<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface

</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">i.</TD>
<TD>the potential for the shafts to intersect a major channel for groundwater
flow from depth and to connect this to the surface environment;</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">ii.</TD>
<TD> the potential for a driving force for groundwater flow from the vaults of 
the repository into the shafts; </TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">iii.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a driving force for vertical upward flow of groundwater
in the shafts; and</TD></TR>
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to

radioactive wastes.</P>

<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts

at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><B>DR. ALAN JAMES HOOPER will say;</B></P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>
<LI>large openings such as vaults, tunnels, drifts and shafts;
</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>
<TABLE BORDER="BORDER">
<TR ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">

<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL DETAILS</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Manager for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex')
having joined the Company in September 1988 on secondment from the former
Central Electricity Generating Board ('CEGB').  I am responsible for evaluations
of long-term repository safety performance of the Sellafield site and for 
advising the Director for Science on co-ordination of the programmes of site
characterisation, research and safety assessment.</P>
<P>1.2 I have been a UK delegate to the Co-ordinating Group for Site Evaluation
and Design of Experiments for Radioactive Waste Disposal of the Radioactive
Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Nuclear Energy Agency since its formation in 1990.  I was elected
its chairman in 1992.
</P>
<P>1.3 I have been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Swedish
&Auml;sp&ouml; Hard Rock Laboratory programme since 1992.  This committee
consists of senior scientists from academic institutions in Sweden and from the
international waste agencies which are participating in the &Auml;sp&ouml;
programme and is responsible for peer review of the results and planned
experiments.
</P>
<P>1.4 I hold a first-class honours degree in Chemistry from Nottingham
University and a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry, also from Nottingham University.</P>
<P>1.5 Prior to my secondment and subsequent appointment at Nirex, I was
employed by the CEGB.  Between 1971 and 1980 I worked on projects to evaluate
the transport of radioactive materials within power reactor circuits and the
radiological consequences of such transport for workers and public.  Between
1980 and 1985 I supported the CEGB Nuclear Decommissioning Project by
contributing to evaluations of the radiological safety of alternative strategies
for decommissioning CEGB Magnox Reactors.  Between 1985 and 1988 I was
responsible for the design and implementation of the research programme to
support the strategy for the eventual disposal of the CEGB's intermediate-level
radioactive wastes.</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY</B></P>
<P> <B>Repository Performance at Sellafield</B></P>
<P>2.1 A preliminary assessment, based on results so far, of the post-closure
performance of a repository located in the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at
Sellafield confirms the good promise of the Sellafield site as a potentially
suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater pathway is central to our
considerations of repository safety and requires to be well understood.  If
resolution of identified uncertainties confirms our current understanding of the
groundwater system at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks ('BVG') of the PRZ which would meet
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.2 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield would
result in the physical and chemical containment in the repository of all but a
small fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just
three radionuclides: chlorine&#173;36, iodine-129 and uranium-238 are calculated
to be released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the
peak risk either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>2.3 The assessment presented in my evidence emphasises the understanding
that has been developed of the contribution of the various barriers in the
repository system to the containment of radioactivity in a repository located in
the PRZ at Sellafield.  The evidence identifies the contribution to containment
performance by the engineered and geological barriers.</P>
<P>2.4 Physical containment is afforded in particular by the waste containers
which prevent ready access of groundwater to the wastes.  The results obtained
so far on the corrosion of steels under the conditions that would apply in a
repository at Sellafield show that the rates of corrosion would be expected to
be low and that the steel containers would remain sufficiently intact to result
in containment within the repository of short-lived radionuclides accounting for
the major part (about 99%) of radioactivity in the repository inventory.</P>
<P>2.5 In order to establish and maintain appropriate chemical conditions in a
repository, the space in the vaults around the waste containers will be
backfilled with a cement-based grout developed for the purpose, and known as
Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  On the basis of results obtained so far of test
work and modelling on the performance of this grout, concerning the suppression
of the solubilities of radionuclides in groundwater and sorption of dissolved
radionuclides onto cement surfaces, the chemical conditions established in a
repository at Sellafield would result in the containment in the repository of
most of the long-lived radionuclides in the disposal inventory.  Over 99% of the
residual 1% of long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which
chemical containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH,
is maintained.</P>
<P>2.6 My evidence identifies three important radionuclides that because of
their chemical properties or very long radioactive decay half-lives are not
physically or chemically contained in the repository until they have decayed to
insignificant levels.  These are chlorine-36 and iodine-129, which are
considered to be highly soluble and not subject to a high degree of sorption in
the near field of the repository, and uranium-238 which has a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years.</P>
<P>2.7 Groundwater flow models predict that the path taken by groundwater
leaving the potential repository location leads to a discharge predominantly
into the sediments currently off the coast below the Irish Sea.  In this event
the additional considerable dilution afforded by the sea leads to assessed risks
to an individual at least three orders of magnitude below the target of 10<SUP>-6
</SUP>per year.  However, the extended timescales of thousands of years before
the groundwater returns to the surface may be sufficient for a change in climate
to cause the sea level to drop and the discharge to be to a terrestrial
environment.</P>
<P>2.8 The concentrations in which the radionuclides chlorine-36 and iodine-129
may reach the surface environment are determined by the flow of groundwater
through the repository near field and by the extent of  subsequent dilution of
this volume of water by groundwater in the surrounding host rock and overlying
sedimentary formations.  It is shown that on the basis of results obtained so
far the combination of low groundwater flow in the BVG at Sellafield and the
dilution and dispersion afforded by the flow of groundwater in the overlying
sedimentary formations is likely to give rise to concentrations of these
radionuclides in the surface terrestrial environment consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>2.9 In the case of uranium-238 the peak in risk from this radionuclide is
considered to occur more than a million years after repository closure and to
result from a daughter radionuclide, radium-226, produced by its radioactive
decay.  On the basis of the results obtained so far, both on the groundwater
system and on the containment afforded to uranium-238 by the engineered barriers
of the repository, the performance of the repository system is likely to give
rise to concentrations of radium-226 in the surface environment consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements. </P>
<P>2.10 On the basis of these results my evidence identifies the key
uncertainties which remain and which need to be addressed to inform two key
decision points in the development of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.11 It is shown that the Rock Characterisation Facility ('RCF') is needed
to provide information to address uncertainties in three main areas:</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P><B> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport</B></P>
<P>2.12 The flow of groundwater into the near field of the repository is highly
dependent upon the description of the networks of connected fractures in the
BVG.  My evidence describes how the integrated activities of observation,
monitoring and testing over extended length scales and in three dimensions only
afforded in the RCF are needed to build sufficient confidence in the calculation
of the flow rate to meet regulatory requirements with respect to post-closure
safety.</P>
<P>2.13 The calculated dilution of the radionuclides transported away from the
repository in groundwater is dependent upon the properties of the flow channels
in key geological formations.  My evidence describes how these flow channels can
be identified and characterised by the integrated activities over extended
length scales and in three dimensions only afforded in the RCF.</P>
<P>2.14 Further key uncertainties are identified in relation to groundwater
flow and radionuclide transport, namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the nature and extent of rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.
</LI></UL>
<P> My evidence identifies the unique attributes of the RCF for addressing
these matters.</P>
<P><B> Natural and Induced Changes</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 The key uncertainties that need to be addressed in respect of natural
and induced changes to the geological barrier are identified as :</P>
<UL>
<LI>validation of the stability of the hydrogeological system over extended
timescales;
</LI>
<LI>the effect of excavation disturbance; and
</LI>
<LI>the effect of chemical disturbance (by alkaline near-field groundwater).
</LI></UL>
<P>2.16 Detailed examination in the RCF of the fractures that are components of
the networks of connected fractures should allow the geological history of flow
patterns to be established, particularly by dating the mineralisation that has
occurred in association with flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then
be compared with the present day flow patterns to test whether significant
changes have occurred in the past and may therefore occur in the future.</P>
<P>2.17 The RCF is needed, in advance of the decision whether or not to propose
development of a repository, to validate that the site characteristics are such
that excavation disturbance would not significantly impair the containment
performance of the natural geological barrier.  Excavation of the RCF itself is
the only means by which a measurable disturbance can be created to allow
extrapolation in time and space of the consequences in the post-closure period
of a repository.</P>
<P>2.18 The access to specific features in the rock in the RCF allows testing
of the effects of alkaline near-field groundwater (derived from the cements in
the repository) on groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
surrounding host rock.</P>
<P><B> Design and Construction of the Repository</B></P>
<P>2.19 The way in which the RCF permits identification of geological and
hydrogeological features that must be taken into account in refining the
repository design in terms of depth, location, layout and orientation of vaults
within the PRZ is described.</P>
<P>2.20 It is also described how the confidence that various underground
features can be sealed adequately to satisfy regulatory requirements on
post-closure safety is only obtainable by access to representative features and
excavations in the rock mass as afforded by the RCF.
</P>
<P><B> Impact of the RCF</B></P>
<P>2.21 Finally, my evidence notes that the performance of the geosphere
barrier is unlikely to be impaired by the impact of the RCF and that this issue
will require to be considered as an element of any application to the regulatory
authorities for authorisation under RSA93.</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE</B></P>
<P>3.1 The purpose of my evidence is :</P>
<UL>
<LI>to describe the Nirex approach to post-closure performance assessment
(Section 4); 
</LI>
<LI>to present a preliminary analysis of post-closure performance of a
repository at Sellafield (Section 5);
</LI>
<LI>to describe the essential information required from the Rock
Characterisation Facility ('RCF') to resolve remaining uncertainties  in respect
of that performance (Section 6); and
</LI>
<LI>to describe the impact that the RCF may have upon the containment
performance of the geosphere (Section 7).
</LI></UL>
<P>3.2 In Section 5, I describe the current understanding of the performance of
a repository located at Sellafield.  The role of the geosphere, both in ensuring
the successful long-term containment properties of the engineered system and in
diluting residual radionuclides dissolved in groundwater emerging from the
engineered system, is described.</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence in Section 5 reflects the results obtained up to early 1994
on the geology and hydrogeology of the Sellafield site that are important to the
movement of groundwater which could contain radionuclides released from the
repository.  The possible implications for repository performance of the results
that have been obtained since early 1994, as presented in Dr. Chaplow's evidence
(<B>PE/NRX/14</B>, <A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">Section 6</A>),
are also considered in Section 5.  This evidence shows why Nirex considers the
Sellafield site as offering good promise as a potentially suitable location for
a repository and, therefore, why it is justified to secure further information
on the site through investigations in the RCF.</P>
<P>3.4 My evidence shows that although the good promise of the site can be
established, there remain key uncertainties which require to be addressed in the
RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether or not to propose development of a
repository at Sellafield.</P>
<P>3.5 The evidence in Section 6 specifies the further information required to
address these key uncertainties which can only be acquired from the RCF.  Dr.
Mellor's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/16</B>, <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE1">Sections
4</A> and <A HREF="../nrx16/nrx16.htm#PHASE2">5</A>) describes how the RCF
needs to be developed and operated to deliver this information.</P>
<P>3.6 My evidence in Section 7 considers the potential for the excavation of
the RCF, and of its shafts in particular, to impact upon the performance of a
repository subsequently located within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group of rocks
('BVG') of the Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ') at Sellafield.  It shows that
there is a sound basis for the proposed location of the shafts and excavation
methods.</P>
<P><A NAME="Approach"></A><B>4. APPROACH TO POST-CLOSURE PERFORMANCE
ASSESSMENT</B></P>
<P>4.1 This Section describes the approach under development by Nirex to assess
the post-closure performance of a deep geological repository at Sellafield.  The
term 'post-closure' refers to the period from the end of repository operations
when, all the repository vaults having been filled with packaged wastes, the
accesses to the repository are backfilled and sealed.  'Assessment' is the
identification and modelling of the processes and pathways by which
radionuclides from the repository may subsequently return to the biosphere and
to people.</P>
<P>4.2 Performance assessment makes extensive use of models.  Development of
assessment models has been built around three major pathways for the possible
return of radionuclides to the biosphere and to people :</P>
<UL>
<LI>transport of radionuclides in groundwater;
</LI>
<LI>migration of radionuclides in gases; and
</LI>
<LI>return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of natural
disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.
</LI></UL>
<P> For a repository at Sellafield the most important pathway, in radiological
terms, is the groundwater pathway.  This is because each of the various
radionuclides in the wastes might be transported in groundwater whereas only a
small number could be transported as a gas.  Also the transport of radionuclides
by the groundwater pathway generally provides the framework for considering the
effect of natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion, except in
the low probability scenarios of direct return of the contents of the repository
by such means.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterPathway"></A><B> Groundwater Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.3"></A>4.3 When the repository is first closed, it will
contain air (for example in the pores of the cements used to immobilise the
wastes, and in any unfilled spaces within the repository) which will, in time,
be displaced by inflowing groundwater.  Thereafter, subject to the performance
of the engineered barriers of the repository, radionuclides will eventually
dissolve or disperse in the water and be available to move into the surrounding
rock.  The extent to which the radionuclides come into contact with water, the
extent to which they dissolve and their ability to move with the groundwater
will each be controlled by the physical and chemical conditions in the
engineered barriers of the repository.</P>
<P>4.4 The engineered barriers are designed to contain as much of the
radioactivity as is reasonably practicable.  This is achieved by providing
physical containment barriers to movement of radionuclides, which are expected
to operate for at least one thousand years after repository closure in respect
of waste packages containing most of the radioactivity, and chemical
containment, operating over a period of around one million years, which will
limit the solubilities, and provide sorption, of radionuclides in groundwater
moving through the repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.5"></A>4.5 The levels of the radiological effects of any
radionuclides that are not contained by the engineered barriers and which reach
the surface in groundwater will be determined largely by the concentrations of
the radionuclides in solution.  The limitation of radionuclide solubilities and
the slow release of groundwater from the repository are of great importance
because they determine the extent to which further reductions in concentrations
must occur, through processes of retardation, spreading and dilution in the
geosphere, for the repository system to be acceptably safe.</P>
<P>4.6 Once the radionuclides in the groundwater have passed from the
repository into the successive layers of surrounding rocks, their rates of
transport to the surface will be determined by the path taken by groundwater
flow through the rocks, the time taken for water to travel along this path, and
by various physical and chemical processes that lead to retardation and
spreading.  The groundwater from the repository will mix with groundwater in the
surrounding rocks leading to dilution of the dissolved levels of radionuclides. 
The extent of dilution will not be determined solely by the amount of
groundwater flowing through the overlying rocks, relative to that flowing
through the repository.  The spreading in space and time of the transport of
repository-derived radionuclides in groundwater through each rock layer will
increase the dilution afforded by their mixing with larger volumes of water in
the succeeding rock layer.</P>
<P>4.7 Eventually groundwater containing repository-derived radionuclides will
reach shallow regions of the rock, which may be considered to be at the boundary
with the biosphere.  On crossing this boundary and entering the biosphere
further dilution, retardation or dispersion can occur by mixing with surface
water (streams, lakes and the sea) or soils.  Radionuclides could become
available for uptake by people by their entering the food-chain, by their
consumption in drinking water or by their inhalation in dust particles.</P>
<P>4.8 The concentrations of radionuclides, both in the groundwater pathway at
its various stages of returning radionuclides to the surface and in the
components of the biosphere, can be calculated on the basis of an understanding
of the controlling physical, chemical and biological processes.  The need is to
calculate the potential uptake of radionuclides by people, living now or in the
future, as a function of time.  From a knowledge of the uptake of radionuclides
through the various potential routes available, a total radiological annual
'dose' to hypothetical individuals can be calculated. This is subsequently
converted to 'annual individual risk' using a dose to risk conversion factor of
0.06 per Sievert.
</P>
<P>4.9 The times of the emergence of radionuclides in the biosphere and their
concentrations will vary according to the controlling physical and chemical
processes relevant to each radionuclide.  The maximum concentrations of
individual radionuclides returning to the biosphere will not coincide in time
unless they have very similar physical and chemical properties.  The total risk
and the contributions of individual radionuclides are typically presented in
graphs of annual radiological risk to an individual through time.  The peak
values shown on these graphs may be compared with the radiological risk target
announced by the Government in its
<I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy, Final Conclusions, Cm 2919,
July 1995</I> (<I>&quot;the July 1995 White Paper&quot;)
</I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208].  At the current stage of the project,
calculations of risk are viewed as the best means of informing a judgment about
the safety of a facility, in line with the statement in <I>the July 1995 White
Paper</I>.  However, it is recognised that in the future other technical
factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature, will also need to be
considered in arriving at the decision.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentModels"></A><B>Assessment Models</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.10"></A>4.10 The top-level tool used by Nirex for
calculating radiological risk from the groundwater pathway is the computer
program called MASCOT and its associated output processor MOP.  MASCOT has been
developed to carry out probabilistic safety assessments, in line with practice
in other countries, for evaluating the safety of radioactive waste disposal
systems.  It takes proper account of the uncertainties associated with the
values of important parameters which influence system performance.  It employs
the 'Monte Carlo' method in which repeated calculations of system behaviour are
made using random sampling from specified probability density functions of the
model parameters which are subject to uncertainty.  The results provide
estimates of the mean and distribution of calculated doses and associated risks.</P>
<P>4.11 MASCOT comprises sub-models describing the behaviour of the sub-systems
of the overall repository system.  These are designed to model the various
processes involved in release of radionuclides from waste packages, their
mobilisation and migration from repository vaults, transport through the
geosphere and biosphere and consequent doses and risks to individuals.  Input
information for sub-models is derived from a variety of sources, including the
output from more detailed models of the system, as described below.</P>
<P> Source Term Model</P>
<P>4.12 The &quot;source term&quot; model describes the behaviour of
radionuclides in the repository vaults and calculates the rate of  their release
as solutes in flowing groundwater. Sub-models are used to represent different
sections of the repository with different characteristics.  The key processes
considered are physical containment by the waste package, radioactive decay and
ingrowth of decay products, solubility limitation, and sorption onto the vault
backfill.  The source term model is supported by a number of research models,
such as RARECAN, CRACK 2, CHEQMATE and HARPHRQ, which address the key physical
and chemical processes in more detail.  The MASCOT source term  model calculates
the concentration of radionuclides in solution in the near-field groundwater as
a function of time.  (The near field of the repository is the part of the system
comprising the waste packages, the backfill surrounding the packages and the
seals used to close off the vaults.  The near-field groundwater is the water
within the porous structure of the backfill.)  The near-field groundwater is
available for transport into the geosphere at a rate dependent on the
groundwater flow through the repository.  (This is usually measured as the
volume in m<SUP>3</SUP> per year of groundwater flowing through the repository
volume.)</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport Through the Geosphere
</P>
<P>4.13 The geosphere sub-models describe the behaviour of radionuclides as
they are transported in groundwater flowing through the geosphere.  The primary
groundwater flow system through fractured rock, such as the BVG, comprises a
network of connected fractures which can be represented on a number of scales.
On the regional  scale - tens of square kilometres - effective properties of the
BVG and surrounding rocks are modelled using a continuum approximation to the
flow system utilising the program NAMMU.  At a repository local scale - of order
ten square kilometres - a more detailed fracture flow model, NAPSAC, is
employed.</P>
<P>4.14 Both NAMMU and NAPSAC permit multi-dimensional groundwater flow
calculations and are used to provide values of the flow of groundwater through
the repository, and of the groundwater flow path lengths and transit times
across each of the hydrogeological units in the flow path.  The groundwater flow
through the repository is measured in cubic metres per year through the full
volume of the engineered repository openings of approximately one million cubic
metres.  It must be assessed reliably because it is an important input to the
source term sub-model in MASCOT.  In addition, geosphere flow-path lengths and
water transit times are required for the geosphere transport sub-models in
MASCOT.</P>
<P>4.15 The transport sub-models within MASCOT calculate radionuclide transport
through different parts of the geosphere taking account of radionuclide decay
and ingrowth, advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and retardation by
sorption.  In addition, radionuclide transport can be retarded by diffusing into
the pore space in the rock matrix.</P>
<P> Biosphere</P>
<P>4.16 The biosphere sub-models of MASCOT are essentially a series of
flux-to-dose rate conversion factors which enable the geosphere calculations of
time-dependent radionuclide fluxes into the biosphere to be converted into doses
and risks to individuals.  For most radionuclides a compartment model, BIOS,
developed by the National Radiological Protection Board, is used to simulate the
processes contributing to radionuclide transport and accumulation in terrestrial
and marine environments.  However, for some key radionuclides  (chlorine-36,
iodine-129 and uranium-238 and its daughters) a heterogeneous resource area
model has been developed to permit a more detailed representation of the
behaviour of the radionuclides in the biosphere.  The development of this model
has been guided by a more physically realistic catchment model generated by the
computer code SHETRAN-UK which has been developed by Nirex, in conjunction with
the Water Resources Systems Research Unit at the University of Newcastle.  An
integral part of the biosphere modelling is definition of critical groups. 
These are defined as being representative of those members of the assumed future
communities that incur the largest annual Effective Dose from radionuclides
present in the environment.  The calculations of Effective Dose make use of
models developed through the International Commission on Radiological Protection
so that potential health risks to individuals can be calculated.  Given the
timescale over which releases are calculated to occur, significant changes in
the climate are projected to arise as a result of glacial cycling:  sea levels
and human behaviour are predicted to change accordingly.  Critical group
behaviour is defined on the basis of the behaviour of existing communities in
regions of the world which currently have analogous climate states.  Many
potential exposure routes are addressed, ranging from human consumption of
contaminated water through to complex food-chain pathways.</P>
<P><A NAME="AssessmentCycels"></A><B> Assessment Cycles</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.17"></A>4.17 The key steps in assessment of the post-closure
performance of a repository will be repeated several times before a decision is
sought from the regulatory authorities to approve the start of disposal
operations in a repository, following its construction and commissioning.  This
iterative process is known as the 'assessment cycle' as described in <I>Nirex
Report 525, Scientific Update 1993, December 1993 </I>(sub-section 5.2, pages 30
to 31) [COR/505].
</P>
<P>4.18 One important function of an assessment is to calculate system
performance for comparison with regulatory requirements to judge whether or not
the system under assessment has the potential to meet them.  A major,
complementary output is a clearer understanding of the issues that are important
to system performance.  Identification of those issues helps to identify
priorities for further data acquisition, on waste or site characteristics for
example, for model development, and for refinement of repository design.</P>
<P>4.19 The presentation, in Section 5 of my evidence, of preliminary results
on the post-closure performance of a repository located in the PRZ at Sellafield
is intended to show our current understanding of the important issues.  This
understanding will develop and become more complete as assessment cycles are
conducted in the future.</P>
<P><A NAME="RepositoryPerformance"></A><B>5. REPOSITORY PERFORMANCE AT
SELLAFIELD</B></P>
<P>5.1 In this section of my Proof of Evidence I describe the calculated
performance of the engineered and natural barriers to radionuclide transport
afforded by a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield.  The
natural barrier provided by the rocks surrounding the repository is of
particular importance as this must ensure that the required chemical conditions
can be maintained in the near field of the repository to contain most of the
radioactivity, and that any residual long-lived radionuclides that are not
contained in this way do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.
</P>
<P>5.2 My evidence identifies the key characteristics of the Sellafield site
which bear on assessment of the post-closure performance of the repository
system.  It is shown that the information and results from the Science Programme
so far suggest the Sellafield site holds good promise as a potentially suitable
location for a repository, but there are uncertainties which need to be
addressed before a decision is taken on whether to propose development of a
repository.</P>
<P><A NAME="DisposalInventory"></A><B>Disposal Inventory</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.3"></A>5.3 The current planning basis for the repository is
that it will receive for disposal 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid, packaged
intermediate-level radioactive wastes and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of solid,
packaged low-level radioactive wastes up to the year 2060.  The radionuclide
content of this total volume of 400,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of wastes is referred to
as the &quot;disposal inventory&quot; and information on this content and the
content of associated materials that may affect repository performance is taken
from information compiled jointly by the Department of the Environment and Nirex
on radioactive waste arising in the UK (<I>DOE/RAS/92.010, UK Nirex Report No.
284, The United Kingdom Radioactive Waste Inventory, November 1992 (&quot;the
1991 National Inventory&quot;</I>) [COR/520].) (See also:<I> DOE/RAS/92.011, UK
Nirex Report No. 285, The Radionuclide Content of UK Radioactive Wastes,
November 1992; and DOE/RAS/92.012, UK Nirex Report No. 286, The Physical and
Chemical Characteristics of UK Radioactive Wastes, November 1992, </I>which are
referred to as sources of information.)</P>
<P>5.4 The disposal inventory may be sub-divided into two broad categories of
radionuclides according to their radioactive decay half-lives.  Much of the
disposal inventory is comprised of relatively short-lived 'fission products'
such as strontium-90 and caesium-137 or 'neutron activation products' such as 
nickel-63, having radioactive decay half-lives of around 100 years or less. 
(Fission products are the result of the nuclear fission of elements such as
uranium or plutonium, as used in the fuels of nuclear reactors.  Neutron
activation products result most commonly from the capture of neutrons by stable
atomic nuclei, to create unstable nuclei which subsequently undergo radioactive
decay). </P>
<P>5.5 The second category comprises radionuclides having radioactive decay
half-lives from hundreds to millions of years.  Many of these are heavy metal
elements such as plutonium, which are very insoluble in the alkaline and
chemically reducing ('low Eh') near-field conditions.  These long-lived
radionuclides include three having radioactive decay half-lives, of hundreds of
thousands of years or more, which prove to be of great importance to the
calculated performance of the deep repository.  These are chlorine-36 with a
half-life of 300,000 years; iodine-129 with a half-life of over 15 million
years; and uranium-238 with a half-life approaching 4,500 million years.  In
order to understand the results of risk calculations reported in this Proof of
Evidence, it is helpful to note that a 'daughter' radionuclide, radium-226,
produced by the decay of the uranium-238 'parent' is of much greater
radiological significance than the uranium-238 itself.</P>
<P> Key Radionuclides</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.6"></A>5.6 The more important radionuclides in terms of
their radioactivity content and relevance to the safety of disposal are listed
in order of atomic number and according to radioactive decay half-life in
<A HREF="#Table5.1">Table 5.1</A>.  The sources of the three radionuclides
found to be of greatest importance are outlined in rather more detail in the
following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.7 Chlorine-36 derives principally from neutron activation of naturally
occurring chlorine, which is present as a trace impurity in various materials in
nuclear reactors.   Accordingly it is likely to be present in small quantities
in many waste streams.  Seven waste streams have been identified as the main
sources of the radionuclide.  They contribute about 65% of the total 16.6 TBq of
chlorine-36 in the disposal inventory and have a volume of about 50,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.
 Because of the significance of this radionuclide in evaluations of repository
post-closure performance, it is considered important to take account of
uncertainties in the quantities present in the disposal inventory, as reported
in <I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table 6.3, page 6.25) [COR/522].  The value of
16.6 TBq is the central case determined for that exercise.</P>
<P>5.8 Iodine-129 derives from nuclear fission and it will be present in small
quantities in a wide range of wastes.  However, four waste streams contribute
about 50% of the projected total of 0.92 TBq, having a total volume of about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.9 Uranium-238 is a major constituent of reactor fuel and will be present
in small quantities in a wide range of wastes.  Seven waste streams contribute
about 55% of the total 36 TBq, having a total volume of about 37,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>.</P>
<P> Packaging</P>
<P>5.10 Intermediate-level wastes intended for disposal will be immobilised
within packages to produce the 'wasteform'.  Most intermediate-level wastes will
be packaged as unshielded wasteforms.  Standard unshielded intermediate-level
waste containers are predominantly drums or boxes fabricated from stainless
steel, or in some cases carbon steel.  The 0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> capacity drum is
the most commonly used container and larger drums or boxes typically have a
capacity of 3 m<SUP>3</SUP>.  The waste is immobilised within the container,
typically using a cement-based grout to produce a solid wasteform.  The
principal waste packages for shielded intermediate-level wasteforms are concrete
boxes, having a length of approximately four metres, in which the waste is again
immobilised  in a cement-based grout.</P>
<P>5.11 Low-level wastes make a very small contribution to the radioactivity
content in the disposal inventory (less than one part in 10,000).  Typically
they will be packaged into carbon steel boxes, having a length of approximately
four metres.  It is currently envisaged that the waste will not be immobilised
within the container.</P>
<P><A NAME="PhysicalContainment"></A><B>Physical Containment</B></P>
<P>5.12 Physical containment features include the initial prevention of access
of groundwater to the radionuclides in the wastes and subsequent limitation of
the movement of groundwater containing dissolved radionuclides away from them. 
The principal factor contributing to physical containment is the integrity of
the waste containers.  Other contributions are obtained from the inaccessibility
of radionuclides in the wastes themselves, for example where their release
requires the complete corrosion of large steel components, and from the
limitation of movement of dissolved radionuclides by diffusion through the
immobilising grout inside the containers.
</P>
<P>5.13 More than 99% of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory will be
present in the unshielded wasteforms contained in drums or boxes made of
stainless or carbon steel.  The resistance of these steel containers to
corrosion under repository conditions is therefore important to the physical
containment of radionuclides.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.14"></A>5.14 The general corrosion of steels is reduced by
the presence of an alkaline water chemistry.  This is an important benefit of
surrounding the waste containers by Nirex Reference Vault Backfill which is
designed to maintain water in its pores at a high pH (where high pH is an
alkaline condition, low pH an acid condition). Corrosion is also very slow under
the anaerobic conditions that will prevail in the repository after the initial
volume of air has been displaced by inflowing groundwater and any residual
oxygen in the water has been consumed by aerobic corrosion.</P>
<P>5.15 Under anaerobic conditions, steels are subject to corrosion which
affects the entire surface of the metal, rather than at localised points. 
Typical results obtained from long-term research work carried out under
deliberately extreme conditions of temperature (up to the maximum of 80C that
might be reached for a short period of time in the repository) and
representative conditions of water chemistry in the engineered barrier system of
a repository at Sellafield show that the corrosion rate will be less than one
micron per year.  Using these and other data obtained from the research
programme the average time for a metal container to be corroded through has been
calculated to range from 9,000 to 16,000 years for the case of a stainless steel
0.5 m<SUP>3</SUP> drum, as reported in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/011, Nirex
Safety Assessment Research Programme, Nirex Near-Field Research: Report on
Current Status in 1994, July 1995 </I>(Sub-section &quot;Container Lifetime
Assessment&quot;, page 16)<I> </I>[NRX/15/1].</P>
<P>5.16 Research has been carried out to determine the effects on physical
containment of the engineered gas vent in some designs of waste container and of
localised corrosion which can affect carbon steels under the initially aerobic
conditions in the repository.  In these cases, there is no significant loss of
containment even if saturation by water were established through the resulting
small penetrations of the container.  The release of radionuclides from the
wasteform to the backfill outside the container is limited by the low rates of
diffusion through the immobilising grout surrounding the waste.</P>
<P>5.17 The decay of the radioactivity in the disposal inventory is shown as a
function of time in <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.  This shows that more
than 95% of the radioactivity would be decayed after 300 years.  It also shows
that if physical containment is conservatively assumed to operate for one
thousand years, the major part of the radioactivity (about 99%) would decay
while contained within the physical barriers afforded by a repository under the
conditions found at Sellafield.  The major contribution to this containment is
the corrosion resistance of the steel containers in the water chemistry of
Sellafield groundwater conditioned to high pH in the pores of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill.</P>
<P> <A NAME="ChemicalContainment"></A><B>Chemical Containment</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.18"></A>5.18 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill surrounding
the emplaced waste containers in the disposal vaults has been carefully
specified to fulfil a number of requirements, namely :</P>
<UL>
<LI>long term maintenance of alkaline porewater chemistry in order to maintain
low dissolved concentrations of key radionuclides under the prevailing
conditions of groundwater flow and geochemistry;
</LI>
<LI>long-term maintenance of a high active-surface-area for sorption of key
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>relatively high permeability and porosity both to ensure homogeneous
performance (so that localised concentrations of materials in wastes do not
exhaust the desired chemical conditioning and thereby locally reduce the
containment performance) and to permit the escape of gas generated by chemical
reactions in the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.19 Two important effects to be taken into account in assessing the
performance at Sellafield of the chemical barrier provided by the backfill are :</P>
<UL>
<LI>leaching of reactive components by groundwater flow; and
</LI>
<LI>reactions with groundwater constituents
</LI></UL>
<P>These are each discussed in the following paragraphs.</P>
<P>5.20 Under the chemically reducing ('low Eh') conditions of the repository,
the solubilities in water of several important radioelements such as plutonium
can be reduced to extremely low values (10<SUP>-7</SUP> mols m <SUP>-3</SUP>
in the case of plutonium) at pH values of between 9 and 10. The solubilities
typically remain at these low levels at any higher pH values that may be
realised in the repository.  Accordingly, the chemical conditioning performance
sought from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill in respect of reduction of
solubility is to maintain a pH above 10 for the period of time during which the
relevant radionuclides will decay to insignificant levels.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.21"></A>5.21 The maintenance of the porewater of the Nirex
Reference Vault Backfill at a pH value above 10 is achieved by the dissolving
into the groundwater of calcium hydroxide which is present in the cement and
lime constituents of the backfill.  The required pH will be maintained until
this supply of calcium hydroxide has been exhausted.   For a given length of
flow path through a repository vault, containing a given amount of backfill, the
rate of removal of calcium hydroxide is determined by the groundwater flow.  For
the proposed volume of about 80,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of backfill in a typical
repository vault having dimensions 550 metres long, 23.5 metres wide and a waste
stack height of 12 metres, and for a groundwater flow through the repository of
140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year    - as calculated in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3,
Sub-Section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522] from the hydrogeological data for the
Sellafield site - simple calculation shows that the pH would be maintained at a
value of greater than 10 for many millions of years.</P>
<P>5.22 It is important to understand whether the pH could be reduced more
rapidly than implied by this simple calculation.  This could occur in parts of
the repository by concentration of groundwater flows through localised
conductive features in the rock, leaving other parts of the repository with a
correspondingly longer period at high pH.  From the information presented on
groundwater compositions in <I>Nirex Report 524, The Geology and Hydrogeology
of the Sellafield Area : Interim Assessment : December 1993 </I>(Volume 3,
Tables 3.4, 3.5 and 3.7) [COR/517], it is also possible to identify a number of
dissolved chemicals present at depth in the PRZ at Sellafield which are reactive
towards cements.  All of these are taken into account, alongside similar
reactive chemicals in the wastes themselves or which would result from their
eventual breakdown, in calculating the period of time for which a high pH would
be maintained.  The results obtained so far allow us to assume conservatively
that the required pH value of 10 or more would be maintained throughout the
repository for one million years.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.23"></A>5.23 The Nirex Reference Vault Backfill was designed
to afford a large surface area in its pore structure for the sorption of
radionuclides from solution in the groundwater.  The value measured for pore
surface area of 2.8 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> m<SUP>2</SUP> per kilogram of material is
highly favourable in this respect.  It is recognised that some chemical
reactions could block off parts of the porous structure of the backfill material
or that cracks could develop in the backfill and the crack surfaces become
altered to give less sorption.  None of the experimental work carried out using
synthesised Sellafield groundwater and related modelling work has indicated any
significant adverse effects.  However, in current safety assessment studies, the
sorption capacity has been reduced from the high values observed in experiments,
to take account of uncertainties in this respect.</P>
<P>5.24 A convenient way of reflecting the physical and chemical containment
afforded by the engineered barriers in the repository concept is to draw a graph
of the &quot;fractional release&quot; of a radionuclide of interest as a
function of time.  The fractional release is that fraction of the total amount
of the radionuclide in the initial disposal inventory that would be found in the
geosphere at a given time.  Its calculation takes account of release of the
radionuclide from the engineered system of the repository and also of depletion
of the radionuclide by radioactive decay.  Low values of fractional release
indicate a good containment performance by the engineered barriers.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.25"></A>5.25 <A HREF="#Figure5.2">Figure 5.2</A> shows the
benefit of chemical containment by reduction of solubility, by sorption and by
the combination of the two processes in the near field in terms of the
fractional release to the geosphere from the disposal inventory of
plutonium-239.  It can be seen that the chemical containment performance that
would be afforded by the action of the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill within the
groundwater system in the BVG of the PRZ at Sellafield is calculated to limit
the fractional release of plutonium-239 to approximately one part in two
thousand.  This explains why, in assessment studies of the post-closure
performance of the total repository system,  plutonium-239 is found to return to
the surface environment in such low concentrations as to make no significant
contribution to radiological risk, as shown in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Table
6.18, page 6.36)<I> </I>[COR/522].</P>
<P>5.26 Calculations of fractional releases for longer-lived radionuclides than
plutonium-239 show that the chemical containment significantly limits their
fractional release for very long periods of time (beyond one million years in
the case of uranium-238.)  A period of one million years, conservatively taken
as the duration for the operation of chemical containment in a repository
located in the PRZ at Sellafield, is marked on <A HREF="#Figure5.1">Figure 5.1</A>.
 This shows that over 99% of the residual 1% of radioactivity present in
long-lived radionuclides would decay during the period over which chemical
containment, represented by conditioning the groundwater to a high pH, is
maintained.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalBarrier"></A><B> Natural Barrier</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.27"></A>5.27 On the basis of the evidence that I have
presented thus far, the natural barrier afforded by the BVG rocks in the PRZ at
Sellafield would ensure a low fractional release, that is radiologically
insignificant, of all but a small number of the longest-lived radionuclides, as
a result of the physical and chemical containment by the engineered barriers of
the repository in that location.  In the case of uranium-238, having a half-life
approaching 4,500 million years,  the release to the geosphere would be limited
for over a million years by the low solubility in the high pH water in the
repository and sorption onto cement phases.  However, two long-lived
radionuclides, chlorine-36 and iodine-129, do not have the metallic character in
their solution behaviour that leads to reduction of solubility in alkali
solution, and in experimental work to date have been found not to sorb strongly
to cement phases or geological minerals.  Accordingly the behaviour of these
radionuclides is modelled by assuming high solubilities and no retardation by
sorption in the flow of groundwater from depth to the surface.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.28"></A>5.28 The further important role of the natural
barrier, identified at the start of this section of my Proof of Evidence is to
ensure that residual long-lived radionuclides that are not physically and
chemically contained by the engineered barriers, representing around 0.01% of
the initial radioactivity, do not migrate to the surface environment in
concentrations which would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory
requirements.  This requires that the dissolved levels of radionuclides will be
sufficiently diluted to low concentrations in the groundwater eventually
carrying them to the surface.</P>
<P>5.29 The extent of dilution is determined by :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the quantity of water flowing in the near-surface rocks, into which
groundwater bearing radionuclides from the repository moves;
</LI>
<LI>the area of near-surface rocks into which groundwater bearing radionuclides
moves : the greater the area the larger the volume of water for dilution
(spreading in space); and
</LI>
<LI>the time over which the radionuclides are released into the near-surface
groundwater system.  The spreading in time arises from the rate at which they
are released from the repository (determined by flow of groundwater through the
repository and the repository porewater concentrations determined by the
physical and chemical barriers) and spreading in time during passage through the
geosphere due to processes such as dispersion, sorption and rock matrix
diffusion.
</LI></UL>
<P>5.30 A further dilution is afforded if the discharge of groundwater from the
geosphere occurs into surface water in the biosphere - in the form of streams,
lakes or the sea - before becoming accessible to people.</P>
<P>5.31 For a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, the
release from the repository of radionuclides such as uranium-238 can extend to
over a million years as a result of solubility and sorption control in the
engineered barriers and of the relatively low groundwater flow through the
repository of 140 m<SUP>3</SUP> per year, as given at paragraph 5.21 of my
evidence.  Even for those radionuclides such as chlorine-36 and iodine-129 that
may not be subject to solubility and sorption control, it would take more than a
thousand years to flush the radionuclides out of the repository in a flow of 140
m<SUP>3</SUP> per year.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.32"></A>5.32 The principal source of dilution by mixing of
repository-derived groundwater with groundwater in overlying rocks is provided
at Sellafield by the Calder Sandstone.  A simple calculation is carried out in<I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3,<I> </I>Sub&#173;section 2.3, page 2.12) [COR/522].  It shows<I></I>that
dilution by a factor of about 600 would be achieved by assuming direct mixing of
the flow of groundwater through the repository with the flow of groundwater
discharging through an area equivalent to the plan area of the repository to
surface from the Calder Sandstone.  For the radionuclides chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 the spreading in time resulting from the short duration of the source
term compared to the geosphere travel time gives a greater dilution factor of
about 2,000.</P>
<P>5.33 As concluded in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 9.1, page 9.2)
[COR/522] the groundwater flow models used in the reported assessment studies
predict that groundwater flow from a repository located in the PRZ to the
surface environment will emerge predominantly at the bed of the eastern edge of
the Irish Sea.  If sea levels were to remain as at present, the discharge at
this location would be subject to a further and considerable dilution by sea
water.  As a consequence of these successive dilutions, the annual radiological
risk to an individual for discharge of all radionuclides to the marine
environment is assessed to be at least three orders of magnitude below the
target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>.
</P>
<P>5.34 This annual risk to an individual is an output from the models that I
described in Section 4 of my evidence.  The computed mean value of risk is
plotted on a graph as a function of time.  It is a mean value because of the use
of probabilistic safety assessment methods in which the calculations are
repeated a number of times, corresponding to the sampling of the allowed ranges
of values for input parameters, and an arithmetic mean is taken of the resulting
values for risk.  The appropriate graph showing the base-case calculation of
risk from marine discharge in a Temperate (as current) climate is produced as
<A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>,  after<I> Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Figure
6.6) [COR/522].</P>
<P>5.35 Under present conditions at Sellafield, a small proportion of the
discharge might occur to the terrestrial environment in association with incised
river beds.  Furthermore, the time taken for emergence into the sea bed would be
such that the sea level could possibly be lower as a consequence of climate
change, possibly placing the whole of the discharge in a terrestrial
environment.
</P>
<P>5.36 Three further curves are presented in <A HREF="#Figure5.3">Figure 5.3</A>
for a terrestrial discharge under three different biosphere states,
corresponding to Temperate, Periglacial and Boreal climates.  On the basis of
current understanding of global climate patterns, Temperate or warmer conditions
are expected to persist at Sellafield for several thousand years.  Beyond that
time period, colder Boreal or Periglacial conditions need to be considered.  For
the purpose of model calculations, each climate state is assumed to persist over
the full period evaluated.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.37"></A>5.37 The Boreal climate state will be associated
with a lower sea level than the current sea level.  Discharge is therefore
likely to be terrestrial.  The peak annual  individual risks in the Boreal
terrestrial state are 1.1 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at twenty thousand years after
repository closure and 3.3 x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> at four million years after
closure.  In all calculations for discharges to a terrestrial environment, the
maximum of the risk curve occurring at about twenty thousand years is
attributable mainly to chlorine-36 (with iodine-129 making a contribution of
around 4%), and that after more than a million years is attributable to the
daughter radionuclides of uranium-238, in particular radium-226.  Chlorine-36 is
effectively transported to the surface at the same rate as the water in which it
is dissolved and the peak at about twenty thousand years corresponds to the most
probable value of calculated groundwater return time.  The most significant
component of the calculated risk is from radionuclides entering the food chain,
particularly through milk derived from pasture-grazing cows.</P>
<P>5.38 Simple scoping studies were carried out to allow calculations of risk
for 'agricultural wells' in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Sub-section 6.7, pages
6.18 to 6.20) [COR/522].  The preliminary estimate of peak annual individual
risk is 1.7 x 10<SUP>-6</SUP> on the basis of an assessment for chlorine-36 and
iodine-129 only : these radionuclides are expected to dominate risk in the
period before 10<SUP>5</SUP> years.  It is found that iodine-129 is the major
contributor.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.39"></A>5.39 As noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522], further
refinement of the assessment methodology will produce a better view of risk from
agricultural wells.  As for all the results in <I>Nirex 95</I> [COR/522], the
calculations for agricultural wells reflect a reference repository design rather
than an optimised system.  If necessary, there is scope for taking specific
waste emplacement and repository design measures to reduce the risks as part of
the optimisation process which ensures that releases are as low as reasonably
practicable.  In the case of iodine-129, which is the main contributor to the
risk, 50% of the inventory is contained in a limited volume of waste, about 500
m<SUP>3</SUP>, as stated in paragraph 5.8.  For such relatively small volumes
of waste, there is flexibility to develop specific measures, which might be
impractical for larger volumes of waste.</P>
<P>5.40. A number of variant calculations were reported in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume
3, Section 7, pages 7.1 to 7.18) [COR/522].  These showed that the risks
calculated to arise from a repository at Sellafield were not greatly changed as
a result of changes in the spreading time for radionuclide transport in the
geosphere if the duration of their release from the repository remains constant
(that duration is inversely proportional to the groundwater flow through the
repository.)  Similarly, the system is robust to changes in the duration of the
release if the spreading time in the geosphere remains constant.  It is only if
the duration of the release and the spreading time in the geosphere both have
values significantly lower than currently calculated that annual individual
radiological risks in excess of the target of 10<SUP>-6</SUP> were calculated
in <I>Nirex 95</I> (Volume 3, Figure 8.8) [COR/522] to arise from natural
discharges to the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="GasPathway"></A><B>Gas Pathway</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.41"></A>5.41 The gas pathway refers to the migration of
radionuclides in gaseous form from the repository to the surface environment. 
The most radiologically significant processes have been calculated to involve
the incorporation of carbon-14 from the disposal inventory in methane generated
from microbiological degradation of wastes in the repository and the subsequent
entry of this methane into the food chain, as noted in <I>Nirex Science Report
S/94/003, Post-closure Performance Assessment: Gas Generation and Migration,
November 1994 (&quot;Nirex Report S/94/003&quot;) </I>(Section 4.1, page 20)
[COR/509].
</P>
<P>5.42 The carbon-14 inventory of 2,600 TBq represents less than 0.1% of the
total disposal inventory.  Scoping calculations have been carried out making the
following simplifications that are believed to be highly conservative :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>all the carbon-14 in wastes that contain biodegradable material is
converted to gas;
</LI>
<LI>maximum rates of methane generation are achieved simultaneously in waste
packages throughout the repository;
</LI>
<LI>all the gas generated in the repository is transported instantaneously from
the repository to the surface and therefore no radioactive decay occurs; and
</LI>
<LI>the gas does not spread out in the geosphere to emerge in the surface soils
over a larger area than the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> This leads to fluxes of carbon-14 in methane entering the biosphere that
are equivalent to annual risks to an individual of about 10<SUP>-7</SUP>.</P>
<P>5.43 Work is also under way in the Nirex Safety Assessment Research
Programme ('NSARP') to study the possible significance of gas-water interactions
on radionuclide transport.  As noted in <I>Nirex Report S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section
3.3, page 16) [COR/509] much of the required information is now available but
the RCF is intended to enable some of the required site-specific data to be
acquired.
</P>
<P><A NAME="DisruptiveEvents"></A><B>Natural Disruptive Events and
Inadvertent Human Intrusion
</B></P>
<P>5.44 As discussed in <I>Nirex Science Report S/95/004, Post-closure
Performance Assessment, Human Intrusion and Natural Disruptive Events, July 1995
(&quot;Nirex Report S/95/004&quot;) </I>(Sub-section 3.2, pages 12 and 13;
Section 5, page 16) [NRX/15/2], the location of a repository in the BVG at
Sellafield is likely<I></I>to afford a high level of isolation of the wastes
from the effects of natural disruptive events, such as erosion and seismicity,
and inadvertent human intrusion.</P>
<P>5.45 The principal form of inadvertent human intrusion considered to date
has involved the radiological exposure of geotechnical workers or surface
inhabitants as a result of inadvertent drilling of boreholes into the repository
at some time in the future, when records of its existence may no longer exist. 
In terms of the relevant characteristics - the dimensions of a repository vault
cross-section and the inventory of heavy metal radionuclides - the current
repository concept correlates quite closely with that assessed for the human
intrusion scenario for a repository in the PRZ at Sellafield in <I>PERA </I>(paragraphs
5.6.11 to 5.6.14, pages 36 and 37) [COR/501].  A peak annual individual risk
from intrusion of less than 10<SUP>-8</SUP> was given in Table 5.2 of that
report.  <I>Nirex Report S/95/004 </I>(Sub-section 3.1, pages 9 to 12)
[NRX/15/2]<I>  </I>updates the information on mineral resources in the
Sellafield location on the basis of the extensive investigations carried out by
Nirex.  There has been no finding of a significant new resource that would
suggest a higher incidence of drilling than assumed in <I>PERA</I> [COR/501].
</P>
<P><A NAME="PotentialSuitabiltiy"></A><B>Potential Suitability of Sellafield
as a Location for a Repository
</B></P>
<P>5.46 The analysis I have presented above confirms the good promise of
Sellafield as a potentially suitable location for a repository.  The groundwater
pathway is central to our considerations of repository safety and therefore
requires to be well understood.  If resolution of uncertainties, as identified
in Section 6 below, confirms our current understanding of the groundwater system
at Sellafield, then a repository could be developed in the BVG rocks of the PRZ
which would meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>5.47 In particular, the predicted flow and composition of groundwater that
would enter a repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield are
consistent with the physical and chemical containment of all but a small
fraction of the radioactivity in the initial disposal inventory.  Just three
radionuclides, chlorine-36, iodine-129 and uranium-238, are calculated to be
released in quantities that result in significant contributions to the peak risk
either from natural discharges or water abstraction in wells.</P>
<P>5.48 If conditions at the Sellafield site were to remain as at present,
resulting in predicted discharge predominantly to a marine environment, these
releases would have small consequences when compared with the risk target.  For
release of chlorine-36 to a terrestrial environment - and of iodine-129 in the
case of agricultural wells - the groundwater system needs to provide dilution of
levels of radionuclides in repository-derived groundwater sufficient to lead to
calculated risks consistent with regulatory requirements.  On the basis of the
calculations carried out, it is judged that such dilution will be afforded by
the hydrogeological system at Sellafield.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.49"></A>5.49 The strong chemical containment that will be
afforded to uranium by the Nirex repository concept ensures that any significant
migration to the surface of  uranium-238 and its daughter radionuclides only
occurs at times beyond about one hundred thousand years after repository
closure, as shown in <I>Nirex 95
</I>(Volume 3, Section 6.4, pages 6.10 to 6.12) [COR/522].  The very long
radioactive decay half-life of uranium-238,  approaching 4,500 million years,
means that it will return to the surface eventually unless a process of
mineralisation leads to its permanent incorporation in the constituents of the
cement-based backfill or the host rocks.  There is evidence that this may happen
but Nirex is not yet sufficiently confident in the evidence to incorporate the
process in safety assessments.  It is of course this long half-life that
accounts for the abundant natural occurrence of uranium-238 on the planet. 
Given the considerable uncertainties associated with numerical assessments over
timescales of the order of a million years, a comparison with naturally
occurring radioactivity is considered to represent a more effective way of
demonstrating the containment performance of the system with respect to this
nuclide,  This approach is under development for use in future assessment
studies.  Nevertheless, the extension of the numerical assessments to times
beyond one million years has produced a calculated annual individual risk of 3.3
x 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for a Boreal climate state.</P>
<P>5.50 The presentation in my evidence of the containment performance of the
barriers in a repository located at Sellafield enables the identification of
aspects of the site where Nirex must be confident that the underlying judgments
are correct and that the range of uncertainty has been narrowed sufficiently. 
These are :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the groundwater flow into the near field of the repository, which
determines the duration of chemical containment and the rates of release of
radionuclides; and
</LI>
<LI>the dilution, during transport in the geosphere, of the dissolved
radionuclides in the groundwater released from the repository, which determines
the concentrations of radionuclides in groundwater reaching the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para5.51"></A>5.51 The most probable value for the groundwater
flow into the near field of the repository is predicted to be  140 m<SUP>3
</SUP>per year as stated in paragraph 5.21.  This value is consistent with
maintenance of chemical containment in the engineered barriers of the repository
for a million years and limits the release of uranium-238 to levels consistent
with risks meeting regulatory requirements.  This value is also consistent with
sufficient spreading in time of the release of chlorine-36 from the repository
to ensure its subsequent dilution to levels that are also consistent with risks
meeting regulatory requirements.  However, groundwater flows greater than this
cannot be ruled out.  It is noted in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 2.3,
page 2.13) [COR/522] that on the basis of the current judgments about the
networks of connected fractures in the BVG used to calculate the flow, a small
probability exists that the flow could be 150 times greater (or indeed smaller).
 If it were found that the description of the networks of connected fractures
giving a flow 150 times greater is a better representation of the fractures in
the BVG, then a repository would probably not meet regulatory requirements.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.52"></A>5.52 Similarly, the most probable value currently
predicted for the dilution of radionuclides in the geosphere is consistent with
a repository performance meeting regulatory requirements.  This dilution is
highly dependent upon the path taken by groundwater from the repository to the
surface environment.  The modelled path is determined by the judgments
concerning networks of connected fractures in both the BVG and the overlying
sedimentary formations and we must be confident that these are correct also.</P>
<P>5.53 The relevant information on the geology and hydrogeology of Sellafield,
available in most part by early 1994, was used in the calculations of risk
reported in Volume 3 of <I>Nirex 95
</I>[COR/522].  Dr. Chaplow presents in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) the further information which
has become available since then.</P>
<P>5.54 This further information has added to confidence that the site at
Sellafield offers a stable geological setting which will provide a low
groundwater flow through a repository located in the BVG and high dilution in
the overlying rocks for radionuclides released from repository vaults.  It
includes information on groundwater chemistry indicating long residence times
for the groundwater in the BVG, and results from the cross-hole testing and
Borehole RCF3 Pump Test.  These tests have provided information on the limited
nature of the connections over extended length scales in the fracture systems in
the BVG and have indicated little connection between the BVG and overlying
sandstones.  While models of the groundwater system have not yet been updated
and implications for risk calculated, I consider that this later information
broadly supports the basis of <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522] with some indications
that the modelling in <I>Nirex 95 </I>[COR/522]  may have been conservative in
its representation of networks of connected fractures in the BVG and overlying
sandstones.</P>
<P>5.55 In Section 6 of my evidence, I describe the information needed from the
RCF to build further confidence in our judgments before key decisions can be
made in the deep repository development programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="InformationRequired"></A><B>6. INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM THE RCF</B></P>
<P>6.1 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.21">paragraph 6.21</A>) notes that for
present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the development of
a repository:</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under
RSA93; and
</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.
</LI></UL>
<P> Nirex will prepare assessments of the post-closure safety performance of
the repository for each of these decision points.  That prepared for the first
decision point will necessarily be preliminary and will be filled out and
finalised to enable the regulatory authorities to take a decision on approval of
the start of disposal operations.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.2"></A>6.2 As described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of
Evidence, (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.22">paragraphs 6.22</A> to 6.24), the
information requirements for the different stages of post-closure safety
performance assessment are somewhat different in character.  This leads to the
identification of two separate categories of information required.  These have
different timescales for delivery that are related to the two decision points
identified above.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.3"></A>6.3 The RCF programme, comprising 3 phases, has been
developed to deliver the information that is needed in accordance with these
timescales.  It is expected that Phase 1 of the RCF programme could deliver the
information required in relation to a decision to propose development of a
repository.  In particular, as will be explained in the following paragraphs in
this Section of my evidence, we need to obtain sufficient information to build
confidence in key models used in assessments of repository post-closure
performance and to enable confident extrapolation of descriptions of the rock
mass and groundwater system across the PRZ for use in developing the repository
design.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.4"></A>6.4 The confidence achieved by the end of Phase 1 of
the RCF programme will be dependent upon the amount and nature of information
that has been obtained at that stage.  The information available will determine
the extent to which models and extrapolations can be put to the test.  The
adequacy of this testing will be subject to rigorous review as part of informing
a decision on whether to  propose development of a repository.  In the event
that it is found inadequate,  further information will be sought from one or
both of the subsequent phases of the RCF programme.  A possible scenario is that
more information will be required on geological and hydrogeological
characteristics accessible to an extent that is too limited in Phase 1 as a
result of their orientation or spacing in relation to the shafts and connecting
galleries.  In that case the subsequent extension of the horizontal galleries of
the RCF, and drilling out from those galleries, will be designed to overcome
this limitation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.5"></A>6.5 The first category of information, required to
inform a decision on whether to propose development of a repository, relates to
those factors which are most important in determining the suitability of the
site as a location for a repository.  These factors are our predictions of
groundwater flow and dilution, the potential for natural or induced changes to
create significant new pathways for groundwater flow, and repository design. 
The position that the Company considers it necessary to achieve in respect of
each of these factors for the first decision point is as follows :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>confidence in our ability to predict groundwater flow and dilution and that
these predictions are consistent with meeting regulatory requirements;
</LI>
<LI>confidence that construction of a repository at the site, or future
naturally induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which
would significantly impair repository performance; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence in the basis for optimisation of repository depth, location,
layout and orientation, and consequent confidence in cost estimates for
repository construction.
</LI></UL>
<P> The safety assessment to be prepared in relation to this decision point
will be required to take account of the alternative scenarios for long-term
evolution of the repository system and information on naturally induced changes
will be important to establish the appropriate framework for such an analysis.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 In the second category of information, required
in relation to a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether to approve
the start of disposal operations, are those factors which will have been
addressed in the laboratory or at other research sites, but where it is likely
that the regulatory authorities will require an in situ demonstration that the
results are applicable to the repository site.  Such information requirements
are currently considered to relate to the following :</P>
<UL>
<LI>processes that can influence the transport of radionuclides in groundwater
in the geosphere;  
</LI>
<LI>quantifications of long-term effects of the interaction of the repository
system with the localised flows in the surrounding rocks; and
</LI>
<LI>finalisation of detailed design, including repository sealing measures.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 Our work has indicated that the factors for which information is sought
in this second category are not likely to determine the basic suitability of a
site as a location for a repository.  Repository safety is calculated to be less
sensitive to the ranges of assumptions that can reasonably be made about these
factors.  However, the demonstration that these factors have been taken into
account in a realistic manner is considered to be a necessary element of a
finalised assessment of post-closure safety performance needed to inform a
decision by the regulatory authorities on approval of the start of disposal
operations.  It is also considered that the second category of information will
include that required to fill out the information supplied in the safety
assessment, prepared at the first key decision point, and that this will be
achieved through a process of further systematic validation.</P>
<P>6.8 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need to
address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of the
repository, but will identify specific remaining uncertainties and the steps
that will be taken to resolve them.  If a robust evaluation can be achieved by
the end of Phase 1 of the RCF programme, then the further work in Phase 2 and
Phase 3 of the RCF programme would continue to address remaining uncertainties,
probably within the framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities,
for the progressive supply of information leading to a decision on approval to
start disposal of wastes in the repository.  </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.9"></A>6.9 The calculations that we have carried out in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 3, Section 9, pages 9.1 to 9.4) [COR/522] indicate that a
repository located in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield could be developed
which would meet regulatory requirements.  This is conditional on the basis that
judgments about the rock characteristics, leading to predictions of groundwater
flow, are correct.  The risk calculations are based on a conceptual model which
contains a particular description of the networks of connected fractures
controlling flow in the BVG.  Uncertainties in the values of parameters
describing the networks have been recognised by ascribing a range of values
having different probabilities about a central value for each parameter.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.10"></A>6.10 Limitations on surface-based observations mean
that we cannot measure the parameters of interest directly.  Expert judgment has
been used in developing the conceptual model and associated ranges of parameter
values.  It is recognised by Nirex and the experts involved in this exercise
that different judgments could be arrived at, leading to different conceptual
models with different ranges of parameter values around different central
values.  Some of these alternative models, albeit improbable, could lead to the
prediction of high values for the flow of groundwater into the repository or low
values for its dilution in the overlying rocks that would not be consistent with
meeting regulatory requirements for post-closure safety of a repository. </P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The remedy is to subject these conceptual
models to a process of validation involving forward predictions, using the
outputs of these models, and testing these predictions against field
observations. This process of validation can be used to achieve the following
objectives :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>discrimination between alternative conceptual models of the same system
using tests to measure directly some aspect of the system for which different
predictions are given by the alternative models;
</LI>
<LI>refinement of a conceptual model where there is some uncertainty about one
or more components of the model, or about the parameters associated with the
model, and the predictions can be compared with test results to reduce or remove
the uncertainty; and
</LI>
<LI>confirmation of a conceptual model as fit for its intended purpose in
post-closure performance assessment studies through testing of the adequacy of
its predictions.
</LI></UL>
<P> This process is intrinsic to the Nirex programme of hydrogeological
investigations, where modelling has been carried out to design the more
extensive hydrogeological tests and to establish criteria for their successful
implementation, and will be developed further for application in the RCF. </P>
<P>6.12 In developing the approach to model validation for the RCF programme,
it is recognised that predictions of the parameters that largely determine
overall system performance, such as groundwater flow through the repository and
dilution of levels of dissolved radionuclides in the geosphere, cannot be tested
directly.  The validation testing of the component conceptual models that are
combined to create the description of the overall system performance must be
sufficiently rigorous, therefore, to build confidence in their application. 
This implies requirements for testing over a range of length scales and for
acquiring sufficient test data to satisfy scientific opinion as to the adequacy
of the process.
</P>
<P>6.13 The RCF overcomes limitations of surface-based or laboratory
investigations for validation in the following ways :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the RCF would permit tests and observations in three dimensions and at a
scale more directly comparable to that of the repository;
</LI>
<LI>specialised tests could be performed in situ, directly on specific features
of relevance to repository performance and under geotechnical and
hydrogeotechnical  conditions which are closely comparable to those of the
repository; and
</LI>
<LI>the RCF would allow direct, in situ, observation and measurement of the
response to excavation of the potential repository host rocks and groundwater
system on a scale, at a depth, and in a location which would provide information
which can be directly related to the performance of a repository within the PRZ.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.14 In his Proof of Evidence, Dr. Holmes (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.6">paragraph 6.6</A>) has identified that the
information that the RCF will provide can be considered to address uncertainties
in three main areas :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.
</LI></UL>
<P> The nature of the key uncertainties will be explained under these headings
in the following paragraphs.  The information required to address them will be
identified in terms of its categorisation in relation to the future developments
of post-closure performance assessments to support the two decision points as
discussed above.  It will be explained why the information required can only be
obtained through the underground access to the rock mass which will be afforded
by the RCF.</P>
<P><A NAME="GroundwaterFlow"></A><B>Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide
Transport</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.15"></A>6.15 The performance of the engineered barriers of
the repository in affording physical and chemical containment is dependent upon
the flow and composition of the groundwater in the repository.  The overall
performance will determine the rate of transfer of dissolved radionuclides in
groundwater out of the near-field of the repository into the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.16 The transport of radionuclides by the groundwater in the geosphere is
dependent upon the characteristics of the rock that control groundwater flow and
the physical and chemical processes that operate within the rock.  The combined
characteristics of the repository host rock and overlying rocks will determine
the pathways taken by radionuclides to return to the surface and the
concentrations at which they will emerge in the biosphere.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.17"></A>6.17 The first category of information required
before a decision is made to propose development of a repository is to test
assumptions made about the characteristics of the site in relation to :
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository; and
</LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>the spreading in the geosphere of residual mobile or long-lived
radionuclides from the repository in groundwater that reaches the surface
environment.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.18"></A>6.18 The second category of information, required to
be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision on
whether to approve the start of disposal operations is to test that evaluations
of processes having the potential to affect the transport of radionuclides have
realistically estimated the effects on post-closure performance.  Currently,
three potentially important processes are identified where information is needed
from the RCF:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>rock matrix diffusion;
</LI>
<LI>colloid transport; and
</LI>
<LI>gas migration.

<P> In addition, the second category of information will include that required
to fill out the information supplied on groundwater flow and on spreading and
dilution in the geosphere in the safety assessment prepared at the first key
decision point.</P>
<P>6.19 The information required on each of the identified subjects is
described under separate headings in the following paragraphs.
</P>
<P>Calculation of Groundwater Flow through the Repository</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.20"></A>6.20 The calculation of groundwater flow through the
repository is carried out on the basis of descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures in the BVG rocks in the PRZ at Sellafield, as given in <I>Nirex
95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.2, pages 5.6 to 5.10) [COR/522].  It is
considered that groundwater flow occurs predominantly in fractures existing in
hard rocks such as the BVG.   Further, it is considered that fractures are not
uniformly distributed through the rock but that, as a result of natural
processes in the geological evolution of the rock formation, several individual
fractures can have developed together in connected networks.  These networks
would extend over greater distances than their component individual fractures
and are therefore likely to be more significant in controlling groundwater flow
through the rock.</P>
<P>6.21 The flow of groundwater through such a network of connected fractures
is controlled by factors such as its overall length, the aperture of the
individual fractures in the network, the ways in which they are connected
together and the variability of these characteristics within the overall
network.  The flow of groundwater through a repository will be determined by the
properties of these networks of connected fractures, by the number of them
intersected by the disposal vaults and by the hydraulic pressure gradients
driving water along them.  The locations of the networks and the spacings
between them are therefore also important information, as is the distribution of
hydraulic pressures within the networks.
</P>
<P>6.22 As described in <I>Nirex 95 </I>(Volume 1, Sub-section 5.1.2, pages
5.3 to 5.5) [COR/522], the results of hydrogeological tests carried out in
boreholes have been interpreted in terms of assumed intersections of the
networks of connected fractures by the boreholes.  Where such an intersection is
assumed, the properties of the fracture network are inferred from the
hydrogeological measurements.  The maximum lengths of these features are put at
many hundreds of metres and so an individual borehole having a diameter of about
150 mm would be intersecting only a small part of the overall system.  This
introduces considerable uncertainties which are recognised by Nirex in assigning
a wide range of possible descriptions to the network of connected fractures and
an associated wide range of values for the important properties.</P>
<P>6.23 The networks of connected fractures can be investigated over a greater
lengthscale by means of cross-hole testing between different boreholes.  Nirex
has carried out such tests, culminating in the Borehole RCF3 Pump Test, as
described by Dr Chaplow in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para6.36">paragraphs 6.36</A> to 6.40).  These
tests have involved the generation of different possible descriptions of the
networks of connected fractures, in the forms of alternative conceptual models. 
By comparing the predictions of these models with the results of testing,
uncertainties concerning groundwater flows can be resolved to some extent and as
noted in paragraph 5.54 the outcomes appear encouraging.  However, the principal
uncertainty, concerning the range of possible descriptions of the networks of
connected fractures, will remain in the absence of direct observations and
complementary testing of the networks.
</P>
<P>6.24 The information required from the RCF is a description of the networks
of connected fractures as the main groundwater flow channels in the BVG, and the
range of values that should be assigned to the key properties of these features,
based upon physical observations.  Furthermore, the information obtained must be
capable of extrapolation both in space, throughout the volume of the BVG rocks
in the PRZ, and also in time, to validate the application of the resulting
models in assessments of repository post-closure performance at long times into
the future.</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF will allow such information to be obtained because it will
afford the opportunity to carry out complementary activities in parallel. 
Direct observations can be made on the way in which individual fractures are
connected to form extended networks.  The properties of the individual fractures
can be measured in parallel with the measurement of the properties of the
connected system as described by Dr. Holmes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/13</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx13/nrx13.htm#Para6.11">paragraph 6.11</A>).</P>
<P>6.26 The access to a large volume of rock containing the networks of
connected fractures will allow observations to be made of their locations and of
any association with other geological features such as faults.  Relationships
with recognisable geological structures and information on trends in the
orientation and spacing of the features would allow the testing of this
information against further observations and would attach greater confidence to
the extrapolation through the rock volume.</P>
<P>6.27 Our current groundwater flow models do not fully reproduce the
hydraulic pressure field that is deduced from borehole measurements.  A
significant factor in the current differences between observation and prediction
may be the way in which the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures
are used to calculate hydrogeological properties on a regional scale.  A further
model development is planned, possibly incorporating relationships between the
depth and location of the networks and their hydrogeological properties, to
address this issue. Sinking of the RCF shafts will provide information to test
the validity of such models.</P>
<P> Spreading in the Geosphere</P>
<P>6.28 As described in paragraphs 5.28 and 5.29 of my evidence, the
concentrations at which radionuclides will be present in groundwater reaching
the surface environment will be determined by a number of factors including
their rate of release from the repository and their spreading in time and space
during passage through the geosphere.</P>
<P>6.29 The rate of release from the repository is largely determined by the
groundwater flow through the near field of the repository (taking account of the
containment afforded by the engineered barriers), where the RCF is intended to
provide essential information.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 The RCF is intended to provide information for
use in determining the spreading in time and space of the transport of
radionuclides in the BVG rocks and the overlying sedimentary formations.  The
spreading of radionuclide transport will be highly dependent upon the properties
of the main groundwater flow channels in the geological formation. Thus, the
information on groundwater flow channels in the BVG rocks sought from the RCF in
relation to calculations of groundwater flow through the repository would be
required for this second purpose also.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.31"></A>6.31 The other geological formation which is
important in this context is the St. Bees Sandstone.  A wide range of
conceptualisations of the flow channels in this formation remains possible on
the basis of the results obtained so far.  At one extreme, this range includes
approximately vertical connected fracture networks extending over large
distances and possibly connected with fracture networks in the BVG.  At the
other extreme of the range is the possibility that horizontal bedding
structures, produced by the sedimentation processes that created the sandstones,
would force the groundwater flow in a horizontal direction.</P>
<P>6.32 The RCF will afford the direct observation of the structural
characteristics of the St. Bees Sandstone, as exposed in the RCF shafts.  The
correlation of the observed large scale geological structures with observations
of groundwater flow and hydrogeological responses in the monitoring boreholes
nearby should enable us to distinguish between the possible descriptions.  A
description based upon physical observations could then be used to calculate the
spreading in time and space for radionuclide transport through this rock
formation.</P>
<P> Rock Matrix Diffusion</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.33"></A>6.33 Radionuclides transported in groundwater along
flow channels in rocks, may diffuse into the surrounding bulk rock matrix.  This
would have the effect of retarding the transport of radionuclides and also
result in some spreading in the geosphere of the initial radionuclide release
from the repository.  The consequent access to sorption sites in the surrounding
bulk rock matrix affords additional retardation to radionuclide transport.  The
nature and extent of the operation of rock matrix diffusion and sorption affects
the calculated radiological consequences of the release of metallic
radionuclides such as uranium-238 in particular.</P>
<P>6.34 Particularly in the BVG there are uncertainties as to the extent to
which this beneficial process will operate. The uncertainties arise from
uncertainties about the networks of connected fractures, the internal structures
of the fractures themselves and the in situ diffusivity of the rock matrix.</P>
<P>6.35 The requirement for this information is placed in the second category, 
to be provided to the regulatory authorities to enable them to take a decision
on whether to approve the start of disposal operations.  Information on the
process of rock matrix diffusion has been obtained from laboratory measurements
and experiments on rock core samples.  However, for the results of this research
to be used with confidence it must be ensured that the measurements were
applicable to the main flow channels and that important properties of the rock
were not modified by their removal from the bulk rock at depth to a laboratory. 
The RCF is required to give direct access to, and measurements in, fractures
identified on the basis of their groundwater flow properties, and to make these
measurements in situ with relatively little disturbance of the rocks.</P>
<P> Colloid Transport</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.36"></A>6.36 Colloids are small particles of matter which
remain suspended in groundwater because they do not settle under gravity.  If
colloidal particles are present in sufficiently large concentrations and remain
stable for a sufficient length of time they have the potential to cause an
increase in the effective transport of radionuclides in groundwater by
incorporating radionuclides from the near field.  No conclusive evidence has
been found to suggest that colloids would exist at significant concentrations in
a repository at Sellafield.  However, because of the known difficulties of
taking undisturbed samples of groundwater to analyse for colloids, robust
arguments are not available to demonstrate that colloids will not be present. 
The key uncertainties relate to the quantities of colloids present in Sellafield
groundwaters and the transport of colloids in fractures in the rocks at
Sellafield.</P>
<P>6.37 Considerable efforts are being made to collect good groundwater samples
from the boreholes at Sellafield for colloid analysis including the drilling of
boreholes without the use of drilling muds.  Whereas the practical difficulties
have been overcome successfully for the analysis of species in solution in
groundwater, the ability to obtain reliable samples and analyses of the colloid
population is hampered by the introduction of relatively large quantities of
particulate matter from the materials of the sampling equipment and the fluids
necessarily used to drill, test and sample the boreholes.  The immediate
accessibility of the rocks at depth in the RCF affords the opportunity to take
undisturbed samples of known origins.  This is because more specialised sampling
equipment, including provisions for stabilising existing conditions, can be
located precisely within a feature of interest.  This benefit of working within
the RCF is extended to more general geochemical sampling where a higher spatial
coverage of sampling can be achieved than through the use of boreholes drilled
from the surface.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.38"></A>6.38 Nirex will seek to generate relatively simple
empirically based models of colloid transport based on experiments conducted
using flow rates and fracture properties of interest.  Given the requirements
for direct access to the fracture system in conjunction with the need for a high
level of control of the experimental conditions there is a particular necessity
to carry out such experiments in the RCF.  It is envisaged that these
experiments would characterise the transport of different colloids relative to a
conservative tracer (a substance that is readily identified and remains
dissolved in water as a trace on its movement) within a single fracture that had
previously been characterised.</P>
<P>Gas Migration</P>
<P>6.39 Our current understanding of processes relevant to gas migration
through the geosphere has been developed through the NSARP experimental
programme at Reskajeage Quarry in Cornwall.  The experimental results have been
used to develop and refine the modelling approach described in <I>Nirex Report
S/94/003 </I>(Sub-section 3.3, pages 13 to 16) [COR/509].  There are two aspects
of gas migration for which in situ testing is needed to confirm understanding
and validate models in order to increase confidence both in the evaluation of
the gas pathway itself and in the assessment of the effect of gas migration on
groundwater flow :</P>
<UL>
<LI>the entry of the gas into the water-saturated fracture network, since it is
necessary to be able to predict the maximum overpressuring that will be
generated in the repository as a result of gas production, in order to estimate
the potential for gas-induced fracturing of the repository or the surrounding
rock; and
</LI>
<LI>the migration of gas through the disturbed zone around the repository and
through the geosphere where issues to be considered are the mechanisms for gas
migration and the associated potential for coupled gas-water flow, the gas
pathways through the fracture network and the time taken for the gas to return
to the biosphere.  (This information is needed to identify the period over which
gas enters the biosphere and to assess whether enhanced migration of
contaminated groundwater is likely to occur.)
</LI></UL>
<P>6.40 The requisite experiments concerned with gas entry pressures and gas
migration in the BVG can only be carried out in the RCF because horizontal
boreholes are required to intersect identified and characterised fractures and
to examine some of the issues relating to the transport of the buoyant gas
through the water-filled fracture network.</P>
<P><A NAME="NaturalandInduced"></A><B>Natural and Induced Changes to the
Geological Barrier</B></P>
<P>6.41 It is recognised that the site characterisation programme carried out
by Nirex yields information on the present day geology and hydrogeology.  The
current regulatory requirements for a repository apply at any time in the
future.  Consideration must therefore be given to future changes to the
geosphere barrier as a result both of natural processes, including tectonic and
climatic processes, and of repository construction itself.  The information
required from the RCF again falls into the two categories determined by the
decision point against which it is generated.</P>
<P>6.42 In order to inform a decision whether to propose development of a
repository, information is required on the type and extent of natural changes
that could occur at the site to confirm that these will not significantly impair
the performance of the geosphere barrier in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport.  Similar information is required on the disturbance to
the rock that will be caused by excavating the repository itself, which is
termed 'excavation disturbance'.</P>
<P>6.43 In order to inform a decision by the regulatory authorities on whether
to approve the start of disposal operations, information is needed from testing
underground of the chemical disturbance in rocks surrounding the repository
caused by contact with alkaline pore water from the cement-based backfill. 
Every effort will have been made to assess the extent and nature of this change
to the rocks surrounding the repository in a conservative manner, using
information obtained from laboratory and field experiments and from
desk-studies.  However, the complex and site-specific nature of the interaction
requires validation to be obtained that its treatment in assessment studies is
appropriate and does not lead to underestimates of the transport of
radionuclides.</P>
<P> Natural Changes</P>
<P>6.44 Dr. Chaplow presents evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para7.6">paragraphs 7.6</A> to 7.26) that the
system of flowing fractures in the BVG has remained stable for a long period of
time.  In particular, no evidence has been obtained for the creation of new flow
paths at depth as a result of any seismic activity during the last several
million years and the groundwater system at depth shows evidence that there have
been no extensive changes as a result of climate-related events such as
glaciation for over a million years.  However, the RCF will be needed to
validate this evidence by means of direct observations of associations of
groundwater flows, mineral formation and geological structures at depth. 
Detailed examination of the fractures that are components of the main flow
channels should allow the geological history of flow patterns to be established,
particularly by dating the mineralisation that has occurred in association with
flows.  This palaeohydrogeological record can then be compared with the present
day flow patterns to test whether significant changes have occurred in the past
and may therefore occur in the future.  On the basis of information obtained
from borehole testing, this does not appear to be the case, but such a
conclusion would only be reliable when greater confidence is obtained in the
descriptions of the networks of connected fractures themselves through
observations and measurements in the RCF.</P>
<P> Excavation Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.45"></A>6.45 The information that can only be obtained from
carrying out work underground in the RCF relates to the disturbance of the
geology and hydrogeology that will result from excavation itself.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.46"></A>6.46 Creating an excavation in rock at depth by any
method removes material which was previously bearing some of the load of the
adjacent and overlying rocks.  Removal of this material therefore causes a
redistribution of the stresses around the excavation.  This redistribution may
be accompanied by some physical movement of the rocks around the excavation,
including movements on existing fractures and the creation of new fractures. 
This phenomenon is termed excavation disturbance.   The excavation disturbance
is confined to a volume, or zone, of rock which surrounds the excavation.  This
disturbed zone of rock surrounding shafts and drifts might provide additional
paths for transport in groundwater of radionuclides from the repository.  The
issues are the hydraulic conductivity of the excavation disturbed zone and how
far the zone extends from the excavation.</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.47"></A>6.47 Currently, views as to the extent and nature of
the excavation disturbed zone are based on past precedent of excavation projects
at other sites and a knowledge of the in situ stresses and rock quality measured
in Boreholes.  On this basis, it is assumed that the hydraulic conductivity of
the rock surrounding an excavation may increase by a factor of up to a hundred
over a distance equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation.  This is
believed to be a conservative description of the hydraulic characteristics and
extent of the excavation disturbed zone.  Scoping studies have shown that
disturbance on this scale is unlikely to impair the performance of the
repository and the effects of disturbance have not been included in assessment
models on this basis.  The information which is needed from the RCF is
measurement of the hydraulic and mechanical characteristics of the excavation
disturbed zone in the sandstones, Brockram and BVG to test the validity of this
assumption.</P>
<P>6.48 It is found that the potentially important effects of excavation
disturbance on groundwater flow characteristics are specific to the geological
and hydrogeological setting and to the nature of the excavation itself.  They
are likely to vary as a function of depth and location because of the different
mechanical loadings that will exist through the rock mass in three dimensions. 
Furthermore the effects, particularly in the long-term, are dependent upon a
number of interacting processes.</P>
<P>6.49 The benefit of the RCF is that it will allow direct measurement and
monitoring of excavation disturbance in the sandstones, Brockram and the
potential repository host rock.  In particular the important geological and
hydrogeological properties of the rock surrounding the excavation can be
determined before and after the excavation has been carried out and can be
observed as a function of time in the post-excavation period.  The monitoring is
particularly important to build confidence in our understanding of the evolution
of the excavation disturbed zone over time.  To enable extrapolation over
timescales of interest, the trends in further development of the disturbance
will be determined.  The response of the disturbed rock to mechanical loading
such as borehole testing will be particularly helpful in this respect.</P>
<P>6.50 The disturbance caused by the excavation will provide a significant
test of the understanding of changes that might result from natural processes. 
The stress redistribution that will occur during shaft sinking will be a useful
analogue for natural events such as glaciation that might place a cycle of
mechanical loading on the rock mass.  The response of the groundwater flow
system can be monitored to test the effects on the hydrogeological system of
such an event.
</P>
<P> Chemical Disturbance</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.51"></A>6.51 A chemical disturbance will be produced in a
volume of rock, or  zone, around the repository by the alkaline fluid emanating
from the Nirex Reference Vault Backfill.  This chemical disturbance has the
potential to modify the surfaces of fractures in the rock.
</P>
<P>6.52 Information on this subject is currently obtained by conducting
laboratory experiments on rock samples from Sellafield, by constructing
mathematical models that couple groundwater flow and chemical reaction and by
building confidence in the results of this work from comparison with
observations on naturally occurring alkaline groundwater systems.</P>
<P>6.53 The essential role of the RCF is to provide the opportunity for
calibration and validation of the mathematical models developed from the current
programme  to give the information required on the key issues listed.  The RCF
allows the detailed characterisation of identified flowing fractures to
determine their structure and mineralogy, the variability of these properties
and the precise compositions of groundwater in contact with the flow-wetted
surfaces in the fractures.  Once the fractures were characterised in this way,
their accessibility in the RCF would allow the conduct of well-controlled
validation experiments.  The principal reactions involved are believed to be
relatively slow and the experiments would build confidence in the trends of
changes to the rock properties rather than determining the long-term
characteristics of the disturbed zone by direct measurement.</P>
<P><A NAME="DesignandConstruction"></A><B>Design and Construction of the
Repository</B></P>
<P>6.54 The information required from the RCF on design and construction of the
repository can again be placed in two categories determined by the decision
point against which it is generated.  In this area in particular, the
information acquired for the decision to propose development of a repository
will be refined for subsequent development of a finalised safety assessment.</P>
<P>6.55 In order to take a decision to propose development of a repository, the
repository design must be developed sufficiently to provide a basis for the
optimisation of repository depth. location, layout and orientation.  This would
allow decisions to be taken on these parameters, albeit allowing for
finalisation of details in light of further investigations underground,
including those associated with repository construction.</P>
<P>6.56 There is little doubt that a repository could be constructed and
operated safely: the key issue is whether it will provide the long-term
isolation and containment of radionuclides in radioactive wastes once it is
closed.  A sound basis for assessment of the post-closure performance requires
that key aspects of the design related to transport of radionuclides can be
defined.  This responds to the requirement most recently restated in <I>the
July 1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208] that best practicable
means should be adopted to limit risk.  For a deep geological repository this is
taken to mean that, where there are options concerning the depth, location,
layout and orientation of the disposal vaults within the host rock, the
decisions taken must be justified.</P>
<P>6.57 It will be important to work within a framework, which has been
discussed with the regulatory authorities, that establishes the basis for making
these decisions and does not foreclose options by inappropriate developments.</P>
<P>6.58 The RCF is particularly valuable in allowing us to proceed in a
step-wise fashion of investigation in the potential host rock to finalise the
repository design.  Dr. Chaplow describes in his Proof of Evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para8.13">paragraphs 8.13</A> to 8.16) a
three-dimensional representational model of the PRZ rock mass that is currently
under development.  This will provide the framework of testing our understanding
by each successive step of excavation and associated investigations represented
by the phases of the RCF programme.  Each step in developing the RCF and
investigating the surrounding rock mass will be designed to create the minimum
site disturbance required to gain the required justification for fixing an
aspect of design through testing the rock mass model against the resulting
observations.  Thus any exploration by development of galleries in a horizontal
direction out from the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound
justification for the depth at which this will occur from confirmation of the
modelled rock characteristics.  Further extensions of investigations away from
the shafts will only be undertaken when there is sound justification for the
eventual location and orientation of a repository.  Care will also be taken that
the nature of the investigations to fix these aspects of repository design would
not compromise our ability to fine tune these aspects at the final stages of
development of a repository itself.</P>
<P>6.59 Before seeking the approval of the regulatory authorities for the start
of disposal operations, information must be obtained, for use in a finalised
safety assessment, with respect to the methods of placing engineered seals,
developed in laboratory facilities, in the required settings.</P>
<P> Repository Depth, Location, Layout and Orientation</P>
<P>6.60 Currently judgments concerning repository design are based upon
interpretations of the rock mass and hydrogeology of the PRZ from information
obtained from the programme of site characterisation.  These interpretations do
not yet enable us to take a firm view on the benefits to be obtained from
particular depths, locations, layouts or orientations of the repository vaults
within the PRZ.
</P>
<P>6.61 Repository design (in particular depth, location, layout and
orientation) would affect factors identified previously : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the calculated flow of groundwater into the repository;
</LI>
<LI>the calculated spreading time for radionuclide transport in the BVG; and
</LI>
<LI>the mechanical and hydraulic characteristics of the excavation disturbed
zone.</LI></UL>
<P> The information required is to develop an understanding of how these
factors will vary as a function of interactions of different processes at
different locations throughout the PRZ.  In particular information is required
that enables the extrapolation throughout the BVG rocks in the PRZ of the
distribution of networks of connected fractures.</P>
<P>6.62 It might be envisaged, for example, that the repository could be
located at a depth at which there were relatively few or even no networks of
connected fractures sufficiently long to act as groundwater flow channels from
the repository depth to the overlying sedimentary formations.  Alternatively,
the spacing and orientation of the networks of connected fractures might allow a
layout of the repository vaults that minimised or wholly avoided intersections
with them.</P>
<P>6.63 It is intended that the main RCF galleries will be created at the same
horizon as the repository vaults.  The RCF shafts are required to give access to
these galleries and their depth will be determined by consideration of the
following factors : 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the sufficiency of information available on taking the shaft to a certain
depth through its intersections with an adequate number and type of geological
and hydrogeological features of interest; and
</LI>
<LI>confidence that, taking remaining uncertainties into account, a repository
could be developed at the selected horizon that would meet regulatory
requirements.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.64 The RCF shaft sinking provides for the validation of the prior
understanding and associated models which will be developed to underpin the
preliminary view on repository depth, currently put at 650 metres below Ordnance
Datum ('bOD').  Those models will predict the information that will become
available to test this view.  The shaft sinking phase will have programmed into
it a decision point at which the results to date will be evaluated to establish
whether the understanding and models are confirmed.  If so, the RCF galleries
will be developed at the depth previously identified.</P>
<P>6.65 That decision point will provide for an updating of the understanding
and modelling.  The updating could indicate that further information is required
to meet the scientific objectives of adequately validating the models or that a
greater depth is appropriate for the optimisation of the repository.  If so, the
RCF shafts will be developed to the necessary depths.  The maximum depth
currently under consideration for the repository is 900 metres bOD and the
shafts of the RCF would have to be sunk to a depth of 935 metres bOD (to provide
for a sump) if this were found to be the optimised depth of the repository.  The
shafts might also be sunk to investigate depths of up to 900 metres bOD to
provide sufficient information for model validation and a decision on repository
(and hence gallery) horizon which could be at a lesser depth.</P>
<P>6.66 Given the intention to minimise the disturbance of the rock in making
these investigations, it will not be practicable to carry out detailed
investigations from the RCF throughout the PRZ.  Instead, the investigations
must be sufficient, in terms of the representative sampling of the rock mass, to
give a firm understanding of the variability of key geological and
hydrogeological characteristics of the rock mass.  The understanding that is
sought of the variations within the rock mass is to enable the variable
characteristics to be predicted throughout the PRZ on the basis of other
measurements from boreholes and various surveys.  This will allow the required
extrapolation across the rock mass to inform  decisions on repository depth,
location, layout and orientation.
</P>
<P>6.67 An essential role of the RCF in providing this information is to allow
the testing of our ability to carry out the required extrapolation.  This would
involve making predictions of the expected geological and hydrogeological
characteristics on the basis both of previous investigations from the surface
and of targeted drilling underground and then carrying out excavations to test
these predictions.  The finalised location of the repository vaults in the rock
mass would be determined by interpreting the results of targeted drilling from
the RCF.  It is essential to gain confidence from such work in the RCF that, in
any subsequent excavation of a repository, the information from prior
investigations could be utilised successfully to confirm the important
properties of the blocks of rock selected.
</P>
<P> Sealing</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.68"></A>6.68 The sealing requirements for the repository
will be established in an iterative manner by assessment studies.  This process
allows the long-term performance requirement to be established for seals placed
in various features of the repository system.  This in turn translates to the
required properties such as fluidity, durability or hydraulic conductivity (in
set condition) at the time of placing seals.  The achievement of the required
properties relates strongly to the interaction between the materials and the
precise geological setting specific to the site and location.  The features that
are currently considered are as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>flowing fractures intersecting repository vaults (which are assumed not to
be sealed in current models);
</LI>

</LI>
<LI>disturbed zones surrounding excavated openings; and
</LI>
<LI>underground boreholes drilled from the proposed RCF itself.
</LI></UL>
<P>6.69 The requirement is that this work should be carried out in
representative geological settings, and in particular in the BVG at depth where
the levels of in situ stress and rock quality will be appropriate.  Furthermore
the requirement is to allow a long lead-time for the seals to set and to
establish an initial equilibrium in advance of using the results in support of a
performance assessment.  Therefore the validation that sealing requirements can
be met can only be achieved by carrying out work underground in the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="ImpactofRCF"></A><B>7. IMPACT OF THE RCF</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.1"></A>7.1 In taking the decision to apply to develop the
RCF, Nirex has given careful consideration to the potential of the RCF shafts in
particular to affect the post-closure performance of a repository subsequently
located within the PRZ because this is clearly a matter on which Nirex will have
to satisfy the regulators at the appropriate stage of an authorisation procedure
under RSA 93.  Two issues are of particular relevance to these considerations: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the location of the shafts relative to the eventual development of the
repository vaults and accesses; and
</LI>
<LI>the method of excavation and the associated disturbance of the surrounding
rock and hence of its hydrogeological properties.
</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para7.2"></A>7.2 For both these issues, the potential for effects
on post-closure performance only exists if sealing materials cannot be placed in
the openings and disturbances caused by the excavations to restrict groundwater
flow and to maintain this barrier over long timescales.  This is believed to be
achievable but, because of the site-specific nature of sealing requirements, it
is intended that suitable designs and specifications of seals will be
demonstrated at a later stage of the programme. In order to progress to that
stage, information will be used from a number of sources, including work that is
currently under way in the Nirex Science Programme, relevant work previously
carried out in other international programmes, and work that is proposed to be
undertaken in the RCF.  In the absence of this information the shafts have been
evaluated in scoping studies as if sealed against the flow of groundwater to
only a very low standard, equivalent to a compacted aggregate material.  The
results of these studies have shown no detrimental effect on transport of
radionuclides and on this basis seals have to date not been included in
assessment models.</P>
<P><A NAME="ShaftLocation"></A><B>Location of the Shafts</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.3"></A>7.3 The key concern in respect of the location of the
shafts is the possibility that they would provide a preferential pathway for
groundwater flow that compromises the containment performance of the geosphere. 
Consideration has been given to various issues in this respect :</P>

<TD WIDTH="50"></TD>
<TD WIDTH="50">iv.</TD>
<TD>the potential for a U-tube groundwater flow system with the shafts
conducting water into the repository and this subsequently being discharged into
the inclined drift tunnels envisaged as the principal accesses to a repository
at Sellafield.</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>7.4 Consideration of the hydrogeological conditions in the PRZ showed that
the consequences of realising ii. or iii. would not be significantly affected by
the choice of shaft locations.  A pragmatic design solution is available to
address iv. whereby there is sufficient flexibility in the routing of the
inclined drifts that these could be arranged to arrive at the repository in
close proximity to the shaft locations.</P>
<P>7.5 When the RCF was proposed in 1992, a good database was available for
conditions at depth in the vicinity of the cluster of the boreholes into the
PRZ, represented by Boreholes 2, 4 and 5.  This gave no indications of a major
flow channel that might connect with a shaft located at Longlands Farm and
therefore gave confidence that the possibility at i. above was unlikely.  The
drilling of several further boreholes in this location and the interpretation of
more detailed geophysical surveys, as reported by Dr Chaplow in his evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#Para4.6">paragraphs 4.6</A>), have confirmed this
prognosis.</P>
<P>7.6 The location of the shafts was determined to be in the north-eastern
quadrant of the PRZ because this was interpreted to be upstream in relation to
the overall direction of flow in that location, as reflected by the choice of
cross-section for groundwater flow modelling reported in <I>Nirex 95</I>
(Volume 3, Section 2.1.1, pages 2.2 to 2.3) [COR/522].  The location of the
shafts at Longlands Farm, within the north-eastern quadrant of the PRZ, would
allow sufficient horizontal distance between that location and the north-eastern
boundary of the PRZ, for the inclined drift access envisaged for a repository to
be brought around the shaft location to approach from upstream without going
outside the PRZ. </P>
<P><A NAME="ExcavationMethods"></A><B>Excavation Methods</B></P>
<P><A NAME="Para7.7"></A>7.7 The main concern in respect of the excavation
methods chosen to develop the RCF is that these will disturb the rock in such a
way as to develop preferential pathways for groundwater flow. The effect of
excavation disturbance on groundwater flows is an important area of study
proposed for the RCF.  At this stage pragmatic assumptions have been made as to
the effects, whereby the hydraulic conductivity of the rock is increased by two
orders of magnitude to a distance into the rock surrounding the excavation
equivalent to twice the diameter of the excavation. These are thought to be
conservative assumptions.  Moreover, as I noted in paragraph 6.47 of my
evidence, scoping studies have shown that disturbance on this scale would be
unlikely to impair the performance of the repository and the effects of
disturbance have not been included in assessment models on this basis.</P>
<P>7.8 There is a good body of evidence from previous practice concerning the
extent of excavation disturbance of rocks of different qualities as a function
of key variables such as the diameter of the excavation and the excavation
methods chosen on which to base these assumptions.  When the assumed extent of
the disturbance is combined with the chosen values for the increased hydraulic
conductivity of the BVG within this disturbed zone there is calculated to be no
significant effect on the movement of groundwater from depth to the surface. 
This analysis takes no benefit from any measures that might be taken to reduce
excavation disturbance effects or to seal the disturbed zone subsequently.</P>
<P>7.9 It was originally envisaged that the shaft excavation would require the
freezing of some part or all of the sandstone formations overlying the BVG. 
This would have required the introduction of a large number of drill holes
around the shaft and possible disruption of the rock by freeze-thaw cycling. 
The replacement of this method by one where groundwater control is achieved by
the preferred method of grouting would introduce a major reduction in the
mechanical disturbance that would be caused, albeit that no significant impact
upon groundwater flow was calculated to result.</P>

</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.

</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society

<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework

repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in

radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>

<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>- establishing the geometry of rock fractures;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting precise and uncontaminated water sampling to be

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>

<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review

<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]
</P>

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]
comments:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect
from others engaged in parallel work world-wide.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very
high quality.</I>&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual
Report</I> of June 1994 (para 3.10, page 11) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by
contractors (who are the contributors to Report No. 524) would, on detailed
review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and

<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of

<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

example, at one site it has comprised 15 boreholes at least 300m deep
complemented by geophysical studies. It is planned to commence construction of
rock characterisation facilities on at least two of the sites in 1996, i.e. two
years after commencement of detailed surface-based characterisation.  A decision
on whether to propose a repository at one of the sites is planned for 2006. This
decision would therefore be made some 12 years after commencement of detailed

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

<TD>Sweden</TD>
<TD>It is planned to carry out detailed site characterisation, initially
comprising boreholes and surface-based geoscientific surveys at two sites over a
four year period commencing in 1995. An underground laboratory would then be
constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally.

</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)
</I>(&quot;<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>&quot;)<I> </I> [COR/605]

<P>&quot;<I>We have been impressed by the quality of individual items of
scientific work undertaken and commissioned by Nirex, which command high respect

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 6.8, page 110:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Nirex site characterisation work at Sellafield has been of very

<P>5.6 Similarly, the <I> </I>RWMAC state in their <I>Fourteenth Annual

<P>&quot;<I>However, there is no reason to modify the view expressed in the
Thirteenth Annual Report to the effect that the work carried out for Nirex by

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)
[GOV/407] the RWMAC state:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The Committee would record, again, its view that the field work,
and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>

<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and

<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

Evidence present the following information:

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs. 
</P>
<P><B> Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>4.11 Current Government policy on the standards of safety for a deep
repository, and the nature of the safety case that must be made, is set out in
the <I>Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy</I>, <I>Final Conclusions
</I>White Paper issued in July 1995<I> </I>(<I>&quot;The 1995 White Paper&quot;</I>)
(paras 74 to 82, pages 21 to 23) [GOV/208].  This White Paper (para 74, page 21)
[GOV/208] states that in terms of policy the 1984 Green Book (<I>Disposal
Facilities on Land for Low and Intermediate Level Radioactive Wastes -
Principles for the Protection of the Human Environment)</I> [GOV/302] is
superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out
of date. The White Paper makes reference at paragraph 74 to the Regulators'
Consultation draft of <I>Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation
</I>under RSA93 issued in August 1994 (&quot;<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I>&quot;)
[GOV/307]. 
</P>
<P>4.12 Relevant Government Policy on the environmental safety criteria for
radioactive waste repositories is set out in paragraphs 75 and 78 of the <I>1995
White Paper </I>[GOV/208]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.
</P>
<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995
White Paper</I>)<I> </I>(para 78, page 22) [GOV/208], the
<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a
proposal is consistent with the principles and requirements.

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal
of Radioactive Wastes in Deep Repositories)

review, be shown to have been well-conducted, and of the highest quality.
Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> In their <I>Fifteenth Annual Report </I>of May 1995 (para 4.6, page 13)

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.
</P>
<P><B> Forward Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval
to start operations in due course when the plant is built and commissioned.
</LI></UL>
<P> On these and other matters the White Paper says (para 62) that further
guidance will be given in the revised and updated version of <I>Radioactive
Substances Act 1960: a guide to the administration of the Act.
</I>
</P>
<P>6.20 In the <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>[GOV/307] the Inspectorates
referred to a &quot;<I>staged application procedure, agreed with the developer,
</I>[which]<I> could facilitate the timely resolution of an application</I>&quot;
for an authorisation to dispose of waste (para 4.1), but (para 4.2):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>envisaged that the Inspectorates will not be in a position to
make final recommendations in relation to such authorisations until the relevant
workings have been excavated and geological investigation has confirmed their
suitability.  Thus, the formal issue of authorisation will be the culmination of
a progressive and extensive process beginning with informal discussions between
the developer and the Inspectorates.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Whether or not an application for an authorisation, staged or otherwise, is
made at about the same time as a planning application for a repository, the <I>Draft
Guidance</I> refers to the possibility that the Inspectorates would be consulted
by the planning authority on the planning application, and gives notice of the
Inspectorates' intention (para 4.3) to
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

<TD>Germany</TD>
<TD>Detailed surface-based characterisation of a salt dome at Gorleben was
carried out over a six year period between 1979 and 1985. These surface-based
investigations comprised four deep boreholes, 44 shallower boreholes and
geophysical surveys. Excavations to enable underground investigations to be

constructed at one site. Following construction of the laboratory, comprising a
tunnel and/or shaft and associated investigations, taking in all around four
years, a decision will be made on site suitability and therefore whether to
propose development of a repository. Repository construction would commence
approximately 10 years after commencement of site characterisation. Underground

<P><B>DR JOHN HOLMES will say:
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="PersonalDetails"></A><B>1. PERSONAL</B> <B>DETAILS
</B>
</P>
<P>1.1 I am Director for Science for United Kingdom Nirex Limited ('Nirex'), an
appointment I took up in October 1992. I have overall responsibility for the
Science Programme that Nirex is undertaking to assess the post-closure safety
performance of a repository at Sellafield and to provide information to assist
in its design. 
</P>
<P>1.2 I hold a first-class honours degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge
University, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College, London, and a
Master of Business Administration degree from Brunel University. I am a
Chartered Engineer, a Fellow of the Institute of Energy and a Member of the
Institute of Management. Since September 1994 I have been a UK representative on
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ('OECD') Nuclear
Energy Agency's Radioactive Waste Management Committee.
</P>
<P>1.3 Prior to my appointment at Nirex, I was employed by British Coal
(formerly National Coal Board). Between 1979 and 1990 I worked at British Coal's
Coal Research Establishment where I successively held the posts of Project
Engineer, Head of Technology Assessment Group, Head of Physics Group and Head of
Power Generation Branch. These appointments gave me experience of managing
research and development projects requiring the integration and co&#173;ordination
of a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Between 1990 and
1992 I was a member of the Directing Staff of British Coal's Management Centre.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Summary"></A><B>2. SUMMARY
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Scope of Evidence
</B>
</P>
<P>2.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his Rule 6(10)
Statement of 27 February 1995. My evidence sets the context for the detailed
scientific evidence of Drs Chaplow, Hooper and Mellor.
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept and Regulatory Framework
</B>
</P>
<P>2.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
as a multi-barrier containment system comprising engineered (physical and
chemical) and natural barriers. The engineered barriers are designed to retain
most (around 99.99%) of the radioactivity in the vaults. The natural barrier is
provided by the geological setting of the repository which should ensure low
flow of groundwater through the repository to permit the effective operation of
the engineered barriers. It should also ensure sufficient dilution of those
residual radionuclides that escape from the vaults in order to limit
concentrations in groundwater reaching the surface. 
</P>
<P>2.3 Government stated in the <I>1995 White Paper </I>(para 78, page 22)
[GOV/208] that a risk target is appropriate as an objective in the design
process for a repository and that this should be a risk to an individual of 10<SUP>-6</SUP>
per year of developing either a fatal cancer or a serious hereditary effect.
</P>
<P><B> Nirex Science Programme
</B>
</P>
<P>2.4 The objective of the Nirex Science Programme is to evaluate the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield. The Nirex
management team for the Science Programme directs the activities of
interdisciplinary and experienced teams of specialist contractors and
consultants  towards the effective achievement of this objective.
</P>
<P>2.5 Quality assurance procedures and independent peer review contribute to
the achievement of high standards of scientific work, as recognised by the RWMAC
and by the Royal Society Study Group which reviewed the Nirex Science Programme.
Wide ranging peer review is assured by the dissemination of results from the
programme : 500 reports, journal articles and conference papers have been
published to date.
</P>
<P>2.6 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal programmes overseas,
makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of post-closure safety
performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is largely about building
confidence that the models are adequate representations of reality. Testing
(validation) of the models involves the systematic comparison of model
predictions with independent field operations and experimental measurements. The
RCF programme is essential in this process.
</P>
<P><B> The Need for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.7 Current models of groundwater flow at Sellafield predict flow through a
repository and dilution of radionuclides emerging in groundwater from a
repository which, when taken with our current view of other factors influencing
repository performance, indicate that a repository could be developed at
Sellafield which would meet regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>2.8 However, limitations on observations that can be made using
surface-based investigations currently allow other models to be developed which
would predict groundwater flow and dilution inconsistent with meeting regulatory
requirements for post-closure safety of a repository.
</P>
<P>2.9 The RCF is needed to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, thought to have lengths of
up to hundreds of metres, which control flow and dilution. This will allow us to
narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models with
confidence across the PRZ and surrounding  rocks.
</P>
<P>2.10 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations of surface-based
investigations by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and
hundreds of metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to
make direct observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one
dimension in a borehole.
</P>
<P>2.11 The RCF is also needed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>to establish that construction of the repository, or future naturally
induced changes, would not result in new pathways for water flow which would
significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>to permit decisions on repository depth, location, layout and orientation.</LI></UL>
<P>2.12 The RCF is to be developed in three phases and a decision on whether to
propose development of a repository could be made at the end of the first, shaft
sinking phase. If the site is found suitable and so a decision is made to
propose repository development at this stage, work would need to continue into
Phases 2 and 3 to address remaining uncertainties, and so ensure that the
repository would be constructed as soon as reasonably practicable, in line with
Government policy. Results from that work would probably be reported within the
framework of a plan, agreed with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive
supply of information leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on
approval to start disposal of wastes in the repository following its
construction and commissioning.
</P>
<P>2.13 As with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be planned with
precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive and provide
insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In this case, it
would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more of the PRZ
using the galleries planned for Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3, before a decision
on whether to propose repository development is made. A flexible approach is
needed in planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they
could permit access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address
specific uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P><B> Responses to Nirex's Plans for the RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>2.14 The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group and the Nirex Review Panel. ERM, advisers to Cumbria County Council,
have expressed the view that the proper assessment of a site for the long-term
disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of underground
experimentation and validation.
</P>
<P><B> Programmes in Other Countries
</B>
</P>
<P>2.15 Review of planned repository programmes in other countries leads to the
conclusion that the proposal to carry out a stage of underground investigations
in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on whether to propose development of
a repository is consistent with general practice internationally. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="ScopeOfEvidence"></A><B>3. SCOPE OF EVIDENCE
</B>
</P>
<P>3.1 The scientific evidence presented by myself and Drs Chaplow, Hooper and
Mellor addresses matter 6 identified by the Secretary of State in his statement
of 27 February 1995:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The results available so far from studies and surveys of the
geology and hydrogeology of the area; the additional information that might
become available only from the RCF, if developed; and the benefits to be gained
from obtaining that additional information, if any, weighed against the possible
impact the RCF might have on the site and surrounding area.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>3.2 I have overall responsibility for the Science Programme and head the
team of senior managers of the Science Programme comprising Drs Chaplow, Hooper
and Mellor. My evidence sets the context for their detailed scientific evidence.
They are responsible for managing a substantial multi-disciplinary programme,
carried out primarily by specialist contractors in the various fields, and each
is supported by an in&#173;house team of Nirex scientific staff. They will
summarise and interpret the substantial body of information arising within their
respective areas of responsibility in a manageable form. The size of this body
of information is illustrated by the number of reports which record it: 500
published reports, journal articles and conference papers and 1,600 volumes of
underpinning factual data on geology and hydrogeology.
</P>
<P>3.3 The evidence of Dr Chaplow and Dr Hooper establishes that the results
available so far support the continuation of investigations at Sellafield, which
continues to hold good promise as a potentially suitable location for a
repository.
</P>
<P>3.4 Their evidence also identifies areas of uncertainty where information is
required from the RCF to enable Nirex to decide whether to propose development
of a deep repository for disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield and to
obtain regulatory approval to start disposal operations if a repository is
constructed.  They will explain why the required information cannot be obtained
by other means. 
</P>
<P>3.5 Dr Mellor describes the programme of activities planned for the RCF to
deliver the necessary information and explains how the RCF has been designed to
enable those activities to be carried out.

<P><A NAME="RepositoryConcept"></A><B>4. REPOSITORY CONCEPT AND REGULATORY
FRAMEWORK
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Repository Concept
</B>
</P>
<P>4.1 In order to provide safe disposal of radioactive wastes a repository and
its geological setting must ensure that any radionuclides that are released
before they have decayed do not return to the surface at concentrations which
would pose radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.2 The Nirex repository concept for the Sellafield site has been developed
to achieve this objective. The concept takes account of the geological setting
and of the nature and quantities of wastes in the disposal inventory. Nirex is
currently planning on the basis of a design capacity of 300,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>
of Intermediate-Level Waste and 100,000 m<SUP>3</SUP> of Low-Level Waste
disposed over a period of 50 years.
</P>
<P>4.3 In common with other disposal agencies internationally, Nirex has a
disposal concept which uses a multi-barrier containment system. Vaults would be
excavated at depth in a stable geological setting. Wastes, packaged in steel or
concrete containers, would be placed in the vaults which would then be
backfilled with a cement-based material. The concept is illustrated in
<A HREF="#Figure4.1">Figure 4.1</A>. 
</P>
<P>4.4 It makes use of both engineered (physical and chemical) and natural
barriers. The physical barrier would be provided by the containers and grouts in
which the wastes are packaged. Results of research to date indicate that a very
high level of physical containment should be maintained for at least one
thousand years, during which period around 99% of the radioactivity in the
repository would decay.
</P>
<P>4.5 The chemical barrier would be provided by surrounding waste packages
with a cement-based backfill. It would operate over a longer period than the
physical barrier (around 1 million years or more) and would act to contain most
(around 99%) of the long-lived radionuclides (i.e. the 1% of the total
radioactivity which is not contained by the physical barrier). The main way in
which radionuclides can potentially be transported away from the vaults is by
flow of groundwater.  The backfill works by making the groundwater entering the
repository vaults alkaline (high pH). These alkaline conditions ensure that many
radionuclides, for example plutonium and uranium, are not very soluble and hence
the groundwater cannot transport them in solution away from the vaults. Also,
the backfill is porous and the pore surfaces are able to retain radionuclides
that have dissolved in the groundwater by the process of sorption.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.6"></A>4.6 The natural barrier would be provided by the
geological setting of the repository. By placing the wastes deep below the
ground in stable rocks with little natural resource potential they would be
isolated from the effects of naturally occurring processes, for example future
ice ages, and human activities. Understanding developed through the Nirex
programme to date indicates that, as well as providing a mechanically stable
environment for the waste packages and the surrounding backfill, the geological
barrier has, in practice, two key functions in respect of transport of
radionuclides in groundwater: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI> to ensure that there are low flows of groundwater through the repository
so that the physical and chemical barriers can operate to retain short-lived and
most long-lived radioactivity; and</LI>
<LI>to ensure sufficient dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>4.7 Establishing whether the geological setting at Sellafield can perform
these two functions is a key objective of the Site Characterisation Programme
and of the RCF.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para4.8"></A>4.8 Corrosion of the containers and degradation of
organic matter in the repository would generate gas, a very small proportion of
which is radioactive. The gas must not build up pressures that would damage the
repository and surrounding rocks, and hence the backfill and surrounding rocks
need to be sufficiently permeable to gas to permit it to escape from the vaults.
The geological setting needs to have characteristics which ensure that gas does
not reach the surface in concentrations that would pose a flammability hazard or
lead to concentrations of radionuclides in gas at the surface which would pose
radiological risks exceeding regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>4.9 Paragraphs 4.5 and 4.8 above have identified two potential pathways for
radioactivity to return to the human environment: transport of  radionuclides in
groundwater and migration of radionuclides in gases.  A third may also be
identified being return of radionuclides to the environment as a result of
natural disruptive events or inadvertent human intrusion.  These pathways need
to be considered in order to evaluate whether a repository located at Sellafield
would be safe after closure.  For each pathway, it is necessary to consider how
much radioactivity may return to the surface, at what time, and the likely
impact on future human inhabitants of the area affected. Potential for
interactions between the pathways must also be considered. Particular attention
has been given to the groundwater pathway which has the potential to return more
radioactivity to the surface than other pathways. Dr Hooper's evidence describes
Nirex's approach to the evaluation of risk arising from the groundwater pathway
and our current estimates of that risk. He also summarises the current position
on our understanding of the other pathways.
</P>
<P>4.10 In order to evaluate safety, the overall system performance of the
repository, i.e. the combined effect of its engineered and natural components,
needs to be considered. The characteristics of the site are an input to this
evaluation of overall system performance. As understanding of the issues which
are most important to system performance increases, the design of the repository
is refined in order to ensure that best practicable means are used to limit
risks as required by the regulatory framework described in the following
paragraphs.

<P><B> Regulatory Framework

superseded by that White Paper and its regulatory requirements are also now out

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>75.  Forming a judgement about the level of safety afforded by a
disposal facility involves assessment of the means by which radionuclides in the
wastes might move from the wastes through the immediate physical and chemical
environment of the facility (and, in the case of deep disposal, through the
surrounding host rocks) back to the human environment. For deep disposal
facilities, this involves considering the potential behaviour of radionuclides
over extended periods - in excess of thousands of years. The safety case
provided by a repository developer or operator will need to address all these
issues. The regulators will need to be satisfied that good engineering practice
has been used in developing proposals for design, construction and operation of
the facility and that good science has been adopted in investigating the
suitability of the site, in supporting research and development work, in the
interpretation of the resulting data and in the development of safety assessment
methodologies.</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>   78.  In the Government's view, the nature of the disposal system
makes it less amenable to such quantified risk assessments than is the case, for
example, for new nuclear reactors. Reliance cannot be placed exclusively on
estimates of risk to determine whether a disposal facility (or a nuclear plant)
is safe. While such calculations can inform a judgement about the safety of a
facility, other technical factors, including ones of a more qualitative nature,
will also need to be considered in arriving at the decision. The Government
therefore confirms the preliminary conclusion of the review that it is
inappropriate to rely on a specified risk limit or risk constraint as the
criterion for determining the acceptability of a disposal facility. A risk
target, however, should be used as an objective in the design process and this
should be a risk of 10<SUP>&#173;6</SUP>/y of developing either a fatal cancer
or a serious hereditary defect. Where the regulators are satisfied that best
practicable means have been adopted by the operator to limit risks and the
estimated risks to the public are below this target, then no further reductions
in risk should be sought. However, if the estimated risk is above this target,
then the regulators will need to be satisfied not only that an appropriate level
of safety is assured, but also that any further improvements in safety could be
achieved only at disproportionate cost.&quot;
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>4.13 Risk arises to an individual if that individual receives a radiological
dose from radioactivity originating in a repository. For each year that a dose
is received there is a risk that a fatal cancer or serious hereditary defect
will subsequently occur. The Government has set a target for this annual risk of
'one in a million'. The <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 6.7 to 6.9,
page 17) [GOV/307] indicates that the target applies to a representative member
of the critical group and that, for doses less than 0.5 sieverts per year, the
dose received by an individual (measured in sieverts) should be multiplied by
0.06 to calculate the consequent risk. It also notes (para 6.11) that the target
risk is well below that implied by the natural background radiation in the UK
which varies from about 1 in 10,000 per year to more than 1 in 1,000 per year. 
Hence the risk target for the repository is one hundredth to one thousandth of
the risk implied by natural background radiation.

<P>4.14 In respect of the &quot;other technical factors&quot; <I>(the 1995

<I>HMIP Consultation Document</I> (Chapters 5 to 7, pages 14 to 22) [GOV/307]
sets out the draft principles and requirements against which the Inspectorates
will assess any application for authorisation under RSA 93.  It also sets out
(Chapter 8, pages 23 to 27) draft guidance on information that the developer
will need to provide to the Inspectorates in order to demonstrate that a

<P><A NAME="ScienceProgramme"></A><B>5. THE NIREX SCIENCE PROGRAMME
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Approach
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.1"></A>5.1 The current main objective of the Nirex Science
Programme is to evaluate the post-closure safety performance of a repository at
Sellafield. It has three main components as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>Site Characterisation Programme: activities to acquire and interpret site
specific data in order to understand and describe the geological and
hydrogeological processes that will influence the post-closure performance of
the repository;</LI>
<LI>The Nirex Safety Assessment Research Programme: laboratory, field and
mathematical modelling studies of processes influencing the retention of
radionuclides in the repository, the migration through the geosphere of
radionuclides which may escape from the  repository and their behaviour in the
biosphere; and</LI>
<LI>The Safety Assessment Programme: to develop the models and methodologies
required to evaluate the overall performance of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P> The programme is managed to ensure that these components are integrated to
secure a focused approach to achievement of the overall objective of the Science
Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.2"></A>5.2 The Science Programme is founded on four
important operating principles:
</P>
<UL>
<LI> having in place a Nirex management team with the knowledge and experience
to direct activities towards the effective achievement of the objective;</LI>
<LI>the use of interdisciplinary teams of specialist contractors and
consultants to carry out the activities who have appropriate expertise and
experience. (These teams, which are augmented from time to time as necessary,
have built up a substantial body of experience, since 1989 for Site
Characterisation, 1982 for the Research Programme and 1986 for Safety
Assessment);</LI>
<LI>the use of quality assurance procedures applied to all activities including
data acquisition, calculations and interpretation; and
</LI>
<LI>independent peer review and challenge.</LI></UL>
<P>5.3 Peer review is applied both to plans for activities in the Science
Programme and to the results of those activities. It is carried out by Nirex
staff, by contractors working on the programme, by consultants not otherwise
engaged on the programme and, as appropriate, by the Nirex Review Panel (see
Section 7 below). A Royal Society Study Group was also set up at the invitation
of Nirex to review the basis and methodology of the Science Programme (see
Section 7 below). In a less formal way, review and challenge is provided by the
publication of reports, journal articles and conference papers on the results of
the Science Programme.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.4"></A>5.4 As indicated at Paragraph 3.2, 500 reports,
journal articles and conference papers on the Nirex Science Programme have been
published to date. In addition, the factual reports, comprising around 1,600
volumes which record the detailed results of the Site Characterisation
Programme, are available to interested parties for reference.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.5"></A>5.5 The quality of the work being undertaken by Nirex
has been recognised by independent reviewers. For example, the November 1994
report of the Royal Society Study Group  at Section 1.9, page 10 (<I>Disposal

Indeed, some of the techniques being used at Sellafield are at the leading edge
of international experience. As indicated in the Thirteenth Annual Report, the
basic data set and much of the geological interpretation is unlikely to be
subject to significant challenge in terms of fundamental accuracy.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

and the interpretation of site data, being carried out by Nirex staff and by
Nirex's contractors is of the highest quality.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B> Use of Models
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.7"></A>5.7 The Nirex programme, in common with deep disposal
programmes overseas, makes extensive use of models in its evaluation of
post-closure safety performance. Building confidence in this evaluation is to a
large degree about building confidence that the models are adequate
representations of reality. Different types of models may be identified as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>conceptual models: which represent our description of system components and
our understanding of the processes which will determine the way they will
behave;</LI>
<LI>mathematical models: in which the conceptual models are represented in
mathematical equations to permit calculations to be carried out and hence
predictions of performance to be made; and</LI>
<LI>computer models: many mathematical models are sufficiently complex that a
computer is required to carry out the necessary calculations, hence the
mathematical models are encoded for computer application.
</LI></UL>
<P> In the modelling of real world situations, simplifications are introduced
in the transition from conceptual models to mathematical models and finally to
implementation using computer codes. Checks must be carried out to ensure that
these simplifications do not make the models inappropriate for their intended
use.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para5.8"></A>5.8 The use of models to describe the behaviour of a
system is commonplace in modern development of technological systems and
assessment of their safety. Use of a model is particularly appropriate where a
similar system is not already in operation, or where an experiment cannot be
carried out which directly reproduces the system and behaviours of interest; in
this case a repository and its behaviour  over many thousands of years. It is
important that the models are tested to check that they adequately describe the
way components of the system behave. This is the process of model validation
which involves the systematic comparison of model predictions with independent
field observations and experimental measurements. 
</P>
<P>5.9 Model development and validation is an iterative process in which models
are developed on the basis of observations and understanding of the relevant
physical and chemical processes. Predictions of independent observations and
experimental measurements are then made, and the comparison of predictions and
observations used to refine the models or to discriminate between different
models of a particular system. As explained at Section 6 below, the RCF has an
essential role in validating models used in the assessment of the post-closure
safety performance of a repository at Sellafield as it can provide information
on the geology and hydrogeology which cannot be obtained from the surface. 
</P>
<P>5.10 Consideration has been given internationally to whether sufficient
confidence can be developed in the evaluation of the post-closure safety
performance of underground repositories. In 1991, the inter-governmental
Organisation for Economic Co&#173;operation and Development ('OECD') published a
collective opinion of the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the OECD
Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Radioactive Waste Management
Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This
covered the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste
disposal practices and concepts (<I>Can Long Term Safety Be Evaluated? An
International Collective Opinion</I>) (pages 6 and 7) [NRX/13/1]. (The opinion
was also endorsed by the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field
of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities.) 
In their collective opinion, the two international bodies confirmed that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate
adequately the potential radiological impact of carefully designed radioactive
waste disposal systems on humans and the environment.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> They also considered:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with
sufficient information from candidate disposal sites, can provide the technical
basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a
satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="NeedForRCF"></A><B>6. THE NEED FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P><B> Results So Far
</B>
</P>
<P>6.1 Results of the investigations to date show that the characteristics of
the site are broadly as envisaged in 1989 when the site was selected for
detailed geological studies, but that we now have a much more detailed picture
of the site than then existed.
</P>
<P>6.2 In particular, evaluation of the post-closure safety performance of a
repository at Sellafield has provided a much improved understanding of the
factors influencing performance. On the basis of that understanding, the
following are identified as key factors in ensuring the safe disposal of
radioactive waste:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow through the repository which is sufficiently low to enable
the physical and chemical barriers to retain short-lived and most long-lived
radionuclides; and</LI>
<LI>sufficient subsequent dilution of those residual radionuclides that are
released from the vaults in order to limit concentrations in groundwater
reaching the surface.</LI></UL>
<P>6.3 Results so far from the Site Characterisation Programme indicate that
the flow of groundwater through the potential repository host rock, the
Borrowdale Volcanic Group ('BVG'), is low and flow is predominantly through
networks of connected fractures, rather than the intact rock. As indicated in Dr
Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>, para
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.21">5.21</A>) models of flow currently
predict a most probable value for flow of 140 m&#179; per year through a
repository located in the BVG.
</P>
<P>6.4 In contrast to the low rates of flow in the BVG, the results of the Site
Characterisation Programme indicate high flow towards the sea in the upper parts
of the overlying sedimentary rocks. Any radionuclides dissolved in groundwater
emerging from the BVG would therefore be diluted by much higher flow of water in
the overlying rocks. As indicated in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
para <A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#Para5.32">5.32</A>) current models predict a
most probable value of dilution of around 2000 : 1 for those radionuclides which
determine peak risks up to 1 million years after closure of the repository.
</P>
<P>6.5 Dr Hooper's evidence presents a preliminary evaluation of the
post-closure safety performance of a repository at Sellafield based on our
understanding of site characteristics. He shows that, if the assumptions
underlying the predicted flows and dilutions identified at 6.3 and 6.4 above
were confirmed or shown to be unduly conservative by the RCF, and taking into
account our current view of other factors influencing repository performance, a
repository could be developed at Sellafield which would meet regulatory
requirements. 
</P>
<P><B> Remaining Uncertainties
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.6"></A>6.6 Three key areas of uncertainty nevertheless
remain which must be addressed before a decision can be made whether to propose
development of a repository at Sellafield and to obtain regulatory approval to
start disposal operations if a repository is constructed.  The information
needed to address these areas can only be gathered from the RCF.  They are as
follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>groundwater flow and radionuclide transport;
</LI>
<LI>natural and induced changes to the geological barrier; and
</LI>
<LI>design and construction of the repository.</LI></UL>
<P>6.7 The main purpose of the RCF is to provide information to address these
uncertainties that cannot be obtained from surface-based investigations. In
addition, it would provide information that can be collected more effectively
from underground investigations than from the surface. For example, it is now
considered that information on the spatial variability of the rock in the
Potential Repository Zone ('PRZ'), previously planned to be acquired by drilling
boreholes PRZ 6 to 10 (<I>Nirex Report 325)</I> (pages 1&#173;2 and Figure 7)
[NRX/13/2], can be gained more effectively by underground drilling from RCF
galleries. This would avoid the need to create five new drilling pads.    
</P>
<P> Groundwater Flow and Radionuclide Transport
</P>
<P>6.8 Models of groundwater flow through the PRZ and surrounding rocks used in
the evaluation of post-closure safety performance are based on information
generated by the Site Characterisation Programme. These models need descriptions
to be developed of the networks of connected fractures thought to have lengths
up to hundreds of metres, which control the flow. Such descriptions currently
must be based on observations of fracturing and in-flows in boreholes, with
borehole cores typically 100 mm in diameter, augmented by remote sensing
techniques such as seismic surveys, which give less precise information than
direct observation, and hydraulic testing in the boreholes.  Because of the
limitations of these observations, important judgements have to be made to
provide these descriptions.
</P>
<P>6.9 In the preliminary evaluation of post-closure safety performance
described in Dr Hooper's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/15</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx15/nrx15.htm#RepositoryPerformance">Section 5</A>), such
judgements were applied in arriving at a description of the networks of
connected fractures considered to best represent the information available.
However, given the limitations of available information, it was recognised that
other descriptions implying significantly higher flows and lower dilutions,
albeit improbable, could plausibly be developed. Dr Chaplow describes the
information provided by the Site Characterisation Programme, subsequent to
carrying out of this preliminary evaluation (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GEOLOGICAL">Sections 5</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#GROUNDWATER">6</A>) which has added to confidence
that the site at Sellafield offers a stable setting able to perform the two key
functions identified at paragraph <A HREF="#Para4.6">4.6</A> of this evidence.
But neither this information, nor any which could be gathered from further
surface-based investigations, overcomes these limitations.
</P>
<P>6.10 We need to acquire information that will allow us to test our
judgements on, and firm-up on our descriptions of, the networks of connected
fractures in the BVG and overlying sedimentary rocks, in particular their
lengths, widths, frequency and ability to allow water to flow. This will allow
us to narrow the range of predictions of flow and dilution, and to apply models
of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport with confidence across the PRZ
and surrounding rocks.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.11"></A>6.11 The RCF will enable us to overcome limitations
of surface-based investigations by providing direct access to a large volume of
rock and by allowing us to investigate on lengthscales of tens and hundreds of
metres the networks of connected fractures.  We will also be able to make direct
observations in three dimensions rather than in essentially one dimension in a
borehole. The ways in which the RCF enables us to overcome the limitations are
as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We can examine and test the network of connected fractures in detail where
they are exposed on the walls of the shafts and galleries (for example 5 metre
diameter shafts provide direct observations at 50 times the lengthscale of the
100 mm cores obtained from boreholes). We can observe continuity between shafts
and drill out from the shafts and galleries to intersect and test networks of
connected fractures at distances of tens and hundreds of metres from the shafts.
As a result we can get much better information on lengths and orientations of
fractures and their associations with particular geological features. We can
observe directly how the individual fractures are connected to each other; and
</LI>
<LI>By observing the response of groundwater pressure and chemistry in the
monitoring network to the sinking of the shafts, we get information on the
ability of the networks of connected fractures to allow water to flow which can
be related directly to the physical observations indicated above. Also we can
drill out into the networks of connected fractures and carry out controlled
experiments to test their transport properties.</LI></UL>
<P> Hence the extent to which judgements have to be made in describing the
networks of connected fractures in the models is much reduced. 
</P>
<P>6.12 This new and different information will enable our models of
groundwater flow to be tested by making predictions in advance of what we will
observe and then comparing observation to predictions. In particular, the RCF
will enable us to test the extent to which: 
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the descriptions of the networks of connected fractures (for example, their
lengths, frequency, widths and ability to allow water to flow) which form the
basis for the models match the observations; and</LI>
<LI>the models are able to predict the observed responses in the monitoring
network.</LI></UL>
<P>6.13 This testing will lead to improved understanding of the groundwater
system and to the refinement of models which can be used to make predictions
with increased confidence across the PRZ and surrounding rocks. Also, the range
of predicted flows and dilutions will be reduced by narrowing the ranges of
parameters describing the networks of connected fractures in the models, and by
eliminating models shown to be inconsistent with the data.
</P>
<P> Natural and Induced Changes to the Geological Barrier
</P>
<P>6.14 The discussion above has concentrated on our view of the way the site
currently behaves. It is important to be able to demonstrate that future
changes, which may be natural or induced by repository construction, will not
create new pathways that would result in unacceptable flows or cause damage to
the engineered barriers of the repository that would significantly impair its
ability to retain radioactivity.
</P>
<P>6.15 Dr Chaplow's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/14</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx14/nrx14.htm#NATURAL">Chapter 7</A>) summarises the results so
far on natural and induced changes. He indicates that work done to date to
examine the past history of the site as a guide to geological conditions in the
future has shown that Sellafield offers a stable geological setting. There is
good evidence to indicate that the networks of connected fractures controlling
flow in the BVG have persisted for millions of years. Further information is
needed to confirm this is so. Also, on the basis of measurements in boreholes
and on experience from other sites, we predict that excavation of the RCF or the
repository should not create new pathways that would result in unacceptable
flows. Information from the RCF programme, relating  more closely to the
lengthscales of repository construction, is needed to confirm this.
</P>
<P>6.16 Our current estimates of the disturbance caused by excavation are based
on measurements in boreholes, numerical modelling and on experience from other
sites. However, it is not possible actually to measure from boreholes the
response of the BVG rock at depth to an excavation of dimensions approaching
those of a repository. We can measure this response directly as we construct the
RCF shafts and galleries. We will be creating openings in the rock far closer to
the dimensions of the repository vaults and drifts than in boreholes, the only
'excavations' into the BVG in the PRZ so far carried out. Our confidence in our
estimates of changes induced by construction will therefore be substantially
enhanced by construction of the RCF. Also the RCF will enable us to make direct
observations of the fracturing, associated mineralisation and of the
geochemistry of the rocks and groundwater which will enable us to firm&#173;up
on our view of the history of changes in the rocks as a guide to potential
future natural changes.
</P>
<P> Design and Construction of the Repository
</P>
<P>6.17 A further consequence of the uncertainties identified above, together
with limitations of available information on the geotechnical characteristics of
the rock, is that we are not yet able to take a firm view on the benefits to be
gained from particular depths, locations, layouts and orientations of a
repository within the PRZ, because we need further information on the extent to
which varying these factors matters in terms of repository performance. 
</P>
<P>6.18 In order to take decisions on the depth, location, layout and
orientation of the repository in the PRZ, we need to establish how groundwater
flow and dilution, and the geotechnical properties of the rock, would vary with
these parameters. By enabling us to develop a much firmer view of the nature of
networks of connected fractures, and their relationships to the geology, and by
enabling us to measure how the geotechnical properties of the rock vary with
depth and location, the RCF will provide us with a firm basis for design
optimisation.

<P>6.19 It is noted that the Government expects (<I>the 1995 White Paper</I>,
para 62) [GOV/208] that for major projects:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>developers will make early application for disposal authorisations, at
about the same time that they seek full planning permission for the project,
although it would be determined separately; and<I></I>
</LI>
<LI>if the regulators are content, the authorisations could be granted
containing conditions which if met at specified stages should lead to approval

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;...<I>comment on whether or not there appears to be any impediment,
in the light of the information available to them at the time of being
consulted, to the eventual authorisation of disposal of waste of the categories
and quantities intended.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="Para6.21"></A>6.21 Nirex's working assumption is therefore that
for present purposes two key decision points can be identified in the
development of a repository as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a decision by Nirex to propose development of a repository, which will lead
to an application for planning permission to develop the repository and
possibly, at about the same time, to an application for authorisation under RSA
93; and</LI>
<LI>a decision by the regulatory authorities, after completion of repository
construction and commissioning, to approve the start of disposal operations.</LI></UL>
<P><A NAME="Para6.22"></A>6.22 A decision by the Company to propose
development of the repository must be made on the basis of confidence that
approval of disposal of wastes would be given by the regulatory authorities. In
the light of the above statements of Government policy, and draft Guidance by
the Regulators, Nirex's working assumption is that it will prepare assessments
of the post-closure safety performance of the repository for each of these
decision points. That prepared for the first decision point will necessarily be
preliminary and will be filled out and finalised to enable the regulatory
authorities to take a decision on approval of the start of disposal operations.

</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.23"></A>6.23 Hence, in respect of the three key areas of
uncertainty to be addressed by the RCF, the Company considers that the following
position needs to have been achieved before a decision could be taken to propose
development of a repository:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>We need to be confident about our ability to predict groundwater flow  and
dilution: this confidence will be derived from the underpinning of our
predictions by information from the RCF. Our predictions will also need to
demonstrate values of groundwater flow and dilution consistent with meeting
regulatory requirements for individual risk and an acceptable safety case;</LI>
<LI>We need to have established that neither construction of the repository,
nor future naturally induced changes, would result in new pathways for water
flow which would significantly impair repository performance; and</LI>
<LI>A firm basis for the optimisation of repository depth, location, layout and
orientation should be established. Decisions would have been taken on these
parameters, albeit allowing for finalisation of details in the light of
continuing investigations underground, and information obtained during
repository construction.</LI></UL>
<P>6.24 The safety assessment prepared for the first decision point will need
to address all the factors influencing the post-closure safety performance of
the repository, and will also identify specific remaining uncertainties and the
steps to be taken to resolve them. In parallel with the RCF, work will continue
in other areas of the Nirex Science Programme to develop this safety assessment.

</P>
<P>6.25 The RCF project is to be carried out in three phases; the first being
the construction of the shafts and connecting galleries and the second and third
being the construction and extension of galleries at depth in the BVG. Two
shafts are to be constructed, providing two separate exits to the surface, to
meet the safety requirements of the Mines (Safety of Exits) Regulations 1988 for
personnel working underground in Phase 2 and Phase 3. Scientific investigations
will be concentrated in the South Shaft with more limited investigations in the
North Shaft.
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.26"></A>6.26 The first phase, being the first opportunity to
carry out tests in situ and at lengthscales close to those of the repository,
should provide an important step forward in our understanding and confidence in
respect of key remaining issues. The shaft sinking phase is identified in <I>Review
of Data Requirements for Groundwater Flow and Solute Transport Modelling and the
Ability of Site Investigation Methods to Meet These Requirements </I>(Section
3.6.1, Page 116) [GOV/610] as playing a major part in the process of model
validation, allowing a large quantity of data to be collected on the rock mass
and the first opportunity to test the groundwater flow models on a large scale.
It is expected, therefore, that the four year scientific programme associated
with Phase 1 could put the Company in a position to take a decision on whether
to propose repository development.
</P>
<P>6.27 However, as with any scientific investigations, progress cannot be
planned with precision. Results from Phase 1 of the RCF could be inconclusive
and provide insufficient confidence to extrapolate models across the PRZ. In
this case, it would be necessary to carry out further investigations over more
of the PRZ using the galleries planned for Phase 2, and possibly Phase 3, before
a decision on repository development is made. A flexible approach is needed in
planning the design of Phase 2 and Phase 3 galleries so that they could permit
access to specific features of the rock, as necessary, to address specific
uncertainties which may remain in the future.
</P>
<P>6.28 The Company is planning on the basis that if it has judged the site
suitable and it decides to make a planning application at Sellafield, three
years will elapse between the making of the application and the granting of
planning permission. If a decision is made to propose development of a
repository at the end of Phase 1 of the RCF, then work would need to continue in
the RCF during this period. This further work in Phase 2 and Phase 3 would
address remaining uncertainties, probably within the framework of a plan, agreed
with the regulatory authorities, for the progressive supply of information
leading to a decision by the regulatory authorities on approval to start
disposal of wastes in the repository following its construction and
commissioning: see <I>HMIP Consultation Document </I>(paras 4.1 and 4.2, page
11) [GOV/307].
</P>
<P>6.29 Much of this test work planned for Phase 2 and Phase 3 would need to be
carried out before commencement of repository construction activity in the BVG
which would disturb the rock in the PRZ and consequently prevent good quality
data being acquired, particularly in respect of groundwater flow and
radionuclide transport. It is also planned that activities would be carried out
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the RCF, prior to repository construction activities
in the BVG, to confirm the characteristics of the rock at the proposed location
of the repository and so enable finalisation of detailed design, in particular
the layout of repository vaults. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para6.30"></A>6.30 If there were to be a hiatus in RCF activities
while the repository planning application were being determined, commencement of
repository construction activities in the BVG would be delayed by several years
following grant of planning permission for the repository.  The delay would be
increased by around three years if just one shaft had been constructed in Phase
1, as the second shaft would have to be completed before the test work and
pre-construction investigations could be commenced in Phase 2 galleries. Such
delays would conflict with Government policy (<I>The 1995 White Paper</I>)<I></I>(para
177, page 45) [GOV/208] on the repository which is that: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>...once a suitable site had been found, it should be constructed
as soon as reasonably practicable.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>6.31 Smooth continuation from Phase 1 into Phases 2 and 3 would also enable
the Company to maintain the expertise developed by the teams of scientists
working on the project.

<P><A NAME="Responses"></A><B>7. RESPONSES TO NIREX'S PLANS FOR THE RCF
</B>
</P>
<P>7.1. The need for the RCF in Nirex's programme to evaluate the suitability
of the site at Sellafield has been recognised by the RWMAC, the Royal Society
Study Group set up to review the Nirex Science Programme, and the Nirex Review
Panel.
</P>
<P>7.2 The RWMAC is the independent body that advises the Secretaries of State
for the Environment, Scotland and Wales, on civil radioactive waste management
issues. The terms of reference of the Committee are (<I>RWMAC</I> <I>Fourteenth
Annual Report)</I> (page 44) [GOV/406]: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>To advise the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland
and Wales on the technical and environmental implications of major issues
concerning the development and implementation of an overall policy for all
aspects of the management of civil radioactive waste, including research and
development; and on any such matters referred to it by the Secretaries of State.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.3 In its response to Nirex's decision to bring forward plans for the RCF (<I>Response
by the RWMAC : UK Nirex Ltd's Consultative Document on a Rock Characterisation
Facility</I>) (para 16, page 6) [GOV/408], RWMAC indicated:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>At the meeting on 2 October</I> [1992]<I> the RWMAC welcomed
these proposals, which have followed on from Nirex's decision of June 1992,
particularly in the light of the realistic approach now being adopted to the
ordering of the progressive collection and analysis of geological and
hydrogeological information essential to the robust assessment of the safety
case.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same report in describing the conclusions of a RWMAC Study Group visit
to investigations in the United States and Canada in 1992, states (para 18,
pages 6 and 7): 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>Those present on the visit returned convinced as to the necessity
for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository ahead of the
approval being sought for the construction of the repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.4 In its <I>Thirteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1993 (paras
4.27 and 4.28, page 17) [GOV/405] the RWMAC commented on Nirex's decision to
propose development of the RCF as a free-standing phase as follows:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>4.27  The RWMAC welcomes these proposals to develop an underground
RCF in order to establish the suitability, or otherwise, of the Sellafield site
with sufficient confidence, before committing to a planning application for the
repository, and also to adopt some of the principles of a 'two-staged inquiry'.
In the Committee's Eleventh Report, published in 1990, we expressed the view
that one option for the way forward in  the planning process could involve a
first stage inquiry for a deep shaft and underground exploration prior to the
submission of a full planning application for the deep repository. Nirex's plans
are now very much in line with the views expressed previously by the RWMAC.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I> 4.28  The RWMAC has visited a number of underground research
laboratories for radioactive waste management studies in different countries and
support the need for underground access to the site of a deep waste repository
ahead of approval being sought for the construction of that repository.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.5 In its <I>Fifteenth Annual Report</I> published in May 1995, the RWMAC
stated (para 4.11, page 14) [GOV/407]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RWMAC is of the view that Nirex correctly justifies the RCF as
an integral, necessary part of the overall science programme required to
establish the post-closure safety case for the repository ahead of construction.
The scope and timescale of the investigations planned are appropriate to the
status of the Sellafield project.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.6 The Royal Society Study Group was formed following an approach by Nirex
in 1993 to the Royal Society with an invitation to assemble an independent
expert group to consider and comment upon the basis and methodology for the
scientific evaluation of the long-term performance of an underground repository
for radioactive waste. Study costs were reimbursed by Nirex, but the study was
undertaken so as to ensure  independence and full control by the Royal Society.
The Study Group report published in November 1994 concluded (<I>The Royal
Society November 1994</I>) (Section 1.6, pages 6 and 7) [COR/605]:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The RCF is an essential component of the Nirex programme. Its
construction should begin as soon as is practicable, bearing in mind the need to
complete some site characterisation studies in advance of the disturbance to the
hydrogeological regime that building the RCF will cause.  International
experience shows that the RCF will need to operate for several years in order to
make a substantial contribution to PCPA's and this is a further reason why we
think the target date of 1998/9 is too early.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.7 The Royal Society Study Group also identified the major problems of
characterisation and validation to which the RCF will be able to contribute as
follows (<I>The Royal Society November 1994</I>) (Section 6.6, page 108)
[COR/605]

</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - permitting tracer tests at various scales to assist in determining
parameters for groundwater flow and radionuclide transport modelling.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> The same section of the report added:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>In addition the RCF can contribute to the assessment of the
possible side effects of repository construction on the host rock.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.8 The Nirex Review Panel comprises Professors Coward, Lloyd, O'Nions and
Sparks and was set up in 1993 to provide independent advice on the appropriate
strategy and approach for geological characterisation of Sellafield, to review
geological and hydrogeological reports prior to publication and to provide ad
hoc specialist advice. In their annual report for 1994 published in February
1995 (<I>The Nirex Review Panel Annual Report 1994</I>) (Section 3.2, page 6)
[COR/516] they conclude:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The major issues identified above and other detailed aspects of
fluid flow through fractured media cannot be adequately addressed through
observations made only at the surface or from boreholes. For these reasons the
Panel has held the view from its inception that at some stage a RCF will be
required. Without such a facility it will be impossible to make a sound safety
case.
</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The Panel is encouraged to note that the Royal Society Study Group has
endorsed the view that Nirex should proceed with the construction of the RCF.
The Panel considers that the present understanding of the Sellafield site is
sufficiently encouraging to justify a major continuation of the site
characterisation programme to include the construction of a rock
characterisation facility. We concur therefore with the Royal Society Study
Group in endorsing the Nirex strategy in this regard.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>7.9 Environmental Resources Management ('ERM'), who are advisers to Cumbria
County Council,  have expressed some reservations about Nirex's proposals for
the RCF, particularly in respect of its timing (<I>Boreholes and Rock
Laboratories to Demonstrate a Safety Case : Response to the October 1992 Rock
Characterisation Facility Consultative Document (Nirex Report 327) - Interim
Technical Report ITA/7</I>) (Executive Summary pages (i) to (v)) [COR/608].
However, in the same document they express views which are broadly in line with
those of Nirex on the need for, and role of, a RCF.  Thus in the Executive
Summary at pages (ii) and (iii):
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The regional borehole programme also has certain limitations.
These are due mainly to the fact that investigations are confined to one
dimension. Even with 20 deep regional boreholes, there are questions about scale
and three-dimensional behaviour of the rock volume that cannot be answered
satisfactorily. Nirex have submitted applications for various RCF and monitoring
boreholes (known as RCM and Potential Repository Zone or PRZ boreholes) as a
precursor stage to the RCF proper.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The term URL covers many different kinds of in-situ research and site
characterisation facilities. The UK Nirex Ltd Rock Characterisation Facility
(RCF) is, in essence, a site-specific URL, designed to investigate the
Sellafield geology and hydrogeology. URLs can provide access to the deep
geological environment, complementing the surface drilling and investigation
programme. They enable in-situ research and characterisation to take place by
allowing three-dimensional, larger volume rock analysis. The physico-chemical
conditions in URLs are generally intended to be similar to those expected in an
actual repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>There are two overall reasons for building URLs:</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>- URLs provide data to support models and performance assessment of
repositories and enable validation of those models and performance assessments.
Research in a URL is particularly valuable in developing and demonstrating the
methods, techniques and instrumentation involved in site characterisation;</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>  - URLs can be used to assess the feasibility of the construction
methods, operational details and final closure of a future repository.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>It is now generally accepted that the proper assessment of a site for
the long-term disposal of radioactive waste needs to include a stage of
underground experimentation and validation, in the form of some facility
resembling a URL.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> And at Section 4.4.5, page 43:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;<I>The biggest advantage of a RCF over the surface investigations is
the access it will give to large volumes of rock in three dimensions. Scale is
very important in rock studies. Experiments on the BVG rock to date have either
been on small cored samples or on weathered outcrops in the Lake District
further to the east. The RCF will enable Nirex to examine and experiment on
large volumes of rock under conditions that are as close as possible to those in
the repository. The opportunity of being able to work in three dimensions is
also very valuable. Although cross-borehole tests from the surface can give much
useful hydrogeological information, the amount of data is limited. (Note that
Nirex have not yet exploited the full potential for cross-borehole experiments
in their current borehole programme.)</I>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>From Nirex's point of view, an important aspect of the RCF is that a
large number of investigations can take place simultaneously under the same
roof. Deep regional boreholes only allow step-by-step testing, requiring long
time-scales to complete a whole programme. There is also a whole range of tests
that cannot be carried out from the surface - rock stress monitoring is just one
example.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>While the proposed Nirex RCF will provide access to a large underground
volume from a relatively small surface area, additional environmental impacts in
the form of monitoring boreholes will accompany the RCF proposal. There would
also be extended use for monitoring in some or all of the existing regional
boreholes.</I>&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="OtherCountries"></A><B>8. PROGRAMMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES
</B>
</P>
<P><A NAME="Para8.1"></A>8.1 While the nature of wastes, repository concepts
and host rocks being investigated vary between countries planning to develop a
deep repository for radioactive wastes, they all have in common a planned stage
of underground investigations in order to establish firmly the suitability of a
site. Additionally, some of these countries, for example Canada, Sweden and
Switzerland, have developed underground laboratories whose purpose is not to
investigate the suitability of a candidate repository site, but to develop the
techniques and methodologies for underground site investigations. Nirex
participates in, or has links with, research programmes of these 'generic'
underground laboratories. Planned programmes in other countries are outlined in
<A HREF="#Table8.1">Table 8.1</A>.
</P>
<P>8.2 Inevitably, there are significant differences between the plans of
different countries and between their regulatory and legal frameworks. However,
a number of general conclusions may be drawn as follows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>as in the UK, the programmes planned to establish the suitability of sites
in other countries comprise surface-based investigations followed by a stage of
underground investigations conducted from excavations made for the purpose;
</LI>
<LI>a stage of underground investigations is, in each country, a precursor to a
decision on whether to propose development of a repository, and is generally a
distinct and separate stage from repository construction; and
</LI>
<LI>the durations of surface-based and underground investigations planned for
Sellafield lie within the range of plans in other countries.
</LI></UL>
<P>8.3 It is therefore concluded that the proposal to carry out a stage of
underground investigations in an RCF at Sellafield prior to a decision on
whether to propose development of a repository is consistent with general
practice internationally.  Mr Folger's evidence (<B>PE/NRX/12</B>,
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#SiteSelection">Sections 6</A> and
<A HREF="../nrx12/nrx12.htm#RCFSite">7</A>) has already explained how the Nirex
approach to site selection and site investigations, including the RCF, is
consistent with IAEA recommendations for a site selection process which
culminates in a siting decision following a site confirmation stage.

Mountain in Nevada in 1991 following its designation in 1987 by Federal statute
as the candidate repository site. Construction of an underground laboratory
commenced in 1993. It is planned that this will lead to a decision on an
application for a licence in 2001 and, if this is approved, repository
construction would start in 2004, 13 years after the commencement of detailed
site characterisation.

$63,000 APPEAL

FROM:    Lawrence Turnipseed (signed 09-18-95)

RE:      Argentina - Hunger & Economic Crisis
          $63,000 Appeal

SITUATION:  Thousands of Argentine people - many of 
them Indigenous - are jobless and lack resources for 
food and other essentials as a result of a prolonged 
drought and government economic policies that are 
aggravating conditions of the poor. 

*******************************************************
*******************************************************

In Argentine suburbs, 33.8 per cent of workers either 
cannot find work or full employment.  In the country's 
northern Indigenous regions, the combined unemployment/ 
under-employment rate is 32.7 per cent. The nation's 
overall unemployment rate has almost tripled to 18.6 
per cent since 1992.

A three-month drought affecting the cotton harvest 
around Puerta Negra, El Zanjon, Pozo del Toro, Lavalle, 
Cabeza de Buey y Castelli severely reduced income of 
Indigenous workers.  In the area where malnutrition is 
prevalent and the incidence of tuberculosis is five 
times greater than the norm, they will not have the 
resources for daily living until planting resumes in 
December.

Social unrest is growing and for some, the drug trade, 
prostitution, and robbery are the only alternatives for 
survival.

*******************************************************
*******************************************************
NEEDS:  $63,000 for (1) emergency assistance including 
purchase and distribution of basic food items 
(2) agricultural development and (3) job-creation 
programs

*******************************************************
*******************************************************

CWS is responding through its Argentine partners -- the 
United Mission Board (JUM) and the Argentine Federation 
of Evangelical Churches (FAIE).

JUM - an ecumenical organization including Methodists, 
Disciples, Reformed Waldensians, and Pentecostals - is 
launching a $20,000 program among Indigenous people of 
El Chaco that includes food assistance, development of 
employment opportunities, and construction of a crop 
irrigation system.

FAIE, including historic and Pentecostal churches in 
Argentina, is implementing a $43,000 emergency 
assistance program through local churches and community 
committees.  This will encompass distribution of basic 
food stuffs (cooking oil, spaghetti, flour, milk, verba 
mate, and rice) to vulnerable people - 2,000 children, 
300 pregnant women, 200 older persons, 1,300 Indigenous 
persons.  FAIE will also seek to find longer-term 
solutions, including employment opportunities, for 
people receiving assistance.


*******************************************************
******************************************************
CHURCH WORLD SERVICE RESPONSE:  
$63,000 APPEAL

- CWS is issuing this emergency appeal for $63,000 
within the context of programs of its Argentine 
partners to address humanitarian needs of people 
affected by economic conditions in the country.

 - CWS is sending $5,000 to United Mission Board (JUM) 
and $3,000 to the Argentine Federation of Evangelical 
Churches (FAIE) from its Rapid Response Fund to provide 
immediate assistance to people in need.

*******************************************************
*******************************************************

The need is urgent. Swift action is necessary.  
Please send contributions through your communion/ 
denomination designated for this CWS emergency 
appeal #7635K or to Church World Service, P.O. Box 
968, Elkhart IN 46515.  CWS uses 100 per cent of 
all denominational contributions for assistance to 
disaster survivors.

It is important to notify the CWS Emergency 
response Office of any grants sent directly.  When 
sending funds directly, please notify the

FORMER YUGOSLAVIA - Civil Strife

Situation Report #5, Fiscal Year (FY) 1995                August 4, 1995

Note:  The last situation report was dated July 13, 1995

Background
Fighting has intensified throughout Bosnia Herzegovina (B-H) in recent
months. The Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) stepped up its shelling of Sarajevo,
halting all humanitarian airlifts and curtailing most of the humanitarian
convoys trying to supply the city.  The U.N. Protection Forces (UNPROFOR)
and the U.N. headquarters in Sarajevo also came under rocket attack by the
BSA.  In mid-June, the Bosnian Government Army (known as the BiH Army)
launched an offensive against the BSA in an effort to break the
stranglehold on Sarajevo.  In July, the BSA turned its attention to the
Muslim-populated eastern enclaves, completely surrounded by Bosnian-Serb
controlled territory.  Two of the enclaves, Srebrenica and Zepa, which had
been designated as U.N. safe areas, were overrun by the BSA in July. 
Elsewhere in B-H, the BSA, the Croatian Serb Army from the Krajina region
of Croatia, and militia loyal to renegade Muslim leader Fikret Abdic began
a coordinated attack on the Bosnian Government-defended Bihac pocket in
northwest B-H.  This action has prompted the joint attack by the Croatian
Armed Forces and Bosnian-Croat militia against Serb-controlled territory
in western B-H to alleviate pressure on the Bihac pocket.  This
intervention threatens to further escalate the conflict.    

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the lead U.N. agency
providing humanitarian assistance in the former Yugoslavia.  Units of
UNPROFOR are responsible for escorting UNHCR relief convoys in B-H.  The
U.N.'s World Food Program (WFP) coordinates food aid contributions for
beneficiaries throughout the region.  The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) carries out relief activities, as well as programs related
to detainees, missing persons, and family tracing activities.  Many
international and local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)  operating
in the region also make a significant contribution to the coordinated
relief effort. 

Numbers Affected
According to the U.N. Updated Consolidated Interagency Appeal for the
former Yugoslavia issued in late May 1995, the beneficiary population has
decreased from 2.27 million to 2.1 million.  The planning figure for B-H
and Croatia remained at 1.4 million, while the target number for the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) decreased from 350,000 to nearly 200,000.

FY 1991-1995 (to date) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$932,969,546

Current Situation       
The political, military, and humanitarian situation is changing rapidly
throughout the region.  On August 4, the war entered a new phase as the
Croatian military attacked the Serb-controlled region of Krajina, shelling
several cities inside the secessionist region of Croatia.  In July, the
eastern enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa were captured and  "ethnically
cleansed" by the Bosnian Serb Army. This action forced tens of thousands
of women, children, and the elderly from these two areas to seek refuge in
the Bosnian Government controlled towns of Tuzla and Zenica.  Fortunately,
pre-positioned food and relief supplies were available for this influx of
newly displaced persons (DPs).  UNHCR and several NGOs are providing food,
shelter, and medical care to these DPs and have already begun work on
providing more long-term shelter and assistance before the onset of winter.

In response to this new influx of DPs into central Bosnia, BHR/OFDA has
provided $7.5 million since July 11 to projects specifically addressing the
needs of the newly displaced population.  On July 17, Director of the State
Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration, Phyllis Oakley
visited Tuzla with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata,
and expressed the willingness of the USG to increase its humanitarian
assistance in response to this new population exodus.  BHR/OFDA's Disaster
Assistance Response Team (DART) has been augmented with additional
personnel to assist in the assessment and coordination of USG humanitarian
assistance. 

Although the international humanitarian community has pre-positioned
sufficient relief supplies to meet the immediate needs of the vulnerable
population in B-H, access to areas surrounded by Bosnian Serb controlled
territory remains unreliable.  The UNHCR humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo
has been suspended since April 8.  Humanitarian convoys to Sarajevo, Bihac,
and Gorazde have been reduced to a trickle.  UNHCR reported that food
shortages in Sarajevo, Bihac, and Gorazde are the worst since the war began
due to the recent hostilities and continued Bosnian Serb refusals to allow
the convoys safe access through its territory.

Political/Military Situation
The fall of Srebrenica and Zepa prompted new ultimatums against the Bosnian
Serbs by the U.N. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).  A
heavily armored British, French, and Dutch Rapid Reaction Force was
deployed to reinforce and protect UNPROFOR in fulfilling its mandate.  On
July 21, the Western allies vowed that if the Serbs attacked the remaining
eastern enclave of Gorazde, NATO would respond with "substantial and
decisive" airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets.  On July 31, NATO stated
that it would also retaliate with airstrikes in response to attacks on the
other safe areas of Bihac, Sarajevo and Tuzla.  The U.N. Secretary General
has delegated the authority for such an operation to the UNPROFOR senior
military commander. The new command-and-control procedure provides for a
more robust and streamlined response to Serb provocations.      

The Bosnian Serbs appear, perhaps for the moment, to be unwilling to test
the NATO ultimatum on Gorazde, but have launched an assault on the pocket
of Bihac in far northwestern B-H. They have been joined by the Croatian
Serb army that controls the Krajina region of Croatia and militia loyal to
the rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic.  The Bosnian Government 5th Army
Corps is defending the pocket against the concerted attack. Meanwhile, the
Croatian army and the Bosnian Croat militia have captured Serb-held
territory in southwestern B-H. This advance is designed to counter the Serb
attack on Bihac and may also serve to threaten Knin, the capital of
Croatian Serb territory in the Krajina.

This recent activity marks the most recent military intervention by the
Croatian military since May 1 when several thousand Croatian Army forces
recaptured Serb-held areas of Sector West in the Western Slavonia region
of Croatia.  In retaliation to the attack, Croatian Serb forces launched
rockets on Zagreb on May 2 and May 3, killing at least 6 and wounding an
estimated 200 civilians in the Croatian capital.

Relief Efforts
The humanitarian crisis in B-H is characterized not by a lack of food or
supplies, but by a lack of access.  Convoys delivering food and supplies
to destinations that must transit Serb-controlled territory are subject to
attack or denied safe passage by Bosnian Serb authorities.  UNHCR continues
to supply towns in central B-H where convoys do not have to transit Bosnian
Serb controlled territory.  Sufficient quantities of food and relief
supplies are stocked in UNHCR warehouses, waiting for successful delivery
to affected areas. To meet the needs of the new DPs arriving from
Srebrenica and Zepa, convoys and cargo flights brought supplies from U.N.
warehouses in Split and Metkovic, Croatia to Tuzla and Zenica, B-H.

UNHCR has recently revised its monthly distribution targets to consist of
approximately 16,000 MT of food and 178 MT of non-food relief commodities
(primarily blankets, plastic sheeting, water containers, hygiene items, and
medical supplies) delivered by humanitarian convoys.  Despite increased
access to central Bosnia, only a minimal number of convoys have reached
other areas, such as Bihac, Gorazde, and Sarajevo.  Due to the increasingly
precarious security situation, UNHCR has dramatically reduced its staff in
its offices in several areas of B-H.

Situation by Region
Eastern Enclaves:  With the fall and ethnic cleansing of Srebrenica and
Zepa, almost the entire beneficiary population has been moved to displaced
settlement areas in Tuzla and Zenica.  BiH soldiers and young males
detained by the invading BSA forces are being held in detention camps in
nearby Serb-controlled towns. As of August 1, the ICRC has not been
permitted access to detention camps holding the prisoners of war. 
Residents fleeing Srebrenica, UNPROFOR soldiers, and other observers have
reported witnessing atrocities and executions of Bosnian Muslims by the
Bosnian Serb Army.  

During the last week of July, two UNHCR convoys carrying approximately 240
tons of food arrived in Gorazde.  These were the first convoys to arrive
in more than a month. The 65,000 Muslim residents of Gorazde are suffering
from acute shortages of food, medicine, and other supplies.  Only a limited
number of residents in the town have rationed access to running water or
electricity.

Central Bosnia:  Conditions in central B-H are better than other parts of
the country due to regular access of humanitarian deliveries to vulnerable
populations.  The city of Tuzla's population has swelled to over 250,000,
not counting the recently arrived DPs that fled from Srebrenica.
Approximately 20,000 of these DPs are housed in collective centers and
about 3,000 have moved in with friends and relatives in private homes, but
as many as 6,000 women, children and the elderly have been forced to live
in makeshift shelters at the Tuzla airport.  UNHCR and NGOs are providing
food, shelter, and sanitation facilities to these DPs.  Plans are underway
to relocate most of the DPs living at the airport to more secure and
accessible areas.  The U.N. has established a helicopter airbridge to ferry
food and relief supplies from 
Split, Croatia to Tuzla.

Expelled and wounded residents of Zepa were taken by bus to Sarajevo or to
the central Bosnian town of Kladanj for onward movement to reception
centers in Zenica.  UNHCR is identifying housing and shelters in Zenica for
evacuees from Zepa and Srebrenica. Additional food and relief supplies are
also being delivered to Zenica for the new DPs.  The estimated 611,000
beneficiaries living in Zenica are still dependent on international food
assistance.   

Sarajevo:  Only 13 percent of food needs were met in Sarajevo in June. 
Cases of anemia, the result of an iron-deficient diet, have been reported
on the increase.  For the first time in over a month, UNHCR convoys arrived
in Sarajevo on July 21-22, delivering 1,458 MT of food aid to the
population.  The BSA is insisting that a portion of the food commodities
destined for Sarajevo be diverted to Serb-controlled areas.  On July 22,
a U.N. convoy escorted by UNPROFOR was shelled by BSA forces outside of
Sarajevo and two UNPROFOR French Battalion soldiers were killed.
   
The Sarajevo airlift of humanitarian relief supplies has not resumed since
April 8 when a U.S. cargo aircraft was hit several times by small arms
fire.  Since then, the Bosnian Serbs have refused to guarantee the safety
of the aircraft, thereby denying Sarajevo the primary means of delivering
aid to the besieged city.  According to UNHCR, the recent military activity
on the ground makes the resumption of the airlift in the near future very
unlikely.

To further strangle the city, the Bosnian Serbs cut off the supplies of
natural gas, electricity, and water at the end of May.  In the city center,
"unprotected" shops and markets have been closed since early June when the
city government ordered them shut due to security reasons.  The 10 megawatt
electric transmission cable, funded by the Soros Foundation and BHR/OFDA,
has served as the primary source of electricity for the city.  The cable
runs over Mt. Igman through the tunnel under the airport and into Sarajevo,
providing power on a priority basis to operate the water pumping stations,
hospitals, and government facilities.  In addition, the city government is
also providing electricity to domestic users nightly on a rotating basis. 
  

Bihac:   Less than 15 percent of food assistance needs have been met in
Bihac over the past year, leaving the vulnerable populations in the enclave
at risk of starvation.  Virtually no food aid stocks remain in warehouses
and the estimated 180,000 people living in the pocket are the most at-risk
population in B-H.  Both ICRC and UNHCR have had difficulty in gaining
access to the Bihac pocket and the last UNHCR convoy arrived on July 12 and
its small quantity of food was distributed immediately.  No humanitarian
supplies have been delivered since the recent intensification of fighting
around the Bihac pocket.

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance
So far in FY 1995, the USG has provided over $152 million for humanitarian
programs in the former Yugoslavia through USAID, Department of State, and
Department of Defense programs.  

USAID/BHR/OFDA Assistance
During FY 1995 to date, USAID/BHR/OFDA has provided over $32 million to
implement 40 humanitarian relief programs implemented by 18 NGOs in the
Former Yugoslavia.  BHR/OFDA continues to address the needs of vulnerable
groups throughout the region through the funding of NGO projects in
emergency feeding programs, health care, winterization programs, water and
sanitation, and seeds and tools distribution.     

BHR/OFDA obligated funding includes the following:
*    International Rescue Committee umbrella grant for relief programs in
     B-H. 
*    Action Internationale Contre La Faim (AICF)/USA spring seeds
     distribution in B-H, provision of hot meals for vulnerable persons in
     Mostar and Zenica, emergency supplemental food distribution in Bihac,
     and assistance to collective centers in Sarajevo.
*    American Red Cross food distribution activities in B-H.
*    Brother's Brother feeding programs for displaced persons in Osijek.
*    Catholic Relief Services production and distribution of underwear in
     B-H, hospital sanitation in Kosovo, and solid waste collection, spring
     seeds distribution, and senior citizen assistance activities in
     Sarajevo.
*    Equilibre transport of relief assistance in B-H.
*    Feed the Children/UK food distribution in B-H.
*    International Medical Corps immunization services in central B-H.

     programs in Kosovo.
*    The Open Society Institute emergency electricity services in Sarajevo.
*    Premiere Urgence for food distribution to the elderly in Mostar. 
*    St. David's Relief livestock support activities in central B-H.
*    World Health Organization nutritional study in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and
     Zenica. 
*    Solidarities continued rehabilitation activities and food and hygiene
     parcel distribution program.

In addition to its obligated funding, BHR/OFDA is currently in the process
of providing $7.5 million to NGOs to support additional emergency relief
activities.  

BHR/OFDA dispatched the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Zagreb
in December 1992.  The DART also operates sub-offices in Split, Croatia and
Sarajevo, B-H.  Among its responsibilities, the DART manages BHR/OFDA's
humanitarian assistance programs and monitors the distribution activities
of UNHCR, NGOs, and international donors.  In January 1994, BHR/OFDA's DART
in Zagreb established a Rapid Response Fund (RRF) to enable it to respond
as quickly as possible to the changing humanitarian needs in the former
Yugoslavia. Thus far in FY 95, the DART's RRF has made available $900,000
to fund small-scale, emergency relief activities carried out by
international and local NGOs.

The DART also provides assistance in calling forward emergency relief
supplies from BHR/OFDA's permanent stockpile in Leghorn, Italy.  To date
in FY 1995, $790,350 worth of emergency stockpile items have been delivered
to the region.

126,400 MT of lentils, cornmeal, beans, rice, peas, vegetable oil, wheat,
and wheat flour valued at approximately $58 million to programs in the
former Yugoslavia.  This assistance has been provided to WFP, Catholic
Relief Services, and the American Red Cross.     

Since June 1995 BHR/FFP has scheduled the incremental delivery of a total
of approximately 70,000 MT of wheat flour through October 1995.  These
allocations meet 60 percent of the flour requirements for B-H for the last

NORTHERN IRAQ - Displaced Persons

Situation Report #4 (FY 1995)                            August 11, 1995


Note: The last situation report was dated April 26, 1995.

Background 
For Iraqi citizens living in the three northern governorates (Dohuk,
Erbil, and As Sulaimaniya) and the rest of Iraq, humanitarian conditions
remain precarious.  The Government of Iraq (GOI) continues to refuse to
comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), which
were enacted in response to Iraqi aggression in Kuwait, its repression
of civilian populations inside Iraq, and Iraq's efforts to develop
weapons of mass destruction.  In violation of UNSCR 688, which demands
the GOI afford immediate, unrestricted access by humanitarian workers to
all those in need of assistance, the GOI has harassed, threatened, and,
in some cases, killed relief workers, attacked relief convoys, as well
as diverted humanitarian aid to its own supporters.  The GOI has also
refused to implement UNSCRs 706 and 712, which would allow Iraq the one-
time sale of oil to purchase food and other humanitarian goods.  The
GOI's failure to take advantage of these provisions has significantly
contributed to a decline in health and socio-economic conditions among
the civilian population in Iraq.  Given the GOI's failure to comply with
these and other UNSCRs, the U.N. has refused to lift economic sanctions
imposed by UNSCR 661 against the GOI, including a ban on all Iraqi
exports and imports, except for food, medicine, and other essential
needs of its population.  On April 14, 1995, the U.N. Security Council
unanimously adopted Resolution 986, which offered the GOI another
opportunity to export a limited amount of oil in order to finance the
purchase of humanitarian goods for northern Iraq.  It was summarily
ignored by the GOI as an interference in Iraqi domestic politics.

Since 1991, the GOI has imposed an embargo on the north that restricts
the flow of basic commodities (fuel, food, medicines) and essential
services.  The lack of an assured source of energy has limited urban
growth, employment, and light industry.

Numbers Affected 
According to the U.N., of a population of 3.7 million in northern Iraq,
1.25 million people are dependent on some form of humanitarian
assistance.  Due to lack of contributions, the U.N. World Food Program
(WFP)  reduced the number of beneficiaries from its original plan of
750,000 year round to 750,000 beneficiaries during the winter months
(November-March) and 350,000 beneficiaries during the summer months
(April-October). There are approximately 650,000 displaced persons in
northern Iraq, of whom 230,000 are unable to return to their place of
origin for fear of retribution.  This group includes those who have fled
from nearby cities still within GOI control, from Iran, and from
insecure border areas with Turkey and Iran.  Within the northern
governorates, there are approximately 13,000 Turkish Kurd asylum seekers
and 3,500 Iranian Kurd refugees.

FY 1995 to date. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$2,545,253

Current Situation 
On July 12, 1995, the Government of Turkey (GOT) confirmed that all
Turkish troops had completed their mission against the Kurdish Workers
Party (PKK) and had withdrawn from northern Iraq.  This marked the end
of the GOT's operations in Iraq which began on March 20, 1995, ended
briefly approximately one month later, and resumed again in early July. 
The military operations were an effort to wipe out what the GOT claimed
were PKK staging bases for operations against the GOT in southern
Turkey.  The fighting displaced approximately 500 families who were
living in resettlement projects near the Iraq-Turkey border and reduced
the access of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Turkish military
occupied areas.

Traffic delays caused by GOT military operations at the Habur Gate
border crossing between Turkey and Iraq declined markedly after April. 
The queue of trucks waiting to cross into northern Iraq decreased after
the end of the first incursion from a length of 100 km to less than 30
km, which is relatively normal for the area. Despite this, humanitarian
shipments are still utilizing the U.N. Department of Humanitarian
Affairs (UNDHA) convoys to speed the delivery of humanitarian supplies
into northern Iraq from Turkey.

Intermittent fighting between the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) in Erbil and As Sulaimaniya
governorates continued during this reporting period.  A cease-fire
instituted in April was extended until July 15, but was broken on July
9.  The USG called on both parties to suspend fighting and both agreed
to do so in late July.  As of early August, both sides are upholding the
cease-fire.  Despite this fighting, NGOs continued operations where
possible and those that were halted due to fighting have been resumed.

On June 21 - 26, BHR/OFDA's Director, Assistant Director and the
northern Iraq Action Officer visited the region to assess the
humanitarian situation and operations of its Disaster Assistance
Response Team (DART) in northern Iraq.  The team met with
representatives of U.N. agencies, the NGO community, local authorities,
U.S. Embassy Ankara, and the U.K.'s Overseas Development Administration
(ODA.)

On July 16, Turkish asylum seekers housed in a displaced persons camp at
Feysh Khabur, near the Syrian border, were relocated to sites near Dohuk
city.  The camp was closed because it was no longer sustainable in that
location.  A local NGO, Kurdistan Reconstruction Organization (KRO), is
currently rehabilitating buildings at a site in Zawita for families and
has established a site in lower Belqas for single men.  The USG is
providing tents at both sites until permanent shelters can be built or
repaired.


Political/Military Situation 
Internecine fighting among rival Kurdish groups escalated recently,
causing problems for the efficient administration of the humanitarian
program in northern Iraq.  Both the KDP, headed by Masoud Barzani, and
the PUK, headed by Jalalis Talabani, continued to clash throughout
northern Iraq.  The most recent fighting is centered around the Balisan
and Hiran valleys in the Erbil governorate.


Relief Efforts
NGOs and U.N. agencies, in cooperation with the GOI and local
authorities, continue to implement the 1995 U.N. Humanitarian Program in
Iraq.  The program's main objective is to assist in the rehabilitation
of northern Iraq in order to restore the region's food security to
levels which existed prior to the 1987 Anfal Campaign.  Priority areas
include health needs, resettlement of displaced people, and agricultural
inputs designed to increase food security. 

The U.N. Guard Contingent in Iraq (UNGCI) is an international body
composed of soldiers predominately from European countries who protect
U.N. personnel employed in the context of the U.N.'s Humanitarian
Program in northern Iraq, as well as the property, equipment and
supplies attached to it.  The UNGCI patrol in areas of deployment,
provide escort duties to relief convoys and relief operations, and
maintain a radio-telecommunications network for the overall benefit and
enhanced security of humanitarian organizations operating in northern
Iraq.  Despite pleas from UNDHA for continued assistance for the UNGCI,
funding constraints have resulted in a decrease in force levels over the
past few months from 150 to 49 guards.  

USAID/BHR/OFDA's DART, headquartered in Zakho, has overall management of
the USG humanitarian program in northern Iraq.  The DART, consisting of
six international and over thirty local professional staff, identify
commodity requirements and program priorities, prepare grants and
contracts, monitor USG-funded projects in the field, and provide
logistics for the transportation of relief supplies.  The DART also
assists NGOs, U.N. agencies, and other organizations in developing
project proposals and developing and reviewing program requirement. 
DART offices are located in Zakho, Dohuk, Erbil, and Sulaimaniya. 

As the principal donor of humanitarian relief in northern Iraq, the U.S.
continues to play a leadership role.  (The U.S. does not fund
humanitarian programs in central and southern Iraq because of the
inability to monitor humanitarian aid and continued interference by the
GOI.)  ODA and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) are
also major donors to the humanitarian program in the north.

The unresolved fighting between the KDP and the PUK remains the largest
hindrance to the humanitarian program at this time.  While the
humanitarian effort is able to continue normally in Dohuk governorate,
the polarization of the parties along geographical lines makes
transporting humanitarian cargo into disputed areas difficult. 


Sectoral Needs
Resettlement
The focus of the U.N. plan of action is to resettle displaced urban
populations and those forcibly moved from their traditional homes into
collective villages by the GOI during the Anfal Campaign, which started
in 1987.  During the Anfal, it is estimated that the GOI destroyed over
4,000 villages, forcing approximately 800,000 people into "collective
towns." These populations currently require continuous support and are
especially vulnerable during winter months.  In addition, the United
Nations Iraq Relief Coordination Unit (UN/IRCU) continues to monitor
those Iraqis displaced by the recent GOT incursion into northern Iraq.
UN/IRCU reports 500 families were displaced by the recent Turkish
military operations in northern Iraq.

As a primary focus of the USG program in FY 1995, 70% of the USG
contribution to northern Iraq is provided for resettlement projects,
either through direct funding or the provision of construction
materials.  Resettlement activities include building shelters, schools
and clinics; repairing access roads; rehabilitating water projects and
sanitation facilities; and providing inputs for small scale agricultural
activities and livestock for especially vulnerable groups such as widows
and the handicapped.  Other resettlement activities include mine
clearing and demarcation, and education of villagers to the hazards of
mines and explosives.  

On April 10, work resumed on the FY 1994 USG-funded Shelter Now
International (SNI) resettlement project in Dohuk governorate.  The
target of this project is to construct 1,063 shelters for displaced
persons (DPs) in 18 villages.  Of these shelters, 668 have been
completed and the majority of the remainder are more than 50% complete. 
On June 30, BHR/OFDA signed a new grant with SNI for the construction of
1,027 family shelters in the Rosty Valley in FY 1995.  The Swedish NGO,
Qandil and the local NGO, Kurdistan Reconstruction Organization (KRO),
continued construction of 350 planned shelters in the Sulevani area with
DOD funds and construction materials; currently 160 have been completed.

On July 20, the German NGO Samaritan Worker's Fund (ASB) completed the
construction of 280 shelters in Erbil governorate, thus fulfilling the
goals of its project there.  Also in late July, OXFAM completed the
construction of the 500 shelters planned in the Germain area.

Fuel
Restrictions on fuel from territory controlled by the GOI remain in
effect. Diesel fuel is still readily available but benzine continues to
be halted from transhipment north by the GOI.  A lack of affordable
benzine is impacting U.N. and NGO programs which rely primarily on
benzine powered vehicles.  The DART field offices continue to distribute
benzine in support of DART operations and to NGOs implementing priority
BHR/OFDA and DOD projects.  

Electricity 
Most areas of the three governorates no longer receive an uninterrupted
supply of electricity.  Dohuk has not received electricity from the
national power grid since August 1993, affecting some 800,000 people. 
Currently, Dohuk's main source of power is derived from generators
throughout the governorate.  While some are commercially operated, most
generators in Dohuk are provided by the USG or UNICEF; these generators
are failing and require unusual and difficult-to-find repair parts.  For
approximately three months, electricity in Dohuk was supplemented by
electrical power provided by the GOT to the local governorate and to
supplement basic facilities.  However, on June 25, this power source was
cut off, placing additional burdens on the 101 already over-burdened
generators used throughout the governorate.  On July 28, GOT-provided
power was restored.  The DART is conducting an assessment of future
energy needs and the USG is working to provide six DOD excess gas
turbine generators to provide a steady source of power, lessening the
strain on the existing power grid, and thus averting major power outages
to hospitals, water systems, and other vital humanitarian operations in
Dohuk governorate.

Since August 3, 1994, the cities of Aqra and Shekan and surrounding
areas have not received electricity from the GOI.  Some generators,
originally provided to respond to the electrical cutoff in Dohuk, were
reallocated to Aqra/Shekan area, but more are needed to meet the basic
medical, water, and sanitation needs.  To further ease this situation,
the Ministry of Industry and Energy in Erbil began providing the area
with electricity on December 10.  However, this source was disrupted
when KDP-PUK fighting damaged the main lines.  Sulaimaniya is beginning
to experience some power outages due to high electricity demand.

Health
Health services remain inadequate in the northern governorates, and
serious shortages of basic drugs, medical equipment and supplies
continue.  To alleviate some of these shortages, the USG has provided
emergency shipments of drugs and other medical supplies for emergency
needs and funds NGO health care projects throughout northern Iraq.
Local and international NGOs are actively addressing the health needs of
communities in northern Iraq through the construction and maintenance of
clinics, health centers, and hospitals. The Iraqi Red Crescent Society
and Pharmacists Without Borders began providing drugs and basic hospital
supplies to several clinics and hospitals in the Dohuk governorate
during June.

UNICEF-sponsored health campaigns began in earnest during the month of
April.  The regional polio immunization campaign was held from April 11
to 17.  The anti-malarial campaign began on May 1.  Due to these annual
campaigns, positive cases of malaria and polio have decreased markedly
compared to the previous three years.  Local health officials, in
coordination with UNICEF, also conducted a survey of vitamin deficiency
in order to target at-risk populations in the northern governorates.

Food
The World Food Program (WFP) has faced continued shortages of donor food
aid throughout the spring and into the current summer season.  In May,
WFP began distributing only wheat flour and lentils, rather than its
full ration of flour, lentils, sugar, and vegetable oil.  In view of the
rapidly depleting food stocks and the fact that there was no food in the
pipeline, WFP further reduced the number of beneficiaries for the month
of June from 350,000 to 300,000 for the north, with only two items at
reduced rationscale:  5 kgs of wheat flour per person and 5 kgs of
lentils.  During the month of July, WFP provided rations to 290,995
recipients in the three northern governorates: 61,000 in Dohuk, 87,575
in Erbil, and 142,420 in Sulaimaniya.   After these food distributions,
WFP expects to be able to meet its August distribution needs with
existing stocks and projected contributions of food.  WFP is
anticipating food shipments will arrive from other donors to meet the
September food distribution.  In preparation for the winter months, the
USG-procured food for the WFP Winter Emergency Program (WEP) began to
arrive at WFP/Erbil warehouse during mid-July.

Agriculture
On April 1, the USG, the ODA, ECHO, and the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), working with local governorate agriculture
departments, instituted a pesticide campaign against the sunne bug. 
Untreated, this insect quickly infests wheat fields, causing
considerable damage to yield and quality of harvests.  The infestation
was especially heavy this year, due to the late arrival of pesticides
from the FAO and ECHO.  The campaign was completed on June 21 and
resulted in the treatment of tens of thousands of hectares of crops.  

On May 24, BHR/OFDA signed a grant with  Northwest Medical Teams (NWMT)
to continue its animal vaccination program throughout northern Iraq. 
NWMT has vaccinated goats and sheep against enterotox, intestinal
parasites, vaptocox, and sheep/goat pox.  To protect cows, goats, and
sheep, NWMT assisted local veterinarians in vaccinating the animals
against foot and mouth disease and the cattle against rinderpest.  The
program is successfully treating animals and lessening local dependence
on free vaccinations by charging nominal fees for this service.  

Education
The International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC), working with
local education officials, has completed its grant for the construction
of six schools in As Sulaimaniya governorate.  The Mines Advisory Group
(MAG) has suspended its Community Mines Awareness Program in villages in
Erbil governorate because of internecine fighting.  The MAG project in
As Sulaimaniya governorate was unaffected and continues to promote
awareness of mine dangers and provide training in mine avoidance.  

Road Repair
In May, the USG-funded SNI project completed its repair of 57 km of
access roads to the SNI resettlement project in Dohuk Governorate which
service 18 villages.  Work on the project had been halted for several
months due to the GOT military incursion.  As part of its resettlement
project in the Rosty Valley, SNI completed its assessments of the access
roads and began work on the project on July 22. The USG-supported Sediq
Weli Sindy Road Project is in the process of connecting more than 20
destroyed villages of the Sindy Tribe to the main road between the towns
of Zakho and Batofa.  As of June 22, 25 km of road had been completed. 
In Sulaimaniya governorate, DOD-funded small purchase contracts to HAD
and the local NGO, Kurdistan Villages Reconstruction Association (KVRA,)
were recently signed for the improvement of roads and bridges to improve
access to isolated villages.

Water and Sanitation
In the Dohuk governorate, two of Qandil's 14 water projects were
completed in June.  In Erbil, the British NGO, Iraq Trust (IT),
continued its work on the rehabilitation of two wells and the
installation of four water and sanitation systems in three villages. 
Also in Erbil, the French NGO, Aide Medicale Internationale (AMI),
completed its $1.4 million well project in Kaulan Village.  Eight other
DOD-funded water and sanitation projects throughout Erbil have been
completed recently.  The projects were carried out by the German NGO
Help.  In Sulaimaniya governorate, Global Partners (GP) completed
drilling two wells which will service 137 families recently resettled by
OXFAM in the Germain area.  Throughout the governorate, six different
NGOs are actively working on eight water sanitation projects which
benefit more than 1,900 individuals and approximately 2,100 families. 

Assistance Provided by the USG
The USG has been in the forefront of the humanitarian relief effort for
northern Iraq since the initiation of Operation Provide Comfort (OPC) in
April 1991. The combined total USG contribution for FY 1991 to 1994
exceeded $335 million in direct relief to the northern governorates,
plus the initial cost of OPC.  In FY 1995, BHR/OFDA has awarded grants
to Global Partners, SNI, and NWMT.


FY 1995
On October 1, 1994, Robert H. Pelletreau, the Assistant Secretary of
State for Near Eastern Affairs, declared that a disaster continues to
exist in northern Iraq, thereby warranting continued USG assistance
during FY 1995.  (DOD allotted $30 million from its FY 1995 humanitarian
budget for use in northern Iraq.)

  ACTIVE.

  2.     IN THE GANGES BASIN, ALTHOUGH THE RISING TREND OF THE RIVERS
  HAS  SLOWED  DOWN AT ALL POINTS, THE SITUATION IN THE LOWER PART OF

  CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE SLOWLY AND NO IMPROVEMENT IS EXPECTED SOON.

  TARAGHAT  AND  KALIGANJ/DHALESHWARI AT NARIANGANJ ARE FLOWING ABOVE
  DANGER  LEVEL.  THIS  IS DUE TO PASSING OF EXCESSIVE WATER FROM THE
  UPPER   BRAHMAPUTRA  TOWARDS  THE  DOWNSTREAM.  THE  INCREASE  WILL
  CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS THUS FURTHER INUNDATING NEW AREAS.

  5.      THE  UPDATED  DAMAGE  REPORT  (AS  OF  0800 HRS OF 17 JULY)

  SITUATION.  IT  WAS  STATED THAT THE EARLY FLOODS IN THE MEGHNA AND
  BRAHMAPUTRA BASIN WERE THE RESULTS OF HEAVIER THAN NORMAL MONSOONAL
  RAIN  ALL  OVER  THESE  BASINS  COMBINED  WITH ONRUSH OF WATER FROM
  INDIA. THE GANGES BASIN (RAJSHAHI DIVISION) WILL EXPERIENCE SIMILAR
  RAINFALL  IN  NEXT 3-4 WEEKS. CONSIDERING THE RAINFALL DISTRIBUTION
  PATTERN,  IT WAS PREDICTED THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SYNCHRONIZATION OF
  BRAHMAPUTRA AND GANGES FOR A SHORT DURATION BUT ITS CONSEQUENCE MAY
  NOT BE SO DISASTROUS.

  NATIONAL RESPONSE

  6.      THE  GOVERNMENT  HAS FURTHER INCREASED THE SUPPLY OF RELIEF
  ASSISTANCE  THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT AND RELIEF.
  NGOS  (PARTICULARLY CARE, RDRS, MSF) AND UN AGENCIES (MAINLY UNICEF
  AND WHO) HAVE ALSO GEARED UP ASSISTANCE.

  7.     THE OVERALL HEALTH SITUATION IS NOT ALARMING AND NO OUTBREAK
  OF  DIARRHOEA/MALARIA HAS BEEN REPORTED BY WHO  OTHER THAN SPORADIC
  OCCURRENCES.  WHO  HAS INCREASED THE SUPPLY OF ORS, WATER PURIFYING
  TABLETS  AND BLEACHING POWDER. ADDITIONAL 5 MILLION WATER PURIFYING
  TABLETS HAVE BEEN ORDERED BY WHO.

  8.      THE ASSOCIATION FOR DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (ADAB) HAS MADE AN
  ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL SITUATION. ON THE BASIS OF THE REPORTS OF
  ASSESSMENT,  RELIEF  DISTRIBUTION  WORKS  HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE
  NGOS  WORKING  UNDER  ADAB  AUSPICES.  IN  ITS  ROLE  AS  THE  MAIN
  COORDINATOR,  ADAB  IS  EXPECTED  TO  FURTHER  REVIEW THE SITUATION
  SHORTLY.

  7.      AS  YET,  NO  REQUEST FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE
  GOVERNMENT  HAS  BEEN  RECEIVED.  DHA/UNDP  RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE
  CONTINUES TO MONITOR SITUATION.

RWANDA - Civil Strife/Displaced Persons
Situation Report #6 Fiscal Year (FY) 1995          July 24, 1995

Note:  The last situation report was dated June 13, 1995.  New
information has been underlined.

Overview
On April 6, 1994, President Habyarimana of Rwanda and President
Ntaryamira of Burundi were killed when their plane crashed while
approaching the airport in Kigali, Rwanda's capital.  After the crash,
government forces and bands of armed militia known as Interahamwe
immediately launched a campaign of genocide against the Tutsi
minority, moderate Hutus, and others who opposed the Hutu political
extremists.  Although the exact death toll may never be known, it is
estimated that as many as 500,000 Rwandans, most of them Tutsi, were
killed between April and July.  The international community was absent
during this period, having been evacuated by mid-April.  The Rwandan
president's death and the ensuing outbreak of violence ruptured the
fragile Arusha peace accord signed in August 1993 between government
forces and the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and sent
hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing to neighboring countries. 
In July, the RPF drove government forces out of Kigali and from their
stronghold, the northwest, causing an additional 1 million people to
flee into eastern Zaire in less than five days.  Refugees arrived in
Zaire without adequate food, water, or shelter.  In Goma, Zaire, an
outbreak of cholera claimed the lives of tens of thousands of
refugees, mostly children, before international relief organizations,
assisted by the U.S. military, established potable water systems that
brought the epidemic under control by mid-August.  Following the
announcement of a unilateral ceasefire on July 20, 1994, a new
Government of Rwanda (GOR) was installed in Kigali, headed by
President Pasteur Bizimungu, Prime Minister Faustin Twagiramungu, and
Vice President/Minister of Defense Paul Kagame.  In August 1994,
additional U.N. Assistance Mission In Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeeping
forces were deployed to Rwanda to assist humanitarian operations and
protect the internally displaced persons and civilians at risk. 
UNAMIR's mandate was expanded in December 1994 to provide security to
members of the international tribunal, human rights observers, and to
assist in establishing and training a new integrated national police
force.  At present there are more than 5,500 UNAMIR personnel in
Rwanda.  UNAMIR's current mandate expires on December 9, 1995, by
which time the UNAMIR presence will be reduced to 1,800 troops, 320
military observers as well as additional support staff.  

Prior to April 6, Rwanda was the most densely populated country in
Africa.  It is the size of the state of Maryland and had a population
of 8.1 million people.  The population was comprised of 14% Tutsi, 85%
Hutu, and 1% Twa before the war.  Since it gained independence from
Belgium in 1962, Rwanda has been fraught with tragic periods of
politically motivated ethnic violence that has claimed the lives of
thousands of people, however the recent genocide experienced by Rwanda
is unprecedented.

Numbers Affected
As of June 28, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) reports there are approximately 1.9 million Rwandan refugees
in the following countries: Zaire - 1.1 million; Tanzania - 608,700;
Burundi - 200,000; Uganda - 4,000.  These numbers do not reflect the
more than 5.5 million persons inside Rwanda who have been affected by
the violence and its aftermath.

Current Situation
On July 4, the anniversary of the RPF's capture of Kigali was
celebrated at the National Stadium.  On July 6-7, the GOR and members
of the international community met in Kigali as a follow-up to the
January 1995 Geneva Round Table.  Out of the $568 million that was
pledged in January, only 16% has been committed. The meeting in Kigali
provided a forum to discuss Rwanda's most urgent needs and a sectoral
action plan was prepared by the GOR.

On April 22, 1995, violence erupted at Kibeho internally displaced
persons (IDP) camp.  The GOR's decision to close the eight remaining
IDP camps followed several months of attempts to peacefully close the
camps through coordinated efforts with the international community,
notably through Operation Retour.  According to both the GOR and the
international community, the camps--Kibeho specifically--served as
havens for Interahamwe activity, thereby posing a threat to the GOR
and to the security of the country.

The April 22 violence was the culmination of a series of incidents
that began on April 17, when the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) began
closing the existing IDP camps and surrounded the largest camp,
Kibeho.  Sporadic gunfire subsequently broke out in the camp during
the morning of April 18, resulting in the death of 8 to 11 children. 
On April 19, the RPA Chief of Staff and the UNAMIR Deputy Force
Commander visited Kibeho to explain to the IDPs that the camp was
being closed.  Many IDPs indicated that they were willing to go home,
however the slow registration procedure and the lack of transport
hindered their prompt return.  In the meantime, the RPA limited the
deliveries of food, water and general facilities to serve as an added
incentive for the IDPs to return home.  The onset of rains on April 20
affected road conditions, further obstructing the IDPs' return to
their homes and contributing to poor sanitary conditions in the camp.

Up until April 22, witnesses report that, in general, there was no
intimidation or violence directed at the IDPs by the RPA, nor
hostility by the IDPs towards the RPA except for isolated incidents. 
Hostilities did exist among the IDPs, however.  On April 22, the
situation came to a head when a large group of IDPs broke through the
RPA-established cordon near the UNAMIR Zambian battalion's compound. 
Fighting broke out between RPA forces and IDPs, and both sides
suffered numerous casualties.  Shortly thereafter, another group of
IDPs broke through the cordon and ran out of the camp, reportedly
wielding rifles, machetes, and stones.  The RPA responded by firing
into the crowd with automatic rifles and machine guns.  In the ensuing
mayhem, many of the camp's 100,000 inhabitants were trampled to death
or suffered injuries from machetes and weapons fire.  The estimates of
the death toll from the Kibeho incident vary: the U.N. estimated 2,000
dead, while the GOR reported approximately 300 IDPs dead.

The IDPs who broke out of the camp left by foot for the stadium in
nearby Butare town, where they awaited transport to their home
communes.  However, approximately 2,000 IDPs remained holed up in the
Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) hospital in Kibeho camp without food,
water or proper sanitation for several days until they agreed to leave
the camp with the assistance of the International Committee for the
Red Cross (ICRC) to return to their homes.

In response to widespread criticism of the RPA's actions, the
President of Rwanda established an International Commission of Inquiry
on April 27 to investigate events leading up to the camps' closures
and the RPA's actions during the incident.  Representatives from seven
countries, the U.N., Organization of African Unity (OAU), and Rwanda
participated in the investigation and their report was issued on May
18. The Commission's inquiry examined the international community's
earlier attempts to close the camps in the southwest through Operation
Retour; recognized the security threat posed by the camps' existence;
and focused on the actions of the GOR authorities, RPA forces, and
UNAMIR during the events of April 22.

Based on its investigation, the Commission "recognized the legitimate
interests of the GOR and the international community to close the IDP
camps as quickly as possible, both for reasons of national security
and in order to remove an important obstacle in the country's efforts
to recover from the devastating effects of last year's genocide."  The
Commission also concluded that, based on its investigation, the
incident in Kibeho "neither resulted from a planned action by Rwandan
authorities to kill a certain group of  people, nor was it an accident
that could not have been prevented."  However, "the operation of the
GOR to close the IDP camps was well-planned but [...] failures
occurred in the implementation and ensuing panic.  The reactions of
the RPA soldiers to the threat at that stage were disproportionate
and, therefore, violative of international law.  The RPA did not
distinguish between hostile and non-hostile targets and indiscriminate
fire by the RPA soldiers occurred.  There are credible indications
that individual RPA soldiers committed summary executions."

At the same time, the Commission also recognized the role of the
militias within Kibeho camp as a contributing factor to the April 22
violence.  The Commission found that many IDPs suffered injuries from
machetes, stampede, and weapons fire, while noting that "there is
agreement among witnesses that machetes were not used by uniformed
personnel but rather by civilians."  During its investigation of
Kibeho camp, the Commission also discovered numerous indications of
the widespread use of machetes and other traditional weapons in acts
of violence and of a number of firearms within the camp population. 
"The activities of the [militias within the camp] ranged from verbal
intimidation to physical violence and were instrumental in creating an
atmosphere of panic among the IDPs culminating on April 22."

It is the Commission's recommendation that the international community
should continue to encourage 

and assist Rwanda in its efforts to achieve justice, national
reconciliation and reconstruction.

Political/Military Situation
The latest round of violence has caused renewed concern about the
situation inside Rwanda.  The international community condemned the
killings in Kibeho and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa
George Moose voiced USG's concerns over the incident with GOR
officials during his trip to Rwanda in late April.  The Governments of
Belgium and the Netherlands announced that they would suspend
bilateral development assistance to the GOR, but continue to support
humanitarian and governance programs.   

An international tribunal has been established by the U.N. Security
Council for the prosecution of those individuals deemed guilty of
genocide.  On May 19, approximately 20 donor countries met in Kigali
and pledged $6 million--in addition to the $1.8 million already
promised--to the work of the international tribunal.  U.S. Assistant
Secretary Shattuck represented the USG at the meeting.   U.N. Human
Rights monitors have been deployed to assist the investigation of past
abuses, provide technical assistance to the justice system, and
promote the observance and respect of human rights.  BHR/Office of
Transition Initiatives (BHR/OTI) is funding a staff person to work
with the human rights operations.

The numbers of persons detained by the GOR for their alleged
participation in the genocide continues to rise.  As of May 18, ICRC
reported that there are between 43,000-44,000 detainees being held in
182 official detention centers throughout Rwanda.  This ever-growing
population further exacerbates the already overcrowded prison
conditions that persist throughout the country, resulting in a notably
high incidence of death and illness among the detainees.  ICRC, U.N.
Development Program (UNDP), and UNAMIR are working with the GOR to
plan the construction of new sites to accommodate the growing number
of detainees.  On May 26, the GOR announced that it will only detain
those who are guilty of the most "notorious" crimes, and where
irrefutable evidence is present, to avoid further overcrowding in the
scarce prison space.

Relief Efforts
The U.N's response to the crisis in Rwanda is coordinated by UNREO,
which was created on April 14, 1994, when the U.N. Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), UNDP, and other U.N. agencies decided to
coordinate their efforts to provide a comprehensive relief response in
Rwanda.  Throughout the crisis, the organization's efforts have been
fundamental in encouraging the coordination of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and their activities, as well as in developing
relationships with the GOR to formulate and implement relief in
Rwanda. Approximately 120 NGOs have applied for registration with the
GOR's Ministry of Rehabilitation, 87 of which have been approved.

Over recent weeks, security conditions for NGOs and UNAMIR personnel
working in Rwanda have deteriorated.  There have been reports of
violent armed robberies against NGO personnel, both in Kigali and
surrounding areas, by men dressed in military uniform.  Attacks have
been accompanied by death threats or threats of rape, although no
casualties have been reported to date. A number of UNAMIR personnel
have been robbed at gunpoint, and oftentimes their vehicles stolen, by
persons dressed in RPA uniforms.  Efforts are underway to resolve this
disturbing situation through diplomatic initiatives.

On May 25, 1994, BHR/OFDA deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team
(DART) to the Rwanda region, with a mandate to coordinate and
facilitate the USG's response to the humanitarian crisis in the field. 
On February 15, 1995,  the DART closed its operation in Kigali, and
passed the management of the BHR/OFDA portfolio to the USAID/Rwanda
mission in Kigali.  Two BHR/OFDA-funded field representatives are
stationed in Kigali to assist the USAID/Rwanda mission.  The field
reps have been crucial in providing regular reporting to Washington on
events in Kibeho and subsequent relief needs, and conducting
assessments of BHR/OFDA-funded NGO projects.  In addition,
State/Population, Refugees and Migration (State/PRM) fielded a
Ugandan-based refugee coordinator for the Rwanda/Burundi region in
February 1995. 

Situation by Region
Rwanda
On April 23, USAID's field representative based in Kigali travelled
with UNREO officials to Butare and the outskirts of Kibeho camp. 
Based on their trip, reports indicate that NGOs and U.N. agencies
demonstrated exemplary coordination in their response to the crisis at
Kibeho and its aftermath.  UNAMIR and IOM were responsible for
providing returnees transport to their home communes; Action
International Contre La Faim/USA (AICF/USA) and Medecins Du Monde
(MDM) provided emergency medical treatment; CARE distributed food and
water to the IDPs; and Save the Children/UK (SCF/UK) provided
assistance to the multitude of unaccompanied children.  Much of the
coordination was conducted through UNREO and the Integrated Operations
Center (IOC).  As an emergency  response measure to the IDPs' urgent
needs, BHR/OFDA funded grants with Solidarites and Feed The
Children/Europe (FTC/E) to augment food distributions to the returning
IDP population.

As of May 9, all of the IDP camps in Rwanda were officially closed by
the GOR, causing thousands of Rwandans to return to their home
communes. Many of the IDPS were forced to leave the camp without
anything; those that were able to depart with a few belongings lost
them to bandits along the way.  Some of the returning IDPs were
reportedly harassed during their return, and received an unwelcoming
reception in the home communes.

Immediate needs of the returning IDP population were identified as
medical assistance and shelter.  Many of the IDPs leaving Kibeho camp
suffered from bullet and machete wounds, dehydration, and exhaustion. 
Continual rains worsened health conditions, underlying the need for
supplies of plastic sheeting to serve as temporary shelter for the returnees.  ICRC provided the sheeting from available stocks inside
Rwanda.

The international relief community has made a concerted effort to
increase the number of expatriate personnel working in the areas of
return, to serve as deterrents to human rights abuses against the
returning IDPs.  During crisis' initial phase, efforts were undertaken
to augment the capacity of the Open Relief Centers, established during
Operation Retour, to act as intermediary transit centers for the
returning IDPs.

The gaps in the region's food pipeline in February and March that
threatened Rwanda's security have been alleviated for the next six
months.  USAID/BHR/FFP (Food for Peace) authorized the U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) to borrow 40,000 MT of corn from Malawi and Tanzania
drought emergency pipelines in order to meet the urgent Rwanda
regional needs. BHR/FFP also approved the immediate procurement and
expeditious shipment of 88,000 MT of food commodities to begin filling
gaps in the Rwanda/Burundi region beginning in April 1995.  BHR/OFDA
approved a grant to WFP for the regional purchase of 4,600 MT of white
maize, and another grant to ICRC for the regional purchase of 4,000 MT
of white maize flour.  State/PRM contributed an additional $10 million
to WFP for food assistance for refugees in the Rwanda/Burundi region.

UNHCR reports that since the civil war ended in July 1994,
approximately 600,000 "old-caseload" refugees (primarily Tutsis who
fled Rwanda in 1959-62) and their offspring have returned to Rwanda
from Uganda, Burundi, Zaire and Tanzania.  These refugees are bringing
large numbers of cattle into the eastern areas of Rwanda, upsetting
the ecology of the area, and introducing animal diseases which
threaten the region.  In addition, the influx of this returnee
population has raised serious property rights issues.  The GOR has
begun its resettlement program for the "old caseload" refugees. 
Through this program, an estimated 78,000 families are expected to be
allocated an average of 1.5 hectares per family, mostly in northeast
and southeast Rwanda.

Eastern Zaire
--Goma, North Kivu
Security conditions have reportedly improved in the Goma region,
largely attributed to the presence of UNHCR Zairian security forces
deployed to the area since February.  The number of blatant acts of
intimidation against the refugee population by the militia, former
political leaders, and ex-Armed Forces of Rwanda (ex-FAR) has
decreased.  However, there are reports that weapons are being
delivered to the area and that the ex-FAR is engaging in military
training and recruitment.

UNHCR, in conjunction with the International Organization for
Migration (IOM), organized a voluntary repatriation effort in late
1994 to facilitate the return of refugees to Rwanda.  Although the
repatriation of new refugees reached a return rate of 1,000 persons
per day in early February 1995, it has now virtually ceased, largely
due to perceptions of insecurity inside Rwanda and rumors of mass
arrests.  The violence at Kibeho further exacerbated this trend.
Meanwhile, old caseload refugees continue to return to Rwanda from
neighboring countries.

Contrary to earlier indications, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
volcanologists report that the two volcanoes in the Goma area,
Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira, do not pose any serious immediate threat
to the lives of the refugees or inhabitants of the Goma area. Since
the volcanoes do pose a very real danger to the Goma area in the long-
term, BHR/OFDA continues to closely monitor the situation in
conjunction with the USGS and is funding 16 weeks of training for a
Zairian volcanologist at the Hawaiian Observatory.

The presence of over 700,000 refugees in the Goma area has had a
devastating effect on the environment of Goma and the nearby Virunga
National Park.  Zairian authorities are attempting to mitigate further
damage by limiting the days in which refugees can collect wood, but
illegal commerce in wood continues. 

--Bukavu/Uvira, South Kivu
There are 28 relatively small refugee camps in the Bukavu area,
accommodating approximately 300,000 Rwandan refugees.  The
power/organization structures in the Bukavu camps are similar to those
in Goma, as the camps are controlled by the ex-Rwandan regime
political figures who are backed by militia groups and the ex-FAR. 
Reports indicate that the UNHCR Zairian security force in Bukavu has
improved poor security conditions that threatened refugees and relief
workers in late 1994 and early 1995.

The Rwandan refugee population in the Uvira region of South Kivu has
increased rapidly in recent weeks, largely with the arrival of
approximately 23,000 Rwandans who fled to Zaire through Burundi
following the Kibeho incident.  Relief agencies in the area are
responding to this population's humanitarian needs, although their
arrival has placed additional strains on available resources for the
South Kivu area.

Burundi
There are some 200,000 Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi, residing
in camps managed by UNHCR. Food distributions are provided by WFP. 
Following reports of attacks on March 27 against the Rwandan refugee
population, approximately 50,000 Rwandan refugees fled to the
Tanzanian border seeking asylum and safety.  On March 31, the
Government of Tanzania (GOT) officially closed its border to prevent a
massive influx into northern Tanzania.  UNHCR and NGOs succeeded in
returning the population to their camps of origin, averting a
potential humanitarian crisis.  The Burundi/Tanzania border remains
closed.  (See also USAID/BHR/OFDA Burundi situation report.)

Northern Tanzania
UNHCR reports that as of May 17, the Rwandan/Burundian refugee
population in northwest Tanzania exceeded 700,000, of which 608,200
are Rwandan. Before the GOT closed the border on March 31, Burundian
and Rwandan refugees continued to flee from northern Burundi into
camps in Tanzania in significant numbers, rendering camp conditions
unstable and placing additional strains on delivery mechanisms.

The USAID-led assessment team deployed to the Burundi region by USAID
Administrator Atwood traveled to Tanzania from April 22-27 upon
completing its work in Burundi.  Based on its assessments of the area,
the team reported that the refugee camps in northwestern Tanzania are
well run and managed by the relief community under the coordination of
UNHCR.  Health conditions are satisfactory, and the global mortality
rate is 0.7/10,000/day, with the primary cause of death being malaria
and the most common health problems being lower respiratory infections
and scabies.  The nutrition status of the refugee population surpasses
that of the local population, and malnutrition rates are below
Tanzanian national averages.  Adequate potable water is, however, a
serious problem for all the refugee camps in western Tanzania.  Water
capacity averages around 6-7 liters/person/day--below the minimum
standard for care and maintenance of refugees.  NGOs report that water
is available in the area, but it is very difficult and costly to
access.  The food situation in the Tanzania camps has, overall, been
adequate, although maintaining the food pipeline is essential and
enhancing logistical infrastructure is critical to meeting the food
needs of refugees in Tanzania and the region. 
 
Security remains a prevalent concern, with ongoing incidents of theft
and murder in the camps.  Camp leaders continue to threaten, control,
and intimidate the refugee population, hindering repatriation efforts. 
The violence at Kibeho has virtually halted the repatriation of new
caseload refugees from Tanzania to Rwanda.  Protection continues to be
a serious challenge, as the Tanzanian police are often accosted when
they attempt to enforce law and order in the camps.

USG Assistance
A disaster was declared in Rwanda in FY 94 on April 28, 1994, by U.S.
Ambassador David Rawson due to the widespread genocide and violence
that broke out following the events of April 6, 1994.  On October 7,
1994, Ambassador Rawson issued a disaster declaration for FY95,
confirming the ongoing crisis in the Rwanda region.

In response to the crises in Rwanda, the USG to date (FY94 and FY95)
has provided nearly $582.5 million to U.N. agencies, IOs and NGOs for
relief programs, in addition to deploying 2,000 troops to the region
to assist the humanitarian effort from July to September 1994.  Some
of this funding, specifically food aid and refugee assistance, has
also addressed the needs of Burundian refugees and IDPs.  (See also
USAID/BHR/OFDA Burundi situation report, March 11, 1995.)  Beginning
in late May 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) began
airlifting emergency relief supplies for U.N. agencies, ICRC, and many
NGOs.  State/PRM has allocated nearly $137 million for refugee
assistance programs in the region.  Since the beginning of the crisis,
USAID/BHR/FFP has committed over 413,000 MT of food assistance valued
at nearly $251 million  to the region.  USG humanitarian assistance to
the region has also been provided by USAID/AFR/EA and USAID/BHR/Office
of Transition Initiatives (OTI).

The GOR continues to require funding to strengthen its ministries and
bolster its capacity to govern the country.  To date, USAID/Rwanda has
committed $8.7 million from the Development Fund for Africa (DFA)
towards the physical and technical support of GOR ministries,
including improving the capacity of the Ministry of Justice. 
Commodities provided by USAID funds, such  as vehicles and computers,
are already in use by the GOR.

Situation Report #6, Fiscal Year (FY) 1995               August 15, 1995

Note:  The last BHR/OFDA situation report was dated August 4, 1995.

Background
Fighting has intensified throughout Bosnia Herzegovina (B-H) in recent
months. The Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) stepped up its shelling of Sarajevo,
halting all humanitarian airlifts and curtailing most of the
humanitarian convoys trying to supply the city.  The U.N. Protection
Forces (UNPROFOR) and the U.N. headquarters in Sarajevo also came under
rocket attack by the BSA.  In mid-June, the Bosnian Government Army
(BiH) launched an offensive against the BSA in an effort to break the
stranglehold on Sarajevo.  In July, the BSA forcibly overran the Muslim-
populated eastern enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa, resulting in
approximately 40,000 displaced persons, most of whom fled to Tuzla and
Zenica.  Elsewhere in B-H, the BSA, the Croatian Serb Army from the
Krajina region of Croatia, and militia loyal to renegade Muslim leader
Fikret Abdic began a coordinated attack on the BiH-defended Bihac pocket
in northwest B-H.  This action prompted the joint attack by the Croatian
Armed Forces (HV) and Bosnian-Croat militia (HVO) against Serb-
controlled territory in western B-H to alleviate pressure on the Bihac
pocket.

On August 4, the HV launched an offensive against Krajina Serb-
controlled territory of Croatia situated along Bosnia's border that
significantly changed the strategic balance in the war.  The Croatian
takeover of the Krajina has resulted in a dramatic increase in
humanitarian needs throughout the region when an estimated 150,000-
200,000 Krajina Serbs fled their homes and moved toward northern B-H and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).  In addition, UNHCR estimates
that 30,000 non-Serbs have been forced from their homes in Serb-held
areas such as Banja Luka and in eastern Slavonia, the U.N. Protected
Area in eastern Croatia.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the lead U.N. agency
providing humanitarian assistance in the former Yugoslavia.  Units of
UNPROFOR are responsible for escorting UNHCR relief convoys in B-H.  The
U.N.'s World Food Program (WFP) coordinates food aid contributions for
beneficiaries throughout the region.  The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) carries out relief activities, as well as programs
related to detainees, missing persons, and family tracing activities. 
Many international and local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) 
operating in the region also make a significant contribution to the
coordinated relief effort. 

Numbers Affected
According to the U.N. Updated Consolidated Interagency Appeal for the
former Yugoslavia issued in late May 1995, the beneficiary population
throughout the region decreased from 2.27 million to 2.1 million. 
However, UNHCR noted in early July that in practice, food distribution
reaches approximately 3.5 million people in the region.  In addition,
recent population movements from the eastern enclaves in B-H and the
former Krajina region of Croatia have increased the beneficiary
population requiring assistance.

Current Situation       
The political, military, and humanitarian situation is changing rapidly
throughout the region.  On August 4, the war entered a new phase when
the Croatian military attacked the Serb-controlled region of Krajina,
retaking the entire area within 5 days. As a result of the offensive,
UNHCR estimates that 150,000-200,000 Krajina Serbs fled their homes,
which marks the largest and swiftest mass exodus since the conflict in
the former Yugoslavia began.  Among the people who fled their homes, the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) estimates that 120,000
have already arrived in Serbia and Montenegro.  Approximately 50,000 are
believed to be spread across northern Bosnia in various states of
transit, particularly in the Banja Luka and Bijelina areas.  UNHCR and
ICRC are coordinating the provision of immediate humanitarian relief
items (food, medicine, and sanitation supplies) to the unsettled
refugees.  UNHCR and ICRC have begun conducting land and air deliveries
of relief assistance to the refugees and displaced persons (DPs) in
northeastern B-H, mainly via Belgrade.  Security and clearances
permitting, ICRC is also attempting to airlift urgently needed supplies
from Belgrade to Banja Luka.  Access to the refugees in Banja Luka and
northern B-H remains difficult due to road congestion, damaged
infrastructure, and the precarious security situation.  Since August 9,
BHR/OFDA and the Department of Defense's Office of Humanitarian and
Refugee Affairs (DOD/HRA) has provided 345,000 humanitarian daily
rations (HDRs) to ICRC for distribution to the refugees from Krajina.    


On August 9 and 11 respectively, BHR/OFDA's Disaster Assistance Response
Team based in Zagreb (DART/Zagreb) dispatched personnel to Knin (the
former Krajina Serb self-proclaimed capital) and Bihac to conduct
initial assessments of the humanitarian conditions in the aftermath of
the HV offensive.  Knin suffered minimal structural damage and was
nearly empty since most of its population fled the HV advance.  In
Bihac, the Muslim population had suffered from a lack of sufficient food
supply in the past months.  
            
In July, the eastern enclaves of Srebrenica and Zepa were captured and
"ethnically cleansed" by the BSA, forcing approximately 40,000 women,
children, and elderly to seek refuge in the Bosnian Government
controlled towns of Tuzla and Zenica.  Fortunately, pre-positioned food
and relief supplies were available for this influx of newly displaced
persons (DPs).  UNHCR and several NGOs continue to provide food,
shelter, and medical care to these DPs and have already begun work on
providing more long-term shelter and assistance before the onset of
winter.

In response to this new influx of refugees into northern B-H and Serbia,
the USG has provided HDRs, water storage equipment, wool blankets,
health kits, and increased funding to NGOs to address the needs of this
newly displaced population.


Political/Military Situation
On August 4-7, the Croatian offensive took nearly all of the Krajina
region, which had been considered a United Nations Protected Area since
the U.N. brokered a cessation of hostilities agreement between the HV
and the Krajina Serb forces in early 1992.  The defeat of the Krajina
Serbs has led to increased fighting in Bosnia; both the BiH and the BSA
are trying to increase their territorial control as the strategic
balance of the war has significantly changed.  As many as 20,000
soldiers are reported among the estimated 150,000-200,000 Krajina
refugees.

This recent activity marks the most significant military intervention by
the Croatian military since May 1 when several thousand Croatian Army
forces recaptured Serb-held areas of UNPA West in the Western Slavonia
region of Croatia.  In retaliation to the attack, Croatian Serb forces
launched rockets on Zagreb on May 2 and May 3, killing at least 6 and
wounding an estimated 200 civilians in the Croatian capital.

Relief Efforts
To meet the needs of the new refugees arriving from the Krajina, UNHCR,
ICRC, international donors, and NGOS are organizing land convoys and
cargo flights to transport supplies from U.N. and other donor warehouses
in the region to the refugees and DPs.  On August 11-15, UNHCR airlifted
376 MT of food and medical equipment from Ancona, Italy to Belgrade, for
subsequent ground transport to refugees. 

The humanitarian crisis in B-H is characterized not by a lack of food or
supplies, but by a lack of access.  Convoys delivering food and supplies
to destinations that must transit Serb-controlled territory are subject
to attack or denied safe passage by the warring sides.  UNHCR continues
to supply towns in central B-H where convoys do not have to transit
Bosnian Serb controlled territory.  However, a recent decrease in donor
support for UNHCR trucking costs has led to a reduction in UNHCR land
convoy deliveries.  Sufficient quantities of food and relief supplies
are stocked in UNHCR warehouses for distribution to the vulnerable
populations in the worst affected areas.  

UNHCR has recently revised its monthly distribution targets to consist
of approximately 16,000 MT of food and 178 MT of non-food relief
commodities (primarily blankets, plastic sheeting, 
water containers, hygiene items, and medical supplies) delivered by
humanitarian convoys.  Despite increased access to central Bosnia, only
a minimal number of convoys have reached other areas, such as Gorazde
and Sarajevo.  Due to the increasingly precarious security situation,
UNHCR has dramatically reduced its staff in its offices in several areas
of B-H.

Situation by Region
Eastern Enclaves:  With the fall and ethnic cleansing of Srebrenica and
Zepa, the beneficiary population has been moved to displaced settlement
areas in Tuzla and Zenica.  BiH soldiers and young males detained by the
invading BSA forces are reportedly held in detention camps in nearby
Serb-controlled towns or are missing. On August 9, the U.S. Ambassador
to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, announced that the U.S. has photos of
mass graves near Srebrenica and accused the BSA of executing 2,000-2,700
Bosnian Muslim men.  

During the last week of July, two UNHCR convoys carrying approximately
240 tons of food arrived in Gorazde.  These were the first convoys to
arrive in more than a month. The 65,000 Muslim residents of Gorazde are
suffering from acute shortages of food, medicine, and other supplies. 
Only a limited number of residents in the town have access to running
water or electricity.

Central Bosnia:  Conditions in central B-H are better than other parts
of the country due to regular access of humanitarian deliveries, and
some commercial traffic, to vulnerable populations.  The city of Tuzla's
population has swelled to over 250,000, not counting the recently
arrived DPs that fled from Srebrenica. Approximately 20,000 of these DPs
are housed in collective centers and about 3,000 have moved in with
friends and relatives in private homes. As many as 5,500 women, children
and elderly DPs remain in makeshift shelters at the Tuzla airport where 
UNHCR and NGOs are providing them food, shelter, and sanitation
facilities. 

Expelled and wounded residents of Zepa were taken by bus to Sarajevo or
to the central Bosnian town of Kladanj for onward movement to reception
centers in Zenica.  UNHCR is identifying housing and shelters in Zenica
for evacuees from Zepa and Srebrenica. Additional food and relief
supplies are also being delivered to Zenica for the new DPs.  The
estimated 611,000 beneficiaries living in Zenica are still dependent on
international food assistance.   

Sarajevo:  The Sarajevo airlift of humanitarian relief supplies has not
resumed since April 8 when a U.S. cargo aircraft was hit several times
by small arms fire.  To further strangle the city, the supply of natural
gas, electricity, and water has been cut by the Bosnian Serbs since the
end of May.  The 10 megawatt electric transmission cable, funded by the
Soros Foundation and BHR/OFDA, provides power on a priority basis to
operate the water pumping stations, hospitals, and government
facilities.

Currently, the Bosnian Serb authorities are denying adequate convoy
access to Bosnian Muslim areas of Sarajevo.  Rather than completely deny
access to Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb authorities have granted convoy
clearance only via a dangerous route subject to Serb sniping. 

Bihac:   The recent Croatian offensive resulted in the liberation of the
Bihac pocket, whose 180,000 residents had been denied adequate food and
relief supplies during the past year.  Less than 16 percent of food
assistance needs were met in Bihac, during the past year, leaving the
vulnerable population in the enclave at risk.  Several relief convoys
have been able to reach the area in the past few days.  

In Miholjski, 10 km south of Vojnic in Croatia, 20,000 Muslim refugees
(supporters of rebel Muslim leader Fikret Abdic) are stranded without a
viable place to settle permanently.  On August 13-14, UNHCR and ICRC
delivered relief items to these stranded refugees, including food,
blankets, jerry cans, water tanks, and sanitation materials.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance
So far in FY 1995, the USG has provided over $173 million for
humanitarian programs in the former Yugoslavia through USAID, Department
of State, and Department of Defense programs.  

USAID/BHR/OFDA Assistance
During FY 1995 to date, USAID/BHR/OFDA has provided over $37 million to
implement 47 humanitarian relief programs implemented by 19 NGOs in the
Former Yugoslavia.  BHR/OFDA continues to address the needs of
vulnerable groups throughout the region through the funding of NGO
projects in emergency feeding programs, health care, winterization
programs, water and sanitation, and seeds and tools distribution.     

BHR/OFDA obligated funding includes the following:
  *  International Rescue Committee umbrella grant for relief programs
     in B-H. 
  *  Action Internationale Contre La Faim (AICF)/USA spring seeds
     distribution in B-H, provision of hot meals for vulnerable persons
     in Mostar and Zenica, emergency supplemental food distribution in
     Bihac, and assistance to collective centers in Sarajevo.
  *  American Red Cross food distribution activities in B-H.
  *  Brother's Brother feeding programs for displaced persons in Osijek.
  *  Catholic Relief Services production and distribution of underwear
     in B-H, hospital sanitation in Kosovo, and solid waste collection,
     spring seeds distribution, and senior citizen assistance activities
     in Sarajevo.
  *  Equilibre transport of relief assistance in B-H.
  *  Feed the Children/UK food distribution in B-H. 
  *  International Medical Corps immunization services in central B-H.
  *  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)/Belgium health and winterization
     activities in the eastern enclaves.
  *  Mercy Corps International medical, agricultural, and winterization
     programs in Kosovo.
  *  The Open Society Institute emergency electricity services in
     Sarajevo.
  *  Premiere Urgence for food distribution to the elderly in Mostar. 
  *  St. David's Relief livestock support activities in central B-H.
  *  World Health Organization nutritional study in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and
     Zenica. 
  *  Solidarities continued rehabilitation activities and food and
     hygiene parcel distribution program.

In addition to its obligated funding, BHR/OFDA is currently in the
process of providing $3.9 million to NGOs to support additional
emergency relief activities.  

BHR/OFDA dispatched the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to
Zagreb in December 1992.  The DART also operates sub-offices in Split,
Croatia and Sarajevo, B-H.  Among its responsibilities, the DART manages
BHR/OFDA's humanitarian assistance programs and monitors the
distribution activities of UNHCR, NGOs, and international donors.  In
January 1994, BHR/OFDA's DART in Zagreb established a Rapid Response
Fund (RRF) to enable it to respond as quickly as possible to the
changing humanitarian needs in the former Yugoslavia. Thus far in FY 95,
the DART's RRF has made available $900,000 to fund small-scale,
emergency relief activities carried out by international and local NGOs.

The DART also provides assistance in calling forward emergency relief
supplies from BHR/OFDA's permanent stockpile in Leghorn, Italy.  To date
in FY 1995, $790,350 worth of emergency stockpile items have been
delivered to the region.

In FY 1995 to date, the Office of Food For Peace (BHR/FFP) has provided
126,400 MT of Title II food assistance valued at $58 million to support
emergency food requirements of refugees and internally displaced persons
in the former Yugoslavia.  

Through WFP and UNHCR's joint relief efforts, at the beginning of FY
1995, BHR/FFP provided 48,140 MT of Title II assistance ($22.4 million)
to meet the food needs of more than 1.4 million people in B-H during the
winter of 1994-1995.  In April 1995, BHR/FFP approved an additional
45,500 MT ($21.2 million) of emergency food for distribution during the
summer and fall of 1995.
In June 1995, BHR/FFP approved a third contribution of 20,000 MT of
wheat flour ($8.9 million) to provide critical stocks for the winter
months.  Food is delivered by WFP to UNHCR's warehouses throughout the
region.  UNHCR subsequently transports the commodities to each district
where the food is distributed to those in need.  

BHR/FFP has provided 6,000 MT of Title II emergency wheat flour ($1.95
million) to CRS for delivery to the bakeries and pasta factories that
support the 400,000 people of the Sarajevo area.  BHR/FFP provided the
American Red Cross, as part of the international Red Cross effort in B-
H, with 6,760 MT of Title II emergency food ($3.6 million) to support
the soup kitchens in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Zenica targeted at the elderly
and the homebound who are unable to assist themselves.    
Total BHR/FFP FY 1995 (to date). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $57,964,200

ENI Assistance
To date in FY 1995, USAID's Bureau for Europe and the Newly Independent
States (USAID/ENI) has obligated approximately $18 million for
humanitarian and development assistance programs in B-H, including the
Presidential commitment of $10 million for the rehabilitation of
Sarajevo.  In addition, ENI has obligated $7,692,000 to humanitarian and
rehabilitation programs in Croatia so far in FY 1995.

International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA: KRAJINA REFUGEES CRISIS


THIS APPEAL SEEKS CHF 5,068,000
IN CASH, KIND AND SERVICES 
TO ASSIST 150,000 BENEFICIARIES FOR ONE MONTH	


10 August 1995


Summary



Five years after armed conflict first erupted in former
Yugoslavia, the crisis in the Krajina region, since 4-5 August
may precipitate the largest refugee crisis of the war so far. Up
to 200,000 Serb refugees have fled their homes in Krajina, and
most appear intent on travelling across the Serb-held portion of
Bosnia-Herzegovina and entering the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. The vast majority of the refugees are arriving at
border crossing points carrying only the barest essential goods
and psychologically shattered after their traumatic exodus and
exhausting journey.







The Intended Operation



The Yugoslav Red Cross National Society has been at the
forefront of the relief efforts to meet the needs of the
refugees arriving at the border since the beginning of the
crisis. It has been using its relief stocks and every other
resource available to the National Society has been utilised,
including the YRC Headquarters in Belgrade, which is housing
more than 50 refugee families. However, the National Society
urgently requires international help to sustain this assistance.
The Federation therefore intends to provide ready-to-eat meals
as well as milk powder, baby sheets and basic hygiene articles
during the immediate emergency phase for 150,000 refugees. In a
second stage of operations, the Federation/YRC will provide
whatever supplies are needed to support refugees in either
transit reception centres or host-family accommodation.



The Disaster



The Croatian area of Krajina was seized by Serb separatist
forces in 1991 and contained an estimated population of 300,000
people, mostly Serbs. However, the Croatian government continued
to lay claim to the region also known as United Nations
Sectors South, West and North and on 4 August launched a
lightening military offensive by its army into Krajina.



The Krajina-Serb civilian population immediately began to flee
the area of hostilities, moving north-north-east into Bosnia.
Tens of thousands of people seeking safety headed initially
towards the town of Banja Luka in Bosnia-Herzegovina, using all
available means of transport. However, as the situation in and
around the Banja Luka area was itself uncertain, within 24 hours
of the crisis, and after a short stop in the town, many people
were on the move again, heading further east towards what they
considered their safest option: the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.



Now, after a treacherous four-day journey, with many refugees
travelling day and night, long queues are forming on the border
between the Serb-Held area of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. More than 45,000 people have already
crossed the border but another 200,000 could be ready to queue
up behind them to complete customs formalities and cross into FR
Yugoslavia. Most of the refugees fled their homes carrying only
the barest essentials and are therefore arriving in FR
Yugoslavia in great need.



The events of the last week have dramatically altered the
conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and may yet unleash a major
escalation of the war. Although an widening of the fighting to
the disputed territory of Eastern Slavonia is still less rather
than more likely at the moment, between 100 and 150 refugees an
hour are already arriving in FR Yugoslavia from this sector
(Sector East). The Federation will continue to monitor the
situation carefully, therefore, and develop appropriate action
based on plans which are already at an advanced state of
preparedness.




The Response so far



Government Action  l

The Serbian Commissariat for Refugees, in response to this new
influx, has opened five reception and transit centres close to
border crossings, to register refugees and relocate them into
private or collective accommodation. Whilst it is difficult to
estimate what proportion of these refugees could be accommodated
with host families, it should be borne in mind that the
sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since
1992 have had a deleterious effect upon the economy, and thus
upon the capacity of people to take on the responsibility for
caring for extra charges.



Red Cross/Red Crescent Action  l

The Yugoslav Red Cross has acquired considerable experience in
dealing with refugee operations in the last three years. It has
reacted swiftly and effectively to this disaster by placing 
teams at the  main border crossings and reception centres.



Even at the Yugoslav Red Cross Headquarters in Belgrade, more
than 50 refugee families were accommodated in the available
space, including garden and parking lots.



The National Society also successfully conducted blood
transfusion campaigns in many municipalities, to cope with the
demand for blood in the hospitals treating the wounded.



The Federation has mobilised all its delegates and other
available resources in the area and is working in close
collaboration with the Yugoslav Red Cross in order to cope with
the crisis.



While the Federation is operative in the FR Yugoslavia, the ICRC
has been active in assisting and monitoring refugees and their
movements in Bosnia-Hercegovina.



Other Agencies' Action & Co-ordination  l

To provide relevant strategy and policy to the relief
operations, a steering committee has been formed by the major
relief agencies (the Federation, ICRC, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, UNICEF,
ECHO and IOM) at the Head of Delegation level to co-ordinate
roles and responsibilities. Two other commissions, for Senior
Logistics Officers involving the same agencies but including
the Yugoslav Red Cross  and to co-ordinate medical activities,
have also been set up.



The Needs to be met



Assessment of Needs  l

Even if this influx is the biggest since 1991, it is not the
first one. Assessments have therefore been made on the basis of
considerable experience and local knowledge of the situation.



Immediate Needs  l

The Yugoslav Red Cross and the Federation are looking to provide
during the immediate emergency phase ready-to-eat meals for
adults, children and babies as well as milk powder, baby sheets
and basic hygiene articles. The needs outlined in the budget are
based upon the needs of 150,000 refugees.



Anticipated Later Needs  l

Due consideration should be made, as in the past, for
appropriate shelter items, as the fifth winter of this conflict
approaches.



Red Cross Objectives



Covering the immediate needs of the refugees remains the primary
initial objective for Red Cross action. This Appeal is for a
duration of only one month and will therefore seek only to
address the immediate needs, whilst preparing for those needs
which will inevitably appear in the medium term.



	The first stage of the relief operations (already in process
from existing stocks) will cover the immediate needs of refugees
both at border crossings and reception centres. 

	Most refugees will initially go to transit reception centres
though others will be accommodated in host-family accommodation.
The Red Cross operation's second stage will be to assess the
refugees' needs in their hew habitat, and to provide for it.

	Stage three, which is not directly covered by this Appeal, will
address the issue of resettlement; whilst a putative fourth
stage should address issues of social security benefits,
education and integration into society.



National Society/Federation Plan of Action



Emergency Phase: Present - 26 August  l

As the relief response already under way is using existing
stocks, the Appeal aims both to sustain the Emergency Phase for
a period not exceeding three weeks. To cover operational
requirements in the first stage, procurement in the region is
essential.



Stage Two:  As soon as possible - end of September l

To cover the needs of the refugees in their chosen accommodation
area for a period of up to one month, procurement regionally and
further afield is envisaged. Both procurement phases will be
co-ordinated by the Secretariat's Logistic Service.



The Federation will continue to use in the normal manner it's
UN-accorded blanket clearance for the purposes of importing
relief goods into areas covered by sanctions for its operations
in former Yugoslavia.



With co-operation between the Federation and the National
Society in both management and logistics already excellent, no
major problems in distribution and reporting are envisaged. The
Yugoslav Red Cross boasts 210 Red Cross branches, 500 personnel,
more than one million volunteers and activists, and fully
computerised logistics and reporting systems. Combined with the
65-staff member Federation delegation and an available fleet of
70 vehicles, the logistical capacity for this operation is
therefore considered to be adequate. The only exception is a
shortage of refrigerated trucking capacity.



The computerised reporting system will provide all necessary
reports, per donor, per commodity, automatically every month. 



Immediate action



Immediate action has been underway  for four days as described
above. This includes the installation of one Medical Coordinator
and two logisticians at the Raca Crossing point, together with
the active mobilisation of 17 branches of the Yugoslav Red Cross
and over 2,000 volunteers.





Budget summary



See Annex 1 for details.



Conclusion



The suffering created by the conflict in former Yugoslavia goes
on this time for Krajina Serbs. The International Federation
is determined to provide, in co-operation with the Yugoslav Red
Cross, support for 150,000 victims of the latest round of
fighting. In this way the International Red Cross/Red Crescent
Movement will demonstrate the translation of its seven
principles into concrete action.

                                28 JULY 1995


  1.    OVERALL  IMPROVEMENT  IN FLOOD SITUATION HAS BEEN REPORTED. DESPITE
HEAVY  RAINFALLS,  THE BRAHMAPUTRA IS RECEDING. THE GANGES IS ALSO RECEDING
IN  MANY  AREAS ALTHOUGH AT SOME POINTS THE RIVER IS STILL FLOWING SLIGHTLY
ABOVE DANGER LEVEL.

  2.     UNDP CONVENED A DONOR'S MEETING ON 24 JULY TO REVIEW ONGOING
  NATIONAL   RELIEF  OPERATION  AND  POSSIBILITY  OF  FUTURE  FLOODS.
  ATTENDANTS  WERE  GOVERNMENT  REPRESENTATIVES, UN AGENCIES AT FIELD
  LEVEL,  MAJOR  DONORS,  ASSOCIATION FOR DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (ADAB)
  AND NGO DISASTER FORUM.

  3.      MEETING  WAS  INFORMED THAT GOVERNMENT IS CONTINUING RELIEF
  OPERATIONS.  NGOS ARE ALSO ACTIVELY INVOLVED AND INDICATED THE NEED
  FOR  INCREASED  ASSISTANCE.  GOVERNMENT  ADVISED THAT IT IS ABLE TO
  COPE WITH THE SITUATION WITH ITS OWN RESOURCES.

  4.      AS  FOR WATER LEVEL, GOVERNMENT INDICATED THAT A THIRD WAVE
  OF  FLOODS  IS  ANTICIPATED DURING THE SECOND WEEK OF AUGUST DUE TO
  EXPECTED HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE GANGES BASIN, EXPECTED ANOTHER WATER
  LEVEL  PEAK  IN THE BRAHMAPUTRA BASIN AND SPRING TIDE ON 10 AUGUST.
  THIS IS VERY LIKELY TO RESULT IN SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE TWO RIVERS.

  5.       UNDP  HAS FORMED A TASK FORCE COMPRISED OF WHO, UNICEF AND
  ADAB.  TASK  FORCE  WILL  WORK CLOSELY WITH GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE
  LIKELY AREAS AND POPULATION TO BE AFFECTED BY THIRD WAVE OF FLOODS.

  6.      AS  YET,  NO  REQUEST FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE
  GOVERNMENT  HAS  BEEN  RECEIVED.  DHA/UNDP  RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE
  CONTINUES TO MONITOR SITUATION.

              UNITED NATIONS INTER-AGENCY HUMANITARIAN PROGRAMME
                   FOR PERSONS DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE
              EMERGENCY SITUATION IN CHECHNYA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION
    
                    SITUATION REPORT OF THE DHA COORDINATOR
                Based on field reports and covering the period
                                4-27 July 1995
 

    HIGHLIGHTS

      -Peace  negotiations between Chechen insurgents and the Russian
      Federation  Government,  conducted  under  OSCE  auspices,  are
      continuing.

      -   The "Update to the United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency
      Appeal  for  Persons  Displaced  as  a  Result of the Emergency
      Situation  in  Chechnya, Russian Federation" has been published
      and discussed at donors meetings held in Moscow and Geneva.

      GENERAL

      The  peace  negotiations  mentioned  above are proceeding.  The
      cease-fire  is  generally  holding,  although  sporadic acts of
      firing  continue  to  be  reported.   On the Chechnya-Daghestan
      border,   these   consisted   of  rocket  and  grenade  firing.
      According  to  NGO  reports, a significant area of farmland has
      become  unusable  because  of  mine presence.  Peasants in this
      area  are reporting sheep and cattle killed or injured daily by
      mines.

      Prospects  for a peaceful military and political settlement ebb
      and  flow  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  Russian  negotiators  are
      reportedly  preparing  two separate draft agreements to present
      to their Chechen counterparts when peace talks resume in Grozny
      on  29  July.  According to the head of the Russian delegation,
      Nationalities Minister V. Mikhailov, the first agreement covers
      military  and  political  issues  while  the  second deals with
      political  issues  alone.   It was subsequently reported that a
      military  agreement was signed on 29 July.  Despite expressions
      of   optimism   on   both  sides,  and  indications  that  both
      delegations  are  prepared  to make concessions on the issue of
      the  political  status  of  Chechnya, internal strife among the
      different  political  groups  within Chechnya has been growing.
      This has aggravated the general situation in the region and has
      provoked  armed clashes including a brief but intense firefight
      in the city centre of Grozny.

      The  "Update  to  the  United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency
      Appeal  for  Persons  Displaced  as  a  result of the Emergency
      Situation  in  Chechnya,  Russian  Federation"  was launched in
      Moscow,  Geneva  and New York on 19 July.  It was released at a
      press  conference  conducted  by  the DHA Coordinator in Moscow
      also  on 19 July, and it was brought to the attention of donors
      at  a meeting held in Moscow the same day.  It was discussed at
      a  donors  meeting  held in Geneva on 27 July which was chaired
      jointly  by  DHA,  UNHCR  and  ICRC.  At  the  meeting,  it was
      highlighted  that a shortfall of about USD 5 million remains to
      be  covered  for  humanitarian  programmes under the Appeal. In
      addition,  USD  2  million  have  been  identified  by  WFP  as
      necessary  to  stockpile food for the winter. It was underlined
      that  WFP  will  need  in-kind  or  cash  contributions  before
      mid-September  1995  in  order to be able to implement the food
      stockpiling programme.

      The Update maintains the original appealed-for amount of USD 25
      million.   Allowing  for  the late arrival of contributions, it
      extends the original programme to cover a 12 month period up to
      31 December 1995.

      Within  the total figure of USD 25 million, the Update provides
      for some redistribution of requirements among sectors, to allow
      for  an  increased requirement for bulk food in the four winter
      months,  a  requirement  for winter clothing, and a requirement
      for a package of returnee assistance.

      For  the  third  time  since  the inception of the programme in
      January  1995,  a  serious  air  safety incident occurred.  Two
      United  Nations  staff members escaped when the control systems
      on  their  airliner  failed.   A  wing  broke  off in the crash
      landing.   In  one  earlier  incident,  the control system also
      failed  but  the  aircraft  made  an  emergency landing without
      further damage. In another incident, passengers were repeatedly
      boarded  and  disembarked  while  the crew attempted to start a
      malfunctioning engine.  They eventually abandoned the attempt.

      TARGET POPULATION

      In  inter-agency  discussions  leading up to the preparation of
      the Update, and as reflected in that document, the total number
      of  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs) from Chechnya now in
      Daghestan,  Ingushetia  and  North  Ossetia  was  estimated  at
      152,000;  at  the  same  time,  for  planning  purposes, it was
      estimated  that,  allowing  for  a  further  return  of IDPs to
      Chechnya  from  now until the end of the year, the IDPs most in
      need would number 118,000.

      The  difference  between  the above figures and the much higher
      figures  reported by the local authorities is explained largely
      by  the  fact  that  a  significant  number  of IDPs are moving
      backwards and forwards across the border, but are spending much
      of their time in Chechnya.

      The  spot  checks conducted by UNHCR field officers have led to
      the  figure  of 152,000.  A more accurate figure will emerge as
      the distribution of wheat flour described below is carried out.

      INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION

      In  Ingushetia  and  North  Ossetia the joint logistics system,
      which  involves  inter-agency  management  and  operation  of a
      warehouse   and   related   transport   system,  is  now  fully
      operational.   (It  was  earlier  reported  that the system was
      operational in Daghestan.)


      DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE

      Shelter, Water and Sanitation

      In  Daghestan, 75 of the shelter, water and sanitation projects
      are  now  completed,  with  13  others  in  various  stages  of
      progress.


      Food
      The  ship  carrying  3,000  MTs  of  wheat flour donated by the
      European   Community  Humanitarian  Office  (ECHO)  arrived  in
      Novorossiysk  in  the  latter  part  of June.  The unloading of
      1,800  MTs  destined  for  Ingushetia  and  North  Ossetia  was
      completed by WFP on 28 June and this part of the cargo was sent
      by  rail  to  Vladikavkaz.  The ship brought 1,200 MTs destined
      for  Daghestan  to  Makhachkala  port  on 8 July; unloading and
      transport to the warehouse in Kizilyurt was completed by WFP on
      18  July and the cargo was released by customs on 20 July.  WFP
      provided a port captain for this operation.

      In  Ingushetia and North Ossetia distribution arrangements were
      made  more complex by the continuing tension between Ingushetia
      and  North  Ossetia;  this  entailed the use of drivers who are
      neither  Ingush  nor  Ossetian,  and the hiring by WFP of three
      Ingush  monitors  for  service  in  Ingushetia and one Ossetian
      monitor for work in North Ossetia.

      Distribution of the wheat flour is now proceeding in Daghestan,
      Ingushetia  and  North  Ossetia on the basis of 4.5 kilogrammes
      per  person  per  month.   With  an average family size of five
      persons,  the  typical  family receives 25 kilogrammes, so that
      two families can share a 50 kilogramme sack.

      In  Daghestan,  monitoring is carried out by UNHCR field staff,
      the  WFP logistics officer and four food monitors hired by WFP.
      The  NGO  Equilibre  is  handling  distribution  to  collective
      centres in Khasavyurt.

      Health

      Two  UNICEF-supported  vaccination  teams  have completed their
      work  in  Daghestan.   In  Ingushetia,  a  staff  member of the
      National  Cold  Store has completed his training in vaccine and
      cold chain management.

      A  WHO  tuberculosis  specialist  has  completed  a  mission to
      Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Daghestan.

      Domestic Needs Items

      The   distribution   by   UNHCR  of  domestic  needs  items  is
      continuing.   With  a  view  to  return  to  school,  UNICEF is
      distributing  to  children  clothing, sports items, and writing
      and drawing materials.


    Community Services

    UNICEF is continuing the training of trainers and monitors in
    trauma relief and child care. A survey has determined that at
    present approximately 10 percent of the IDP children are
    manifesting at least two of the symptoms commonly used to
    identify trauma victims; an earlier survey had reported 15
    percent.

    FINANCIAL UPDATE

    In addition to the pledges and contributions announced in the
    Update to the Inter-Agency Appeal, which totalled USD 17.4
    million as of 30 June against the Appeal programmes, UNHCR
    reported in July that it had received a contribution of USD
    98,718 from the Dutch NGO Stichting Vluchteling for multisectoral
    assistance to IDPs.

    Outside the Appeal framework, pledges and contributions reported
    to DHA since 1 July are as follows:

         -    ICRC has received USD 605,789 from Sweden and USD
    55,008 from Denmark;

         -    IOM has received USD 235,518 from Switzerland for the
    evacuation of vulnerable people from Chechnya, which is part of
    IOM's appeal issued on 19 January 1995; IOM has also reported a
    contribution of USD 220,000 from the US Government in support of
    IDPs inside Chechnya;

         -    The EC has provided the following contributions for
    medicines, medical supplies, parts for basic water supply and
    special foods: USD 1,342,282 for ICRC; USD 2,348,993 for
    MSF-Belgium; USd 939,579 for MSF-France; 2,174,497 for Merlin-UK;
    USD 1,073,826 for the French NGO Equilibre; USD 268,456 for Feed
    the Children-UK; and USD 402,685 for EC coordination and
    monitoring.

ZAIRE - Refugees 

Fact Sheet #1                                     August 24, 1995

Background:  Zaire continues to host more than 1 million Rwandan
refugees.  A majority of these refugees arrived over a five-day
period following the July 1994 victory in Rwanda by the Tutsi-
dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).  Military elements of
the former regime known as the ex-Armed Forces of Rwanda (ex-FAR)
as well as militia members are prevalent among the refugee
population.  Through intimidation, the ex-FAR has prevented many
Rwandan refugees from returning to Rwanda.  The ex-FAR allegedly
conducts military training near the camps and has pledged to
retake Rwanda by force, if necessary.  Credible sources speculate
openly about a potential invasion and feel that it could occur
prior to Nov. 1995 when the next rainy season commences.  

An arms embargo was placed on Rwanda in May 1994 by the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC) to stem the flow of arms during
the civil war.  In light of the threat from the former regime,
the UNSC unanimously voted on Aug. 16, 1995, to suspend the
embargo for 1 year.  The Government of Zaire (GOZ) believed that
lifting the embargo would invite attacks by the Government of
Rwanda's (GOR) military, known as the Rwandan Patriotic Army
(RPA), on refugee camps in Zaire and that the restrictions in the
resolution were insufficient to prevent misuse of the weapons. 
The GOZ warned that if the embargo were lifted, it would be
justified in abandoning its international obligation to provide a
safe haven for refugees.  On Aug. 19, the GOZ military began
forcibly repatriating Rwandan and Burundian refugees.  

Numbers Affected:  As of August 2, the U. N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) reports there are approximately 1.1 million
Rwandan and 100,000 Burundian refugees in Zaire.  According to
UNHCR, the GOZ military forcibly repatriated 12,800 refugees from
Aug. 19-23.  It is estimated that approximately 80-85% of the
returnees are women, children, and elderly.  Many of the
returnees have come from Mugunga camp in Goma which has a large
ex-FAR population.  UNHCR reports that an additional 133,000
Rwandan and Burundian refugees have left their camps near Goma,
Bukavu and Uvira and fled further into Zaire to avoid being
repatriated.  

Current Situation:  The GOR, with assistance from UNHCR, is
processing the returnees as quickly as possible.  UNHCR has
opened reception centers in Gisenyi and Cyangugu that can
accommodate up to 5,000 refugees per day.  However, it has warned
that if the number of returnees exceeds 10,000 per day, its
lodging and processing capacity will be overloaded.  
          
The Rwandan side of the border currently is calm.  The refugees
are being trucked by the U.N. and the International Organization
for Migration (IOM) from the border to transit sites.  It is
being reported that most Rwandan returnees are arriving with
little or nothing because they either did not have time to
assemble their belongings or their possessions were looted by the
GOZ military.  The RPA is maintaining a low-key presence.

Increasing civil disturbance in Burundi hinders the country's
ability to integrate returning refugees.  UNHCR has established a
transit camp near Gatumba but it is very close to the Zairian
border and has no water and sanitation resources.  Fortunately,
the Burundian refugees are arriving with a few more possessions
and supplies.  Relief agencies are providing shelter and
temporary water and sanitation services.  

Diplomatic Efforts:  The U.N., the U.S. Government (USG) and
others are urging the GOZ to fulfill its international obligation
to the refugees.  On Aug. 23, the UNSC issued a statement noting
the GOZ's plight and urging the refugees' countries of origin to
make a greater effort to draw the refugees home.  Other donors
have issued their own statements recognizing the GOZ's concerns
for its national security but emphasizing its obligations under
international humanitarian principles.  On Aug. 24, the GOZ
suspended its forced repatriation policy, though how long this
will last is unclear.  UNHCR High Commissioner Ogata will meet
with GOZ Prime Minister Kengo in the near future to discuss the
issue.

USG Assistance:  U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, David Rawson, as well
as representatives of USAID/Rwanda and USAID/Burundi have visited
key border sites and the Gatumba transit centers.  The State
Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration has
dispatched its regional refugee coordinator to the scene.  The
USG has not expended additional humanitarian assistance as a
result of the GOZ's current actions.  However, previously-funded
projects continue to benefit needy refugees and internally
displaced persons in the Rwanda/Burundi region.

RWANDA - Civil Strife/Displaced Persons

Situation Report #7 Fiscal Year (FY) 1995             August 28, 1995

Note:  The last situation report was dated July 24, 1995.

Overview
More than one year after the April 6, 1994, plane crash that killed
President Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Ntaryamira of Burundi
and unleashed massive genocidal killing and refugee outflows, Rwanda's
future remains uncertain.  Increased levels of voluntary refugee
repatriation and agricultural activity are signs that the country is
on the road to rehabilitation.  However, over a million refugees
remain outside Rwanda's borders; among them, militia members and
military elements of the former regime known as the ex-Armed Forces of
Rwanda (ex-FAR).  The ex-FAR allegedly conducts military training near
the camps and has pledged to retake Rwanda by force, if necessary. 
Credible sources speculate openly about a potential increase in cross-
border raids and feel that it could occur prior to November 1995 when
the next rainy season commences.  

The U.N. Assistance Mission In Rwanda (UNAMIR) peacekeeping force
remains in Rwanda to assist humanitarian operations, protect
internally displaced persons and civilians at risk, provide security
to members of the international tribunal and human rights observers,
and assist in establishing and training a new integrated national
police force.  UNAMIR's current mandate expires on December 9, 1995,
by which time its presence will be reduced from 5,500 to 1,800 troops,
320 military observers as well as additional support staff.  

Prior to April 6, 1994, Rwanda was the most densely populated country
in Africa.  It is the size of the state of Maryland and had a
population of 8.1 million people.  The population was comprised of 14%
Tutsi, 85% Hutu, and 1% Twa before the war.  Since it gained
independence from Belgium in 1962, Rwanda has been fraught with tragic
periods of politically motivated ethnic violence that has claimed the
lives of thousands of people, however the genocide experienced by
Rwanda last year is unprecedented.

Numbers Affected
As of August 2, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) reports there are approximately 1.8 million Rwandan refugees
in the following countries: Zaire - 1.1 million; Tanzania - 526,000;
Burundi - 182,413; Uganda - 4,000.  These numbers do not reflect the
more than 5.5 million persons inside Rwanda who have been affected by
the violence and its aftermath.

Current Situation
When the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) won the civil war in Rwanda in
July 1994 and was recognized as the legitimate Government of Rwanda
(GOR), it inherited an arms embargo placed on Rwanda in May 1994 by
the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to stem the flow of arms
the country during its civil war.  The new GOR has been in place for
over a year.  In light of this and what the UNSC calls "reports of
military preparations and increasing incursions into Rwanda by
(military) elements of the former regime" in refugee camps in eastern
Zaire, the UNSC unanimously voted on August 16, 1995, to suspend the
embargo against the GOR for one year and then lift it, allowing the
GOR to acquire weapons to defend itself.

In doing so, the UNSC decided to continue to prohibit the sale and
supply of arms and related materiel to non-governmental Rwandan forces
both within and outside the country.   As means of assurance, the UNSC
is requiring all countries exporting weapons to the GOR to notify and
register purchases with the U.N.  The resolution also prohibits the
transfer -both direct and indirect- of these weapons to neighboring
countries.

The Government of Zaire (GOZ) did not support lifting the arms
embargo, citing its belief that it would open the door to attacks by
the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) on refugee camps in Zaire and that the
restrictions in the resolution were not sufficient to prevent misuse
of the weapons.  The GOZ warned that if the embargo was lifted the GOZ
would be justified in abandoning its international obligation to
provide a safe haven for refugees.  On August 19, the GOZ military
began forcibly expelling Rwandan and Burundian refugees from camps in
eastern Zaire.  UNHCR reports that, between August 19 and 23, the GOZ
military expelled 15,081 refugees.  On August 24, the GOZ suspended
its forced repatriation policy, though how long this will last is
unclear.  (For more information, see BHR/OFDA's Zaire-Refugees Fact
Sheet.) 

While the UNSC resolution represents further international support for
the GOR, the resolution also reminds the GOR that the international
community remains concerned about the situation in Rwanda's prisons. 
As of August 14, approximately 51,000 people are detained in 14
prisons and 196 detention centers throughout Rwanda.  The official
capacity of these facilities is judged to be 11,500 and, in some
prisons, there are as many as four people per square meter.  It is
estimated that approximately 300 prisoners die per month, largely due
to overcrowding.

The relief community in Rwanda, including the GOR, is developing an
action plan to alleviate the prison overcrowding in the near future. 
The plan calls for the creation of temporary facilities capable of
housing 15,000 detainees by the end of September 1995.  Permanent
facilities capable of housing 35,000 detainees also will be created. 
In addition, the relief community and the GOR are taking steps to
locate and rehabilitate supplementary detention centers so that female
and child prisoners can be separated from the main holding facilities. 
The number of child detainees is 1,028.

Voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees from neighboring countries
is continuing with the spontaneous and organized arrival of refugees
from Burundi, Zaire and Tanzania, though the number from Tanzania has
been limited.  Since 1994, an estimated 700,000 Rwandan refugees have
returned to Rwanda, 150,000 of which have repatriated in 1995.  Many
of the returnees are "old caseload refugees" from Uganda who fled
Rwanda in 1959 and 1963.

The environmental impact of Rwanda's civil war is evident in virtually
every area where refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) have
lived.  In southwest Rwanda, the former IDP campsites are almost
totally denuded of ground vegetation and trees.  Nearly all
surrounding tree plantations and woodlots are bare.  In Zaire, similar
environmental devastation has been reported in Goma and the nearby
Virunga National Park.  Zairian authorities are attempting to mitigate
further damage by limiting the days in which refugees can collect
wood, but illegal commerce in wood continues.  Poaching also is a
problem.  In Tanzania's Ngara District, a 10-15 kilometer radius
around the Benaco refugee complex has been denuded.


Political/Military Situation
UNAMIR reports that the overall security situation in Rwanda,
particularly in Kigali, is improving.  Rwanda's gradual return to
normalcy appears to be accompanied by a weakening support base for the
former regime.  This has spurred incidents of infiltration and
targeted violence in areas bordering Zaire by the ex-FAR and militia. 
Two government officials were murdered in July in Bugarama in
southwest Rwanda.  Acts of banditry occur and key installations, such
as water and power plants, have been sabotaged.

UNAMIR is proceeding with its plans to downsize in Rwanda.  By the end
of July, the Tunisian and Ethiopian contingents had departed and the
Nigerian contingent had been reduced.  By the end of August, the
Zambian, Senegalese, and Australian troops will depart and the
Malawian contingent will be reduced, bringing the troop level of
UNAMIR to approximately 2,500.

The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) established by
the U.N. Security Council for the prosecution of those who committed
serious violations of International Humanitarian Law, including
genocide, is working to overcome logistical obstacles and conduct
effective investigations by building up its staff of investigators and
prosecutors.  In addition, the ICTR's Chief Prosecutor, Judge
Goldstone, met with U.N. officials in New York, including Secretary
General Boutros-Ghali, in late July to increase the level of
cooperation between the ICTR and the U.N.  Judge Goldstone also
visited Rwanda on August 7 to survey ICTR activities there.

U.N. Human Rights monitors are providing technical assistance to the
justice system, and promoting the observance and respect of human
rights.  BHR's Office of Transition Initiatives (BHR/OTI) is funding a
staff person to work with the human rights operations.

Relief Efforts
Efforts are underway in Rwanda to trace former camp residents
following the forced closure of all camps for internally displaced
persons (IDP) in Rwanda by the GOR in April.  At that time, the number
of IDPs was estimated to be 160,000 - 180,000.  Based on registration
figures, a considerable number of IDPs have not returned to their home
communes but continue to be displaced in Rwanda or have sought refuge
in Burundi.  Of the former IDPs that have been registered, local
authorities in places such as Gikongoro report that some are
attempting to resettle in areas other than their home communes.  In
some areas, people have reintegrated well, often with assistance from
the communes, and are engaged in agricultural activities.  In others,
such as Butare, the shortage of housing and land has led to violent
disputes.

The U.N.'s Rwanda Emergency Office (UNREO) in Kigali will close its
doors on August 31.  UNREO recently has been working with the U.N.
Development Program's Resident Representative in Rwanda to establish a
Disaster Management Team (DMT) for contingency planning.  The DMT is
forging links with the GOR and NGOs to carry out joint assessments and
contingency planning.  The NGOs are undertaking a similar exercise
informally to identify available resources and develop contingency
plans on a regional basis.  

Situation by Region
Rwanda
A country-wide nutritional survey conducted in July showed that global
malnutrition rates for children younger than five had risen from a
pre-war level of 3.8 % (July 1993) to 9.7%.  The survey also showed
that the rate of chronic malnutrition now stands at 44.4%.  In June
1993, the rate was 56.3%.  The reason for this variation is not clear.

WFP reports that the number and volume of food-for-work (FFW) projects
in agriculture and infrastructure rehabilitation have increased
dramatically.  During July 1995, up to 48% of total food aid
distributions were via FFW, as opposed to 10% during the first six
months of 1995.

Eastern Zaire
In addition to the 15,081 refugees forcibly expelled to Rwanda and
Burundi by the GOZ from August 19-23, approximately 133,000 refugees
left their camps and fled further into Zaire to avoid repatriation. 
Five of the eleven refugee camps near Uvira in South Kivu Province
have been vacated.

While refugees from the Goma camps are arriving in Rwanda with little
or no belongings, Burundian refugees from camps in South Kivu are
arriving in Burundi with a few possessions and supplies, including
food. (See also BHR/OFDA 
Zaire-Refugees Fact Sheet.) 

Burundi
Since January 1995, UNHCR estimates that  20,000 Rwandan refugees in
Burundi have returned to Rwanda.  UNHCR has facilitated fact-finding
visits of Rwandan refugees from Burundi to Rwanda and they have proven
quite successful.  UNHCR also is monitoring the reintegration of
returnees in areas receiving substantial returnee populations.  In
four communes in Butare Prefecture, UNHCR reports that all the
returnees appear satisfied with the situation in their various
communes.  (See also BHR/OFDA Burundi situation report.)

Northern Tanzania
Relief agencies assisting Rwandan refugees in Tanzania are suffering
from UNHCR's severe lack of funding.  All agencies are cutting
international staff and some, such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
and the World Health Organization (WHO) are shutting down programs
altogether.  Projects to expand shelter facilities and provide vital
new sources of potable water are grinding to a halt.  In addition, the
lack of funding has constrained contingency planning exercises.

USAID representatives visited refugee camps in Ngara and Kibondo
Districts July 17 - 21.  As of August 2, the five camps that make up
Benaco Complex in Ngara had a population of 421,000 and are reported
to be calm, though overcrowded.  Apart from high malnutrition rates
(54%) in children under five, most of the refugees do not seem to have
serious nutritional problems.

The provision of adequate water is a very serious problem in the
camps.  Even at the current meager rate of consumption, the camps'
water supply will last only another 6-12 months.

The USAID team also visited Kanembwa camp in Kibondo District.  The
camp is calm and has a population of about 13,000.  Water, firewood
and sanitation services are adequate, but the camp's food rations are
not.  Of the camp's 3,000 children under the age of five, 194 were in
special feeding programs being treated for malnutrition.  Aside from
these nutritional problems, the overall health conditions in the camp
appeared to be adequate.

The villages near Kanembwa camp have allocated 5,000 acres of land to
the refugees.  If the refugees can cultivate the land successfully, it
could result in a decreased dependence on food aid next year.

The camps in both Ngara and Kibondo Districts report serious
logistical problems that could hinder the delivery of relief supplies
in the near future, particularly during the rainy season.  In
addition, the birth rates in the camps are extremely high.  This
eventually will overwhelm the presently-sufficient sanitation
services.

The Government of Tanzania (GOT) officially closed its border with
Burundi on March 31, 1995, to prevent the influx of additional
refugees.  It remains closed.


USG Assistance
A disaster was declared in Rwanda in FY94 on April 28, 1994, by U.S.
Ambassador David Rawson due to widespread genocide and violence
following the events of April 6, 1994.  On October 7, 1994, Ambassador
Rawson issued a disaster declaration for FY95, confirming the ongoing
crisis in the Rwanda region.

In response to the crises in Rwanda, the USG to date (FY94 and FY95)
has provided over $584.3 million to U.N. agencies, IOs and NGOs for
relief programs, in addition to deploying 2,000 troops to the region
to assist the humanitarian effort from July to September 1994.   Some
of this funding, specifically food aid and refugee assistance, also
has benefitted Burundian refugees and IDPs.  Beginning in late May
1994, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) began airlifting emergency
relief supplies for U.N. agencies, ICRC, and many NGOs.  State/PRM has
allocated nearly $137 million for refugee assistance programs in the
region.  Since the beginning of the crisis, BHR/FFP has committed over
413,000 MT of food assistance valued at nearly $251 million  to the
region.  USG humanitarian assistance to the region has also been
provided by AFR/EA and BHR/OTI.

The GOR continues to require funding to strengthen its ministries and
bolster its capacity to govern the country.  To date, USAID/Rwanda has
committed $8.7 million from the Development Fund for Africa (DFA)
towards the physical and technical support of GOR ministries,
including improving the capacity of the Ministry of Justice. 
Commodities provided by USAID funds, such as vehicles and computers,
already are in use by the GOR.

Situation Report # 3 Fiscal Year (FY) 1995                     July 24, 1995

Note: The last situation report was dated June 30, 1995.  For more information
on the Rwanda regional crisis, see also BHR/OFDA Rwanda situation report,
July 24, 1995.

Overview
On October 21, 1993, President Melchoir Ndadaye, the first democratically
elected President of Burundi, and several high-ranking government officials
were killed by military personnel in a coup attempt in the capital, Bujumbura. 
The slaying of Ndadaye sparked nationwide ethnic violence between the
minority Tutsi and the majority Hutu ethnic groups.  Many provinces suffered
human and property destruction on a devastating scale.  Other provinces were
spared the worst of the destruction but became places of refuge for
Burundians.  The northern and central provinces were hit the hardest by the
violence and disorder.  On January 13, 1994, the National Assembly elected
President Cyprien Ntaryamira to replace slain President Ndadaye.  President
Ntaryamira and the President of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana, were killed in a
plane crash on April 6,1994 while approaching the airport in Kigali, Rwanda's
capital.  The presidents were returning from a regional summit to explore
solutions to end the violence that has occurred in Rwanda and Burundi over
the years.  In September 1994, after lengthy negotiations, the major political
parties entered into a power-sharing convention and Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
was chosen to succeed Ntaryamira in October 1994.  Although a new government
is now in place, political and ethnic tensions remain high, and acts of
violence continue to occur with alarming frequency.

Burundi has a population of 5.6 million people, of which an estimated 85% are
Hutu, approximately 14% are Tutsi, and 1% are Twa.  Despite their minority
status, the Tutsis have traditionally dominated the government, military,
economy, and educated society.  The new President of Burundi is a member of
the majority (predominantly Hutu) FRODEBU party, while the Prime Minister is
from the (predominantly Tutsi) UPRONA opposition party.  The military remains
primarily Tutsi, particularly at the higher ranks.

Numbers Affected
As a result of the violence that began in October 1993, between 50,000 to
100,000 people were killed, thousands wounded, and approximately 1 million
persons were displaced from their homes in Burundi.  Over 600,000 Burundians
fled to neighboring countries.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) now
estimates that there are approximately 340,000 internally displaced persons
(IDPs) in Burundi.    The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
reports that as of June 28, 1995, approximately 203,500 Burundian refugees
remain in neighboring countries:  6,000 in Rwanda; 102,500 in Tanzania; and
95,000 in Zaire.   UNHCR also estimates that 200,000 Rwandans remain in
northern Burundi as a result of the violence in Rwanda following the events
of April 6, 1994.

General Situation
Security conditions in Burundi continue to deteriorate.  Political and ethnic
tensions have escalated to new heights in Bujumbura, and fighting in the
city's ethnically mixed suburbs has resulted in numerous civilian deaths,
sudden population movements towards and into Zaire, and a veritable ethnic
balkanization of the population.  On July 14, fighting erupted in the volatile
Bujumbura quartiers of Kamenge and Kinama, which have been the scene of
reoccurring violence for the past several weeks.  The cause of the fighting is
unknown but resulted in significant population displacements to the
surrounding hills.  NGOs initially were denied access to the area for security
reasons, however, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) later
estimated that approximately 10,000 persons were displaced.  

In the northern provinces, ethnic tensions continue to flare between the
Burundian IDPs and the Rwandan Hutu refugees.  The insecurity surrounding
this fragile situation has been heightened by the relief community's announced
plan to phase out general food distributions to the IDPs, based on numerous
assessments that have determined that the IDPs' need for food relief no longer
exists except among vulnerable populations. The relief community has become a
target of the violence and tension, resulting in grenade attacks against non-
governmental organizations' (NGO) residences, ambushes of NGO and U.N. relief
convoys, and the murder of an expatriate relief worker.  The escalating
violence has also affected the expatriate diplomatic and civilian communities. In
late March, three Belgians were attacked and killed during an ambush on the
outskirts of Bujumbura, and a South African producer was killed shortly
thereafter.  On June 14, a convoy carrying several Burundian officials,
western diplomats--including U.S. Ambassador Krueger--, and journalists was
attacked in the northwest, resulting in several casualties and the deaths of
one Organization of African Unity (OAU) military observer and one Burundian
military official.

Additionally, attacks against the Rwandan refugee population, their fears of
forced repatriation into Rwanda, and overall growing insecurity in northern
Burundi have resulted in sporadic population movements towards the
Burundi/Tanzania border, which remains officially closed by the Government of
Tanzania (GOT) since March 31, 1995.  Such ongoing movements and threats of
a possible influx into Tanzania contribute to the instability of the
Rwanda/Burundi region.

As a result of the growing insecurity in Burundi and concerns regarding the
provision of relief assistance in the region, USAID Administrator Brian Atwood
deployed a USAID-led assessment team to Burundi and Tanzania from April 17-
27. The team consisted of representatives of USAID/BHR/OFDA, USAID/BHR/Food
For Peace (BHR/FFP), USAID/Africa Bureau (USAID/AFR), State/Population,
Refugees and Migration (State/PRM), and InterAction.  The purpose of the
assessment was to examine the feasibility of the WFP program to reduce
general food distributions to displaced and dispersed populations, review the
USAID humanitarian relief portfolio, and determine the feasibility of
implementing recovery and development programs in Burundi.  The team's
findings reconfirmed previous assessment reports that the humanitarian crisis
in Burundi that followed the October 1993 crisis is largely over.  The present
situation in Burundi stems from a political crisis, which necessarily impacts
the current humanitarian situation.

Political/Military situation
Following President Ntaryamira's death on April 6, 1994, National Assembly
President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was appointed as Burundi's interim
president.  Political tensions intensified in ensuing months, largely caused by
the impasse over presidential succession.  The impasse was accompanied by 
increased incidents of ethnic and political violence.  The situation was finally
resolved by a multi-party agreement in September 1994 to form a new
coalition, which paved the way for the installation of Ntibantunganya as
President in October 1994.  Under this new power sharing agreement, officially
known as the Conventions of Government, the Prime Minister and 45 percent of
ministerial positions are allocated to the opposition.

After a series of internal political struggles within the UPRONA party, Prime
Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko was forced to resign from his position in
February 1995.  UPRONA nominated Antione Nduwayo as the new prime
minister, and his nomination was formally accepted by the President on
February 22.

On June 18, President Ntibantunganya announced a series of  "non-state of
emergency" measures during a televised speech to reinforce peace, security,
and confidence in Burundi.  These measures, effective immediately, included
suspension of all political meetings, demonstrations, and political radio
broadcasts; censorship of radio and television broadcasts and newspaper
articles to prevent dissemination of ethnic "hate" messages; division of the
country and major urban centers into "sectors" under joint civilian/military
rule; installation of a country-wide curfew; issuance of new national passports;
and the requirement that all Burundians wishing to travel outside of their
province be in possession of official travel documents."

Additionally, the President announced that he will rule by decree until the
next session of Parliament, which begins in October 1995.  Attributing
deteriorating security conditions to both Hutu and Tutsi extremist groups, the
President appealed to all political parties to support him and the multi-party
power sharing arrangement established by the Conventions of Government. 
Finally, the President stressed that "since the main problem [in Burundi] is
security, it is the soldiers who will be responsible for everything."

On June 19, a special session of the National Assembly was called by the
President to consider the emergency measures he announced on June 18, and
to "enact measures for the creation of new judicial committees which will
investigate all crimes committed in the country since October 1993."

It is the Burundian government's intention that the culmination of these new
measures will reinforce security and justice throughout Burundi, thereby
curbing the growing violence.  Meanwhile, the international community
continues its efforts to stabilize Burundi's political situation.  U.N. Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali visited Burundi on July 16 to appeal to the
Burundian people to reconcile and work toward peace.  He met with President
Ntibantaganya and various other government and military officials.  The USG
also has dispatched a number of high-ranking officials to Burundi, both to
demonstrate support for the democratically elected Government of the Republic
of Burundi (GRB) and to consult with government and military officials on
security issues.  In late April, Assistant Secretary of State (AS) for African
Affairs George Moose visited Burundi to discuss issues of security, justice and
accountability, and issues related to Burundi's IDP population.  AS Moose also
discussed the need to incorporate Hutu soldiers into the Tutsi-dominated
military, rendering the institution more ethnically equitable and unbiased.   In
early June, a high-ranking delegation from the OAU also visited Burundi to
partake in peace talks and negotiations, however the delegation's efforts were
hindered by a sudden escalation of violence during the time of their visit.

The USG continues to work with the U.N. and GRB towards the installation of a
Commission of Inquiry.  It is envisaged that the Commission would serve to
investigate the 1993 failed coup attempt and President Ndadaye's assassination,
and grave violations of international humanitarian law that accompanied and
followed these acts.

Meanwhile, political violence continues.  The frequency of political
assassinations and the existence of reported "hit lists" for further
assassinations is particularly disturbing.  At least twenty prominent
Burundians or local authorities have been attacked or assassinated since
January 1994.

The international community, including the U.S. government, has been actively
working to stabilize the fragile political situation in Burundi.  The Burundi
Policy Forum has been established in the U.S. to discuss U.N., NGO and
international organization (IOs) activities to help Burundians promote peace
and reconciliation for their own country, and to make additional
recommendations for conflict prevention and resolution measures.  BHR/OFDA
participates in this forum.

Relief efforts
Relief organizations have been providing humanitarian assistance in the form
of food, water, non-food relief commodities, and medical services to Burundi's
displaced population since the October 1993 outbreak of violence.  At that
time, two distinct categories of internally displaced persons emerged in
Burundi.  The "displaced" population, largely Tutsi, sought protection in
public buildings and were guarded by the Burundian military, while the
"dispersed" population, largely Hutu, fled to the hills to avoid central roads
and the Tutsi-dominated military.  Relief agencies have encountered difficulties
in providing humanitarian assistance to the dispersed, as they are not
concentrated in any particular areas or regions and are often difficult to
locate.  Many of the displaced and dispersed travel to their homes for short
periods of time, but return to the hills or camps due to security concerns.

With the escalation in violence and insecurity, relief efforts have become
increasingly hindered.  Attacks against U.N. convoys and NGOs' property and
personnel are becoming more frequent.  In late April, a Greek expatriate
working for Catholic Relief Services (CRS) was murdered while assessing the
need for food distributions in Kirundo province, northern Burundi.  In the
aftermath of this tragedy, more than 25 NGOs working in Burundi declared a
week-long work stoppage.  During this time the participating NGOs travelled
throughout the countryside and Bujumbura to inform the local population and
officials of the NGOs' neutrality, and their purpose in delivering humanitarian
assistance.  In spite of their efforts, however, attacks against NGOs and U.N.
relief agencies continue.  Several WFP convoys transporting food commodities
throughout the north have been attacked and/or looted.  On June 8, 25 WFP
trucks were detained outside of Bujumbura by angry local residents, who
accused WFP of trafficking arms to Hutu refugees in Zaire.  In mid-June, an
Action International Contre La Faim/France (AICF/F) and GTZ (a German NGO)
convoy of six vehicles was ambushed by unknown assailants, resulting in the
deaths of local civilians and injuries suffered by AICF/F personnel.

The USAID-led assessment team that visited Burundi in late April determined
that the humanitarian crisis that resulted from the October 1993 violence in
Burundi is essentially over.  The 1994/1995 harvests at the household levels
were notably good.  Nutritional surveys of the displaced population have
shown a progressive improvement.  Severe malnutrition in the IDP camps,
according to information provided by UNICEF and AICF, has declined. 
Malnutrition levels for infants under 2 years is just over 2 percent, compared
to a malnutrition level of 5.6 percent prior to the October 1993 crisis.

Subsequent to the USAID-led assessment, a multi-donor field assessment
mission was deployed to Burundi in response to the President of Burundi's
appeal to the international community for additional food assistance for IDPs. 
The mission consisted of representatives from the U.N., European Union (EU),
USAID/FFP, and the GRB.  Between May 28-June 17 the team travelled to seven
northern and central provinces, visited 25 IDP camps and relief centers, and
interviewed numerous local officials, church representatives, displaced and
dispersed persons, and relief workers.  Based on its findings, the team
reported that the majority of the affected population in camps have access to
land and, in some provinces, 85 percent of the displaced are farming.  Harvest
forecasts for June and July are excellent, significantly reducing the
requirement for emergency food assistance.  Most camps have well-stocked
local markets on-site, and additional markets within one kilometer of the
camps.  The team also observed that the majority of the IDPs have not
returned to their homes permanently due to real and perceived security
threats, to receive food aid, and to seek shelter, as their houses have not
been rebuilt from the October 1993 destruction.  The emphasis among some
local Burundian officials is to rebuild houses and to attain the level of
agricultural production that existed before the crisis, thereby leading
northern Burundi towards a stage of reconstruction and eliminating emergency
relief needs.

Based on the findings of these and other assessments, WFP has announced its
intention to gradually phase out general food distribution to the majority of
the IDP population.  At present, WFP provides general food distributions to
approximately 340,000 IDPS. WFP intends to reduce this caseload to 112,000
beneficiaries by the end of July, with a 20 percent decrease per month
through March 1996, security allowing.  WFP will, however, continue to assist
approximately 80,000 vulnerable persons, and intends to implement food-for-
work targeted feeding programs and ad hoc assistance as required.

Insecurity in Burundi and resulting population movements towards the
Burundi/Tanzania border have presented renewed challenges to the relief
community.  In late March, more than 55,000 Rwandan refugees fled towards
the Tanzanian border after attacks were reportedly waged against their camps. 
The GOT immediately closed its border to prevent an additional influx of
refugees into northwest Tanzania, where resources are already overtaxed by
the presence of more than 700,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees, and
resulting security and environmental concerns prevail.  UNHCR and other
relief agencies acted promptly to transport these refugees back to camps to
avoid yet another humanitarian crisis.  Additional population flows throughout
Burundi, both towards the Zairian and Tanzanian borders, have highlighted
the need to ensure that ample supplies of potable water and food commodities
are available in the region.  WFP, with contributions from the USG, is
currently undertaking efforts to improve Tanzania's road and rail
infrastructure to ensure that adequate relief supplies can be delivered into
the region to meet the current needs of the refugee populations, as well as
any emergency needs in the future.

USG Humanitarian Assistance
The USG has coordinated its relief efforts with the international donor
community to respond to the needs of disaster victims in Burundi.  Since the
crisis began on October 21, 1993, the total USG contribution is $35,708,549. 
BHR/OFDA funding has assisted Burundian IDPs, and has been channelled to
NGOs and U.N. agencies implementing programs in Burundi.  BHR/OFDA has
funded projects to provide emergency food and non-food commodities, shelter,
and health services to the Burundian IDP population.   On July 1, 1994,
USAID/BHR/OFDA Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) for Rwanda
established a field office in Bujumbura to conduct assessments of northern
Burundi to determine humanitarian conditions of the Burundian displaced and
Rwandan refugees, as well as to ascertain the level of security in the area. 
(See also USAID/BHR/OFDA Rwanda Situation Reports.  To date, BHR/OFDA has
provided over $7,765,712 million in FY94 and FY95 to assist NGO and U.N.

DISTRICTS  AND  RENDERED 75,000 PEOPLE HOMELESS, OF WHICH 71% ARE WOMEN AND
CHILDREN.



  2.     THE MOST AFFECTED DISTRICTS ARE :

  ADEWUI           BE                   KEGUE
  AFLAO-GAKALI     CASSABLANCA          KLIKAME

                      HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN RWANDA

                    25 July 1995                   No. 13
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               ---------------
        The information contained in this report was provided by the
          United Nations Rwanda Emergency Office in Kigali (UNREO)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               ---------------


    OVERVIEW

  The humanitarian situation has continued to improve and security is
  reported  to  be  generally  satisfactory  throughout most parts of
  Rwanda.   However,  a number of worrying trends underscore both the
  fragility  of conditions and the complexity of problems still to be
  faced.  Two of the most disturbing developments relate to increased
  infiltration  and  targeted  murders  by  the  former government in
  Rwanda  and  increased  acts  of  violence  by  organised  gangs of
  hardliners against people suspects of genocide.

  UNHCR  has recently restarted repatriation from Goma, Zaire and has
  signed  a  Tripartite  Agreement  with  Tanzania and Rwanda for the
  organised  voluntary  return  of refugees from Tanzania.  There are
  also  some indications that repatriation on a larger scale may also
  be  possible  from  Burundi.  The reintegration of former displaced
  persons  in  some  areas,  however, remains problematic and without
  solutions  to  the  continued  high  rate of arrests, the appalling
  conditions  in  prisons  and  slow  progress  on the justice front,
  successful repatriation and reconciliation will not be possible.


  SECURITY

  Reports  of infiltration, targeted violence, including sabotage and
  murders   by  agents  of  the  former  government  have  increased,
  particularly  in areas bordering Zaire and Burundi.  Two government
  officials  have recently been murdered in Bugarama in the southwest
  of  the  country.  Both were Hutu moderates and known supporters of
  the Rwandan Government and its policies of reconciliation.  Acts of
  banditry,   allegedly   involving  people  from  refugee  camps  or
  Interhamwe,  meanwhile,  are  now reported almost on a daily basis.
  There  have  also  been  a  number  of incidents in the Gisenyi and
  Kibuye  areas  in northwest Rwanda where key installations, such as
  water  and  power plants have been sabotaged.  The deaths and other
  violent  acts are believed to be part of a terror campaign designed
  to terrorise the Rwandese people and destabilise the country.

  To  counter  the  infiltration,  watch groups of civilians, working
  closely  with the RPA, have been formed in villages and towns along
  border  areas.  In some areas, MILOBS report that this has resulted
  in marked decrease in the number of security incidents.

  Reports continue to be received, particularly from the Butare area,
  of   human   rights  abuses  perpetrated  by  organised  groups  of
  hardliners.  These abuses include violent attacks, beatings, murder
  and  disappearances  of  mostly  former  camp populations.  Some of
  these  groups are said to have affiliations with local authorities.
  NGOs  have  also  reported  a  growing number of people arriving at
  hospitals and other medical centres with machete wounds.


  DISPLACED PERSONS

  Efforts are still under way to review the situation in the communes
  and  to  trace former camp populations following the forced closure
  of  IDP camps in April.  Based on registration figures, it is clear
  that  a larger number of people from the camps have not returned to
  their   communes,   but   continue   to  be  in  hiding  either  in
  conflict-affected areas of Burundi or within Rwanda.

  Reports  from  local  authorities in some areas, such as Gikongoro,
  indicate  that former displaced people have also turned up in areas
  from  where  they  did  not  originate.   As  reported  in the last
  situation  update,  monitoring  by  MILOBS  and  Human Rights field
  officers  in the communes have revealed a very mixed situation.  In
  some   areas,   people  have  reintegrated  well,  and  often  with
  assistance   from   the   communes,  are  engaged  in  agricultural
  activities.   In  other  areas,  reintegration is being hampered by
  housing  and  land  shortages.   Disputes  over land and homes have
  become  acute  in  the Butare area and have also led to violence or
  false  accusations  of  genocide.  As reported under security there
  have  also  been  increased reports of machete attacks, murders and
  disappearances of some of those who returned from the camps.


  REFUGEES

  Prospects  for repatriation of Rwandese from neighbouring countries
  have  appeared  more  encouraging,  with the recent spontaneous and
  organised  arrival  of  refugees  from Burundi, Zaire and Tanzania.
  Although  the  majority  of returnees to Rwanda continues to be the
  old  case  load,  many  of  whom  have been in exile since the late
  1950's,  a  total  of 6,661 refugees who fled in the events of last
  year  were brought back to Rwanda by UNHCR during July.  There have
  also  been continued reports of other groups arriving spontaneously
  from all three countries, including from Goma, Zaire.

  As  a  result  of these encouraging signs, on 5 July, UNHCR resumed
  its  voluntary repatriation programme for Rwandese refugee camps in
  Goma.   A  tripartite  agreement  has  also been recently signed by
  Rwanda,  Tanzania  and UNHCR for the repatriation from Tanzania and
  confidence-building  measures  have been stepped up in Burundi.  As
  part  of  these  measures,  refugees  in camps in Burundi have been
  assisted  to  return  to  Rwanda  to  see  conditions in their home
  communes  and there have been visits by senior Rwandese and Burundi
  Government  officials  to  the camps.  The camps in Goma hold about
  721,000  of more than one million Rwandese who fled to Zaire a year
  ago.   Tanzania hosts another 600,000 Rwandese refugees and Burundi
  195,000.


  PRISONS

  The  situation  regarding  overcrowding  in prisons has now reached
  nightmare  proportions.  Following  a  decrease  in  the  number of
  arrests in late May, the number of people being detained on charges
  of  genocide  is  once more in the region of 1,000 to 1,500 a week.
  More  than  49,000  are currently incarcerated in some 210 prisons,
  detention  centres  and  cachots.  Over 10,000 are in Kigali prison
  which  was built to hold a maximum of 2,000 people.  Although there
  are  no  exact  figures for the whole country, it is estimated that
  the  death  rate  each  month, largely due to overcrowding, is more
  than  300.   In  some prisons, there are as many as four people per
  square meter.
   A  new  detention  centre  for  5,000 prisoners is presently under
  construction  and  should  be  completed  by  late August.  UNDP is
  funding  the security installations and ICRC is providing tents and
  most   of   the   internal   facilities.   A  special  Presidential
  Commission,   comprising   government   officials  and  ICRC,  have
  identified  other  temporary  facilities which can eventually house
  some  26,000  detainees.  The US$ 1 million project, funded through
  the   Secretary-General's  Trust  Fund,  to  rehabilitate  existing
  prisons  is  presently  underway  but  work  is  hampered  by sheer
  overcrowding.

  The restoration of the judicial system, meanwhile, remains slow and
  no  courts are yet functioning for crimes related to genocide.  The
  Commissions of Triage, established to review cases and speed up the
  release of people when there is insufficient evidence to hold them,
  is  far  from  fully  operational  and  the  number of releases has
  remained low.

  In  July, however, over 150 child prisoners aged 7 to 14 years were
  moved  from  prisons  to a newly rehabilitated children's detention
  centre.   Some  of these children had been sexually abused.  At the
  centre they will be provided with education and skills training.


  MUTARA

  During  the  last few months the humanitarian community has closely
  monitored   the  developing  situation  in  the  Mutara  region  of
  northeast  Rwanda,  where cattle overpopulation and a lack of water
  have  raised  fears  of a potential disaster during the dry season.
  Unseasonably  late  and  heavy  rains  in the region have helped to
  mitigate  the  problems  expected  due  to  lack of water, and have
  contributed  to an unusually good harvest season.  As a result, few
  problems  are now expected with food supply in the region, although
  WFP, FAO, and NGOs continue to closely monitor the situation.


    A recently completed census puts the present cattle population of
    the Mutara region at about 25,000.  This is significantly less
    than previous estimates, yet still five times greater than the
    projected carrying capacity of the region.  The comparatively low
    number counted can be attributed in part to recent movements of
    herders and their cattle south into other areas of Rwanda.  Large
    herds have been reported in Bugasera, Kibungo, and as far south
    as Butare.  Livestock experts suggest that the cattle remaining
    in the region will suffer increased health problems and some
    malnutrition, but will survive the dry season.  However, the
    present overgrazing is causing increasing environmental
    degradation, rapidly reducing the carrying capacity of the land.
    It hence is urgent that durable solutions to the cattle
    overpopulation in this region are found.


    EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS

    In view of the instability across the Great Lakes and the
    possibilities of new sudden emergencies, UNREO is continuing to
    work with the UN Resident Coordinator in Rwanda to establish a
    Disaster Management Team for contingency planning.  The DMT will
    forge links with appropriate Rwandan Government ministries and
    NGOs both for contingency planning and to carry out joint
    assessments. Some NGOs, on their own initiative, have already
    formed an informal group to identify available resources and
    develop contingency plans on a regional basis.

  13 AUGUST. OF THESE ONLY 37 WERE FELT BY THE RESIDENTS, THE LARGEST
  OCCURRING  AT  2:22 AM ON THE 13TH AND RECORDING A MAGNITUDE OF 3.5
  ON THE RICHTER SCALE. THE EPICENTRE OF THE CLUSTER OF QUAKES PLACED
  THEM BELOW THE ST. GEORGES HILL, NORTH EAST OF THE VOLCANO. EXPERTS
  HAVE  STATED HOWEVER THAT THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY
  AT ST. GEORGES HILL.

  3.      THE CURRENT ALERT REMAINS AT THE ORANGE LEVEL (MOBILIZATION
  OF  PERSONNEL  AND  EQUIPMENT  FOR  POSSIBLE  EVACUATION), WHICH IS
  CONSIDERED  TO BE ADEQUATE AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER THE TEAM OF US AND
  CARIBBEAN  SCIENTISTS  BASED  AT  A LOCALLY ESTABLISHED OBSERVATORY
  CONTINUE  TO  MONITOR THE SITUATION ON A 24 HOUR BASIS. IN ADDITION
  TO   MONITORING   INSTRUMENTS   THAT  HAVE  BEEN  INSTALLED,  DAILY
  RECONNAISSANCE OVERFLIGHTS OF THE VOLCANO HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE.

  4.       THE  EMERGENCY  OPERATIONS CENTRE (EOC) IS ALSO MONITORING
  THE  SITUATION  ON  A  24  HOUR  BASIS. RESIDENTS ARE BEING UPDATED
  THROUGH  FREQUENT NEWS RELEASES AND BY STATEMENTS FROM THE GOVERNOR
  AND CHIEF MINISTER.

  5.      ON  AUGUST 9TH,  JUST OVER 400 PERSONS WERE REPORTED HOUSED
  IN 9 SHELTERS IN THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND. THE REDUCTION IN ACTIVITY
  HAS  SINCE  THEN  PERMITTED  THE GOVERNMENT TO REDUCE THESE NUMBERS
  SIGNIFICANTLY.  MEANWHILE  CONTINGENCY  PLANS  FOR POSSIBLE FURTHER
  EVACUATION CONTINUE TO BE REFINED AT THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS.
  PREPARATION  OF  AN  EVACUATION  SITE IN THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND IS
  UNDERWAY. AN ALTERNATE EOC HAS ALSO BEEN ESTABLISHED AND AN ADVANCE
  LIAISON TEAM HAS BEEN STATIONED IN THE NORTH.

  6.      AT  THE  REGIONAL  LEVEL  AN  INTERAGENCY COORDINATING TEAM
  (IACT)   BASED  IN  ANTIGUA  HAS  BEEN  ESTABLISHED  TO  COORDINATE
  PREPARATIONS  FOR  A POSSIBLE EVACUATION TO ANTIGUA. THE GOVERNMENT
  OF  ANTIGUA  AND BARBUDA CONTINUES TO DEVELOP ITS PREPAREDNESS PLAN
  FOR  HOSTING EVACUEES. THE CDERA COORDINATING UNIT AND THE NATIONAL
  DISASTER  ORGANISATIONS  (NDOS)  OF  PARTICIPATING STATES HAVE BEEN
  ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PREPAREDNESS MEASURES.


  7.      THE  BRITISH GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN PLAYING A LEAD ROLE IN THE
  RESPONSE  AND  HAS  PROVIDED  OR  FINANCED  MOST  OF  THE  EXTERNAL
  ASSISTANCE.  SEVERAL OTHERS ARE ON STANDBY TO ASSIST IF NECESSARY.

                           INFORMATION REPORT NO.9
                                21 JULY 1995

  SITUATION

  1.      THE  OVERALL  SITUATION  IN  THE  FLOODED  AREA  AROUND THE
  BRAHMAPUTRA  BASIN (FROM CHILMARI TO ARICHA) IS IMPROVING. HOWEVER,
  THE  BRAHMAPUTRA  STILL CONTINUES TO FLOW ABOVE THE DANGER LEVEL AT
  ARICHA.

  2.      IN  THE GANGES BASIN, THE RIVERS ARE RISING STEADILY AT ALL
  POINTS  AS  EXPECTED  AND  CONTINUES  TO FLOW ABOVE DANGER LEVEL AT
  GOALUNDO AND BHAGYAKUL. AREAS DOWNSTREAM FROM GOALUNDO TO MADARIPUR
  HAVE  BEEN INUNDATED AND ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN SO FOR THE NEXT FEW
  DAYS.

  3.      IN  THE  LOWER  PART OF THE MEGHNA BASIN, AREAS IN COMILLA,
  BRAHMANBARIA,  NARSINGDI,  MUNSHIGANJ,  NARAYANGANJ  AND  LOW LYING
  AREAS  OF  DHAKA  WERE  INUNDATED.  THE  SITUATION  HAS  STARTED TO
  IMPROVE;  HOWEVER, LOW LYING AREAS AROUND DHAKA AND NARAYANGANJ ARE
  EXPECTED  TO  REMAIN  INUNDATED  FOR  QUITE  SOME TIME AS THE WATER
  NORMALLY RECEDES AT A SLOWER PACE.

  4.      IT  HAS  BEEN  PROJECTED  BY  THE BANGLADESH METEOROLOGICAL
  DEPARTMENT  THAT  THE  NORTH-WESTERN  PART  OF THE GREATER RAJSHAHI
  DIVISION  IS  TO  EXPERIENCE  HEAVY  RAINFALLS DURING THE FIRST TWO
  WEEKS  OF  AUGUST.  NORMAL  MONSOON  IS EXPECTED IN THE BRAHMAPUTRA
  BASIN  IN  THE  NEXT  2-3  WEEKS. THE GOVERNMENT PREDICTED THAT THE
  BRAHMAPUTRA  IS  LIKELY  TO  EXPERIENCE ANOTHER PEAK AT BAHADURABAD
  DURING  THE  SECOND  WEEK  OF  AUGUST.  THIS IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO A
  SYNCHRONIZATION  WITH  HIGH  RIVER  LEVELS  IN THE GANGES FOR SHORT
  DURATION.

  NATIONAL RESPONSE

  5.      PRIME  MINISTER  SAID  THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE THE
  FARMERS  WITH  SEEDLINGS  FREE OF COST AND HOUSE BUILDING GRANTS TO
  FLOOD  HIT  POOR  PEOPLE. GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO TAKE STEPS TO REPAIR
  THE  DAMAGED TUBEWELLS AND EMBANKMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STRUCK AREAS.
  RELIEF GOODS WERE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE AFFECTED PEOPLE.

  6.      RELIEF  OPERATIONS  IN  DAMAGED  AREAS ARE STILL CONTINUING
  UNDER  THE  AEGIS OF THE MINISTRY OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT AND RELIEF
  IN  CONJUNCTION WITH THE BANGLADESH RED CRESCENT SOCIETY. NGOS HAVE
  ALSO GEARED UP THEIR RELIEF ACTIVITIES IN THE AFFECTED AREAS.

   7.     THE  ASSOCIATION FOR DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (ADAB) CONVENED A
  MEETING TO REVIEW THE SITUATION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE EXTENT OF
  FLOODING  AND  FLOOD  DAMAGE  HAS LED TO THE WORST SITUATION IN THE
  LAST SEVERAL YEARS. ADAB AND THE NGO REPRESENTATIVES PRESENT AT THE
  MEETING  REQUESTED  DONORS TO COME FORWARD AND ASSIST NGOS IN THEIR
  RELIEF AND REHABILITATION EFFORT.

  8.      IN  VIEW  OF  THIS  SITUATION,  A LARGER DONOR COORDINATION
  MEETING  WILL  BE HELD ON 25 JULY TO APPRAISE DONORS OF THE OVERALL
  SITUATION  AS  WELL AS THE PROGNOSIS FOR THE REST OF THE VULNERABLE
  PERIOD OF THE MONSOON SEASON TILL THE END OF SEPTEMBER.

  9.      AS  YET,  NO  REQUEST FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE
  GOVERNMENT  HAS  BEEN  RECEIVED.  DHA/UNDP  RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE
  CONTINUES TO MONITOR SITUATION.

  OF DHA INFORMATION REPORT NO. 11).

  3.      APPROXIMATELY  4,000  EVACUEES ARE STILL BEING SHELTERED IN

  CDERA IN RESPONSE ACTION AND PROVIDING LISTS OF ESSENTIAL DRUGS AND
  SUPPLIES, HEALTH MESSAGES FOR THE POPULATION AND WRITTEN GUIDELINES
  FOR  THE  MEDIA  ON  THE  VOLCANIC  ACTIVITY. AT THE REQUEST OF THE
  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH  OF MONTSERRAT, PAHO PREPARED MEDICAL SUPPLIES
  FOR  A  SPEEDY  DISPATCH  TO  MONTSERRAT  IF  NECESSARY.  PAHO ALSO
  DISPATCHED  TWO  SUMA  TEAM  MEMBERS TO BE PART OF THE INTER-AGENCY
  COORDINATION  TEAM  IN  ANTIGUA  FOR  LOGISTIC  SUPPORT IN SUPPLIES
  MANAGEMENT.  TWO  STAFF  MEMBERS  FROM  THE  EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
  DISASTER RELIEF COORDINATION PROGRAM (PED) ARE PRESENTLY IN ANTIGUA

                 FOR PERSONS DISPLACED AS A RESULT OF THE
                     EMERGENCY SITUATION IN CHECHNYA,
                            RUSSIAN FEDERATION

                  SITUATION REPORT OF THE DHA COORDINATOR
              BASED ON FIELD REPORTS AND COVERING THE PERIOD
                          28 JULY-31 AUGUST 1995
 

    GENERAL

  A  MILITARY  AGREEMENT  SIGNED  ON  30 JULY 1995 IS GENERALLY BEING
  RESPECTED,  ALTHOUGH  NUMEROUS  INCIDENTS  HAVE BEEN REPORTED.  THE
  AGREEMENT  PROVIDED  FOR  DISARMAMENT  OF  THE CHECHEN FIGHTERS AND
  WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN FEDERAL FORCES.  CHECHEN FIGHTERS HAVE HANDED
  IN  A QUANTITY OF LIGHT WEAPONS AND THE FIRST WITHDRAWAL OF RUSSIAN
  FORCES,  FROM THE VILLAGE OF ASSINOVSKAYA, HAS COMMENCED.  EXCHANGE
  OF PRISONERS HAS NOT YET STARTED.

  THE  POLITICAL  AGREEMENT  ON  THE  FUTURE  OF  CHECHNYA, WHICH WAS
  SUPPOSED  TO  FOLLOW  THE  MILITARY  AGREEMENT,  HAS  NOT  YET BEEN
  REACHED.   PRESIDENT  YELTSIN  HAS  APPOINTED  THE SECRETARY OF THE
  NATIONAL  SECURITY COUNCIL, MR. OLEG LOBOV, AS SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL
  ENVOY TO CHECHNYA WITH THE TASK OF OVERSEEING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
  THE MILITARY AGREEMENT AND STABILISING THE SITUATION.  HE WILL HAVE
  FULL  POWERS  OVER  ALL  OTHER  FEDERAL  AUTHORITIES  IN  THE AREA.
  PRESIDENT  YELTSIN  HAS  ALSO  EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE
  PERSONALLY IN NEGOTIATIONS, AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME.

  IN  SPITE  OF  THE CEASE-FIRE CALLED FOR BY THE MILITARY AGREEMENT,
  REPEATED   SHELLING   WAS  HEARD  BY  UN  STAFF  IN  SLEPTSOVSKAYA,
  INGUSHETIA  WHILE  SHELLING  AND  FIRING  WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE
  DIRECTION OF BAMUT, IN SOUTHWEST CHECHNYA, NEAR THE INGUSH BORDER.

  IN  DAGHESTAN,  FOUR  BORDER  GUARDS  AND  EIGHT DAGHESTANI SPECIAL
  POLICE   ("OMON")   WERE  REPORTEDLY  KILLED  BY  CHECHEN  FIGHTERS
  ATTEMPTING TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO BOTLIKH.

  TWO  CHILDREN  WERE  INJURED AND ONE KILLED BY MINE EXPLOSIONS NEAR
  THE VILLAGE OF SHUSHA, IN THE BORDER AREA.

  THE  QUESTION OF HANDING IN ARMS IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO THE
  UNITED  NATIONS  IN  THE SERNOVODSKAYA AREA OF INGUSHETIA, WHERE UN
  HUMANITARIAN  RELIEF IS BEING PROVIDED.  THE AREA IS MARKED ON MAPS
  AS BEING PART OF INGUSHETIA; ITS POPULATION IS LARGELY CHECHEN, AND
  APPARENTLY    BOTH   THE   INGUSH   GOVERNMENT  AND  THE  TEMPORARY
  ADMINISTRATION  IN CHECHNYA HAVE AGREED THAT THE AREA SHOULD REVERT
  TO CHECHNYA.  THE CHECHEN FLAG WAS RECENTLY RAISED IN ASSINOVSKAYA,
  AND  CHECHEN  FIGHTERS,  WHO  HAVE  FREQUENTLY SOUGHT REFUGE IN THE
  AREA, STILL HAVE THEIR WEAPONS.

  INSIDE  CHECHNYA,  IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT 244 LIGHT WEAPONS, BUT
  NO  HEAVY WEAPONS, HAVE BEEN HANDED IN BY CHECHEN FIGHTERS.  IT WAS
  ALSO REPORTED THAT THE CITY OF GROZNY IS NOW FULL OF ACTIVITY.

  ARMED  MEN  BROKE  INTO  THE  ICRC OFFICE IN KHASAVYURT (DAGHESTAN)
  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD AND STOLE EVERYTHING, INCLUDING MEDICAL
  SUPPLIES  AND  SATELLITE RADIO EQUIPMENT.  UNKNOWN PERSONS FIRED AN
  ANTI-TANK  GRENADE  AT  THE  RESIDENCE  OF  THE  PRIME  MINISTER OF
  DAGHESTAN; NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED.

  UNHCR  MOVED  ITS  OFFICE  TO  MORE SECURE PREMISES IN MAKHACHKALA,
  WHICH  WILL  ALSO  ACCOMMODATE  WFP  AND  A UNICEF EXPERT IN TRAUMA
  RELIEF.   EXCEPT  FOR  THIS ONE CONTINUING ACTIVITY, UNICEF HAS NOW
  COMPLETED ITS PROGRAMME IN DAGHESTAN.

  AN  AUDIT  OF  THE  UNHCR  OFFICE IN MAKHACHKALA WAS CARRIED OUT BY
  UNITED NATIONS EXTERNAL AUDITORS.


  TARGET POPULATION

  A  DHA/UNHCR  MISSION  WHICH  VISITED INGUSHETIA, NORTH OSSETIA AND
  DAGHESTAN FROM 12 TO 20 AUGUST CONCLUDED THAT THE PRESENT NUMBER OF
  IDPS  IN  INGUSHETIA  WAS 67,000; IN NORTH OSSETIA THERE WERE 5,000
  WHILE  IN  DAGHESTAN THERE WERE 50,000.  IT WAS THUS ESTIMATED THAT
  THE  TOTAL  NUMBER  OF  IDPS  WAS  122,000.   IT WAS NOTED THAT, IN
  ADDITION  TO  THIS,  THERE  WERE 32,000 IDPS IN INGUSHETIA FROM THE
  PRIGORODNY  DISTRICT  OF  NORTH  OSSETIA,  AND 35,000 REFUGEES FROM
  GEORGIA IN NORTH OSSETIA.

  IT  SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A SURVEY OF BENEFICIARIES IN INGUSHETIA BY
  UNHCR FIELD STAFF IS STILL UNDER WAY.

  THERE  HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF RETURNS IN RECENT WEEKS; IN
  THE  UPDATE  TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONSOLIDATED INTER-AGENCY APPEAL
  FOR  PERSONS  DISPLACED  AS  A RESULT OF THE EMERGENCY SITUATION IN
  CHECHNYA,  IT  WAS  ESTIMATED  THAT  THE  TOTAL  NUMBER  OF IDPS IN
  INGUSHETIA, NORTH OSSETIA AND DAGHESTAN WAS 175,000.

  IN  INGUSHETIA,  NEW  CRITERIA  HAVE  BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE LOCAL
  MIGRATION  SERVICE  FOR  RECOGNITION  AS  AN IDP;  THESE CONDITIONS
  INCLUDE PROOF OF PROPERTY DESTRUCTION IN CHECHNYA.

  THE  DAGHESTAN  MIGRATION  SERVICE HAS RECEIVED AN INSTRUCTION FROM
  THE  FEDERAL  MIGRATION  SERVICE TO CONSIDER GRANTING THE STATUS OF
  "FORCED  MIGRANT"  TO  SELECTED  IDPS,  WHO  REPORTEDLY  MUST BE OF
  DAGHESTANI BACKGROUND TO QUALITY.


  INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION

  AS  MENTIONED  ABOVE, A DHA/UNHCR MISSION VISITED INGUSHETIA, NORTH
  OSSETIA  AND  DAGHESTAN  FROM  12 TO 20 AUGUST 1995 AND CONDUCTED A
  REVIEW  OF  THE PROGRAMME ON THE BASIS OF INTER-AGENCY DISCUSSIONS.
  THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW WILL BE COMMUNICATED TO THE INTER-AGENCY
  NIS  TASK  FORCE  AND  TO  A DONORS MEETING WHICH WILL BE HELD ON 4
  OCTOBER IN GENEVA.

  UNICEF CLOSED ITS OFFICE IN MAKHACHKALA AT THE END OF AUGUST, AFTER
  COMPLETING   ITS  DISTRIBUTION  OF  UNICEF  RELIEF  SUPPLIES.  (THE
  DISTRIBUTION OF CHILDREN'S FOOTWEAR WILL BE HANDLED BY UNHCR.)  THE
  UNICEF EXPERT IN TRAUMA RELIEF REMAINS IN PLACE.

  IOM  ALSO  CLOSED ITS OFFICE IN DAGHESTAN AT THE END OF AUGUST, AND
  WILL NOW CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS INSIDE CHECHNYA.

  ICRC  ANNOUNCED  THE  ARRIVAL OF SCHOOL MATERIALS WHICH ADDRESS THE
  TOPIC  OF WAR AND PEACE TO ENHANCE RESPECT FOR HUMANITARIAN LAW AND
  HUMAN RIGHTS.

  IN  INGUSHETIA AND NORTH OSSETIA THE FIRST ROUND OF WHEAT FLOUR HAS
  BEEN  COMPLETED,  WITH  473 MTS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH 34 DISTRIBUTION
  POINTS.   THE SECOND ROUND IS NOW UNDERWAY; THE TOTAL QUANTITY WILL
  BE 1,800 MTS.

  75  MTS OF SUGAR HAVE BEEN RECEIVED IN VLADIKAVKAZ AND DISTRIBUTION
  WILL COMMENCE SHORTLY.

  THE  FIRST  THREE OUT OF FIVE RAILWAY WAGONS CARRYING VEGETABLE OIL
  HAVE  REACHED  VLADIKAVKAZ;  THE ARRIVAL  OF THE REMAINING TWO WILL
  MEAN  THAT  ALL SUPPLIES FOR THE PRESENT PHASE OF THE OPERATION  --
  THAT  IS,  NOT  COUNTING  THE  WINTER  PROGRAMME  -- WILL HAVE BEEN
  RECEIVED.

  IN  DAGHESTAN,  40  MTS OF SUGAR ARRIVED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF CUSTOMS
  DELAY  ON THE UKRAINIAN-RUSSIAN BORDER.  THE FIRST DISTRIBUTION OUT
  OF  1,200  MTS  OF  WHEAT  FLOUR HAS BEEN COMPLETED, AND THE SECOND
  COMMENCED WITH SIMULTANEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF SUGAR.

  95  MTS OF VEGETABLE OIL REACHED DAGHESTAN ON 4 SEPTEMBER AFTER THE
  WFP REPRESENTATIVE HAD TRAVELLED TO NOVOROSSIISK PORT WITH A CONVOY
  TO  DEAL  WITH  CUSTOMS  PROBLEMS.  5  MTS WERE DAMAGED AT SEA AS A
  RESULT OF INCORRECT LOADING.

  THERE IS STILL AN URGENT NEED FOR CONTRIBUTIONS FOR WINTER FOOD.

SUDAN - Civil Strife/Displaced Persons

Situation Report #3, Fiscal Year (FY) 1995        July 31, 1995


Background
Fighting began in 1983 between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and
the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) when the southern-based
rebels demanded more influence in the government and protested
the GOS efforts to "Islamize" the Christian and animist south. 
In 1991, the SPLA split into factions, and intensified fighting
between the SPLA factions erupted in areas of the south. 
Civilians throughout the south and the transitional zone (the
area of southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, northern Bahr el
Ghazal, and the northern Upper Nile States) are directly affected
by aerial bombings by the GOS and forced relocations due to
fighting.  Ongoing insecurity and population displacement in the
south and the transitional zone, as well as near Khartoum, have
not only interrupted or destroyed most of the indigenous trading
and productive systems, but have also been a major impediment to
relief efforts.  The United Nations (U.N.) and numerous
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) within and outside the
framework of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) are delivering relief
assistance by airlifts, airdrops, barges, trains, and truck
convoys.  In more secure areas of southern Sudan, efforts to
rehabilitate and restore self-sufficiency have begun.

Numbers Affected
According to U.N. assessments carried out in late 1994, an
estimated 4.25 million war-affected Sudanese will require some
form of relief assistance, including 3.6 million in southern
Sudan, 350,000 in the transitional zone, and 300,000 in camps
outside of Khartoum.  As a result of an improved food security
situation, the numbers of Sudanese requiring food assistance in
1995 is approximately 1.1 million:  720,000  displaced/affected
in southern Sudan; 95,000 displaced in the transitional zone; and
240,000 displaced in the camps outside of Khartoum.  Sudanese are
continuing to flee from southern Sudan because of insecurity and
civil strife.  Currently, there are an estimated 553,000 Sudanese
refugees:  26,000 in the Central African Republic; 330,000 in
Uganda; 50,000 in Ethiopia; 118,000 in Zaire; and 29,000 in
Kenya.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), as of March 1995, Sudan hosted an estimated
600,000 refugees:  400,000 from Eritrea and 200,000 from
Ethiopia.  UNHCR estimated that over the course of 1995, 50,000
Eritrean and 50,000 Ethiopian refugees will be voluntarily
repatriated.  By June 8, over 24,000 Eritreans had been
repatriated under UNHCR's pilot repatriation project.  An
additional 100,000 Eritreans were scheduled to return to their
country between September 1995 and August 1996.  Repatriation of
the Ethiopian refugees is moving very slowly.

Fiscal Year 1995 (to date) . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$41,982,803

Current Situation
The GOS has imposed severe new restrictions on Operation Lifeline
Sudan (OLS) relief deliveries for southern Sudan, including
barring C-130 flights. The C-130 is the principal aircraft used
to deliver relief supplies.  In addition, the GOS has told donors
that the  headquarters for OLS southern Sudan should be moved
from Lokichokio, Kenya, to Sudan. Donors have strongly protested
both steps. The GOS has also banned the head of OLS southern
Sudan from traveling in Sudan.  A complete review and assessment
of OLS  is scheduled to take place in the fall. 

The second cease fire brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter will expire at the end of July.  Former President Carter
traveled to Sudan  July 19-23 where he obtained informal
agreement to extend the cease fire for several weeks.  Although
the cease fire is holding in many areas, localized fighting
continues in southern Sudan.  Bahr el Ghazal has been
particularly problematic.  Militias and SPLA troops continue to
engage in skirmishes while NGOs complain of harassment by local
authorities and militias. 

At the end of May, the GOS took captive two Italian relief
workers and a Sudanese (an SPLA official) who flew to Pariang, in
Upper Nile, without authorization.  In return, the SPLA took
three WFP staff and two GOS officials hostage in Chukudum, in
Eastern Equatoria.  The GOS released the Sudanese in early July
and the two Italian doctors on July 18.  The SPLA subsequently
released all five of its captives a few days later.      
Insecurity along the border with Uganda has disrupted relief
deliveries.  A few NGOs have continued to work in the area, but
most NGOs and UN agencies have temporarily halted operations
along the Gulu-Aroya-Moyo corridor.  In both June and July,
relief activities around Akobo, in Jonglei,  were temporarily
disrupted due to reported militia activity.

Last year's harvests were reported to be the best in five years
in many areas of Sudan, especially in Eastern and Western
Equatoria and in northern Sudan.  The good harvests caused a
significant drop in World Food Program (WFP) planning figures for
food aid beneficiaries in early 1995. The surplus from last year
should enable many areas to get through the dry season, which has
brought harsh conditions to southeastern Sudan, and in particular
to Jonglei, where Akobo, Waat, and Ayod are experiencing drought
conditions. 

Political/Military Situation
A limited cease fire was negotiated by former President Carter to
permit a guinea worm eradication program in areas contested
between the GOS and the SPLA. In late May, in a violation of the
cease fire, the GOS attacked and captured Pariang, a town in
Upper Nile.  Nonetheless, the cease fire has been extended
unofficially and will probably expire in late September.   

On May 16, the GOS arrested Sadiq el Mahdi, former prime minister
of Sudan, and head of the opposition Umma Party.  Mr. El Mahdi is
still in the custody of the GOS, which has not filed any official
charges against him.  

In June, the national Eritrean political party hosted a meeting
of the Sudanese opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in
Asmara.  The meeting united members of several different
opposition groups who agreed to a new leadership structure for
the NDA and to a five-point strategy for the future of Sudan. 
The Eritrean Government broke off diplomatic relations with the
GOS in December 1994, but relations between the Government of
Eritrea and the GOS continue to deteriorate. 

Relations between Egypt and the GOS have also  markedly
deteriorated in recent weeks.  Following the June 26
assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
Egyptian officials accused the Sudanese government of involvement
in the attempt.  There have been skirmishes between Egyptian
military forces and Sudanese police in the disputed border area
of Hala'ib.  Diplomatic relations have also soured;  among other
incidents, both Egyptian officials in Khartoum and Sudanese
officials in Cairo have been attacked and beaten in recent weeks
and the diplomatic corps in both capitals have been reduced to
very small numbers.  
Considerable tensions remain along the Sudan-Uganda border. 
Uganda broke off diplomatic relations with the GOS in April 1995
  

Relief Efforts
Relief efforts continue to be hampered by insecurity in several
areas of Sudan.  There is increased concern particularly
regarding the safety of humanitarian relief planes in southern
Sudan.    

Since May, the Sudanese Government has been progressively
restricting OLS southern Sudan operations.  In early May, the GOS
barred the UN from flying to 12 locations: Maiwut, Pariang,
Pagak, Mayen Abun, Akon, Lietnam, Chukudum, Ikotos, Boma, Pakok,
and Nimule.  The ban persisted throughout May and was accompanied
by increasing GOS rigidity regarding any deviation from the
flight schedule established each month for the following month. 
In June, the GOS lifted the ban on flights to Mayen Abun, Akon,
Kongor, and Lietnam, but insisted that UN flights to these sites
must go through Khartoum, while ICRC flights would have to go
through Juba.  This demand effectively cancelled the flights
because of the complications involved in establishing the new
routes.

In July, the GOS once again banned flights into several locations
(Chukudum, Bomo, Ikotos, Nimule, Pakak, and Mongala) and rerouted
other flights so that they would have to originate from Sudan and
not Kenya.  The GOS also banned the use of  C-130 aircraft for
transport of relief supplies. The C-130s  carry 89-100 per cent
of all food transported to southern Sudan, and are especially
critical during the rainy season which is now beginning. As all
of these restrictions
are in violation of the agreements signed by the UN, the GOS, and
the SPLA, the donor community has strongly protested the GOS
position. As of mid-July, the aircraft were still flying despite
the GOS ruling; however, the Belgian government has temporarily
withdrawn its C-130 from OLS South and the UN has announced its
intention to stop flying.  

For over a year, WFP in Southern Sudan has been experimenting
with a new approach to estimating food needs and to targeting
food aid.  The food economy model for needs assessments involves
a more comprehensive evaluation of a community's food resources,
its coping mechanisms, and its economic strategies.  On the
targeting and distribution side, WFP organizes community based
relief committees, generally comprising 13 members (7 women and 6
men) who are responsible for setting eligibility criteria and for
organizing food distributions.   Field observers report that the
new assessment, targeting, and distribution systems have enabled
led to significant decreases in relief deliveries.  

These more accurate targeting techniques have enabled WFP to
lower estimates for cereal requirements for FY 1995 for southern
Sudan from 21,557 MT to 15,911 MT. In April, May, and June a
total of 6,394 MT was delivered by air to locations in southern
Sudan, while 1,963 was delivered by road. To date, WFP has
delivered a total of 5,300 MT of food by barge to locations in
southern Sudan in FY 1995.  A seventh barge was scheduled to make
3,600 MT of food deliveries along the Juba-Adok corridor in July.

Surpluses from last year's harvest have provided a cushion
against a bad season in many areas.  Nonetheless there is growing
concern about a belt extending from Upper Nile down through
Eastern Equatoria into Kenya.  Rainfall in June and July has been
far below average and maize and sorghum plantings have already
been adversely affected. If the drought continues, it could bring
serious crop failure.

The European Union (EU) announced a six month  extension, until
the beginning of 1996, of air transport services sponsored by the
EU Humanitarian Aid Office.  The additional funds will pay for
transportation of relief supplies between Nairobi and Lokichokio,
and Lokichokio and southern Sudan. 

NGOs continue to have difficulties carrying out relief activities
in northern Sudan.  In Khartoum, the Federal Ministry of Social
Planning had indicated an interest in meeting with NGOs and had
promised a new policy paper on  treatment of NGOs.  Neither
initiative has been realized, and donors believe that the GOS is,
if anything, dealing more harshly with NGOs, the ICRC, and UN
agencies.  



Situation by Region
The South
Equatoria
Security difficulties persist in Equatoria.  
In Juba, the GOS has further restricted the movement of
expatriates from ICRC, the UN, and NGOs, and has recently decided
that expatriates can no longer use Juba to exit Sudan, but
instead must go through Khartoum.  Relief workers may only travel
between their living quarters and their places of work, and must
get permits to go to outlying villages.  Food conditions in Juba
are worsening and there are reports that people have died from
consuming treated seed meant for planting.

After the February SPLA/M raid on Labone, NGOs returned to the
two displaced persons camps in March to reestablish relief operations.  In late June, Catholic Relief Services (CRS) workers
were attacked by SPLA soldiers when they attempted to stop the
diversion to Uganda of a CRS truck carrying 7-8 MT of vegoil and
sorghum. In response, CRS shut down operations in Labone until
August and reduced the rations going to Labone because of
continuing diversions.  In addition, CRS demanded that the SPLA
commit itself to preventing such diversions before CRS will
reopen its trucking operations. 

Relief activity along the corridor from northern Uganda to
southern Sudan has slowed considerably as a result of increasing
security incidents on both sides of the border.  The insecurity
has disrupted delivery of relief supplies to Mangalatore
displaced persons (DP) camp.  American Refugee Committee (ARC)
will undertake a nutritional survey in Mangalatore in the coming
weeks. 

Norwegian Peoples' Aid staff report that thousands of Dinka are
leaving Mundri area camps in Western Equatoria and heading home
to Bor county, and that they need assistance. 

Upper Nile
The SPLA/United (SPLA/U), headed by Lam Akol hijacked a WFP barge
on May 8, taking several hostages, and stealing all the personal
property of the crew and passengers, the food, and the UNICEF
seeds and tools on board.  The SPLA/U claimed that the barge was
passing through its territory without proper notification and
that therefore it was entitled to take the barge.  The SPLA also
complained that the UN was not delivering food to its area, and
that it was entitled to the same treatment as the relief arms of
the SPLM and the SSIM.  

UN officials viewed the hijacking of the boat as primarily an
effort by the SPLA/U to gain more political power.  UN
representatives told the SPLA/U that it would have to return the
personal and relief items it had stolen, and provide assurance
that the food had been distributed to needy people. In addition,
the UN representatives said that they would try to notify the
SPLA/U of barge movements in the future, and that they would
ensure that the needs of the population in SPLA/U territory were
being met.  The UN refused to give the SPLA/U funding to start a
relief agency, or to give in to other SPLA/U demands. 

In June, relief workers were evacuated from Akobo, Ayod, Waat,
and Yuai due to insecurity following cattle raids and skirmishes.

In July, the murder of a senior SPLA commander by militia
soldiers led to another evacuation. 

Bahr el Ghazal
In June, a GOS supply train was attacked by SPLA near Wau.  This
incident provoked a round of fighting that compelled relief
workers to temporarily evacuate the area. Save the Children UK
suspended its operations in northern Bahr el Ghazal in June and
early July due to difficulties with both local authorities and
troops.  As of mid-July, SCF/UK was negotiating new ground rules
for its activities with the SPLM authorities. 

In contrast to its neighbors to the East, Bahr el Ghazal got
relatively good rains in June and July.  Field observers predict
a good harvest if farmers can harvest their crops without
worrying about fighting interrupting them.  

Transition Zone
South Kordofan
In May, the South Kordofan Government returned 1,300 MT of food
commodities to SCF/US in exchange for 766 MT of food  that had
been stolen in February by the South Kordofan Peace and
Resettlement Agency (PRA).  The South Kordofan authorities agreed
to provide SCF/US with a total of 1,600 MT of food, the
equivalent in current market value of the food which had been
stolen. Although the South Kordofan Government took several weeks
to return the food, both it and the GOS showed an unusual degree
of cooperation in helping SCF/US recover the food.

UNICEF has reported an outbreak of measles in DP settlements in
South Kordofan.  According to UNICEF, over 80 children have died
and over 300 cases have been observed.   


South Darfur
In May, WFP allocated approximately 1,500 MT of food to SCF/UK
for distribution in the Ed Daein camps. This was the first batch
of the 3,790 MT of food that WFP will provide SCF/UK for
distribution in the Ed Daein area over the rainy season from June
to September. SCF/UK is also distributing 1,000 MT of groundnut
seed to farmers among the displaced.  The seed is being provided
with the expectation that recipient farmers will return an equal
amount of seed after the harvest.  SCF is allocating drug kits to
health centers in local villages.  The kits are to be used by
both displaced and the local community and the displaced. 
Malaria and diarrhea are the most common diseases in the camp. 
OXFAM/UK is putting boreholes in all the camps where water
facilities are considered insufficient. When the boreholes are
completed, OXFAM will leave.

Over 73,000 people currently live in the ten DP camps that are
located in the Ed Daein region in south Darfur.  Local
authorities would like the DPs either to leave Ed Daein or to
integrate with their hosts.  Local authorities have suggested
that relief may be terminated at the end of the 1995 growing
season;  the DPs say they will not go home unless there is
permanent peace 

Over the last two months, the Ed Daein camps have reported a
mysterious illness that causes swelling of the legs and neck and
often leads to death.  In one camp, 60 people were reported to
have died in 6 weeks.  NGOs have been trying to get into the
camps to conduct an assessment, but have met with resistance from
the GOS. 

The North
Khartoum
The GOS continues extensive demolition campaigns in the displaced
camps in the Khartoum area.  As a result, the displaced camps Dar
al Salam and Jebel Aulia are growing.  The influx is straining
the limited health and nutrition services provided by local and
international NGOs. Dar al Salam is located at a distance of 40
kilometers from Khartoum, where there is little access to food,
water, education, markets, and other services.  Relocations
impact the ability of the displaced to earn an income because
they are resettled at a distance from Khartoum.  The USG has
condemned the demolition campaigns, but more demolitions are
expected since the Minister of Housing announced in December his
intention to remove all unplanned settlements in Khartoum.   The
GOS has recently raised fuel prices significantly.  The price
hike will cause NGOs working in northern Sudan more hardship as
truks are a more important means of transport there than in the
south.   

The Jebel Aulia camp is located in an open area, making it
particularly vulnerable during the rainy season.  An early storm
struck the camp on June 9, destroying houses, damaging health
clinics, schools and workshops.  Several people were injured.  A
recent assessment performed by Adventist Development and Relief
Agency International (ADRA)  showed that malnutrition has
increased in the camp over the last four years, despite an
ongoing food aid program.  The malnutrition is due to a number of
factors, including political constraints and environmental
conditions. Residents urgently need ways to generate income and
cash.   

A recent assessment by an International Rescue Committee (IRC)
team of the DP camp at En Nahud suggested that conditions in the
camp had much improved since the beginning of the year.  In
particular, monitoring of feeding programs, camp management and
health care have all gotten better.  A shortage of anti-
tubercular drugs has been rectified, but the assessment team
called for better TB diagnosis and follow-up procedures.  The
team also recommended that an evaluation of the feeding program
be conducted. There are an estimated 7,500 persons in the camp.  


Assistance Provided by the U.S. Government 
On October 1, 1994, U.S. Ambassador Donald Petterson renewed the
civil strife/displaced persons disaster in Sudan, determining
that USG relief assistance would be needed for FY 1995.   Thus
far in FY 1995, the USG has provided $41,982,803 in relief
assistance.  USG relief assistance to Sudan is provided through
USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, USAID's
Office of Food for Peace (FFP), and the State Department's Bureau
for Population, Refugee, and Migration (PRM).

Two BHR/OFDA personal services contractors (PSCs) work in
Khartoum and in the Sudan Field Office in Nairobi, Kenya.  The
PSCs monitor and coordinate the distribution activities of WFP,
OLS, other NGOs, and international donors, and report on
humanitarian relief issues.

                 SITUATION REPORT NO. 2 - GUYANA
                    CYANIDE MINE WASTE SPILL
                         (23 AUGUST 1995)


1. THE PRESIDENT OF GUYANA, HIS EXCELLENCY CHEDDI JAGAN, HAS
DECLARED THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE RECENT GOLD MINE WASTE SPILL AN
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER ZONE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS REQUESTED
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE.

2. THE GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA ESTIMATES THAT UP TO 1.25 MILLION
CUBIC METRES OF MINING WASTE WITH A CYANIDE CONCENTRATION OF
28PPM HAS ENTERED THE OMAI AND ESSEQUIBO RIVERS. THEY ESTIMATE
THAT A FURTHER 0.75 MILLION CUBIC METRES COULD BE RELEASED.

3. THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS ADVISED ALL RESIDENTS ALONG THE
ESSIQUIBO RIVER, THE MAJOR RIVER IN THE COUNTRY, NOT TO USE WATER
FROM THE RIVER TO DRINK, COOK OR GIVE TO LIVESTOCK NOR TO EAT
FISH.

4. IN A NATIONAL ADDRESS, THE PRESIDENT OF GUYANA OUTLINED STEPS
BEING TAKEN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL INCLUDING: THE DISPATCH OF AN
INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT TEAM AND A HEALTH MINISTRY TEAM TO THE
SITE OF THE SPILL, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONAL MONITORING
TEAM IN BARTICA, THE MONITORING OF WATER AND AQUATIC LIFE IN THE
AREA BETWEEN THE OMAI MINE AND BARTICA, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
AN INTER-AGENCY DISASTER CONTROL COMMITTEE HEADED BY THE PRIME
MINISTER SAM HINDS AND INCLUDING THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, THE
MINISTRIES OF HEALTH, FINANCE, REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER
RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS.

5. THE UNDP OFFICE REPORTS THAT A JOINT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED COMPRISING THE GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA, LOCAL
ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES AND THE OMAI GOLD MINES LIMITED (OGML)
WHO OPERATE THE MINE.

6. OGML REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF INTERNATIONAL
EXPERTS AT OMAI UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER OF THE CANADIAN PARENT COMPANY OF OGML.  THE COMPANY
REPORTS THAT MONITORING DOWNSTREAM OF THE SPILL IN THE ESSEQUIBO
RIVER HAS SUGGESTED A REDUCTION IN CYANIDE LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE
DILUTION FROM THE RIVER.  THEY NOTE THAT, AS OF 15.20UTC AUGUST
21, REPORTS FROM SHERIMA, SEVENTY FIVE KILOMETRES DOWNSTREAM,
SHOW CYANIDE LEVELS OF 0.009 PPM.  THEY FURTHER REPORT THAT AS OF
17.45UTC 21 AUGUST, TOTAL CYANIDE LEVELS WERE MEASURED AT 0.09PPM
FROM THE CONFLUENCE OF THE OMANI AND ESSEQUIBO RIVERS DOWNSTREAM
FOR EIGHT KILOMETRES.  WATER SAMPLES TAKEN ARE BEING SENT
OVERSEAS FOR INDEPENDENT TESTING.

7. OGML REPORT THAT THEY STARTED A FOUR STAGE ACTION PLAN AS OF
23.00UTC AUGUST 21 TO ATTEMPT TO STOP THE FLOW WITHIN 48HOURS.
THE MEASURES INCLUDE INSTALLING PUMPS TO MOVE EFFLUENT FROM THE
DAMAGED TAILINGS POND TO A SECURE MINING PIT, BUILDING A COFFER
DAM TO ARREST THE LEAKAGE FROM THE TAILINGS DAM AND STOP THE
FLOW INTO THE RIVER SYSTEM, FILLING 'SINK HOLES' IN THE DAMAGED
DAM AND INCREASING THE SIZE AND DEPTH OF THE DITCH BEING USED TO
DIVERT WASTE FROM THE TAILINGS POND TO THE MINING PIT.

8. THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT IS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHING TWO
EXPERTS TO THE SITE: ONE TO ADVISE THE GOVERNMENT ON HEALTH
IMPLICATIONS OF THE SPILL AND ONE TO ASSIST IN THE EVALUATION OF
DRINKING WATER QUALITY. TESTING EQUIPMENT IS ALSO BEING
PROVIDED. IN A SECOND PHASE, CANADIAN EXPERTS WILL ADVISE THE
GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA ON MEASURES TO IMPROVE SAFETY OF FUTURE
MINING OPERATIONS.

9. THE PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION (PAHO) REPORTS THAT THEY
ARE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHING AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER TO ASSIST
IN THE RESPONSE.

10.  THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME/DEPARTMENT OF
HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS (UNEP/DHA) ENVIRONMENT UNIT ARE IN CLOSE
LIAISON WITH THE UNDP OFFICE IN GUYANA AND POTENTIAL DONOR
COUNTRIES TO ENSURE COORDINATED INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE.

                DHA-GENEVA SITUATION REPORT NO. 4
                 GUYANA CYANIDE MINE WASTE SPILL
                        (29 August 1995)


1. THE PAN AMERICAN HEALTH ORGANIZATION (PAHO) HAS REPORTED ON A
RECENT MISSION TO THE SITE OF THE RECENT GOLD MINE WASTE SPILL.

2. THE REPORT NOTES THAT AQUATIC LIFE IN THE OMAI CREEK AND AT
THE CONFLUENCE WITH THE ESSEQUIBO RIVER WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED
IN THE SPILL.

3. THE REPORT ALSO NOTES THAT THE SPILL DID INITIALLY POSE SOME
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RISK TO SMALL POPULATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY
100-200 PEOPLE ALONG THE FIRST FORTY KILOMETRES OF THE ESSEQUIBO
RIVER. THE MISSION FOUND THAT WHERE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF
DRINKING WATER WAS NOT AVAILABLE, BOTTLED DRINKING WATER WAS
PROVIDED BY THE MINING COMPANY OMAI GOLD MINES LIMITED (OGML).

4. FURTHER DOWN STREAM BY THE ROCKSTONE RAPIDS THE MISSION FOUND
THAT THERE WILL BE NO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS WITH REGARD
TO THE LEVELS OF CYANIDE DUE TO THE LARGE DISPERSION AND
DILUTION FACTOR AND OXIDISATION OF THE CYANIDE. HOWEVER, THE
DISCOLORATION OF THE WATER BY SUSPENDED CLAY HAS DISCOURAGED THE
USE OF WATER FROM THE ESSEQUIBO.

5. THE MISSION RECORDS THAT FROM PLUME OBSERVATIONS, MIXING OF
THE SPILL WITH THE WATERS OF THE ESSEQUIBO (14.4 MILLION CUBIC
METRES PER HOUR AVERAGE AUGUST FLOW RATE) WOULD HAVE PRODUCED A
DILUTION FACTOR OF 320:1 AT THE TOWN OF BARTICA, SOME 120
KILOMETRES FROM THE SPILL SITE. THE PAHO EXPERT ESTIMATES THAT
THIS DILUTION EFFECT ALONE WOULD REDUCE CYANIDE LEVELS FROM 30PPM
TO 0.094PPM (COMPARED WITH THE WHO GUIDELINE VALUE FOR FREE
CYANIDE OF 0.07PPM AND CANADIAN AND US LIMITS OF 0.2PPM AND
0.15PPM RESPECTIVELY).

6. PAHO FURTHER NOTES THAT THE ACTUAL CONCENTRATION OF CYANIDE IN
THE PLUME WOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN THE 0.07PPM AT BARTICA GIVEN
THAT:
A) IDEAL PLUG FLOW CONDITIONS DO NOT OCCUR, THE PEAK
CONCENTRATION SPREAD OUT OVER A LARGER STRETCH OF THE RIVER,
B) CYANIDE IS NOT A STABLE COMPOUND AND EASILY OXIDIZES AND BREAKS
DOWN IN SUNLIGHT,
C) THE FLOW RATE DECREASED QUICKLY AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF
THE BREACH BECAUSE OF THE REDUCTION IN WATERPRESSURE DUE TO
THE LOWERING OF WATER LEVEL IN THE TAILINGS DAM,AND
D) ONLY 20 PERCENT OF THE CYANIDE LEVELS WERE FREE CYANIDE AND
80 PERCENT THE LESS TOXIC METALLIC CYANIDE.

7. IN A TRIP ON 23 AUGUST TO ALL SETTLEMENTS ALONG THE RIVER FROM
BARTICA TO OMAI, NO CASES OF CYANIDE POISONING NOR DEAD FISH WERE
OBSERVED BY THE PAHO EXPERT.

8. HOWEVER, THE PAHO REPORT NOTES THAT SAMPLING STRATEGIES USED
BY OGML WARRANTED CONCERN. THE PAHO EXPERT IDENTIFIED THAT ONLY
A SINGLE SURFACE SAMPLE WAS TAKEN NEAR SHORE AT DIFFERENT SITES.
THE PAHO REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT SAMPLES SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
AT THREE DIFFERENT POINTS ALONG THE CROSS-SECTION OF THE RIVER,
ABOUT 10M APART AND AT LEAST ONE METRE DEPTH.

                DHA-GENEVA SITUATION REPORT NO 3
                 GUYANA CYANIDE MINE WASTE SPILL
                        (25 AUGUST 1995)


1. THE COMPANY WHICH OWNS THE MINE SUBJECT TO THE RECENT CYANIDE
WASTE SPILL HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE SPILL WAS STOPPED AT 05.00UTC
ON AUGUST 24.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT A TOTAL OF 3.2 MILLION
CUBIC METRES OF TAILINGS WATER WAS RELEASED FROM THE TAILINGS
RESERVOIR OVER THE SPILL PERIOD OF 100 HOURS.

2. AT A COORDINATION MEETING OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HELD
IN GEORGETOWN BY THE DHA/UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE, THE
PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR MR NAVIN CHANDARPAL REPORTED THAT THE
CONTAMINATION HAD PASSED THE TOWN OF BARTICA TOWARDS THE SEA.
FRESH WATER CONTINUES TO BE PROVIDED TO COMMUNITIES ALONG THE
ESSEQUIBO RIVER FROM THE MINE TO BARTICA.

3. THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF THE PARLIAMENT OF GUYANA AGREED A
MOTION ON 24 AUGUST THAT PLACES FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SPILL
ONTO THE OWNERS OF THE MINE AND RESOLVED THAT THE COSTS 'TO
RECTIFY THE SITUATION' WILL BE MET BY OMAI GOLD MINES LIMITED
(OGML). THE MOTION ALSO RESOLVES THAT A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY
WILL BE ESTABLISHED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSES OF THE DISASTER AND
'MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND MODIFICATIONS TO
BE UNDERTAKEN BY OGML TO MINIMISE THE EXPOSURE TO THE ENVIRONMENT
IF UNEXPECTED, UNFORESEEN EVENTS OCCUR.' THE PARLIAMENT NOTED
THAT GOLD MINING OPERATIONS AT OGML WILL ONLY RE-COMMENCE ON A
RESOLUTION BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.

4. OMAI GOLD MINES LIMITED (OGML) REPORT THAT TOTAL CYANIDE
READINGS IN THE ESSEQUIBO RIVER TAKEN ON AUGUST 23 AND 24 SUGGEST
A RAPID REDUCTION IN CYANIDE PRESENCE IN THE WATER.

5. A TEAM OF EXPERTS RETAINED BY THE COMPANY HAVE REPORTED THAT
THE CYANIDE CONCENTRATION IN THE TAILINGS WATER WAS 25 TO 30 PPM
WITH A FREE CYANIDE CONCENTRATION OF 5-6PPM.  THE COMPANY REPORTS
THAT CONTINUOUS MONITORING IN THE ESSEQUIBO RIVER BETWEEN 20
AUGUST AND 24 AUGUST INDICATED LEVELS OF CYANIDE WITHIN THE
DRINKING WATER STANDARDS OF CANADA (0.20PPM) AND THE USA
(0.15PPM).

6. THE COMPANY REPORTS THAT, IN THEIR ESTIMATION, AND ASSUMING
COMPLETE MIXING, THE CONTAMINATED TAILINGS WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN
DILUTED BY THE ESSEQUIBO RIVER (AVERAGE AUGUST FLOW RATE OF 14.4
MILLION CUBIC METRES PER HOUR) BY A FACTOR OF 150-200 TO 1 BY THE
TIME THE DISCHARGE REACHED BARTICA. THE COMPANY NOTES THAT
COMPLETE MIXING DID NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE POLLUTION REACHED
ROCKSTONE, 90KM DOWNSTREAM FROM THE MINE. THEIR MONITORING SHOWS
THAT CYANIDE CONCENTRATIONS REACHED A MAXIMUM OF 0.22 PPM
IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF THE OMAI RIVER. THEY SAY THAT AS THE
SPILL PROCEEDED DOWNSTREAM THE CONCENTRATION OF CYANIDE DECREASED
BY AS MUCH AS TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.

7.  THE DHA/UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE REPORTS THAT THE
GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA ARE SENDING 3 EXPERTS IN DAM SAFETY
AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TO ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT OF GUYANA.

Subject: China: Floods  IFRC  28-Jul-95


International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies
CHINA: FLOODS


Appeal no.	06/95 *		
Situation Report no. 1
Period covered:	July 1995



_______________________________



The record floods in China are not receding and may yet grow
worse. The Chinese Red Cross Society is already providing relief
to victims in seven provinces through its provincial branches
and is working with a Federation co-ordination team on
channelling further assistance, financed by the international
appeal launched on 19 July. So far, however, the appeal has
received only a limited response.

_______________________________





The context



Exceptionally heavy rainfall from June onwards has caused record
floods in central and east China. They have swept across 22 out
of the country's 30 provinces, affecting 100 million people, the
majority in the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Hubei,
Guizhou, Jiangsu and Shandong along the Yangtse River.
Government figures put the number of deaths at 1,179, and
injuries at 26,115, while 5.5 million people have been marooned
by the floodwaters which broke through dams, dykes and
embankments, destroying houses and sweeping away crops, roads
and other infrastructure. 



Fears are growing that the disaster could get worse. Since
floods normally peak in mid-August, at the height of the monsoon
season, water levels could rise still further. In addition, if 
agricultural land remains flooded beyond the end of August, the
next planting season will be threatened and millions of people
will face extreme hardship.



Latest events



The floods are the worst  recorded in China since 1954. In
Jiangxi province 38 counties, or over one third of the province,
are under water. In the province of Jiangsu, according to RCSC
reports, 80% of the land is flooded. This region is particularly
flood prone since water from an area of over 2 million sq.km
drains into the Yangtze and Huai rivers. As a result, some 18
floods have occurred  in the last 45 years. This year, up to 200
mm of rain fell in a single day. Along the middle and lower
Yangtze river 18 sections of dykes, in all some 54.7 km in
length, have collapsed and seven protective embankments been
breached.



Hubei province has suffered similar destruction. Here again,
these are the worst floods since 1954. In early July the town of
Xiaochi was under 2.55 metres of water.  In this province alone
the government

mobilised 1.8 million people to work on reinforcing and
repairing the dams. The maximum recorded rainfall  in this
province in one hour was 119 mm, and in one day, 370 mm. In the
county of Dantu, a quarter of the entire population of 430,000
was mobilised to repair the dykes. The Red Cross branch assisted
with this work.



Volume flow in the Yangtze River reached over 75,500 cubic
metres per second, the second-highest flood peak since 1949.



The table below shows the situation in the seven provinces
targeted by the Federation appeal:



	 	Jiangxi Hunan 	Anhui 	Hubei  	Guizhou Jiangsu Shandong 
No of Deaths 	242 	540 	48 	56 	98 	14 	Awaiting  Update 
Affected population (x 1,000) 	
		2,094 	3,435 	227 	1,320 	692	160 	awaiting update 
Injured 	5,915 	14,582 	318 	1,318 	826 	260 	awaiting update 
Houses damaged (x 10,000)
	 	61 	171 	6 	45 	2 	10 	awaiting update 
Houses destroyed (x 10,000) 	
		14 	38 	4 	17 	1 	2 	awaiting update 


Red Cross/Red Crescent action

Red Cross Society of China (RCSC)  l 

All three assessment teams sent to the most-devastated provinces
by RCSC national headquarters (NHQ) have now reported back,
confirming the priorities of medicines, disinfectants and food
established for the first phase of the relief operation. Over 
CHF 1.6 million in funds have been sent to the provinces. In
addition the NHQ has prepared plans of action for the purchase
of goods by the branches with funds from the Federation appeal,
in accordance with the priorities and phases outlined in the
appeal.



At the provincial level, many RC branches have raised
substantial amounts of money for the purchase of relief
materials. They are working hand in hand with the provincial
authorities with whom the Red Cross has very close ties. In
collaboration with the public health authorities some 1,800 Red
Cross medical teams are operating in the affected areas and have
treated over 250,000 people. 



At the county-branch level, similar efforts to those at the
provincial level are being undertaken. 



International Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies 
l  

The  four-member Federation co-ordination team, whose fourth
member arrived in Beijing one week ago,  is assisting  the RCSC
with the organisation, implementation and monitoring of the
relief operation. Three of the team members are currently in the
flooded areas with CRCS teams. They are expected to return to
Beijing this weekend. The Co-ordination team and the CRCS are
finalising the terms for disbursement of funds.



Purchases and delivery of  relief goods, drawing on the CHF
900,000 already transferred to the RCSC, are now taking place. A
total of 10,400 kg of disinfectants (worth CHF 84,000) are on
their way to five provinces;  337 boxes of medicines (CHF
182,000) have been sent to six provinces; and all provinces have
been instructed to go ahead with the local purchase of rice or
flour,  for a total sum of RMB 800,000 (CHF 112,000).



Other Red Cross & Red Crescent Society Action  l

The Hong Kong Red Cross (a Central Council Branch of the British
Red Cross), which sent members to join the RCSC assessment
teams, has launched a local appeal. The Taiwan Red Cross has
made bilateral donations for flood relief. The Red Cross
Societies of Australia and Canada have also launched appeals to
the public. 



Outstanding needs



All the elements in the appeal have yet to be covered
satisfactorily, and cash is urgently required if the excellent
work the Chinese Red Cross has started in the affected provinces
is to be maintained.



A logistics delegate is needed to work with both the CRCS and
the co-ordination team for a four-month period, starting
immediately (For further details, see the list of open
positions, issued 20 July).



External relations - Government/UN/NGOs/Media



The Federation's co-ordination team has established relations
with a number of Embassies and Representative Offices in Beijing
in order to keep them appraised of the situation.



The RCSC is stepping up its efforts to increase media coverage
of the flood situation and has already succeeded in having
stories appear in the press, including in The People's Daily,
China's biggest newspaper. It has made videos of the floods and
its relief work and has dispatched copies to a number of
National Societies. (The video is available on request from the
Federation Secretariat.) It hopes to repeat this operation,
using material from the Central Chinese Television Station. 



Contributions



See Annex 1 for details.



Conclusion



Despite their immensity, the floods in China have received only
short-lived and limited coverage in the international media.
This lack of coverage probably explains, at least partly, the
very limited response so far to the Federation's appeal despite
its modest target  assistance to just 2% of the estimated 100
million people affected.



To the best of our knowledge, no foreign humanitarian agencies
are providing flood relief assistance on any substantial scale.
And since the Chinese government has not asked for international
aid, assistance from inter-governmental agencies is precluded.
The Red Cross is thus effectively the only channel for providing
aid to some of the millions of people left destitute by this
huge disaster. National Societies are urged to come forward with
generous support and ensure that  the Federation does not fail
those for whom it is a vital lifeline.

                     DHA-GENEVA INFORMATION REPORT NO.4
                               11 AUGUST 1995


  1.    UNDP/DHA  RESIDENT  REPRESENTATIVE REPORTS THAT, AS A RESULT OF THE
RAINS/FLOODS  IN  ALL PROVINCES, INCLUDING AZAD JAMMU AND KASHMIR, NORTHERN
AREAS  AND  FEDERAL  ADMINISTERED  TRIBAL  AREAS,  THE TOLL, AS OF 9 AUGUST
1995,IS:

  HUMAN LIVES LOST:     451             VILLAGES AFFECTED:  4,585

  PERSONS     AFFECTED:         1.255m              AREA    AFFECTED:
  3.472
                                                  (MILLION ACRES)

  HOUSES DEMOLISHED :   55,473          CROPS AFFECTED:     1.126
                                                  (MILLION ACRES)

  HOUSES DAMAGED:  76,982

  CATTLEHEAD  LOST:     15,375


  2.      INCESSANT  RAINS  IN  CERTAIN DISTRICTS HAVE AGGRAVATED THE
  SITUATION  AND  SOME  THE  DAMAGE  INDICATORS ARE CLOSE TO THE PEAK
  LEVEL  OF  THE  FLOODS  OF  1992  AND  1994.  ACCORDING TO DHA/UNDP
  RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE, DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING
  THE REMAINING MONSOON SEASON (UP TO SEPTEMBER ,1995), THE SITUATION
  MAY CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE.

  3.     THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN ORGANIZED ANOTHER VISIT FOR ABOUT
  15 DONORS AND THE UNDP RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVE, TO FLOODED AREAS IN
  THE  GUJRANWALA  DIVISION  OF THE PUNJAB PROVINCE, WHERE THE FLOODS
  WERE   ALREADY   RECEDING,  AND  THE  GOVERNMENT  HAD  HANDLED  THE
  SITUATION.  NEVERTHELESS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN
  ABOUT  THE  STOCKS BEING RUNNING LOW, FEARING FOR ANY RECURRENCE IN
  THE REMAINDER OF THE MONSOON SEASON.

  4.      THE  GOVERNMENT  OF  JAPAN ANNOUNCED TO DHA ITS DECISION TO
  DONATE  USD 300,000 (YEN 29,400,000) FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF PROJECTS,
  AS  WELL  AS  100 TENTS, 2,000 BLANKETS AND 2 MEDICAL KITS, UP TO A
  VALUE OF USD 227,840 (YEN 20,050,000).

  5.      ON  AUGUST  9  THE  UNDP OFFICE ARRANGED A JOINT MEETING OF
  DONORS,  THE UN DISASTER MANAGEMENT TEAM AND SENIOR REPRESENTATIVES
  OF THE GOVERNMENT, ATTENDED BY A TOTAL OF 23 INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES
  AND 5 GOVERNMENT MINISTRIES.

    DURING  THIS  MEETING THE PAKISTAN AUTHORITIES INFORMED THAT THEY
  HAVE  ESTABLISHED  438  CAMPS,  WHERE  RELIEF  ASSISTANCE  IS BEING
  PROVIDED TO 93,726 PERSONS. THE ESTIMATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT OF
  PROVIDING  IMMEDIATE RELIEF IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT AROUND USD 29
  MILLION,  FOR  MEETING  THE  COST  OF  DEATH  COMPENSATION,  HOUSES
  DAMAGED/DESTROYED, RELIEF STORES AND HELICOPTER SPARES. THE COST OF
  DAMAGE   TO   NATIONAL   HIGHWAY  IS  ESTIMATED  TO  BE  USD  14.61
  MILLION.THIS REPRESENTED A HEAVY BURDEN ON THE GOVERNMENT'S BUDGET.

    IT  WAS STRESSED BY THE GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE WORST
  AFFECTED  AREAS  WERE  RELATIVELY  POOR DISTRICTS WHERE PEOPLE LOST
  EVERYTHING  (SUMMER  CROPS, HOUSES AND LIVESTOCK). THIS WOULD IMPLY
  THE  NEED  TO CREATE CAPACITIES FOR THEIR ECONOMIC UPLIFT UNTIL THE
  NEXT CROP SEASON, REHABILITATE THEIR HOUSING FACILITIES AND PROVIDE
  COMPENSATION FOR THEIR PERISHED LIVESTOCK.

  6.     CONTRIBUTIONS ANNOUNCED AT THE MEETING:

         UNDP  OFFICE  IN  ISLAMABAD  ANNOUNCED A GRANT OF USD 50,000
                                        AS  A  CONTRIBUTION  FOR  THE
                                             PROCUREMENT   OF  RELIEF

1. AT REQUEST OF GOVT, DHA-LED MISSION CONSISTING OF A
FOUR-PERSON UNDAC (UN DISASTER ASSESSMENT AND COORDINATION) TEAM
AND A WHO REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED IN PYONGYANG ON 29 AUGUST.

EDUCATION.

3. BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED, UNDAC/WHO TEAM REPORTS THAT
FLOODING OCCURRED DURING THREE SEPARATE PERIODS (7-15 JULY, 26
JULY-12 AUGUST, AND 17-20 AUGUST).  LAST PERIOD WAS MOST INTENSE,
WITH UP TO 600 MM OF RAINFALL PER DAY (AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL IS
1,000-1,500 MM).  RIVERS OVERFLOWED, AND A NUMBER OF SMALL AND
MEDIUM SIZED DAMS HAVE BURST, CREATING FLASH FLOODS.

BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR)
OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA)

CARIBBEAN - Hurricane 

Fact Sheet #4                              September 8, 1995


Note:  The previous fact sheet was dated September 7, 1995.

Background:  After battering the northern leeward islands from
September 4 to September 6, Hurricane Luis has cleared the
Caribbean.  Luis currently is located about 640 miles south-
southwest of Bermuda.  The Government of Bermuda has issued a
tropical storm watch and a tropical storm warning is in effect
for the Bahamas.

Numbers Affected:  There have been no official estimates of the
number of people in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Luis. 
Media reports indicate that at least 10 people (1 in Guadeloupe
and 9 in St. Maarten) have been killed, dozens are missing and
thousands have been left homeless but these have not been
confirmed by official sources.

Current Situation:  Damage reports continue to come in from the
islands affected by Hurricane Luis.  The four-person BHR/OFDA
disaster assessment team will complete its assessment of Antigua
today.  So far, the team is reporting that the loss of roofs
appears to be the most serious problem, followed by the lack of
electricity, water and telephones.  While the island's
electricity generation and transmission systems weathered
Hurricane Luis well, distribution lines are down all over the
island.  The island's water distribution and telephone services
are dependent on these lines, hence the disruption in these
services.  The team found Antigua's public hospital to be
operating at 75% its capacity.  As previously reported, the
hospital suffered extensive damage to its roof.  As of today, the
hospital has only a two-day supply of water remaining.   Since
the distribution d on other islands and are working to gather
information on the extent of the damage caused by Luis and the
needs resulting from it.  The island nation of Antigua & Barbuda
appears to have been damaged most extensively.  The pharmacy and
surgery wards of the island's public hospital were destroyed and
its roof taken off.  Thousands of houses, several health posts
and schools were damaged or destroyed.  Its international airport
is open but navigational equipment is not functioning, there is
no electric power, no water and no telephonic communication.  In
addition, two hotels were washed into the sea and destroyed. 
Montserrat, which had 90% of its housing destroyed by Hurricane
Hugo in 1989 and currently is threatened by a volcanic eruption,
emerged from Hurricane Luis with widespread but manageable
damage.  Dominica suffered principally from the wind and rains
which caused landslides, inflicted severe damage in the coastal
zone and may have damaged up to 80% of the banana crop.  Reports
indicate that the northern and eastern sections of the island are
cut off from the capital due to flooding and landslides, and that
two bridges are unusable.  Communications have been restored.  In
St. Kitts & Nevis, the government headquarters, several other
public buildings and the main hospital were damaged, as were
numerous houses and commercial establishments, including tourist
hotels.  Its services are still in operation.

Humanitarian Assistance:  Caribbean neighbors of the islands
affected by Hurricane Luis are offering assistance in the form of
military reconstruction teams, cash donations, technical support,
food, housing materials, clothing and other non-food items.  In
addition, international donors such as the Eastern Caribbean
Donor Group (chaired by the U.N. Development Program in
Barbados), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) and the International Maritime Satellite Organization
(INMARSAT) as well as the Governments of Canada and the United
Kingdom and the European Union are assisting in relief efforts. 
On a regional level, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response
Agency (CDERA), the Caribbean Disaster Response Unit (CDRU) and
the Caribbean Conference of Churches (CCC) are conducting
assessments, prioritizing needs and coordinating disaster relief
assistance.

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The U.S. Ambassador in
Barbados, who is accredited to each independent Eastern Caribbean
state, declared a disaster on September 5 for Hurricane Luis in
the islands of Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Dominica. 
On the same day, BHR/OFDA dispatched $25,000 to the Embassy. 
These funds will be dispersed quickly once needs have been
clarified and prioritized by the four-person BHR/OFDA assessment
team which arrived in Antigua yesterday.  The team's first
priority will be to survey Antigua's damaged public hospital and
determine what is needed for it to resume basic operations. 
Contrary to previous reports, the hospital was not completely
destroyed and has been able to continue operations in three wards
on a limited scale.

A BHR/OFDA-funded airlift of relief commodities will arrive in
Antigua today at approximately 2:30 pm EDT.  The 40,000-pound
shipment includes 4,500 blankets, four 3,000-gallon water
containers, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four chain saws, 400
pairs of gloves, 100 tents and 240,000 sq. ft. of plastic
sheeting to be used as temporary shelter.  The value of the
commodities and their transport is $140,000.  These items will be
distributed by CDERA and the CRDU.

BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR)
OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA)

CARIBBEAN - Hurricane 

Fact Sheet #3                                  September 7, 1995


Note:  The previous fact sheet was dated September 6, 1995.  

Background:  After battering the northern leeward islands from
September 4 to September 6, Hurricane Luis is moving away from
the Caribbean.  Luis currently is located about 220 miles north
of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and continues to move in a
northwesterly direction at nine miles-per-hour (mph.)  It is
expected to maintain this speed and direction today, avoiding the
United States but possibly threatening Bermuda during the next
two or three days.  The extreme northeastern Caribbean continues
to be threatened by heavy rain resulting from Luis which could
result in flash flooding and mud slides.

Numbers Affected:  There have been no official estimates of the
number of people in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Luis. 
Media reports indicate that at least 10 people (1 in Guadeloupe
and 9 in St. Maarten) have been killed, dozens are missing and
thousands have been left homeless but these have not been
confirmed by official sources.

Current Situation:  Damage reports continue to come in from the
islands affected by Hurricane Luis.  Disaster relief experts have
arrived in Antigua and on other islands and are working to gather
information on the extent of the damage caused by Luis and the
needs resulting from it.  The island nation of Antigua & Barbuda
appears to have been damaged most extensively.  The pharmacy and
surgery wards of the island's public hospital were destroyed and
its roof taken off.  Thousands of houses, several health posts
and schools were damaged or destroyed.  Its international airport
is open but navigational equipment is not functioning, there is
no electric power, no water and no telephonic communication.  In
addition, two hotels were washed into the sea and destroyed. 
Montserrat, which had 90% of its housing destroyed by Hurricane
Hugo in 1989 and currently is threatened by a volcanic eruption,
emerged from Hurricane Luis with widespread but manageable
damage.  Dominica suffered principally from the wind and rains
which caused landslides, inflicted severe damage in the coastal
zone and may have damaged up to 80% of the banana crop.  Reports
indicate that the northern and eastern sections of the island are
cut off from the capital due to flooding and landslides, and that
two bridges are unusable.  Communications have been restored.  In
St. Kitts & Nevis, the government headquarters, several other
public buildings and the main hospital were damaged, as were
numerous houses and commercial establishments, including tourist
hotels.  Its services are still in operation.

Humanitarian Assistance:  Caribbean neighbors of the islands
affected by Hurricane Luis are offering assistance in the form of
military reconstruction teams, cash donations, technical support,
food, housing materials, clothing and other non-food items.  In
addition, international donors such as the Eastern Caribbean
Donor Group (chaired by the U.N. Development Program in
Barbados), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) and the International Maritime Satellite Organization
(INMARSAT) as well as the Governments of Canada and the United
Kingdom and the European Union are assisting in relief efforts. 
On a regional level, the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response
Agency (CDERA), the Caribbean Disaster Response Unit (CDRU) and
the Caribbean Conference of Churches (CCC) are conducting
assessments, prioritizing needs and coordinating disaster relief
assistance.

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The U.S. Ambassador in
Barbados, who is accredited to each independent Eastern Caribbean
state, declared a disaster on September 5 for Hurricane Luis in
the islands of Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Dominica. 
On the same day, BHR/OFDA dispatched $25,000 to the Embassy. 
These funds will be dispersed quickly once needs have been
clarified and prioritized by the four-person BHR/OFDA assessment
team which arrived in Antigua yesterday.  The team's first
priority will be to survey Antigua's damaged public hospital and
determine what is needed for it to resume basic operations. 
Contrary to previous reports, the hospital was not completely
destroyed and has been able to continue operations in three wards
on a limited scale.

A BHR/OFDA-funded airlift of relief commodities will arrive in
Antigua today at approximately 2:30 pm EDT.  The 40,000-pound
shipment includes 4,500 blankets, four 3,000-gallon water
containers, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four chain saws, 400
pairs of gloves, 100 tents and 240,000 sq. ft. of plastic
sheeting to be used as temporary shelter.  The value of the
commodities and their transport is $140,000.  These items will be
distributed by CDERA and the CRDU.

                         CARIBBEAN - Hurricane 

Fact Sheet #1                                September 5, 1995

Background:  Hurricane Luis is moving across the Caribbean's
northern leeward islands.  The northeast islands from Dominica to
Puerto Rico have been placed under a hurricane warning.  A
tropical storm warning is in effect for Martinique.  Luis has a
diameter of approximately 700 miles.  It is producing maximum
sustained winds near 140 miles-per-hour (mph) and is moving in a
west-northwest direction at approximately 9 miles-per-hour (mph). 
The hurricane is expected to maintain this speed and direction
today and experts are working to predict its track beyond that. 
In the meantime, storm tides measuring up to nine feet in height
have been reported and rainfall of ten to twelve inches can be
expected along Luis' path.

Numbers Affected:  Estimates of the number of people affected
currently are not available although it is safe to assume that
the entire populations of the northern leeward islands are
threatened by Hurricane Luis.  

Current Situation:  As of 2:00 pm EDT today, Hurricane Luis was
leaving Antigua and Montserrat.  The storm currently is passing
through St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Maarten.  According to the
Antigua Red Cross, the islands were experiencing strong winds and
driving rain.  Many roofs have been reported lost.  As of 11:00
am today, the center of Hurricane Luis was located about midway
between St. Barthelemy and Barbuda.  The core of the hurricane
should continue to move over the northern leeward islands today. 
A U.S. reporting station on Antigua lost its wind recording
instrument this morning when gusts reached 146 mph.  Unofficial
sources reports gusts of up to 175 mph there.  

Hurricane Luis has knocked down telephone lines, disrupting
communication with many of the affected islands.  While
preliminary damage reports have been received, more precise
reporting on conditions will not be available until communication
links are restored and the storm clears the islands.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The USG is monitoring
Hurricane Luis closely and is prepared to provide immediate
assistance once the needs have been identified by an assessment
and a disaster has been declared.  BHR/OFDA, the USG's foreign
disaster assistance arm, will manage the provision of emergency
aid to all non-U.S. islands affected by Hurricane Luis.  Two
BHR/OFDA disaster response experts and two communications experts
from Florida's Metro Dade Fire Department are en route to
Barbados where they will meet with their regional counterparts
and USG personnel.  The BHR/OFDA assessment team plans to
continue on to Antigua tomorrow - weather permitting - to
undertake aerial and on-the-ground assessments of the leeward
islands, to meet with local disaster managers and to recommend an
appropriate USG response.  More BHR/OFDA disaster response
experts are on stand-by, should their services be required. 
BHR/OFDA has relief commodity stockpiles in the U.S. and in the
region.  The stockpile managers have been alerted and relief
items could be dispatched very quickly once assessments verify
the needs.  

As the USG's domestic disaster responder, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) is in charge of providing assistance to
the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
only.  A Washington-based BHR/OFDA disaster specialist has been
assigned to FEMA to serve as a liaison between the two USG
disaster responders.  FEMA has dispatched its own team to the
region to monitor the situation and make recommendations on
assistance to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  FEMA
maintains a cache of plastic sheeting for temporary shelter
purposes in BHR/OFDA's Panama stockpile.  BHR/OFDA will assist
FEMA in moving these commodities should they be required.

ZAIRE - Refugees 

Fact Sheet #2                                     August 28, 1995

Note:  The last fact sheet was dated August 24, 1995.

Background:  Zaire continues to host more than 1 million Rwandan
refugees.  A majority of these refugees arrived over a five-day
period following the July 1994 victory in Rwanda by the Tutsi-
dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).  Military elements of
the former regime known as the ex-Armed Forces of Rwanda (ex-FAR)
as well as militia members are prevalent among the refugee
population.  Through intimidation, the ex-FAR has prevented many
Rwandan refugees from returning to Rwanda.  The ex-FAR allegedly
conducts military training near the camps and has pledged to
retake Rwanda by force, if necessary.  Credible sources speculate
openly about a potential invasion and feel that it could occur
prior to Nov. 1995 when the next rainy season commences.  

An arms embargo was placed on the rump government of Rwanda in
May 1994 by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to stem
the flow of arms during the civil war.  After winning the war in
July 1994, the RPF established a new Government of Rwanda (GOR),
which has been in place for over a year.  In light of this and
the threat from the former regime, the UNSC unanimously voted on
Aug. 16, 1995, to suspend the embargo for 1 year and and then
lift it.  The Government of Zaire (GOZ) did not support lifting
the arms embargo, citing its belief that the lifting would invite
attacks by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) on refugee camps in
Zaire and that the restrictions in the resolution were
insufficient to prevent misuse of the weapons.  The GOZ warned
that if the embargo were lifted, it would be justified in
abandoning its international obligation to provide a safe haven
for refugees.  On Aug. 19, the GOZ military began forcibly
repatriating Rwandan and Burundian refugees from camps in Goma,
Bukavu and Uvira.  

Numbers Affected:  As of August 2, the U. N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) reports there are approximately 1.1 million
Rwandan and 100,000 Burundian refugees in Zaire.  According to
UNHCR, the GOZ military forcibly repatriated 15,081 refugees from
Aug. 19-23.  It is estimated that approximately 80-85% are women,
children, and elderly.  Many of the returnees come from Mugunga
camp in Goma which has a large ex-FAR population.  UNHCR reports
that an additional 133,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees left
their camps near Goma, Bukavu and Uvira and fled further into
Zaire to avoid being repatriated.  

Current Situation:  After the GOZ suspended its forced
repatriation program on Aug. 24, UNHCR renewed its voluntary
repatriation efforts on Aug. 25.  UNHCR reports that 267 Rwandans
from camps in the Goma area participated in its organized
repatriation program over the weekend.  Another 36 Rwandans
returned to Rwanda over the weekend without UNHCR's assistance.

Rwandan refugees in northern Burundi continue to utilize UNHCR's
organized, voluntary repatriation program.  Between 600-800
refugees are returning to Rwanda each week.  This program was in
effect prior to the GOZ's forced repatriation campaign and has
been unaffected by events in Zaire.

Diplomatic Efforts:  UNHCR High Commissioner Ogata will meet with
GOZ Prime Minister Kengo on Aug. 29 in Geneva to discuss a
program of voluntary repatriation.

USG Assistance:  U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, David Rawson, as well
as representatives of USAID/Rwanda and USAID/Burundi have visited
key border sites and transit centers.  The State Department's
Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration has dispatched its
regional refugee coordinator to the scene.  The USG has not
expended additional humanitarian assistance as a result of the
GOZ's current actions.  However, previously-funded projects
continue to benefit needy refugees and internally displaced
persons in the Rwanda/Burundi region.

CARIBBEAN - Hurricane 

Fact Sheet #2                                   September 6, 1995


Note:  The last situation report was dated September 5, 1995.


Background:  Hurricane Luis is moving across the Caribbean's
northern leeward islands.  A hurricane warning is in effect for
the northeast islands from Guadeloupe to Puerto Rico.  A tropical
storm warning is in effect for Martinique and Dominica.  Luis has
a diameter of approximately 700 miles.  Its maximum sustained
winds have decreased to 130 miles-per-hour (mph) with gusts up to
150 mph.  Hurricane and tropical storm force winds extend 140
miles and 230 miles, respectively, outward from its center.  Luis
is moving in a northwesterly direction at 9 mph.  Luis is
expected to maintain this speed and direction today.  Experts
have not reached a consensus on the hurricane's track beyond
that.  In the meantime, storm tides measuring up to nine feet in
height have been reported and rainfall of ten to twelve inches
can be expected along Luis' path.

Numbers Affected:  Estimates of the number of people affected
currently are not available although it is safe to assume that
the entire populations of the northern leeward islands are
threatened by Hurricane Luis.  

Current Situation:  As of 4:00 am EDT today, Hurricane Luis was
located approximately 40 miles northeast of the island of Anegada
in the British Virgin Islands.  It has cleared the islands making
up the southern portion of the affected area, including
Montserrat, Dominica, St. Kitts & Nevis and Antigua.  The island
of Antigua has been damaged extensively.  The pharmacy and
surgery wards of the island's public hospital were destroyed and
its roof taken off.  Thousands of houses, several health posts
and schools were damaged or destroyed.  Its international airport
is open but navigational equipment is not functioning, there is
no electric power, no water and no telephonic communication.  In
addition, two hotels were washed into the sea and destroyed. 
Montserrat, which had 90% of its housing destroyed by Hurricane
Hugo in 1989 and currently is threatened by a volcanic eruption,
emerged from Hurricane Luis with widespread but manageable
damage.  Its airport is closed.  Dominica is without telephonic
communication.  Its airport also is closed and numerous
landslides have been reported.  St. Kitts & Nevis are reporting
widespread but manageable damage overall.  However, both of its
hospitals lost part of their roofs and several wards will be out
of operation until temporary roofing can be constructed.  Several
regional disaster response coordinators plan to undertake aerial
surveys of Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St. Kitts & Nevis this
morning.  If possible, the group will land briefly in St. Kitts,
where the airport is open.

Hurricane Luis no longer is a threat to Haiti, the Dominican
Republic and Jamaica.  However, it currently is thrashing the
British and U.S. Virgin Islands as well as Puerto Rico with high
winds and thunderstorms.  This is expected to continue into
tonight.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The USG is monitoring
Hurricane Luis closely and is prepared to provide immediate
assistance once the needs have been identified by an assessment
and a disaster has been declared.  BHR/OFDA expects to receive a
disaster declaration today from the U.S. Embassy in Barbados,
which represents the USG in the region.  BHR/OFDA, the USG's
foreign disaster assistance arm, will manage the provision of
emergency aid to all non-U.S. islands affected by Hurricane Luis. 
Two BHR/OFDA disaster response experts and two communications
experts from Florida's Metro Dade Fire Department met with their
regional counterparts and USG personnel today in Barbados.  The
BHR/OFDA assessment team will fly to Antigua this afternoon to
undertake a needs assessment and to recommend an appropriate USG
response.  The Regional Disaster Advisor for USAID's Regional
Housing and Urban Development Office (RHUDO) in Jamaica will join
them tomorrow in Antigua.  BHR/OFDA is assembling a plane load of
blankets, four 3,000-gallon water containers, 1,005 five-gallon
water jugs, chain saws, gloves, tents and plastic sheeting to be
used as temporary shelter.  This air shipment will arrive in
Antigua early tomorrow morning.  More BHR/OFDA disaster response
experts are on stand-by, should their services be required.

As the USG's domestic disaster responder, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) is in charge of providing assistance to
the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
only.  A Washington-based BHR/OFDA disaster specialist has been
assigned to FEMA to serve as a liaison between the two USG
disaster responders.  FEMA has dispatched its own team to the
region to monitor the situation and make recommendations on
assistance to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  FEMA

CARIBBEAN - Hurricane 

Fact Sheet #5                                 September 10, 1995


Note:  The previous fact sheet was dated September 8, 1995.  

Background:  After battering the northern leeward islands from
September 4 to September 6, Hurricane Luis has cleared the
Caribbean.  As of 11:00 am EDT, Luis was located about 505 miles
south-southwest of Bermuda.  The Government of Bermuda has issued
a tropical storm warning.

Numbers Affected:  There have been no official estimates of the
number of people in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Luis.  A
BHR/OFDA assessment team reported 2 people killed and 155 injured
in Antigua.  Media reports indicate that at least 13 people have
been killed, dozens are missing and thousands have been left
homeless but these have not been confirmed by official sources.  

Current Situation:  The four-person BHR/OFDA team has completed
its assessments of Antigua & Barbuda and St. Kitts and is
finalizing its findings.   To date, the BHR/OFDA team has not
been able to visit St. Maarten, but reports indicate that it
suffered massive damage, including injuries and fatalities.  Many
tourists were on the island when Hurricane Luis struck and
efforts to evacuate them commenced on September 7.  On that day,
the British High Commission in Antigua evacuated 300 British
citizens by charter flight.  On September 9, a U.S. military C-
130 aircraft evacuated two plane loads of American tourists. 
Commercial airlines also are beginning to charter flights to
evacuate tourists.  
 
Humanitarian Assistance:  The Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) has issued an emergency health appeal for $990,000 for
Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Montserrat.  The
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) also has launched an appeal for $1,163,934. In addition,
PAHO, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNDHA), the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the U.N.
International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), several private
sector and non-governmental agencies and the Governments of the
Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Trinidad & Tobago, the
United Kingdom, the United States and Canada have contributed
cash, technical support, food and non-food emergency assistance
through means other than PAHO's appeal.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The U.S. Ambassador in
Barbados, who is accredited to each independent Eastern Caribbean
state, declared a disaster on September 5 for Hurricane Luis for
the islands of Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Dominica. 
On the same day, BHR/OFDA dispatched $25,000 to the Embassy.  A
BHR/OFDA-funded airlift of relief commodities arrived in Antigua
on September 7 at 2:50 pm EDT.  The 40,000-pound shipment, worth
$140,000 including transport, contained 4,500 blankets, four
3,000-gallon water containers, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four
chain saws, 400 pairs of gloves, 100 tents and 240,000 sq. ft. of
plastic sheeting to be used as temporary shelter.  On September
6, the Ambassador declared a second disaster for St. Kitts &
Nevis for which BHR/OFDA provided another $25,000.  A second
BHR/OFDA 50,000-pound airlift of 1,875 blankets and 739,296 sq.
ft. of plastic sheeting, worth approximately $130,000 including
transport, arrived in Antigua at 9:00 am EDT on September 9.  The
shipment also included communications equipment.  A third 70,000-
pound relief flight is being configured today.  It is anticipated
that the airlift will arrive at 9:00 am EDT on September 11 and
will consist of 856,800 sq. ft. of plastic sheeting,
approximately 3,500 blankets, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four
chain saws, and 216 pairs of gloves from OFDA stockpiles.  The
shipment will also include commodities donated by the American
Red Cross, including 300 cots, 500 blankets, and 48 rolls of
plastic sheeting.  An estimation of the value of this shipment,
which will cost approximately $65,000 to transport, currently is
not available.  The relief items will be provided to persons in
need in both St. Kitts and Antigua.

Note:  The previous fact sheet was dated September 8, 1995.  

Background:  After battering the northern leeward islands from
September 4 to September 6, Hurricane Luis has cleared the
Caribbean.  As of 11:00 am EDT, Luis was located about 505 miles
south-southwest of Bermuda.  The Government of Bermuda has issued
a tropical storm warning.

Numbers Affected:  There have been no official estimates of the
number of people in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Luis.  A
BHR/OFDA assessment team reported 2 people killed and 155 injured
in Antigua.  Media reports indicate that at least 13 people have
been killed, dozens are missing and thousands have been left
homeless but these have not been confirmed by official sources.  

Current Situation:  The four-person BHR/OFDA team has completed
its assessments of Antigua & Barbuda and St. Kitts and is
finalizing its findings.   To date, the BHR/OFDA team has not
been able to visit St. Maarten, but reports indicate that it
suffered massive damage, including injuries and fatalities.  Many
tourists were on the island when Hurricane Luis struck and
efforts to evacuate them commenced on September 7.  On that day,
the British High Commission in Antigua evacuated 300 British
citizens by charter flight.  On September 9, a U.S. military C-
130 aircraft evacuated two plane loads of American tourists. 
Commercial airlines also are beginning to charter flights to
evacuate tourists.  
 
Humanitarian Assistance:  The Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) has issued an emergency health appeal for $990,000 for
Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Montserrat.  The
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) also has launched an appeal for $1,163,934. In addition,
PAHO, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs
(UNDHA), the U.N. Development Program (UNDP), the U.N.
International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), several private
sector and non-governmental agencies and the Governments of the
Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Trinidad & Tobago, the
United Kingdom, the United States and Canada have contributed
cash, technical support, food and non-food emergency assistance
through means other than PAHO's appeal.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The U.S. Ambassador in
Barbados, who is accredited to each independent Eastern Caribbean
state, declared a disaster on September 5 for Hurricane Luis for
the islands of Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Dominica. 
On the same day, BHR/OFDA dispatched $25,000 to the Embassy.  A
BHR/OFDA-funded airlift of relief commodities arrived in Antigua
on September 7 at 2:50 pm EDT.  The 40,000-pound shipment, worth
$140,000 including transport, contained 4,500 blankets, four
3,000-gallon water containers, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four
chain saws, 400 pairs of gloves, 100 tents and 240,000 sq. ft. of
plastic sheeting to be used as temporary shelter.  On September
6, the Ambassador declared a second disaster for St. Kitts &
Nevis for which BHR/OFDA provided another $25,000.  A second
BHR/OFDA 50,000-pound airlift of 1,875 blankets and 739,296 sq.
ft. of plastic sheeting, worth approximately $130,000 including
transport, arrived in Antigua at 9:00 am EDT on September 9.  The
shipment also included communications equipment.  A third 70,000-
pound relief flight is being configured today.  It is anticipated
that the airlift will arrive at 9:00 am EDT on September 11 and
will consist of 856,800 sq. ft. of plastic sheeting,
approximately 3,500 blankets, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four
chain saws, and 216 pairs of gloves from OFDA stockpiles.  The
shipment will also include commodities donated by the American
Red Cross, including 300 cots, 500 blankets, and 48 rolls of
plastic sheeting.  An estimation of the value of this shipment,
which will cost approximately $65,000 to transport, currently is
not available.  The relief items will be provided to persons in
need in both St. Kitts and Antigua.

BURUNDI - Civil Strife/Displaced Persons

Situation Report #3 Fiscal Year (FY) 1995                 August 28, 1995

Note:  The last situation report was dated July 24, 1995.  New
information has been underlined.  For more information on the Rwanda
regional crisis, see BHR/OFDA Rwanda situation report dated August 1995
and the Zaire - Refugees fact sheet dated August 24, 1995. 

Overview
On October 21, 1993, President Melchoir Ndadaye, the first
democratically elected President of Burundi, and several high-ranking
government officials were killed by military personnel in a coup attempt
in the capital, Bujumbura.  The slaying of Ndadaye sparked nationwide
ethnic violence between the minority Tutsi and the majority Hutu ethnic
groups.  The northern and central provinces were hit the hardest by the
violence and disorder.  On January 13, 1994, the National Assembly
elected President Cyprien Ntaryamira to replace slain President Ndadaye. 
President Ntaryamira and the President of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana,
were killed in a plane crash on April 6,1994, while approaching the
airport in Kigali, Rwanda's capital.  The presidents were returning from
a regional summit to explore solutions to end the violence that has
occurred in Rwanda and Burundi over the years.  In September 1994, after
lengthy negotiations, the major political parties entered into a power-
sharing convention and Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was chosen to succeed
Ntaryamira in October 1994.  Although a new government is now in place,
political and ethnic tensions remain high, and acts of violence continue
to occur with alarming frequency.  This escalation of insecurity has
resulted in a growing number of newly displaced populations as people
are forced to flee from their homes and communes.  The level of
insecurity and fighting in the western region has erupted to such an
extent that the area is now considered a veritable war zone, and the
resulting emergency humanitarian needs are significant.

Burundi has a population of 5.6 million people, of which an estimated
85% are Hutu, approximately 14% are Tutsi, and 1% are Twa.  Despite
their minority status, the Tutsis traditionally have dominated the
government, military, economy, and educated society.  The new President
of Burundi is a member of the majority (predominantly Hutu) FRODEBU
party, while the Prime Minister is from the (predominantly Tutsi) UPRONA
opposition party.  The military remains primarily Tutsi, particularly at
the higher ranks.

Numbers Affected
As a result of the violence that began in October 1993, 50,000-100,000
people were killed, thousands wounded, and approximately 1 million
persons were displaced from their homes in Burundi.  Over 600,000
Burundians fled to neighboring countries, although the majority of these
have since returned.  However, the ongoing violence and insecurity has
generated new displaced and refugee populations.  As of August 18, the
U.N. World Food Program (WFP) was providing food assistance to
approximately 356,180 Burundian internally displaced persons (IDPs), of
which more than 199,500 have been displaced only recently as a result of
the growing violence.   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
reports that as of August 2, 1995, approximately 187,224 Burundian
refugees remain in neighboring countries:  5,600 in Rwanda; 83,000 in
Tanzania; and 100,000 in Zaire, although this figure continues to
increase as fighting wages on in western Burundi..   UNHCR also
estimates that 169,000 Rwandans remain in northern Burundi as a result
of the violence in Rwanda following the events of April 6, 1994.  

Total U.S. Government (USG) Assistance . . . . . . . . . . . $227,419,547


Current Situation
Violence and overall insecurity in Bujumbura and its surrounding
provinces is increasing humanitarian needs among the population while
rendering relief efforts difficult.  In Bujumbura, outbreaks of violence
are ongoing in the two remaining ethnically-mixed quartiers, Kamenge and
Kinama.  As the military and armed militias continue to attack each
other, civilians have been forced to flee repeatedly to the surrounding
hills, resulting in newly displaced populations and a veritable ethnic
balkanization of the capital city.   The outlying provinces of Bujumbura
Rurale, Cibitoke, and Bubanza are likened to a war zone and conditions
are so insecure that virtually no expatriate relief staff are able to
work in the region.  There are increasing numbers of blesses de guerre
(war wounded), newly displaced populations that are forced to flee from
one commune and province to another.  

Repatriation of Rwandan refugees, both organized and spontaneous, from
northern Burundi to Rwanda continues with increasing regularity.  It is
hoped that this trend will continue, thereby alleviating tensions
between the Rwandan refugees and the local and displaced populations in
the northern provinces.

On August 19, the Government of Zaire (GOZ) military began forcibly
repatriating Burundian and Rwandan refugees back to their countries of
origin.  By August 24, when the forced repatriation ceased, more than
2,100 Burundians arrived at the Gatumba transit center and 100,000 more
had gone into hiding around the Zairean town of Uvira. For more
information on this situation, see the OFDA Fact Sheet Zaire- Refugees.

Political/Military Situation
The USG has dispatched a number of high-ranking officials to Burundi,
both to demonstrate support for the democratically elected Government of
the Republic of Burundi (GRB) and to consult with government and
military officials on security issues.  In late April, Assistant
Secretary of State (AS) for African Affairs George Moose visited Burundi
to discuss issues of security, justice and accountability, and issues
related to Burundi's IDP population.  AS Moose also discussed the need
to incorporate Hutu soldiers into the Tutsi-dominated military,
rendering the institution more ethnically equitable and unbiased.  
Additionally, in July, U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali visited
Burundi and met with key Burundian leaders and officials, conveying the
message that Burundians must be willing to help themselves during this
crisis, and urging the international community to coordinate its efforts
to assist the Burundians.

Meanwhile, politically-motivated violence not only continues, but is
increasing in both Bujumbura and the provinces.  Assassinations of
provincial governors, their advisors, communal administrators, and
government employees occur with alarming frequency - a minimum of one
per week.

The international community, including the USG, has been working
actively to stabilize the fragile political situation in Burundi.  
BHR/OFDA participates in the Burundi Policy Forum, which was established
in Washington, DC, in January 1995 to discuss U.N., non-governmental
organization (NGO) and international organization (IO) activities to
help Burundians promote peace and reconciliation for their own country,
and to make additional recommendations for conflict prevention and
resolution measures.  Additionally, numerous peace-building and
reconciliation activities are underway in Burundi, under the auspices of
the U.N. Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG)'s office
and NGOs.  

Relief Efforts
Following the events of October 1993 and the resulting humanitarian
needs, relief organizations began to provide humanitarian assistance in
the form of food, water, non-food relief commodities, and medical
services to Burundi's displaced population.  At that time, two distinct
categories of IDPs emerged in Burundi.  The "displaced" population,
largely Tutsi, sought protection in public buildings and were guarded by
the Burundian military, while the "dispersed" population, largely Hutu,
fled to the hills to avoid central roads and the Tutsi-dominated
military.  Many of these individuals have remained displaced/dispersed
since October 1993, and only recently have begun to return to their
homes, security permitting.  Many of the displaced and dispersed travel
to their homes for short periods of time, but the majority return to the
hills or camps due to security concerns and unfavorable conditions in
the communes of return.

In June, WFP began to implement a program to phase out general food
distributions to the more than 350,000 old caseload displaced/dispersed
persons.  Under the projected program, WFP intended to reduce this
number to 112,000 by end-July, and reduce it further by 20% increments
per month over the next several months, arriving at a beneficiary
population of 8,000 vulnerable persons by March 1996.

WFP has been partially successful in reducing its food distribution
program in areas where security conditions and cooperation of the local
government have allowed the phaseout to proceed.  In July, the
beneficiary displaced/dispersed population in Kirundo numbered more than
177,000.  During the first distribution in August, this number was
reduced to 29,000, with the agreement of the provincial Governor. 
Reductions in beneficiaries are occurring in other provinces as well.

Although the food emergency resulting from the October 1993 crisis is
believed to be over, ongoing and escalating violence throughout the
country has resulted in significant new humanitarian needs.  The new
relief needs, notably in the medical sector, have drawn more relief
agencies to Burundi, bringing the number of NGOs and IOs providing
humanitarian assistance in the country up to 16.

In June, relief activities in-country were virtually suspended after an
Action Internationale Contre la Faim/France (AICF/F) convoy was ambushed
while driving from Bujumbura to the central provinces.  This attack
confirmed growing concern that the roads are not safe for travel, and
most NGOs have since refrained from travelling by road from Bujumbura to
the provinces, unless it is unavoidable.  To restore relief activities
in the interior and to ensure the safety of NGO and U.N. personnel, WFP
has provided a small aircraft that flies regularly to Gitega and Kirundo
Provinces.

Situation by Region
--Bujumbura City 
Throughout the past several months, the city of Bujumbura has been
riddled with regular outbursts of violence, notably in the once
ethnically mixed suburbs of Kamenge and Kinama.  Civilians often are
caught in the violence waged between the military and armed militias,
resulting in death, injury, destruction of homes and property, and the
recurring flight of the population to the surrounding hills.  Medical
evacuations and treatment are provided by Medecins Sans 
Fronterieres/Belgium (MSF/B), MSF/France (MSF/F), Red Cross/Belgium
(RC/B), and the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC).

These population movements are so regular that ICRC, UNHCR, and RC/B
have begun to establish an IDP camp to accommodate those people in
Bujumbura who frequently are forced to flee between their homes and the
hills.  WFP is providing emergency food distributions to more than
50,000 IDPs in Bujumbura, as of August 18.

--Western Provinces (Cibitoke, Bujumbura Rurale, Bubanza)
Severe violence between the military and armed militias continues, as do
attacks against civilians.  ICRC is evacuating an increasing number of
war-wounded to Bujumbura for medical treatment.  However, the hospitals
in Bujumbura are ill-equipped to treat the rapidly growing caseload, the
majority of whom require surgical treatment for wounds inflicted by
machetes, bullets, grenades and, most recently, landmines.  Most of the
hospitals are lacking electricity, sanitation facilities, drugs and
medical supplies, and staff.  Recently, MSF/B, Medecins du Monde (MDM),
and MSF/F were paired with the three main hospitals in Bujumbura to
offer support and assistance. 

Additionally, the local medical infrastructure in this area has
virtually collapsed.  Many trained local health care workers have fled
the area and both local and expatriate medical staff are unable to
travel regularly to the health centers due to insecurity.  Meanwhile,
more than 300 cases of cholera have been confirmed by ICRC and the World
Health Organization (WHO) along the Zaire/Burundi border, where
Burundians are living in squalid conditions, unwilling to be placed in
refugee camps and are fleeing between the two countries as dictated by
the volatile situation.  In response to the need for functioning water
systems in the area, the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) and ICRC have begun to install water bladders in critical
locations.

As of August 18, WFP estimated that of the 250,000 inhabitants of
Bubanza province, 75,000 are displaced within the province or have fled
to neighboring areas.  Similarly, an estimated 68,000 people have fled
from Bujumbura Rurale.  WFP and ICRC continue to attempt to meet the
needs of these populations, and when security allows, WFP provides
emergency 10-day rations.  WFP is chairing regular coordination meetings
with relief agencies and Burundian authorities to define a common
strategy for the growing number of new beneficiaries.

--Central Provinces (Gitega, Muramvya, Ruyigi, Kayanza)
Although sproadic outbreaks of political and ethnic violence occur, the
central provinces have been relatively calm recently.  These conditions,
as well as support from the local governments and populations, have
enabled the relief community working in these provinces to focus on
rehabilitation activities.  It is hoped that activities aimed at
creating favorable conditions in areas of return will encourage the
displaced and dispersed to return--and remain--in their homes, thereby
promoting stability and self-sufficiency.  NGOs, including AICF/F,
OXFAM/UK and World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD), are working
with the local population to rehabilitate shelters, promote agricultural
recovery, provide local nutritional and health programs, and repair
water systems.  To date, these programs have been successful, and have
facilitated the return of numerous displaced and dispersed to their
homes.

--Northern Provinces (Muyinga, Kirundo, Ngozi)
The northern provinces were severely affected by the instability and
destruction that accompanied the violence of October 1993.  The presence
of more than 200,000 Rwandan refugees over the past year further
destablized the area as tensions flared between the refugees and the
local and displaced populations.  This was compounded by the
international community's support for WFP's plan to phase out food
distributions to the displaced, while continuing assistance to the
refugees created additional tension.  Consequently, several WFP trucks
were attacked and looted, and a CRS expatriate worker was murdered in
Kirundo Province in May while assessing food needs there.  
However, according to relief organizations working in this region, the
situation has quieted over the past few months.  Incidents of political
and ethnic violence continue, although less frequently than several
months ago.  Additionally, the Governor of Kirundo is working with WFP
to reduce general distributions there.

Organized and spontaneous repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Burundi
continues in growing numbers and increasing regularity.  UNHCR estimates
that since January 1995, approximately 20,000 Rwandans have repatriated. 
Meanwhile, indicators for the remaining refugee population are good,
including in the medical and nutritional sectors.

Additional population flows throughout Burundi during the past several
months, both towards the Zairian and Tanzanian borders, have highlighted
the need to ensure that ample supplies of potable water and food
commodities are available in the region.  WFP, with contributions from
the USG, is currently undertaking efforts to improve Tanzania's road and
rail infrastructure to ensure that adequate relief supplies can be
delivered into the region to meet the current needs of the refugee
populations, as well as any emergency needs in the future.

USG Assistance
The USG has coordinated its relief efforts with the international donor
community to respond to the needs of disaster and conflict victims in
Burundi, both following the October 1993 crisis and during the current
situation.  Since the crisis began on October 21, 1993, the total USG
contribution Burundi and the region is over $227 million.  BHR/OFDA
funding has assisted Burundian IDPs, and has been channelled to NGOs and
U.N. agencies implementing programs in Burundi.  BHR/OFDA has funded
projects to provide emergency food and non-food commodities, shelter,
and health services to the Burundian IDP population.   To date, BHR/OFDA
has provided over $8.2 million in FY94 and FY95 to assist NGO and U.N.
programs in northern and central Burundi.

In FY94 and FY95, BHR/FFP has provided 343,510 MT of Title II emergency
food commodities worth over $200.2 million to the Burundi region, which
also includes Rwanda Tanzania, and Zaire.  These commodities are being
distributed through WFP who has been working in part with CRS and
Caritas to distribute the food to the affected populations. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture has provided 20,000 MT of Section 416(b) food
commodities for the region, totalling $8.8 million in FY94.

The State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration
(State/PRM) has earmarked approximately $5.5 million in response to
appeals from organizations responding to the Burundian refugee crisis.

FROM:    Lawrence Turnipseed (signed 09-22-95)

RE:      Southwest Florida Flooding
          $80,000 Appeal

SITUATION:  Hundreds of lower-income families who 
depend on farm work for their livelihoods are without 
jobs and housing in Southwest Florida due to flooding 
from heavy rains that have occurred since mid-August.  
A community consortium spearheaded by the National Farm 
Worker Ministry, a CWS partner, and churches has begun 
responding to their needs.  CWS is issuing this appeal 
within the context of this program. (Ref.  CWS Alert 
dated 09-14-95.)  
*******************************************************
*******************************************************

The rains, which started with Tropical Storm Jerry and 
have continued as result of other tropical storm and 
hurricane systems in the South Atlantic and Caribbean, 



may have affected as many at 1,200 to 1,400 families in 
the Bonita Springs/Fort Myers area.  

Many of them have been living in shelters for close to 
a month.  Other homeless families are living with 
relatives and friends.

Because of flooded fields, affected farmworkers find 
jobs to be scarce.  Many of the homeless - particularly 
those who are unable to speak English -- do not know 
how to apply for assistance to which they are entitled.

*******************************************************
*******************************************************
NEEDS:  Funds for: 

- Family assistance - shelter, utilities, clothes, 
food, household goods
   
- Disaster preparedness & response training in the 
farmworker community  
*******************************************************
*******************************************************

A response to needs in Southwest Florida has evolved 
out of an assessment conducted by the Farmworker 
Association of Florida (FAF), Christian Disaster 
Response (CDR) -- a ministry of the American 
Evangelical Christian Church, and the National Farm 
Worker Ministry (NFWM) -- a CWS partner.

The response will be implemented by a consortium of 
people from the community, churches, and farm labor 
organized by NFWM, CDR, and FAF.  It calls for $60,000 
in direct assistance to families ($500 grants); $10,000 
for training people in the farmworker community in 
disaster-related case assessment, aid eligibility 
regulations, and assistance delivery; and $10,000 for 
on-site program administration.   

Organizers envision the consortium to continue working 
in disaster preparation and mitigation following the 
current response. 







*******************************************************
*******************************************************
CHURCH WORLD SERVICE RESPONSE:  
$80,000 APPEAL

- CWS is issuing this appeal for $80,000 within the 
context of the disaster recovery program formulated by 
the Southwest Florida farmworker community consortium 
to address human needs related to flooding    

 - CWS is sending $3,000 to National Farm Workers 
Ministry from its Rapid Response Fund as seed money for 
the flood recovery program in Southwest Florida.

- Roberta Perry, American Evangelical Christian Church  
CWS volunteer Disaster Resource Specialist in 
farmworker issues and staff person with the National 
Farm Worker Ministry, facilitated organization of the

Subject: Central America: Haemorrhagic Fever  DHA


     APPEAL FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH
         HAEMORRHAGIC DENGUE OUTBREAK IN CENTRAL AMERICA

               COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, GUATEMALA,
                   HONDURAS, NICARAGUA, PANAMA

                        10 SEPTEMBER 1995

(DHA IS ISSUING THIS APPEAL AT THE REQUEST OF PAHO/WHO)



1. DENGUE AND ITS MORE SERIOUS FORM, DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER
(DHF) ARE TRANSMITTED BY THE BITE OF THE AEDES AEGYPTI MOSQUITO.
DENGUE EPIDEMICS HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN THE AMERICAS SINCE 1963.
THERE IS NO VACCINE OR SPECIFIC TREATMENT AVAILABLE FOR DENGUE,
ALTHOUGH SIMPLE SANITATION MEASURES CAN GET RID OF MOSQUITO
BREEDING PLACES.

2. DENGUE AND DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER (DHF) ARE CURRENTLY AN
ACUTE PROBLEM OF SERIOUS PROPORTIONS IN THE AMERICAS.  THE
SITUATION HAS BECOME A HEALTH AND SOCIOPOLITICAL EMERGENCY,
LEADING NATIONAL AUTHORITIES REGIONWIDE TO TAKE EXTRAORDINARY
RESPONSE MEASURES FOR HEALTH DISASTER.

3. ACCORDING TO FIGURES COMPILED BY THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
PROGRAM OF PAHO, A TOTAL OF 23,603 DENGUE CASES (WITH 352 CASES
OF DHF) HAVE BEEN REPORTED FROM COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR,
GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, NICARAGUA AND PANAMA.

4. IN BRAZIL 74,098 CASES OF DENGUE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  IN
MEXICO 1,905 CASES OF DENGUE AND 34 CASES OF DHF HAVE BEEN
REPORTED AND IN VENEZUELA, 15,252 CASES OF DENGUE INCLUDING
2,934 CASES OF DHF.

5. IN ENGLISH-SPEAKING CARIBBEAN, 228 CASES OF DHF HAVE BEEN
REPORTED.

6. THE RESURGENCE OF DENGUE IN THE AMERICAS IS DUE IN PART TO
SETBACKS IN PROGRAMS TO ERADICATE THE MOSQUITO.  CONTROL
MEASURES THAT MUST BE TAKEN TO CONTROL DENGUE INCLUDE CLEAN-UP
CAMPAIGNS, PUBLIC EDUCATIONS, SPRAYING, AND TREATMENT OF WATER
WITH LARVICIDES.

7. IMMEDIATE ACTION IS THEREFORE CALLED FOR TO CARRY OUT THE
EXTRAORDINARY RESPONSE MEASURES THAT THE COUNTRIES ARE NOT IN
A POSITION TO FINANCE WITH THEIR OWN RESOURCES, HENCE THE NEED
FOR INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE.

8. EMERGENCY MEASURES ARE PROJECTED TO LAST 6 MONTHS AND ARE
GEARED TOWARDS TWO BASIC OBJECTIVES: PATIENT CARE AND VECTOR
CONTROL.

ORGANIZATION
============
9. EMERGENCY COMMITTEES FOR DENGUE ARE PREPARING OR UPDATING
AN EMERGENCY PLAN THAT INCLUDES THE ONGOING EVALUATION OF THE
IMPACT OF THE VECTOR CONTROL MEASURES AND DAILY MONITORING OF
THE INCIDENCE OF CASES AND PROPER MEDICAL CARE.  THE PLAN
FURTHER INCLUDES INVENTORY OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES,
ESTABLISHMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SENTINEL SITES,
COORDINATED PROCUREMENT OF SUPPLIES AND TRAINING OF PERSONNEL.

TRAINING OF HEALTH PERSONNEL
============================
10. SEMINARS FOR ALL HEALTH PERSONNEL (SIX SEMINARS PER COUNTRY),
TRAINING AT HOSPITAL LEVEL FOR PAEDIATRICIANS AND INTERNISTS,
INFORMATION DISSEMINATION WORKSHOPS FOR COMMUNITIES AND
JOURNALISTS, COUNTRY WORKSHOPS TO TRAIN PERSONS IN CHARGE OF
SPRAYING.

DRUGS AND SUPPLIES
===================
11.  MEDICAL SUPPLIES REQUIRED ARE AVAILABLE IN MOST NATIONAL
HOSPITALS. INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE NECESSARY TO ENSURE
THEIR UNINTERRUPTED AVAILABILITY. THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN THE LOCAL
MARKETS IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND WILL BE PURCHASED BY THE
PAHO/WHO REPRESENTATIVE OFFICES AT THE MOST FAVOURABLE PRICES
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE
===========================
12.  THE SYSTEM FOR ACTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEILLANCE WILL BE
STRENGTHENED, WITH LABORATORY SUPPORT FOR MONITORING THE
EPIDEMIC AND ORIENTING VECTOR CONTROL MEASURES.  FOR THIS
PURPOSE, THE NETWORK OF SENTINEL CENTERS LOCATED IN HOSPITALS
AND HEALTH CENTERS WILL BE UPGRADED.

LABORATORY
==========
13. THE LABORATORY NETWORK WILL BE STRENGTHENED, WITH PRIORITY
GIVEN TO DIAGNOSING CASES OF DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER AND
AREAS WHERE DENGUE IS DETECTED FOR THE FIRST TIME. MOST OF THE
EQUIPMENT MATERIAL REQUIRED MUST BE PURCHASED OUTSIDE LATIN
AMERICA.

VECTOR CONTROL
==============
14. THIS IS DONE THROUGH THE CONTROL OF ADULT MOSQUITOES AND
LARVAL FORMS. EVEN THOUGH IT IS IMPORTANT TO ELIMINATE THE ADULT
MOSQUITOES INFECTED WITH THE DENGUE VIRUSES IN ORDER TO
INTERRUPT THE CHAIN OF TRANSMISSION, THE HIGHER PRIORITY IS TO
ELIMINATE OR REDUCE BREEDING SITES. PURCHASE OF HEAVY-DUTY
FOGGERS WILL BE DONE IN MARKETS OUTSIDE CENTRAL AMERICA.
INSECTICIDES WILL BE PURCHASED, SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY, FOLLOWING
LOCAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION
======================================
15. SIMULTANEOUSLY OR PRIOR TO THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE
EMERGENCY COMMITTEES WILL ORGANIZE AND IMPLEMENT A BROAD
PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN USING RADIO, TELEVISION, POSTERS, AND ALL OTHER
AVAILABLE MEDIA.

BUDGET FOR 6/COUNTRY PROJECT       USDOLLARS
============================       =========

VECTOR CONTROL                      1,368,000
MEDICAL CARE                          150,000

Note:  The previous fact sheet was dated September 8, 1995.  

Background:  After battering the northern leeward islands from
September 4 to September 6, Hurricane Luis has cleared the
Caribbean.  As of 11:00 am EDT, Luis was located about 505 miles
south-southwest of Bermuda.  The Government of Bermuda has issued
a tropical storm warning.

Numbers Affected:  There have been no official estimates of the
number of people in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Luis. 
The Pan American Health Organization reports 2 people killed and
158 injured in Antigua, no deaths or injuries in Barbuda and only
minor injuries in St. Kitts & Nevis.  Media reports indicate that
at least 16 people have been killed, dozens are missing and
thousands have been left homeless but these have not been
confirmed by official sources.  Contrary to previous reports,
there were no hurricane-related deaths in St. Maarten.

Current Situation:   A U.S. Military Disaster Assistance Survey
Team (DAST), tasked with coordinating the evacuation of American
tourists, arrived in St. Maarten on September 9.  By September
10, all Americans who wanted to leave had been evacuated via a
combination of U.S. military, commercial and contract flights.  
The DAST reports that the Government of the Netherlands has
sufficient quantities of relief items for victims of Hurricane
Luis and will not require outside assistance.  The island's
electrical plant is operating and water points have been
established on the island.  The DAST plans to depart today.

According to PAHO and BHR/OFDA field teams, Antigua's electricity
and telephone services are being restored.  By today, 80% of the
island's water services should be working.  Visual assessments
indicate that 80-90% of the island's homes have been damaged, 10-
20% of which are destroyed or severely damaged.  As of September
8, 1,600 people were in shelters.  Most of Antigua's roads are
passable, garbage collection was restarted on September 9 and
commercial airline service has resumed.  Ninety percent of
Barbuda's homes have been damaged.  Of these, 50% sustained major
damage and 10% are destroyed.  Phone service and electricity
continues to be out, however, as of September 7, water services
had been restored.   In St. Kitts & Nevis, water has been
partially restored but electric power is still out in most areas. 
Telephones are working.  Most of Nevis' agricultural crops were
lost and there was considerable erosion of its beaches due to
storm surges.  
 
Humanitarian Assistance:  PAHO has issued an emergency health
appeal for $990,000 for Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and
Montserrat.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC) also has launched an appeal for
$1,163,934. In addition, PAHO, the United Nations Department of
Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA), the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP), the U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF), several private sector and non-governmental agencies
and the Governments of the Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, St. Lucia,
Trinidad & Tobago, the United Kingdom, the United States and
Canada have contributed cash, technical support, food and non-
food emergency assistance through means other than PAHO's or
IFRC's appeals.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance:  The U.S. Ambassador in
Barbados, who is accredited to each independent Eastern Caribbean
state, declared a disaster on September 5 for Hurricane Luis for
the islands of Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis and Dominica. 
On the same day, BHR/OFDA dispatched $25,000 to the Embassy.  A
BHR/OFDA-funded airlift of relief commodities arrived in Antigua
on September 7 at 2:50 pm EDT.  The 40,000-pound shipment, worth
$140,000 including transport, contained 4,500 blankets, four
3,000-gallon water containers, 1,000 five-gallon water jugs, four
chain saws, 400 pairs of gloves, 100 tents and 240,000 sq. ft. of
plastic sheeting to be used as temporary shelter.  On September
6, the Ambassador declared a second disaster for St. Kitts &
Nevis for which BHR/OFDA provided another $25,000.  A second
BHR/OFDA 50,000-pound airlift of 1,875 blankets and 739,296 sq.
ft. of plastic sheeting, worth approximately $130,000 including
transport, arrived in Antigua at 9:00 am EDT on September 9.  The
shipment also included communications equipment.  A third 65,000-
pound relief flight for Antigua, St. Kitts & Nevis, worth
$142,104 including transport, will arrive today.  It is
anticipated that the airlift will arrive at 12:00 pm EDT on
September 11 and will consist of 856,800 sq. ft. of plastic
sheeting, approximately 2,750 blankets, 1,000 five-gallon water
jugs, four chain saws, and 216 pairs of gloves from BHR/OFDA
stockpiles. The shipment also includes commodities donated by the
American Red Cross, including 296 cots, 1,250 blankets and 96,000
sq. ft. of plastic sheeting.  Some of this shipment's plastic
sheeting will be used to repair the roofs of hospitals in St.
Kitts & Nevis.

Fiscal Year 1995 - Situation Report #2                 September 21, 1995

Note:  The last situation report was dated February 3, 1995. 

Overview
After almost six years of war, the leaders of the main warring
factions -- the National Patriotic Front for Liberia (NPFL), the
ethnic Mandingo-based United Liberation Movement for Democracy in
Liberia (ULIMO/M), the Armed Forced of Liberia (AFL) -- and the
Liberian National Transitional Government (LNTG), which has been
responsible for the political administration of Liberia since
March 1994, signed a new peace agreement on August 19, 1995,
known as the Abuja Accord.  The Accord, named for its signing in
Abuja, Nigeria, is Liberia's thirteenth peace agreement.  It has
been embraced by Liberians and the international community alike
who see it as a peace accord with a difference.  It is viewed as
a sincere effort to restore peace to the country and represents a
reconciliation between long-time adversaries Charles Taylor and
Nigeria, a consensus among West African States on Liberia and
direct involvement of faction leaders in implementing the accord,
all essential factors to lasting peace.  In addition, the Accord
has enticed a small number of Liberian refugees to return home.

Prior to the Abuja Accord, Liberia had been in the throes of a
civil war since December 24, 1989.  Peace-keeping forces from the
Economic Community of West African States' (ECOWAS) Military
Observer Group (ECOMOG) arrived in August 1990 to separate the
warring factions.  ECOMOG policed and provided security for the
Monrovia area.  At least seven major rebel groups were vying for
power in Liberia:  1)  Charles Taylor's NPFL,  2)  Alhaji
Kromah's (ULIMO/M),  3)  a Krahn-based ULIMO splinter group led
by Roosevelt Johnson,  4)  an NPFL splinter group named the
Central Revolutionary Council (CRC-NPFL) led by former Charles
Taylor supporter Tom Woewiyu,  5)  another Krahn-based group
called the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), led by George Boley  6)
the Lofa Defense Force (LDF) headed by Francois Massaquoi which
is thought to have its origins with the NPFL and  7)  the AFL --
the Krahn-dominated army of the late President Samuel Doe, now
headed by Hezekiah Bowen -- which had a hand in creating the LPC.

The parties to the conflict have had a consistent track record of
failing to honor the numerous peace agreements negotiated by the
United Nations (U.N.) and ECOWAS.  As such, poor security in much
of the country and threats against relief personnel hindered the
delivery of humanitarian assistance to those most in need in
Liberia's interior.  On September 18, 1994, U.N. relief agencies
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) officially suspended
up-country humanitarian assistance.  For the past year, relief
activities, for the most part, have been limited to Monrovia,
Buchanan and their immediate environs.

Numbers Affected
Out of a population of approximately 2,500,000, 725,000 Liberians
remain refugees in neighboring Guinea (397,000), Cote d'Ivoire
(305,000), Sierra Leone (3,000), Ghana (16,000), and Nigeria
(4,000).  Approximately 1,000,000 Liberians have been internally
displaced, and while an exact number may never be known, it is
estimated that more than 150,000 people have died as a result of
the war.  Liberia also hosts approximately 120,000 Sierra Leonean
refugees.

TOTAL U.S. GOVERNMENT (USG) ASSISTANCE for FY 1995 (to date) . $57,332,312 

Political/Military Situation
So far, implementation of the Abuja Accord has been on track.  A
cease-fire was put in place on August 26 and is generally
holding.  A new LNTG Council of State (COS) was sworn in on
September 1, 1995.  This new government, known as LNTG II, is
headed by Wilton Sankowolo, a civilian not affiliated with any of
the rebel groups and a respected language professor.  Charles
Taylor, Alhaji Kromah and George Boley serve as COS Vice
Chairpersons, equal in status but each administering a distinct
government portfolio.  Presidential elections have been scheduled
for August 20, 1996.  The faction leaders have agreed to withdraw
from the COS during the electoral phase of the transition if they
become candidates.

Disarmament and Demobilization
Among other things, the Accord calls for the creation of
"assembly areas" to contain the estimated 40,000-60,000 rebel
fighters for a "demobilization, disarmament and reintegration
(DDR) program."  Previous data showed that 6,000 of these
fighters were child soldiers who will require special assistance
to reintegrate into civilian society.  Current estimates indicate
that the number may be higher.  The assembly areas are supposed
to be in effect by mid-September with DDR to follow soon after.

The responsibility of monitoring the cease-fire and supervising
the disarmament and demobilization process lies with ECOMOG and
the U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) which was
established on September 22, 1993.  Harassment and abuse of
UNOMIL at the hands of rebel fighters in late 1994 led the U.N.
Security Council (UNSC) to scale back UNOMIL's presence from 366
to about 44 soldiers.  The UNSC also warned that, absent serious
progress toward peace, UNOMIL would be recalled.  

The Abuja Accord prompted the UNSC to extend UNOMIL's current
mandate to January 31, 1996, and to increase immediately the
number of military observers by 42.  The UNSC will consider
further augmentation of UNOMIL based on progress on the ground in
implementing the peace agreement. 

ECOMOG also scaled back its presence in Liberia in 1995.  The
supplemental troops from Tanzania and Uganda, which joined ECOMOG
following the July 1993 Cotonou Accord, have departed and the
core Nigerian and Ghanaian forces have diminished their troop
levels.  The current size of ECOMOG is estimated to be about
7,000 troops.  However, the signing of the Abuja Accord has
inspired new confidence on the part of ECOWAS toward Liberia. 
ECOMOG estimates it may need as many as 12,000 troops to fulfill
its obligations under the Abuja Accord and continue the West
African multi-national peace-making force for an additional year. 


Relief Efforts
In the spring of 1995, prior to the signing of the Abuja Accord,
relief agencies were beginning to have some access to up-country
Liberia after an absence of many months.  Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF) successfully negotiated cross-border medical
deliveries, albeit limited, from neighboring Cote d'Ivoire and
Guinea for needy displaced persons trapped by fighting in the
interior.  WFP, in addition to operating in Greater Monrovia, has
been working with various international and local NGOs to provide
food assistance up-country as areas become accessible.  Recent
WFP/NGO convoys include:  WFP/Save the Children Fund/U.K.
(SCF/UK) to upper Margibi County, WFP/Liberian Islamic Union for
Reconstruction and Development (LIURD) to rural Montserrado
County and WFP/Lutheran World Federation (LWF)-Lutheran World
Services (LWS) to central Liberia.  In addition, WFP, Catholic
Relief Services (CRS) and SCF/UK continue to deliver needed food
assistance to lower Bong, Margibi and Grand Bassa Counties.

In May and June, NGOs conducted preliminary nutritional surveys
in Greater Liberia which indicated an alarmingly high incidence
of malnutrition.  In July, SCF/UK conducted a rapid nutritional
survey in upper Margibi and lower Bong Counties, an area
estimated to have a total population of 330,000.  The height and
weight of 900 children under the age of five years from 16
communities along the Kakata-Gbarnga highway were recorded.  The
results of the survey revealed that 56.2% were acutely
malnourished (having less than 85% the normal weight-for-height
ratio), 42.3% were severely malnourished (less than 75% the
normal weight-for-height ratio), 37% suffered from kwashiorkor
(swollen lower limbs due to nutrient deficiency) and 19.1%
suffered from marasmus (skinniness due to nutrient and caloric
deficiencies.)  It is estimated that a total of 20,000 children
fall into the severely malnourished category.

SCF/UK concluded from the survey that the lack of access to the
population and the consequent insufficient supply of nutritious
food, substandard water, sanitation and hygiene conditions in the
area was creating a nutritional emergency.  SCF/UK also observed
that children between the ages of five and ten are just as
malnourished as the younger children.  As a result, SCF/UK is
distributing food to the population and is working with
MSF/Holland (MSF/H) and MSF/France (MSF/F) to implement
therapeutic feeding programs, reactivate health services --
including immunizations -- and to address hygiene, water and
sanitation services.

WFP commenced its 21st general food distribution in Monrovia on
August 30, 1995.  Over 7,440 metric tons (MT) of food are being
distributed to 161 communities in the city.  For the first time,
rice, one of Liberia's staple foods, is being substituted with
bulgur wheat.  Bulgur wheat is more nutritious and is a self-
targeting commodity that reaches those most in need.  This
prevents emergency food aid from becoming a disincentive to local
production and reduces the beneficiary population's dependency on
international assistance.

USAID's Role in Liberia's Transition to Peace
After nearly six years of war, the successful transition from
emergency to rehabilitation and development activities in Liberia
will require a consolidated approach among donors, International
Organizations (IOs) and the U.N.  USAID currently is working with
other USG agencies and donors to develop such a strategy to
support the peace process and assist Liberia in its transition to
self-sustaining development.

Much of the emergency needs will shift from Monrovia to the
interior as the displaced population returns to their homes and
as improved access uncovers heretofore unreachable populations in
need.  Monrovia itself is likely to move from an emergency to
reconstruction phase rather quickly.  Furthermore, emergency
relief requirements throughout Liberia are expected to diminish
following the return and reintegration of refugees, displaced
persons and combatants.  It is anticipated that this
recovery/transition phase will take one to two years.

Due to problems with access in Liberia's interior over the past
year, BHR/OFDA has structured its grants to allow maximum
flexibility for the location of NGO projects.  This has enabled
NGOs to relocate their emergency programs based on access
realities.  This practice of geographic flexibility in grants
will be an asset to BHR/OFDA-funded relief providers in Liberia
as the peace process allows displaced persons to return to their
counties and villages.  

U.S. Government (USG) Assistance FY 1995
Thus far in FY 1995, BHR/OFDA has provided $4,376,874 of
emergency relief assistance to Liberia.  Negotiations for
additional grants worth approximately $3,000,000 will be
completed by September 30, 1995, the end of FY 1995.  In FY 1995,
BHR/OFDA replenished 400 rolls of plastic sheeting sent to
Liberia in late FY 1994 from a BHR/OFDA stockpile.  BHR/OFDA also
contributed funds toward the repair of the Mechlin River Bridge
which was in serious disrepair and is essential for the overland
delivery of relief commodities to Buchanan.  The following NGOs
were awarded grants:  1)  CRS for the distribution of emergency
Title II food, seeds and tools,  2)  Action Internationale Contre
la Faim/France (AICF/F) for an emergency water/sanitation
program,  3)  MSF/H for emergency health, nutritional and
water/sanitation activities and  4) Salesian Missions to train
health care workers and laboratory technicians.  BHR/OFDA also
provided grants to two U.N. agencies:  1)  the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) for emergency assistance to displaced persons and 
2)  the U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) to support its food
distribution activities.  BHR/OFDA expended $308,400 for
assessments and to support an Emergency Disaster Relief
Coordinator (EDRC) in Monrovia for one year.

In FY 1995, the Bureau for Humanitarian Response's Office of Food
for Peace (BHR/FFP) has provided 30,000 MT of food commodities to
CRS under the P.L. 480, Title II program.  The value of the food
commodities, combined with the cost of ocean transport and
internal transport, storage and handling, totals $14,575,800. 
BHR/FFP also has provided WFP with 80,830 MT of Title II food
commodities for the Liberia region so far in FY 1995 totaling
$37,101,700.  The value of all Title II food commodities,
combined with the cost of ocean transport and internal
transportation, storage and handling, totals $51,677,500.   

USAID's Bureau for Africa (AFR/WA) has provided $780,000 in
Economic Support Funds to Ghana to support the efforts of
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, in his role as ECOWAS
Chairperson, in the Liberian peace process.

The State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and
Migration (PRM) has approved funding in FY 1995 for: 1) $234,312
to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) for education
programs for Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea,  2)
$112,604 to IRC for assistance to Liberian refugees at Buduburam
refugee camp in Ghana and  3)  $151,022 to IRC for assistance to
Liberian refugees in Cote d'Ivoire.  PRM also has made
contributions to the general programs of the following U.N. and
International Organizations in FY 1995 in response to their
Africa-wide Appeals:  
1)  $44,000,000 to UNHCR,  2)  $38,500,000 to the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and  3)  $10,000,000 to the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC.)  Portions of these contributions are being used to assist
Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees.

TO:    CHURCH WORLD SERVICE CONSTITUENCY

FROM:    Lawrence Turnipseed (signed 09-18-95)

RE:      Puerto Rico & the U.S. Virgin Islands - 
          Hurricane Marilyn:  $250,000 Appeal

SITUATION:  At least nine persons died and thousands 
are homeless and jobless in Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands as a result of Hurricane Marilyn.  On 
the Virgin Islands, power and communication systems are 
still down and food and water must be brought in from 
the outside.  CWS has offered emergency relief supplies 
to mass care providers and is identifying long-term 
needs churches will have to help address.  Based on the 
extent of damages, it is issuing this appeal for 
$250,000 (Ref.  CWS Alert date 09-17-95.) 
*******************************************************
*******************************************************

Marilyn damaged nearly 17,000 homes on St. Croix and 
St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.  St. Thomas 
experienced the worst of the hurricane's fury with 
nearly all of the 12,000 homes on the Island either 
destroyed or damaged.  The storm also totally destroyed 
warehouse food stocks on St. Thomas and did heavy 
damage to its only hospital.  Forty per cent of the 
12,000 homes on St. Croix sustained moderate to severe 
damage in localized pockets.  

The hurricane affected 850 housing units in eastern 
portions of Puerto Rico, doing the most destruction on 
the Islands of Culebra and Vieques off the coast.  On 
Culebra, the storm destroyed an estimated 100 homes and 
damaged another 250.

Beyond the property destruction, Marilyn has also 
severely disrupted the fishing-dependent economies of 
the areas it struck.  Many people have lost their jobs 
on the affected islands where fishing boats and 
facilities were damaged or destroyed.    

*******************************************************
*******************************************************
NEEDS:  Funds and material aid for:  
 
- Emergency relief - food, water, bedding, tents, 
shelter-related equipment
   
- Cleanup, repair, and rebuilding of homes and other 
structures
 
- Economic assistance to individual families

- Pastoral care & counseling 
*******************************************************
******************************************************

CWS is offering relief supplies to mass care providers 
including the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) and the American Red Cross (ARC) which have had 
emergency material in place at sites since before the 
hurricane struck.  Although needs are being addressed, 
CWS expects requests for supplementary aid and is 
gearing up to meet them.

In Puerto Rico, the Christian Ministry Service in 
Emergency (CMSE), a CWS partner, is planning to focus 
on unmet long term recovery and rehabilitation needs on 
the Islands of Culebra and Vieques.

CWS will also begin conducting a needs assessment in 
Puerto Rico and on the U.S. Virgin Island later this 
week to identify other ways it can assist survivors of 
the hurricane.  It is in touch with denominations and 
church-related agencies that have a presence on the 
affected islands - including Lutheran Social Services, 
the Reformed Church in American, and Catholic 
Charities. 
 
*******************************************************
*******************************************************
CHURCH WORLD SERVICE RESPONSE:  
$250,000 APPEAL

- CWS is issuing this initial emergency appeal for 
$250,000 to address needs of survivors of Hurricane 
Marilyn in Puerto Rico and on the U.S. Virgin Islands.

 - CWS is sending $5,000 in seed money to the Christian 
Ministry Service in Emergency (CMSE) for its recovery 
program on the Islands of Culebra and Viaeques.

-  CWS United Church of Christ/Christian Church 
(Disciples of Christ) volunteer Disaster Resource 
Consultant (DRC) Abigail Rosado Quiles in Puerto Rico 
is working with CMSE in developing its recovery 
programs on the Islands of Culebra and Viaeques.

-  CWS is sending Richard Krajeski and Kristina 
Peterson, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) CWS DRCs in West 
Virginia, to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to 
conduct a needs assessment, identify ways CWS can 
contribute to the recovery effort, and help the local 
religious community develop and implement a response to 
needs created by Hurricane Marilyn.

-  CWS is continuing to attempt to contact Sylvia 
Talbot, African Methodist Episcopal CWS DRC on St. 
Croix, about needs on the Island.  (AT&T expects to 
restore telephone communication to St. Croix tomorrow.)

What is the purpose of Travel Leader PR News?</b><br><b>A.</b> A.To serve travel writers. They increasingly are using The Internet's World Wide Web as an information resource, many checking it daily.  <p><b>Q. Is Travel Leader PR News  redundant with press releases already distributed by other means?</b><br><b>A.</b> Not at all, because the main purpose of Travel Leader PR News  is to provide an archive of releases and background pieces readily available to writers at any time. Writers no longer will have to fish out news releases or press kits sent them weeks ago, or request new ones. Recent release hyperlinked headlines, however, receive immediate visibility on the "What's New?" page, remaining there for 30 days.<p><b>Q. Do members have their own proprietary sites within Travel Leader PR News?</b><br><b>A.</b> Yes. They even can have its own URLs to allow access directly from other sites, and have their  own "home pages" with their own color logos and directories of releases available online.<p><b>Q. How will travel editors and writers know that Travel Leader PR News  exists on the Internet, and where to find it?</b><br><b>A.</b> Initially the travel pressincluding both consumer and trade resources, as well as electronic and print mediawill receive a mailing that explains the service, that it is free to them, and that lists its members.<p>A ROLODEX card containing the Travel Leader PR News URL (http://www.travelleader.com) also will be included for continual reference.<p>In addition, a sweepstakes with highly attractive prizes will be offered exclusively for members of the travel press. Other relevant high traffic Internet sites also will be linked, as will the consumer and industry newsletters at the Travel Leader Services site.<p><b>Q. Is Travel Leader PR News  redundant with members' existing Web sites? And can links be established to jump to them?</b><br><b>A.</b> Travel Leader PR News  exists primarily to serve the press. Consumer traffic ("hits") nevertheless will occur as a bonus. Members having Web sites of their own, therefore, may want hyperlinks. Those carrying 10 or more pages monthly (three month minimum) on Travel Leader PR News  can be linked to their home pages at no charge.<p><b>Q. How affordable is the service?</b><br><b>A.</b> Very affordable indeed....Each ongoing page (up to 300 words) online costs just $7.00 per month after the first month. The rate for the first month is $25.00 per page, including the listing in "What's New?"<p>Package rates also are available for members wishing to archive the body of their press releases for reference by writers.

In the hope of saving hours if not days of sailing, they have given the infamous cape too little respect and too narrow a berth. The villain was, as it still is, the confluence here of the Gulf Stream and other currents to produce unchartable tides, shifting sandbars, fickle winds and some unpredictable weather. A conspiring of these elements often left vessels foundering helplessly on the shoals. Shipwrecks were so common that the U.S. Lifesaving Service's twenty-five stations on the Outer Banks, which operated well into this century when the U.S. Coast Guard took over, were a significant local employer. Daring rescues in foul weather via lifeboats propelled by human muscle, or in "breeches buoys" dangled on ropes extended from ship to shore over white-capped waves, were among the most widely known heroic deeds of their day. <p>North Carolina's Outer Banks stretch from the Virginia border to the tip of Ocracoke Island,120 miles south along the North Carolina Coast, with Hatteras Lighthouse both its symbolic and geographical center. We elected to make this passsage on land, however, our first venture in a motor home... We can care less if our blue water sailing friends are disdainful. The land cruise is infinitely safer than making the passage "outside," while allowing more activities and points of interest along the way than going by boat "inside" the cape.  <p>This maritime highway "North Carolina Route 12" on which we travel often is within sight of both the ocean and Pamilco Sound, that great protected sea that hosts the Inland Waterway here and defines over half of North Carolina's mainland coast. During nor'easters and hurricanes, the road itself often is endangered, if not temporarily closed, by driving ocean spray or drifts of sand. Conversely, a storm coming out of the southwest off of Pamlico Sound, such as it did this past March, can cause flooding that plays equal havoc.<p>Traveling down and then back up Route 12 in our self-contained cruiser, we are able to stop and walk on some of the miles of beaches between Nags Head and Ocracoke Village. During our sojourns, we listen to the seductive drawl of native accents, some with an occasional hint of Elizebethan inflections, develop an almost intimate relationship with the local wildlife, maintain our independence from motels and restaurants unless one of them totally excites our fancy, and follow our impulse at any moment to move our lodging to a new location. To say we are enjoying a moveable feast only begins to describe our trip; we have our own moveable resort that keeps us close to the whole seashore experience which is the reason we have come .(More)<p>Furthermore, the symbiosis between our chosen destination and mode of transportation plays itself out in many ways during the course of the trip. The informality of the Outer Banks is complemented by the RV (for recreational vehicle) lifestyle, which is equally casual. <p>In our travels we see many kinds of RVs, from tent trailers and vans, to travel trailers and motorhomes. At campgrounds, one experiences a cross section of America from senior executives to postal workers. If there is a snobbery, it is that there is none. If a politician wants to take the pulse of middle America, this is where to come.<p>Many we talk to in the campgrounds have traveled throughout North America, with the kids when younger, and then as older "empty nesters", are visiting offspring and grandchildren in their homes far-flung around the county. In between they may spend time in New Orleans or Yellowstone. One couple, with grown children now living on both coasts, has visited all 49 U.S. states on the North American continent, and has toured extensively in Canada and Mexico.<p>Many coming to the Outer Banks have brought their surf casting rods. With the bluefish running, they do not hesitate to share their catch with us. <p>The demographic mix of people here shifts according to season, depending upon whether or not schools are in session. The off-season is more peaceful at the campgrounds and on the beaches. Once schools let out, the ratios shift from predominantly seniors and retirees, to at least an even split of families with children, a population segment that is growing as the maturing the baby boomer generation moves into the family-rearing years. Whether staying in an RV or a tent, camping is a shared family experience that most enjoy and can afford. <p>We note a heightened camaraderie among RVers in the private KOAs (for Kampgrounds of America).  Camping and being with other campers here is an activity unto itself. The $15-25 overnight fee reflects that one can get a "full hookup" for electrical power, potable water and sewage, as well as have access to a campgrounds store, game room, and swimming pool  these latter amenities assuming greater importance once schools are out. The KOA campground at Chesapeake, Virginia, en route here, even offers pony rides.<p>Our neighbor's attitude at the KOA in Rodanthe, where we stay our first night on Hatteras Island, about our going on to outlying Ocracoke Island, is, "Why go there? There's nothing to do." <p>That sounds so good to us that we immediately head for the ferry. And how right he was. It is semi-desolation and total bliss. <p>At the National Parks Camground on Ocracoke Island, like the others elsewhere throughout the United States, there is no hookup. Little matter: we are in a totally self-sufficient vehicle with holding tanks, an auxillary generator and extra batteries. Furthermore, the nightly fee here is only $11.00, $5.50 for seniors (over 62.) Here also are people with just tents or tent trailers, seeking a purer camping experience.<p>At Ocracoke we pick our spot alone near a sand dune and turn off the motor. The roar of the ocean, less than 200 yards away, lulls us to sleep this night. During the following days a short hike across the dune brings us to the broad beach where we find a few fishermen, a half dozen varieties of shore birds and an occasional four wheel drive vehicle cruising past with its surf casting rods standing smartly upright in a row across the front bumper. Driving on the beach is such a part of the local tradtion that the Park Service allows it here, whereas it does not, for example, on Cape Cod. <p>We observe individuals and couples arriving, pitching a tent, disappearing within,  appearing the next morning to walk the beach, then striking the tent and leaving.  New York and New Jersey license plates indicate a full day's drive to get here. Pale and wan-looking upon arrival, we wonder what pressures at home has made them come all of this distance. One young man in his late twenties traveling and fishing alone tells us he just had to escape from the office for a few days. Apparently the word is out about the cure from civilization offered here.<p>One thing that these people also must have discovered is that the National Park Service Campgounds are a treasure in themselves, as are the people who run them.. The areas are thoughtfully layed out providing maximum individual space  mowed, clipped and immaculately maintained, with rarely the blemish of even a piece of paper on the ground. The Parks Service personnel, in their squared-off ranger's hats, always seem in command of their jobs and eager to help guests. One guide explains that The Cape Hatteras National Seashore, over 75 miles long and covering over 30,000 acres, contains three other active campsites in addition to this one at Ocracoke. The northernmost is at Oregon Inlet. Frisco and Cape Point are near the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. A fourth one at Salvo is temporarily closed due to government budget restrictions. <p>The Park Service offers self-guided "interpretive tours." We walk over a trail of pine straw onto a gray, weathered catwalk that takes us through stands of salt hay into the heart of the salt marsh.  The rich environment of the marsh, full of decayed vegetation in which mollusks and crustacia thrive, is descibed on a trailside placard as "organic soup." An interpretive trail indeed! Bushes are pointed out that protect themselves from the damage of salt spray by keeping their maximum growth lower than the level of the dunes.<p>At the Pea Island Nature Preserve forty miles farther north near the Oregon Inlet Campground, to which we subsequently move,  we find spring-fed fresh water ponds that support river otters and muskrats, swimming and playing with little apparent regard for our presence. In the salt water ponds and marshes blue herons and snowy egrets dance in the mirkey water to stir up their dinner. While viewing all of this in clear sunshine from a raised observation platform, a thunderstorm progressing up the Banks from Cape Hatteras provides a brilliant rainbow. The whole vast scene, with all of its colors and life,.scans like a Frederic Church painting, too grand in its scope to be real.<p>With storms constantly coming and going, so does the shoreline.  Oregon Inlet is a major outlet from Pamlico Sound into the ocean, used daily by sports fishermen, and is a lifeline for the commercial fishing fleet docking at Wachese on Roanoke Island. There is a school of thought that argues to leave the seashore alone to shift sand and move inlets as it pleases. It always has and it always will. The inlet that allowed Sir Walter Raleigh's vessel to penetrate the Outer Banks in 1584 to Albemarle Sound and to found its colony on Roanoke Island (now known as the "Lost Colony"), no longer exists, closed centuries ago by the sea's action.  Likewise Oregon Inlet, the present-day principal break in the Banks, did not exist at all until it was opened by storms in 1846. <p>Now man manages nature here at the inlet and at other places along this seashore because his interests are threatened. Heroic measures are being used to save the channel from filling in. The battle is endless.<p>Likewise, we see the mammoth sandbags and breakwaters built to save the 208-foot tall Hatteras Lighthouse, which when erected in 1870, was 1,500 feet from the ocean, but which  now is protected by only 200 feet of headland.  While still a functioning lighthouse and the tallest one in North America, it is also the leading symbol of the Outer Banks and a major tourist attraction. Every possible measure is being used to save it.<p>In our RV we drive to the field where on December 17, 1903 the Wright Brothers made their historic first powered flight . Next we go to see the spectacular Elizabethan Gardens on nearby Roanoke Island, where the Lost Colony is immortalized in the grand operatic pageant performed each year. But then it starts to rain, hard at times. We have lunch in the RV, take time out for a siesta, and because it is still raining, decide not to return to our campground at Oregon Inlet. We will quit while we are ahead after almost a week of near-perfect weather. With no need to go back to a hotel to check out, and with all our belongings on board, we turn on the engine and head towards home. Life these past few days has been just as simple and unplanned as that.<p>If you plan to go there, According to an industry spokesperson, the total cost to rent an RV averages $1,000-1,2000 per week, but prices vary greatly depending upon vehicle size, season and location. . The largest national renter is Cruise America, which operates in over 100 locations throughout the U.S., including Washington, D.C., and Raleigh, North Carolina, their closest to the Hatteras area. For more detailed information and reservations through Cruise America, which also offers fly-drive programs and the option of dropping the vehicle in a second location, call 800-327-7799, or a travel agent. <p>For a copy of the Recreation Vehicle Rental Association directory, which lists over 200 dealers nationwide, plus a copy of their 32-page booklet Rental Ventures, call 800-336-0355. There is a $7.50 charge and major credit cards are accepted.<p>First time RV renters should allow at least two hours to get checked out on their vehicles and to provision. <p>During holiday or vacation periods, campground reservations are recommended. The National Park Service 800-number is 365-CAMP, with reservations and advance payment accepted over the phone via a major credit card for certain campgrounds up to eight weeks in advance.. Seniors (62 years old) should so specify when making their reservation to receive the 50% discount.<p>Several comprehensive camping directories also are available, including the 1,750-page Woodall's Campground Directory , providing telephone numbers for virtually all for public and private campgrounds worth considering (and some that are not), and AAA Campbooks in 11 regional editions A KOA directory, which includes maps, rates, facilities available at each of their 550 locations and their phone numbers for reservations, is free at any of their campgrounds, or by sending  $3.00 to KOA, P.O.Box 30558, Billings, Montana 59114. <p>Visitor information also can be obtained from the North Carolina Division of Travel & Tourism by calling 800-VISIT NC. For a literate and entertaining account of the history, people and ecology of the area, told as a narrative of the author's visit there, read Anthony Bailey's The Outer Banks, published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, in 1989.<br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><font size=+2><a name="lookat">Look at Where You Are Going</a></font><br>For travelers who would like to see where they might be going before they go there, Destinations on Tape may be their answer. Islands, countries, cities, cruise lines, tour operators, hotels, etc., supply the tapes, so they naturally tend to be promotional in nature, but are generally informative and high in production quality. Full page ads promoting the service have appeared in The New York Times and Smithsonian magazine, among others.<p>The tapes you select are combined onto one customized video cassette. Each tape selected is priced at $7.00 and there is a per order handling and duplicating fee of $5.75. In other words, if you order three videos, say of Bermuda, Cambridge Beaches there, and the Southampton Princess hotel, the total comes to $26.75. Second day air also is available.

Who's got time to shop during week? It's got to be on vacation and on the weekend. <p>The first harbinger of this trend was seen over a decade ago when Freeport, Maine, home of L.L.Bean was the state's (it even said "Maine, Vacationland" on the license plates) second largest attraction for out of state tourists. The bargains galore, mostly close outs and discontinued items, could be had only by visiting the store, which often was crowded even at at midnight during the summer months. Imagine getting a pair of genuine L.L. Bean hiking boots for half price. <p>Growth of the malls has been nothing short of exponential in the decade of the nineties, however. With a 50% increase since l990 in the number of malls to 311, there has been a doubling in the number of shops. Moreover, mall developers look to the potential for tourist traffic in their planning. In the gigantic Potomac Mills mall outside of Washington, on third of the shoppers are tourists, many of them foreigners. At the 400-store Mall of America outside of Minneapolis, of the 40 million annual visitor count, 12.5 million of it is accounted for by tourists. Northwest Airlines, based in Minneapolis, with its strong Pacific franchise, brings in planeloads of Japanese. It also brings in shoppers from Los Angeles just for the day. <p>The resurgence in Hawaiian tourism is in no small way a result of the Japanese passion for buying American goods on American soil-at half the price they would pay in Japan. In 1995 the giant Waikele Factory Stores Mall in Waipahu drew almost one third of all Japanese visitors. The eastbound market, dominated by the Japanese, through April (1996) is 17.3% ahead of last year.Ironically, overextended Japanese real hotel developers are being bought out by Hawaiian and US-mainland real estate syndicates at one third the the original investment, who in turn will profit from the revitalized Japanese consumer economy. Bargains notwithstanding, like with many American households these days, a Tokyo working couple just does not have the time to shop at home. <p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="profitin"></A>Profiting from Asian Growth</FONT><br>The Asian economic growth engine is expected to continue churning. Maybe not in the double digit range of the last decade, but certainly in the high single digit numbers. Anyone traveling in Asia only has to look at the abundance of construction cranes in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, etc. to believe this. <p>What we Westerners need to understand about doing business out there is how very important personal relationships are, and how they need to be carefully cultivated. Close to half of all business growth is controlled by the Chinese, both of mainland China and those living permanently overseas. It is a vast network of family, colleagues, and acquaintances that controls enormous wealth and provides an alternative to the kind of business institutions and services (including investment banks, lawyers, and accountants) more universally available in the West.. <p>John Naisbitt in his new book "Megatrends Asia: Profit or Peril" addresses the importance of the ethnic Chinese spread throughout the Far East in a decentralized business web. Likewise, so does author Jim Rohwer in &quot;Asia Rising: Why America Will Prosper as Asia's Economies Boom.&quot; The latter's central thesis is that more than offsetting the competition in labor and manufacturing to the West is the tremendous markets these rapidly developing economies of the East offer. Both books provide useful understanding to those of us seeking business partnerships and growth in this area. <p>In the more immediate future, US travel to China will be stimulated by people wanting to experience Hong Kong before the PRC takeover next year, and the Yangtze River, before the high dam changes the river's character forever, according to Simon Winchester, Asia-Pacific Editor of CN Traveler speaking at a PATA gathering in New York in February. <p>One question centers on whether the new Chinese bureaucracy will allow the former British Crown Colony to prosper as it has in the past. <p>Then, too, there is the possibility that Shanghai, which serves the more dynamic northern provinces, will eclipse Hong Kong as China's principal commercial hub and gateway to the West. <p>In short, Hong Kong may be experiencing its best days right now. <p>The Yangtze River dam project of the coming decade will displace whole villages, compromise the natural beauty of many parts of the river, and restrict its flow in others to limit navigation. So best see it now, many believe, tour operators included.<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="concerns"></A>Concerns About Safety Abroad</FONT><br>According to the Menlo Consulting Group's TravelStyles&reg; study, 8% of all outbound pleasure travelers feared for their safety at some time on their last international trip, and 3% were victims of some criminal act. This translates to 2.4 million persons who were in fear, and 900,000 who actually were victimized. Since these are averages for all foreign-traveling Americans, some countries were much higher. Furthermore, these incidence levels can be multiplied many times in terms of their influence on potential travel, due to victims' expression of displeasure to their friends upon returning home-not to mention when the press prints any of this kind of bad news. <p>The problem also is that Americans have a low level of awareness of what goes on abroad, and of geography. &quot;The Troubles&quot; in Northern Ireland mean cancellations for Dublin, for example. People getting shot in a restaurant in St. Thomas has a ripple effect for tourism throughout the Caribbean. <p>The violent crimes three years ago in Florida prompted cancellations en masse from Europe, and the state was still suffering for it when another such incident occurred this year. One can be philosophical that shootings, robberies, and other unpleasantries have always happened to travelers. But this is serious business today, because relative safe destination alternatives are readily available, and those with unsafe images lose out...big time! <p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><p><FONT size=+2><A NAME="avideois"></A>A Video is Worth a Thousand Words</FONT><br>Kerry Cannon's Destinations on Tape, on the other hand, distributes videos for travel suppliers. Twice each year the catalog is mailed to 1.2 million US households with high leisure travel potential. Each supplier listing, with color logo and descriptive copy of the product, is priced at $1,975. There is virtually no other expense or effort on the part of the supplier since the consumer pays the cost of duplicating and shipping the tapes ordered. Each participating supplier then receives a list of those consumers ordering its tape-certainly a well-qualified group since each tape costs $7.00. (See our consumer letter The Travel Leader for further description of the service.) For more information call Destinations on Tape at 800-822-4604.

The new (February; 1995) Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC), a governmentally chartered private-public corporation replaces the old government agency, Tourism Canada. Now with a lot of help from its friends in the private sector, Canada has an annual promotion budget of $100 million. According to Tom Penney, the CTC's marketing director for the US, over $34 million of the funds this year have been allocated in media advertising and promotion towards developing this market...and are pretty much already spent in anticipation of the summer season. <p>Advertising emphasis is concentrated in New York, Chicago, and LA, to enable the14-week TV program, begun in February, to achieve effective impact. This means that the campaign's 250/week rating point level is strong enough to be heard above all the clutter and clatter on the tube. (And if you cannot afford that level in a major market, TML's experience says, don't even bother being there on TV.) <p>At the same time, the promise and tone of the commercials should get attention. Sophisticated urban charm and spectacular natural settings come alive with people kissing and whales breaching. Very nice! No need to know, therefore, whether the action is in Vancouver or in Montreal, in the Bay of Fundy or on the coast of British Columbia, which allows for a unified national campaign. The theme is "The World Needs More Canada" The campaign is extended with inserts in upscale magazines such as The New Yorker, Gourmet, and Travel & Leisure. Vickers & Benson, Toronto, is the advertising agency. <p>The promotion does not let us Yanks forget that the US dollar goes one-third further in Canada than at home. Also there is the new "Open Skies" agreement with the US, which means that the airlines from both the US and Canada are virtually unrestricted in their bilateral route expansions. Air Canada alone since February 1995 has added more than 30 new routes between the US and Canada. <p><FONT size=+2>People Magazine's Victories at Sea</FONT><br>There is no mystery about People magazine's ability to efficiently reach travelers of just about any stripe. The problem is, the efficiency only works with national buys in the magazine, and who's got that kind of money in the travel industry? The answer is Carnival Cruise Lines, the largest in the world. From Carnival's perspective the magazine's extensive reach can attract first time cruisers (only 2% of the US population has ever set foot on a cruise ship) in great quantities. From People magazine's perspective, this is the largest exclusive media buy in the history of the magazine. McFarland and Drier, Miami, is the ad agency. <p>This comes on the heals of the Cruise Lines International Association's (CLIA) 24-page People magazine insert on February 12. Replies are coming in at a rate four times greater than last year, according to Jim Godsman, CLIA's president. CN Traveler magazine also was a part of this "National Cruise Vacation Month" promotional program that includes a sweepstakes driving consumers to travel agencies, which as we all know, make over 95% of all cruise booking. <p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="whoson"></A>Who's On First?</FONT><br><B>MUSICAL CHAIRS AT THE TOP CRUISE LINES Adam Aron</B> has resigned as chairman and CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL). He has been named to the same post at Vail Resorts Inc. which operated Vail and Beaver Creek ski resorts in Colorado. A Harvard &quot;B School&quot; alum, his travel industry career has been marked by highly innovative marketing programs, including the frequent flyer plan at PanAm, champaign flights for Western Airlines, and later a range of imaginative merchandising at Hyatt. <p><B>Bruce Nierenberg</B>, also a marketing innovator, becomes EVP at NCL where he started his career in the cruise industry. A pioneer in the concept of family cruising, he went on to found Premiere Cruise Lines and, with Costa, American Family Cruises, which Costa folded after eight months of operation. <p><B>Rod McLeod</B>, who had resigned precipitously as EVP of Royal Caribbean Cruise Line (RCCL), will assume the same title July 1, when his contractual &quot;non-compete&quot; clause expires, at Carnival, reporting to his old industry colleague and rival <B>Bob Dickson</B>, the line's president.. The four marketing vice presidents under McLeod at RCCL (Mike Applebaum, sales; Adam Goldstein, marketing; Margarita Navarrete, passenger services; and Brian Rice, market planning and development) now will report directly to the line's president <B>Richard Fein</B>. <p><B>Peter Ward</B>, former Rolls Rolls-Royce Motor Cars head brought in by Trafalgar House to run Cunard prior to its being sold to Norway's Kvaerner Plc., has resigned. For the moment his reorganization and marketing programs remain in place. He is being replace by <B>Antti Pankakoski</B>, a lawyer and head of Kvaerner's shipbuilding operation. Some speculate that the line is being dressed up to be sold off piecemeal. <p><B>OTHER CHANGINGS OF THE GUARD</B> <br><B>George Her</B>n has retired as vp/public relations at the French Government Tourist Office. George's career spans over three decades at Air France and at the FGTO, where he also supervised the advertising and promotional programs. He will continue to do independent communications consulting. He can be reached in New York City at 212 751 5311; in Palm Beach, Florida, at 407 844 0424. <p><B>Kenneth Hine</B> is retiring as president and CEO of the American Hotel & Motel Association (AH&amp;MA), where he has served for 27 years. He was inducted into the Travel Industry Association's Hall of Leaders at the TIA's annual conference on October 17. <p><B>William Fisher</B> has replaced Hine at AH&amp;MA. Fisher comes from a similar post at the National Restaurant Association (NRA)where he is credited with creating an educational foundation, with having intensified the organization's government affairs efforts in Washington, and with restructuring the NRA's financial and administrative activities. He also lectured and was an assistant professor at the Cornell Hotel School, from which he holds undergraduate and advanced degrees. <p><B>Antonio Enriques Savignac</B> for personal reasons has stepped down effective September 1 as Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization(WTO) headquartered in Madrid, saying that the job is an exhausting one and that he didn't feel he was able to handle the required pace any longer. He has held the post for the past six and a half years, traveling incessantly for the organization during that period. Savignac, as you may remember, is the former Secretary of Tourism for Mexico, and earlier, while head of FONATUR, was in charge of developing the now highly successful resorts of Cancun and Ixtapa. He is returning to Mexico where he plans to remain active in teaching and writing about matters relating to tourism. <p><B>Francesco Frangialli</B>, deputy secretary-general, takes over Savignac's duties on an interim basis until a new secretary-general is elected and installed January 1, 1998. In spite of the US's decision, as part of its privatization posture to which the US Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA) recently succumbed, to resign and withhold its $500,000 annual dues, Fragialli says that the WTO &quot;is in good shape, we have the respect of our members and are in a healthy financial situation....&quot; Savignac is generally credited with a large share of this success. <p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="marketin"></A><B>MARKETING BRIEFS</B></FONT><br><B>T&L AND TW STILL TOP MEDIA GUNS</B> <br>Revenues for magazines in the travel classification increased 8% last year, according to Ad Age, more than keeping pace with the top revenue earners, newsweeklies, which gained 5.8%. <p>Travel & Leisure, the category's revenue leader, took in $85.5 million from circulation and ad sales. <p>Travel Weekly, the largest of the trades, realized $78.6 in revenues. to make it second overall in the travel publishing industry, consumer or trade. <p>The third most revenue-bearing book is Endless Vacation, a property of Resort Condominiums International, at $75.4 million. <p>Of ten business magazine classifications, travel is third behind computers and electronic engineering. TW, Travel Agent, and Tour & Travel News lead the trade category, which at $174 million, was 3.4% behind the previous year's revenue performance. <p><B>$5 BILLION TIMESHARE MARKET, ONCE THE UGLY DUCKLING OF LODGING, <br>NOW GETS PLENTY OF RESPECT </B><br>Back in the early eighties, when consumer abuse by the industry spawned a sleazy public image, annual sales were only $480 million. By the time the nineties were underway, however, the industry had cleaned itself up and had attracted operators such as Marriott, Hilton, ITT Sheraton and Disney. Their presence has played no small part in making timeshare the $5 billion industry it is today. <p>Another important factor has been the demographic growth of the family market. These increasing numbers of baby boomer parents are attracted to the opportunity for a familial bonding experience (until they've actually done it a couple of times), not to mention the seductive economics of being able to load the whole gang into a resort condo during vacations. <p>The company that dominated the industry's marketing then, as it does now, was Resort Condominiums International. Generally referred to in the trade simply as RCI, the company was founded by Christel DeHaan (with her ex husband). Now she is selling it to acquisitive-bent HFS, which under its chairman Henry Silverman, is constructing a deal that could be worth $825 million and puts her on the HFS board. Now that's a lot of respect. <p>Silverman, who only recently acquired Avis, sees RCI as part of a horizontal integration of travel facilities that includes 5,300 lodging franchises with names such as Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Ramada, Super 8, Knights Inn, Park Inn and Travelodge. <p>Now he will have a leading travel media outlet as well in which to tell his story. Endless Vacation magazine.<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="adagency"></A>AD AGENCY ACTION</FONT><br>Who can image Leo Burnett Chicago (creators of The Marlboro Man) without United Airlines (also creators of "Friendly Skies") after 31 years? The $100 million however has been reassigned to Fallon McElligott Minneapolis and Young & Rubicam of New York. Others in the running included the incumbent, plus Ammirati Puris Lintas, and TBWA Chiat/Day. <p>Fallon McElligott also handles Holiday Inn Worldwide, while in more than 40 countries Y&R handles Lufthansa, which has a marketing agreement with United. <p>Radisson Hospitality Worldwide, a division of the Carlson Companies, headquartered in Minneapolis, on the other hand, has chosen Ingalls advertising of Boston to handle its advertising account, estimated at $5-6 million. <p>The Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corp. account of $2 million goes to Tierney & Partners, Philadelphia, a division of True North Communications. <p><B>More Information Please</B><br><B>PATA Scrutinizes Region's Performance</B><br>"We are seeing a continued shift in the origin of travelers to the Pacific Asia region as a result of the growing economies of Asia," says Ms. Low Hoh Gek, Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) Director of Research. "With the emerging outbound markets of India, Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, this trend will be even more pronounced in future years." Asian travelers now account for 60.6% of the 36 PATA member nation arrivals up from 45.1% just a decade ago. Conversely, the share of arrivals from North America has declined during the period to 12.5% from 22.4%.<p>The overall increase for the PATA member destinations was up 9.1% last year, according to the organization's 125-page Annual Statistical Report, just released. It is available for a fee from PATA headquarters in San Francisco: Fax (415) 986-3458, phone: (415) 986-4646, e-mail: pata@class.org.<p><B>The ETC Looks Ahead</B><br>Meanwhile, the European Travel Commsiion (ETC) ponders whether the North American visitor count, running 5.3% ahead this year for a projected 9 million visitors in 1996, can be increased by one-third to 12 million departures by the year 2000, just four years from now, the kind of increase reminiscent of the early eighties. This is the question examined by speakers at the annual half-day marketing conference at New York's Grand Hyatt Hotel on Friday, November 8. For information call Donald N. Martin & Company at (212) 307-1200, fax (212) 307-1205 or e-mail at: dnmco@aol.com.<p><B>The Big Picture Sums it All Up</B><br>To read, or even to browse through the Travel Industry World Yearbook, The Big Picture 1995-96, makes us aware of how very much is happening globally in tourism, and how little we know. This 162-page volume proceeds from an overview and industry highlights, through the US states and foreign destination countries, to analyses by industry sectur (i.e. travel agents, hotels, airlines, etc.). Its text reflects the many years of active experience in the industry by the author, Somerset Waters, and the thoroughly professional editing job by former ASTA Travel News Editor Tom Bridges. The Big Picture is available for $79 plus $3 S&H ($11 foreign) from P.O. Box 610, Rye, NY 10580 or by calling (914) 921-0988.<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><A HREF="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif"ISMAP BORDER="0" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></UL></BODY></HTML>

Writers and editors, including columnists and news directors at radio and TV stations, are informed and reminded of Travel Leader PR News' &quot;Web&quot; address (www.travelleader.com) via an initial Rolodex card mailing, quarterly newsletter mailings, and other activities thereafter. Registration for sweepstakes drawings and Travel Leader Services' own consumer and industry newsletters linked to the Travel Leader PR News (PRN) site will promote repeat visits. <p>Various routes of accessing documents on the service are available to the press. The name of each member (or client) is listed according to destination or service category, and is linked to the member's Travel Leader PR News &quot;contents page&quot;. The headline of the release or background paper appears on the &quot;What's New?&quot; page for 30 days, and on the member's own PRN &quot;contents page,&quot; in both cases being linked to the full text of the PR document. <br><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="rates"></A>Rates and Billing<br></FONT> 1. The rate is $25.00 per page or portion thereof, which covers its being electronically entered and maintained online for the first month. The rate is $7.00 per page for each month the document remains thereafter. All billing statements are based upon the documents that are online on the final business day of each month. Package rates also are available that represent substantial savings. (see Package Rates below) <p>2. A page is defined as up to 300 words. For example, a release of 500 words would be billed at $50 for the first month, and $14 for each month thereafter. <p>3. All releases requiring scanning from mailed or faxed hard copy incur an additional one-time fee of $5 per page. <p>4. Establishment of each member's "contents page" will incur a one-time fee of $50 for scanning and positioning the logo. For initial postings of 25 or more pages, this fee is waived. If contact names, address, phone and fax numbers do not appear in the text of each release, instructions should be given for this information to be incorporated in the "contents page" header design. A press release letterhead usually can serve as artwork for the "contents page" elements. <p>5. Billing statements will be sent only to.U.S.and Canadian billing addresses. Remittance must be in dollars drawn on U.S.or Canadian banks.(An addditional $2.50 clearance fee per check is charged for all checks drawn on Canadian banks.) All statements are due upon receipt, and will be in arrears at the end of the next calendar month. If the member is in arrears, all documents may be automatically removed from online. <br><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="press"></A>Press Kit Continuity Package Rates</FONT> <br># of Pages Online  Annual Rate <I>(billed quarterly) </I><br>10............................$1,250 <br>25 ...........................$1,950 <br>50 ...........................$3,450 <br>75 ...........................$5,150 <br>100 .........................$5,950 <br><p><I>Package Price Includes:</I> <UL><LI>Initial placement of all releases online from supplied disk or e-mail. <LI>Scanning of supplied art for color logo for contents page <LI>E-mail link <LI>Hyperlinks to members' Web sites (with reciprocal links). <LI>Entering new/replacement pages annually up to twice the number of pages online (i.e. a 50-page plan allows for 100 replacement pages annually). <LI>Extra pages billed at prorated package rate. <LI>Listed in mailings to over 1,000 travel press </UL><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="member"></A>Placement Policies</FONT> <br>1. Members simply fill out a registration form the first time they use Travel Leader PR News. This records contact names, billing and other addresses, telephone, fax and e-mail numbers, and provides that each member understands and accepts the procedures, terms, and conditions for using the service. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by Travel Leader, no terms or conditions, printed, written or oral, accompanying releases or otherwise expressed by the member that conflict with this Fact Sheet shall not be binding on Travel Leader. <p>2. Once the New Member Registration Form has been filed with Travel Leader Services, either as hard copy or electronically via the WWW site, releases transmitted to the service automatically are placed online. Members are responsible for notifying Travel Leader Services when the release is to be removed from the service. If this is known at the time of the posting, this may be specified then, and plainly marked to that effect..."remove after 30 days"<p>3. Releases will receive the fastest execution and incur the least possibility for electronic error if they are transmitted via e-mail. Floppy disks also may be sent, and in fact, are recommended if a number of releases are to be posted at a given time, such as in the initial establishment of a site on the service, when hard copy of the member's logo also should be included to be scanned as the heading for the "contents page"<br> <br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="procedure"></A>Procedures for Members Submitting Releases to Post Online</FONT><br> <I>Members- Kindly submit releases, whether on disk or via e-mail, in the following format: </I><UL><LI>Single-spaced <LI>12 point New Or Times New Roman font<LI>Left-justified (i.e.no centering) <LI>No accents above or below letters, underlining, italicizing, etc. <LI>Text Only documents. simply select &quot;Save AS...&quot; under the File menu and choose &quot;Text only,&quot; Plain Text,&quot; or simply &quot;Text,&quot; to save documents in basic ASCII format. </UL><p>Addresses and phone numbers: <p>The e-mail address is: prnews@travelleader.com <p>Releases should be sent as attachments &quot;pasted&quot; to the transmitting document. <p>The postal address is: Webmaster Travel Leader PR News PO Box 2397 Darien, CT 06820 <p>The fax number is 203 662 0455 <p>The telephone number for all inquiries is 203 655 4947 <br><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="general"></A>General</FONT> Travel Leader Services, the service provider, has the right to refuse material deemed by them to be salacious or otherwise inappropriate, are not responsible for, and disclaim any liability for, the opinions or information expressed in the material provided by members, and disclaim any responsibility for errors in material provided by clients, in transcription, or other electronic errors. <p>In consideration of the publication of public relations and advertising materials, the originator and agency, jointly and severally, will unconditionally indemnify and save the publisher, its agents, employees and officers, harmless, on demand, from and against any and all loss, liability and expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) suffered or incurred by reason of any claims, proceedings or suits for libel, violation of right of privacy, plagiarism, copyright infringement, and any other claims or suits based on the contents or subject matter of such public relations and advertising materials.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>TL PR News FAQ</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/tlpr/tlprlogo.gif" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="54" ALIGN=bottomNATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><p><font size=+2>FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</font></center><p><b>Q. What is the purpose of Travel Leader PR News?</b><br>A. To serve travel writers. They increasingly are using The Internet's World Wide Web as an information resource, many checking it daily. <p><b>Q. Is Travel Leader PR News  redundant with press releases already distributed by other means?</b><br>A. Not at all, because the main purpose of Travel Leader PR News  is to provide an archive of releases and background pieces readily available to writers at any time. Writers no longer will have to fish out news releases or press kits sent them weeks ago, or request new ones. Recent release hyperlinked headlines, however, receive immediate visibility on the "What's New?" page, remaining there for 30 days.<p><b>Q. Do members have their own proprietary sites within Travel Leader PR News?</b><br>A. Yes. They even can have its own URLs to allow access directly from other sites, and have their  own "home pages" with their own color logos and directories of releases available online.<p><b>Q. How will travel editors and writers know that Travel Leader PR News  exists on the Internet, and where to find it?</b><br>A. Initially the travel press - including both consumer and trade resources, as well as electronic and print media - will receive a mailing that explains the service, that it is free to them, and that lists its members. <p>A ROLODEX card containing the Travel Leader PR News URL (http://www.travelleader.com) also will be included for continual reference. <br><p>In addition, a sweepstakes with highly attractive prozes will be offered exclusively for members of the travel press.<br><p>Other relevant high traffic Internet sites also will be linked, as will the consumer and industry newsletters at the Travel Leader Services site.<p><b>Q. Is Travel Leader PR News  redundant with members' existing Web sites? And can links be established to jump to them?</b><br>A. Travel Leader PR News  exists primarily to serve the press. Consumer traffic ("hits") nevertheless will occur as a bonus. Members having Web sites of their own, therefore, may want hyperlinks. <br><p>Those carrying 10 or more pages monthly (three month minimum) on Travel Leader PR News  can be linked to their home pages at no charge.<p><b>Q. How affordable is the service?</b><br>A. Very affordable indeed....Each ongoing page (up to 300 words) online costs just $7.00 per month after the first month. The rate for the first month is $25.00 per page, including the listing in "What's New?" Package rates also are available for members wishing to archive the body of their press releases for reference by writers. (See- Press Kit Continuity Package Rates - in the Fact Sheet.)<p>For more information call DANesbett:203-655-4947<br>fax: 203-662-0455<br>e-mail: <a href="mailto:dnesbett@travelleader.com">dnesbett@travelleader.com</a><p><center><a href="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif" ISMAP border=0 WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom></a></center></body></html>

Writers and editors, including columnists and news directors at radio and TV stations, are informed and reminded of Travel Leader PR News' &quot;Web&quot; address (www.travelleader.com) via an initial Rolodex card mailing, quarterly newsletter mailings, and other activities thereafter. Registration for sweepstakes drawings and Travel Leader Services' own consumer and industry newsletters linked to the Travel Leader PR News (PRN) site will promote repeat visits. <p>Various routes of accessing documents on the service are available to the press. The name of each member (or client) is listed according to destination or service category, and is linked to the member's Travel Leader PR News &quot;contents page&quot;. The headline of the release or background paper appears on the &quot;What's New?&quot; page for 30 days, and on the member's own PRN &quot;contents page,&quot; in both cases being linked to the full text of the PR document. <br><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="rates"></A>Rates and Billing<br></FONT> 1. The rate is $25.00 per page or portion thereof, which covers its being electronically entered and maintained online for the first month. The rate is $7.00 per page for each month the document remains thereafter. All billing statements are based upon the documents that are online on the final business day of each month. Package rates also are available that represent substantial savings. (see Package Rates below) <p>2. A page is defined as up to 300 words. For example, a release of 500 words would be billed at $50 for the first month, and $14 for each month thereafter. <p>3. All releases requiring scanning from mailed or faxed hard copy incur an additional one-time fee of $5 per page. <p>4. Establishment of each member's "contents page" will incur a one-time fee of $50 for scanning and positioning the logo. For initial postings of 25 or more pages, this fee is waived. If contact names, address, phone and fax numbers do not appear in the text of each release, instructions should be given for this information to be incorporated in the "contents page" header design. A press release letterhead usually can serve as artwork for the "contents page" elements. <p>5. Billing statements will be sent only to.U.S.and Canadian billing addresses. Remittance must be in dollars drawn on U.S.or Canadian banks.(An addditional $2.50 clearance fee per check is charged for all checks drawn on Canadian banks.) All statements are due upon receipt, and will be in arrears at the end of the next calendar month. If the member is in arrears, all documents may be automatically removed from online. <br><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="press"></A>Press Kit Continuity Package Rates</FONT> <br># of Pages Online  Annual Rate <I>(billed quarterly) </I><br>10............................$1,250 <br>25 ...........................$1,950 <br>50 ...........................$3,450 <br>75 ...........................$5,150 <br>100 .........................$5,950 <br><p><I>Package Price Includes:</I> <UL><LI>Initial placement of all releases online from supplied disk or e-mail. <LI>Scanning of supplied art for color logo for contents page <LI>E-mail link <LI>Hyperlinks to members' Web sites (with reciprocal links). <LI>Entering new/replacement pages annually up to twice the number of pages online (i.e. a 50-page plan allows for 100 replacement pages annually). <LI>Extra pages billed at prorated package rate. <LI>Listed in mailings to over 1,000 travel press </UL><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="member"></A>Placement Policies</FONT> <br>1. Members simply fill out a registration form the first time they use Travel Leader PR News. This records contact names, billing and other addresses, telephone, fax and e-mail numbers, and provides that each member understands and accepts the procedures, terms, and conditions for using the service. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by Travel Leader, no terms or conditions, printed, written or oral, accompanying releases or otherwise expressed by the member that conflict with this Fact Sheet shall not be binding on Travel Leader. <p>2. Once the New Member Registration Form has been filed with Travel Leader Services, either as hard copy or electronically via the WWW site, releases transmitted to the service automatically are placed online. Members are responsible for notifying Travel Leader Services when the release is to be removed from the service. If this is known at the time of the posting, this may be specified then, and plainly marked to that effect..."remove after 30 days"<p>3. Releases will receive the fastest execution and incur the least possibility for electronic error if they are transmitted via e-mail. Floppy disks also may be sent, and in fact, are recommended if a number of releases are to be posted at a given time, such as in the initial establishment of a site on the service, when hard copy of the member's logo also should be included to be scanned as the heading for the "contents page"<br> <br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="procedure"></A>Procedures for Members Submitting Releases to Post Online</FONT><br> <I>Members- Kindly submit releases, whether on disk or via e-mail, in the following format: </I><UL><LI>Single-spaced <LI>12 point New Or Times New Roman font<LI>Left-justified (i.e.no centering) <LI>No accents above or below letters, underlining, italicizing, etc. <LI>Text Only documents. simply select &quot;Save AS...&quot; under the File menu and choose &quot;Text only,&quot; Plain Text,&quot; or simply &quot;Text,&quot; to save documents in basic ASCII format. </UL><p>Addresses and phone numbers: <p>The e-mail address is: prnews@travelleader.com <p>Releases should be sent as attachments &quot;pasted&quot; to the transmitting document. <p>The postal address is: Webmaster Travel Leader PR News PO Box 2397 Darien, CT 06820 <p>The fax number is 203 662 0455 <p>The telephone number for all inquiries is 203 655 4947 <br><br><a href="#top"><img src="up.gif" border=0 alt="Up"></a><hr><FONT size=+2><A NAME="general"></A>General</FONT> Travel Leader Services, the service provider, has the right to refuse material deemed by them to be salacious or otherwise inappropriate, are not responsible for, and disclaim any liability for, the opinions or information expressed in the material provided by members, and disclaim any responsibility for errors in material provided by clients, in transcription, or other electronic errors. <p>In consideration of the publication of public relations and advertising materials, the originator and agency, jointly and severally, will unconditionally indemnify and save the publisher, its agents, employees and officers, harmless, on demand, from and against any and all loss, liability and expense (including reasonable attorneys fees) suffered or incurred by reason of any claims, proceedings or suits for libel, violation of right of privacy, plagiarism, copyright infringement, and any other claims or suits based on the contents or subject matter of such public relations and advertising materials.

Tabulations revealthat roughly half of the respondents access the Internet on a regular basis.<BR><BR>In addition to the Web's being a valuable information resource, a numberof freelancers are auditing the sites of publications in which their &quot;hardcopy&quot; has appeared. They do so to ascertain whether there was any copyrightviolation....meaning whether or not additional royalties are due them forusing their work online. Heaven forbid that a publication might forget tomail a supplementary check. <P><CENTER></CENTER><P><FONT size=+1><B>TRAVEL JOURNALIST ORGANIZATIONS MERGE AND DIVERGE</B></FONT><BR>Don Bonhaus, US director of the World Federation of Travel Writers and Journalists(FIJET) tells us the organization currently is exploring opportunities toincrease its presence here, such as with the International Food, Wine & TravelWriters Association (IFW&amp;TWA). Such an expansion would add 450 journaliststo the 2,300+ members in 50 countries, where there also are 40 affiliateorganizations. FIJET was founded in 1954, and headquarters in Kortenberg,Belgium. <BR><BR>(FIJET Congress XXXIX October 23-30 in Mar Del Plata, Argentina, was themed,&quot;Internet, accessibility and opportunities for FIJET members.&quot;)<BR><BR>At the same time, the members of the Travel Journalist Guild (TJG) individuallyhave been invited to become members of FIJET. The Guild's membership isrestricted to 75 practicing professional (&quot;No clips, no trips&quot;)free lance writers. Membership slots are coveted. If you're thinking aboutapplying and wondering when there may be openings, start by reading obits.It's that tight. <BR><BR>The proposed merger between IFW&TA and NATJA, North American Travel JournalistsAssociation of 200 members, on the other hand, has been called off. NATJApresident and its newsletter writer Dan Schlossberg relates that insteadNATJA currently is focusing attention on an awards competition with prizesof three day weekends in several categories donated by Westin Hotels. <P><CENTER></CENTER><P><FONT size=+1><B><I>For more information...</I></B></FONT><BR>about travel press organizations, their activities and membership requirements,contact: <BR><BR><B>FIJET</B><BR>Don Bonhaus, US Director<BR>(World Federation of Travel Writers and Journalists)<BR>Tel: 908 291 2840 <BR>Fax: 908 291 9272 <BR><BR><B>IFW&amp;TWA</B><BR>Linda Marie Singer, Pres.<BR>Tel: 510 372 8805 <BR>(International Food, Wine & Travel Writers Association)<BR>E-Mail: lindamari@aol.com<BR>Ron Hodges, Exec.Dir.<BR>Tel: 310 433 5969<BR>E-Mail: medialpro@deltanet.com<BR><BR><B>NATJA</B><BR>Dan Schlossberg, Pres.<BR>(North American Travel Journalists Association)<BR>Tel: 201 791 3160<BR>Fax: 201 791 3349 <BR>E-Mail: 71574,3252@compuserve.com<BR><BR><B>NYTWA</B><BR>Tom Passavant, Pres<BR>(New York Travel Writers Association)<BR>Tel: 212 969 7517 <BR>Fax: 212 969 7557<BR><BR><B>SATW</B><BR>Susan Rexer, Admin.

ESCAPE</B> A new travel market on the block is Escape magazine, whichis focusing on adventure travel (try Bhutan, Outer Mongolia and North Korea).A charter issue free offer was mailed in September into high demo neighborhoods.Unsolicited manuscripts and photographs are welcome (with SASE), with noset payment scale established yet for either. The mailing address is POBox 5159, Santa Monica, CA 90409-5159. The phone there is 310 392 5235.<BR><BR><B>2. ADVENTURE TRAVEL BUSINESS</B> The fact that adventure travel really is on the leading edge these days is further exhibited by another publication entry, the trade spin off of Adventure West magazine, Adventure Travel Business. Its subjects cover conservation management and natural resources, marketing, trends, clients liability and risk management (people really do fall off of rocky cliffs and drown in raging rivers), doing business on The Internet, merchandising, etc. Queries can be emailed to editors@adv-media.com&gt; or mailed to PO Box 3210, Incline Village, NV 89450. <BR><BR>Best yet, visit the Adventure Travel Society site: <A HREF="http://www.adventurewest.com/">http://www.adventurewest.com</A>and get all of the needed addresses, editors' names and their individualemails, plus editorial and photo requirements and rates, paying up to $850for Adventure West stories. <BR><BR><B>3. GETAWAYS</B> The handsome premiere issue (250,000 copies) is out,edited by David Breul, formerly the editor of the late, and equally handsome,European Travel & Life. So far, the Getaways editors have bought only assignedstories, but unsolicited M/S's will be considered in the future, as wellas queries. Focus is on short, luxury vacation experiences in North America,which in addition to the US, Canada and Mexico, includes Hawaii and theCaribbean. The magazine's web site is <A HREF="http://www.getawaysmag.com/">http://www.getawaysmag.com</A>Send material to 95 Chestnut St , Providence, RI 02903.

TWO EXCELLENT EXAMPLES:</B></FONT><P><CENTER></CENTER><P><B>1. MINDSTORE</B><BR>Hal Gieseking, former Consumer Editor of the Reader's Digest's Travel Holidaymagazine, past president of SATW, and author of 12 travel books, is mindingthe store all right. He has launched a new venture on the Internet: theMindstore: <A HREF="http://www.wmbg.com/mindstore">http://www.wmbg.com/mindstore</A>. The program offers courses onthe Internet of particular interest to writers and travel industry personnel.<BR><BR>One of these is a photography workshop conducted by Tom and Michele Grimm,world-trotting photographers whose color images have appeared in dozensof magazines. <BR><BR>The other is a course taught by Richard Janssen, former Senior Editor ofBusiness Week, called &quot;The Art of News Writing: Choosing and Schmoozing.&quot;The program could be of real help to anyone who has ever had to write afeature article for a newsletter or local newspaper or send out news releases,Hal tells us in his usual soft spoken manner. <BR><BR>Both courses begin with a free lesson to let Internet surfers decide ifthe course is for them. They can then purchase the balance of the coursefor $10 (photography workshop) or $15 (journalism course). But first, Halsuggests, check out those free lessons on the Internet! In case of emergencyhis email address is: hal@wmbg.com<BR><BR><B>2. WRITER/PHOTOGRAPHER LEE FOSTER , ONLINE A DOZEN YEARS ALREADY, JUSTKEEPS WINNING AWARDS</B><BR>Lee Foster, chairman of the Electronic Media Committee of SATW, has beennamed the 1996 winner of the Lowell Thomas award in the category of ElectronicComputer Media.

The headline refers to the just completedWorld Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children.

Also demonstrating travel's growing popularity, 76 percent of U.S. adults took at least one trip of 100 miles or more away from home in 1995, a profound increase from 1985 when only 63 percent reported the same.<p>Americans have a love affair with travel. It is now a staple product and for most Americans represents our nation's founding principle--freedom.  In addition, travel is affordable and easy, due to competition and sophisticated infrastructure--also results of our nation's core values, explained TIA President & CEO William S. Norman.  This love affair has created a $430 billion industry that the nation now depends upon for economic sustenance.<p>The data comes from TIA's -1995 Travel Market Report- which is based on results of TIA's National Travel Survey of 18,000 U.S. households.  The report sells for $225 for non-members and $150 for TIA members.<p>TIA is the national, non-profit organization representing all components of the $430 billion travel industry.

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>CLIA</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><FONT size=-1>Contact:<BR>Diana M. Orban Associates<BR>#104823<BR>(201) 605-2121</FONT> <BR><P><CENTER><FONT size=+2><B>WHERE CAN YOU GO ON A CRUISE?</B></FONT><BR>From Ashdod to Zanzibar, and (Nearly) All Points in Between </CENTER><P>In days of yore, sailors set out for ports undiscovered with little morethan a compass and some not-too-edible food. Luckily for today's cruisers,those days are long gone. <BR><BR>What isn't gone, though, is the sense of adventure that's awakened whenheaded for ports unknown. <BR><BR>From Ashdod in Israel to Zanzibar in Tanzania, and nearly all points inbetween, cruise ships are crisscrossing the globe and taking vacationersto more exotic and unusual destinations. And, with more than 1,800 portsof call worldwide, cruise vacationers are finding possibilities as diverseas the destinations themselves. <BR><BR>&quot;Have you ever thought of visiting Casablanca on a cruise? How aboutLatvia or Estonia?&quot; asks James G. Godsman, president of Cruise LinesInternational Association (CLIA). &quot;If you think you can't get thereby cruise ship, think again, because with more than 1,800 ports worldwide-- and countless land excursions offering a chance to explore a country'sinterior -- chances are you can.&quot; <BR><BR>&quot;And unlike our pioneering predecessors, you'll eat well, enjoy plushaccommodations, genuine relaxation and an exciting dose of fun,&quot; Godsmansays. <BR><BR><B>Not Your Usual Ports of Call </B><BR>Cruise vacationers seeking the unexpected will often find that they neednot venture too far from the ships, as cruise lines are punctuating theiritineraries with stops in exotic ports. Windstar Cruises, for example, stopsin Casablanca, the Moroccan city made famous by Humphrey Bogart, IngridBergman and Rick's American Cafe. Costa Cruise Lines takes passengers toDubrovnik, Croatia and Tallinn, Estonia. And, Seawind Cruise Line visitsGrenada, an island of soaring peaks covered with rain forests and dottedwith volcanic craters. <BR><BR>Radisson Seven Seas Cruises lists the Chilean fjords, the Russian Far Eastand both polar regions among its most unusual offerings, while CommodoreCruise Line takes vacationers to two Honduras ports, Puerto Cortes and RoatanIsland. In the winter, Royal Olympic Cruises' ships sail the Amazon Riverand the Straits of Magellan in South America, arriving in Rio de Janeiroin time for the spectacular Carnival celebrations. <BR><BR>Some of Crystal Cruises' itineraries include stops in Dubai, Arab EmirateRepublic; Moroni, Grande Comore Island; and Muscat, Oman, while Orient Linesstops in Ashdod, Madagascar, Antarctica, Zanzibar, Napier and Tasmania.<BR><BR>Fare, Huahine; Hiva Ov, Marquesas and Castro, Chiloe Island, Chile top thelist of unusual destinations offered by Seabourn Cruise Line, while PrincessCruises will offer, for the first time in 1997, stops in Mauritania; Aden,Aqaba; Orkney Islands; Latvia and Estonia. <BR><BR>Travelers interested in Central America can sail a partial transit of thePanama Canal with Regal Cruises, and on the way stop in Puerto Limon, CostaRica, where Christopher Columbus landed on his fourth voyage. And, Caribbeanfans also will find something unusual to see, as Carnival Cruise Lines offersits passengers a chance to visit the less-traveled ports of St. Lucia, St.Barts and St. Kitts. <BR><BR><B>Chock Full of Culture</B> <BR>For those travelers who would like to witness history in the making, SilverseaCruises offers its inaugural voyages to South Africa, where guests may witnessthe dramatic social changes taking place in this most beautiful and diverseof countries. Oceanic Cruises' August itineraries are timed to allow passengersa chance to go ashore for Japan's festivals. And those sailing with BergenLine, a newcomer to the CLIA fleet, will visit ports along Norway's westerncoast, including Alesund, known for its Art Nouveau architecture, and Trondheim,home of Nidaros Cathedral, where Norway's kings are coronated. <BR><BR>Passengers of Holland America Line will set foot in the Mayan ruins of Tikalin Guatemala and Copan in Honduras, while Cunard Line passengers will attenda party among the ancient ruins of Ephesus, in the Turkish fishing villageof Kusadasi. Cruisers looking to just kick back and relax may enjoy a day-longvisit at Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's private destinations, Labadee andCocoCay, or an afternoon stay at Taku Lodge, an Alaskan hideaway nestledamid glaciers, mountains and forests, when sailing with Celebrity Cruises.<BR><BR>Cruisers can also choose to get up close and personal with the natural phenomenaof an area. For example, when visiting Alaska with Norwegian Cruise Line,passengers on a hike can peer into and touch deep blue ice caves at MendenhallGlacier, and while sailing American Hawaii Cruises, vacationers get a super-closelook, from the deck, at the Kilauea Volcano as molten lava flows down thehillside and into the sea. <BR><BR>And, literary buffs sailing with Delta Queen Steamboat Co. may choose aside trip to The Cave, the Hannibal, Mo., boyhood home of Samuel Clemensand setting of the annual National Tom Sawyers Days Festival. <BR><BR>&quot;The sea has long intrigued travelers,&quot; says Godsman. &quot;Aslong as there are people, there will be craving for adventure and excitement,and as long as there's that, there will be a need to feel like a sailor,exploring ports unknown.&quot; <BR><BR>To learn more about the destinations accessible by cruise ship, contacta CLIA-affiliated travel agency near you. To find one, visit CLIA's homepageon the Internet, at (<a href="http://www.ten-io.com/clia/">http://www.ten-io.com/clia/</a>), or look for CLIA's blue,gold and white logo in local travel agents' windows. <BR><BR>September 1996 <BR><BR>NOTE TO EDITORS: A copy of Cruise Lines International Association's Guideto Worldwide Destinations is available to editors only by calling (201)605-2121. <BR><BR>A booklet that includes CLIA's &quot;destinations grid&quot;</BODY></HTML><center><a href="http://www.travelleader.com/butbar2.map"><IMG SRC="http://www.travelleader.com/tlsbutbr.gif" ISMAP border=0 WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="78" ALIGN=bottom></a></center></body></html>

<p><center><b>100th Anniversary of Comic Strip Art - A year long event</center></b>

<p>Belgium may not be the birthplace, but it is definitely the cradle of the Comic Book.

<p>On 18 October 1896 a new form of art was born, when the Yellow Kid by Richard F. Outcault appeared in the New York Journal. This was the birth of comic strip art. For the first time the typical division into separate pictures was used for telling a story.  For the first time too, the speech balloon was used systematically to contain the dialogues.

<p>This editorial novelty came to Belgium only in 1929 with the creation of the comic strip character Tintin and was soon followed by Spirou, Lucky Luke and the Smurfs just to name a few.

<p>Belgium turned out to be an exceptionally fertile breeding ground for comic strip art.  Not only did the 9th Art thrive in our country - which it still does - but a whole comic strip culture has come into being. The most prestigious bookshops offer all kinds of comics, there are Tintin shops and comic strip book even has an influence on fashion, advertising and many other areas involving merchandising.

<p>The centenary of the comic strip art will therefore not go by silently.  There will be no single day on which the comic strip art lover will not be able to choose from a wide range of exhibitions throughout Belgium.  Center stage will be occupied by the Belgian Center for Comic Strip Art in Brussels,  a museum entirely dedicated to the 9th Art.     Herewith a selection of exhibitions:

<ul>
<li>Willy, Wanda and Fauna at the Antwerp Zoo from May through September 1996

<pre>
</pre><li>50 Years of Lucky Luke at the Center for Comic Strip Art in Brussels from June 4th through October 6th

<pre>
</pre><li>The traditional Meybom (planting of the tree) festivities in Brussels with a parade of giant comic strip art characters present on August 9th 1996
</ul>

<p>For more information contact : The Belgian Center for Comic Strip Art, 20 rue des Sables, 1000 Brussels.  Open every day from 10 am to 6 pm. Closed on Mondays and January 1, November 1 and December 25.
<br>Tel: 011 32 2/219.19.80 Fax: 011 32 2/219.23.76

<p>Hotels join the celebrations and offer special Comic Strip Art Weekends. For information and a complete calendar of events celebrating the 100th Anniversary of Comic Strip Art contact the Belgian Tourist Office in New York.

<p><center><b>"FROM ENSOR TO DELVAUX" MAJOR EXHIBIT TO BE HELD 
AT THE PROVINCIAL MUSEUM OF MODERN ART IN OSTEND 
FROM OCTOBER 5, 1996 UNTIL FEBRUARY 2, 1997</center></b>


<p>The best of twentieth-century painting is brought together in an exhibition at the Provincial Museum of Modern Art in Ostend.  "From Ensor to Delvaux" will present a unique selection of the best works by Ensor, Spilliaert, Permeke, Magritte and Delvaux.

<p>The collection surveys modern and contemporary visual art and includes: James Ensor (1860-1949) and Leon Spilliaert (1881-1946) both born in Ostend; and Constant Permeke (1885-1952) who worked and lived there for some time.  Together with the Brussels artists, Rene Magritte (1898-1967)  and Paul Delvaux (1897-1991) these artists form the core of modern art history in Belgium.

<p>Since art and tourism prove to be good partners, special packages are offered which include a guided tour of the exhibition and a night's stay with other possible tourist options.  In Ostend itself or the immediate surroundings there are several splendid museums which could form an interesting supplement to the exhibition: the Ensor house in Ostend, or the Paul Delvaux Museum in St. Idelsbald/Koksijde.  The Belgian art cities of Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp are less than one hour drive away.

In the rural Litchfield Hills nature provides an extravaganza of autumn colors as visitors enjoy gourmet meals in quaint country inns.</font></center>
<p>
LITCHFIELD, CT  --  Brilliantly hued autumn leaves provide a magnificent background for diners enjoying a meal in one of many Litchfield Hills country inns.  Terraces and porches look to scenic rivers and landscapes ablaze with a thousand shades of Autumn in this northwestern corner of the Nutmeg State where the prized broad leaved trees abound.
<p>
The Old Riverton Inn, Route 20, Riverton, CT. 860-379-8678 sits on the west branch of the Farmington River.  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and meticulously restored over the years, this friendly establishment has been pleasing visitors since it first opened exactly 200 years ago.  A Sunday dinner on the Grindstone Terrace may feature Chef Roy's Boneless Breast of Chicken with Sauce Barnaise and Almonds.
<p>
In the rural, tranquil setting by the Bantam River, The Stone House Cafe and Gallery, 637 Bantam Road, Rte. 202, Litchfield, CT; 860-567-3326 is a historic two-story structure that was once part of a farm.  Guests can have their meal on a patio above the river.  Among often requested specialties are the Stone House Crabcakes, served with a sweet-hot Thai Chili sauce.
<p>
The rustic Tributary Restaurant, On the River, Winsted, CT; 860-379-7679 was once known as the "Old Barn on Rowley Street".  Built in 1861 and carefully renovated, its interior bricks come from a torn-down jail.  Gourmets from near and far come to savor the Tributary Bouillabaisse, seafood simmered in a tomato broth, white wine, leeks, fennel and a touch of saffron over linguini.  The Brookside Bistro in West Cornwall, 860-672-6601 is steps away from the historic covered bridge on the Housatonic River, one of just two in Connecticut that can be crossed by car.  Lamb shank braised with white beans and red cabbage is a Bistro favorite served on the spacious screened porch that perches above a lively stream.

<br><b>INTER-CONTINENTAL CONCIERGES THE WORLD OVER UNVEIL 
CONFIDENTIAL TRAVEL INFORMATION</b>


<p>
<center><b>Concierge Confidential: 50 Years of Closely Guarded Travel Tips and Other Priceless 
Information is Available Free</b></center>

<p><b>LONDON (May 10, 1996)</b> -- When in Rome?  Do what the Inter-Continental concierge suggests:  rent a bike at the Spanish steps and pedal through Borghese park.  And when in Paris, San Francisco, Rio, Bali or Nairobi, do what Inter-Continentals coterie of concierges recommend to turn an ordinary trip into an extraordinary experience.

<p>As a service to travelers, Inter-Continental has published closely guarded travel tips, trivia and other priceless information from around the world in a booklet, called Concierge Confidential, that is free for the asking.  Here is a sampling of  recommendations:

<ul>
<li>Turn a bad hair day into a great one at Berlins Friseur Museum where the featured attraction is the history of hair.

<li>Take to the lake.  While the plumes of water shot from Genevas trademark Jet d'Eau are visible for miles, the best place to watch is from the quai Gustave Ador. 

<li>Set your sights on a samovar, military regalia or Imperial jewels at the Izmailovo flea market in Moscow and go via Europes grandest subway system.

<li>Go really down under on the Egouts de Paris tour which traces the history of the Paris sewer system.

<li>Savor New York's most expensive and well-known restaurants at lunch when many offer an affordable prix-fixe menu.

<li>Have your concierge call ahead, for the only way to purchase fine Finnish fabrics at the Marimekko Factory is by appointment only.  
</ul>

<p>To receive a free copy of Concierge Confidential,  call toll-free at (800)-615-6085.  For reservations, contact your local travel agent or Inter-Continental reservations at 1-800-327-0200.

Norman.  "Costs have kept pace with the low rate of inflation, and were it not for higher increases in the cost of lodging (+4.1%)  and entertainment (+3.7%), the overall cost of the travel experience in the United States in 1994 would have been less than the rate of inflation."<p>Data for December 1995 reveal few surprises.  Airline fares dropped 6.8 percent from November; this reflects a number of fare sales that took place during the month.  Motor fuel  prices, which had dropped 6.1 percent in November 1995, dropped another 1.9 percent in December as world oil supplies, while not necessarily "glutting" the market, remain plentiful.<p>The Travel Price Index, a product of TIA's research department, is based on the Consumer Price Index and measures seasonally unadjusted changes in the cost of travel in the United States.  It reached 158.3 (1982-84 = 100) in December 1995.  The Travel Price Index indicates that change in prices of travel goods and services available to the consumer in the U.S. and does not necessarily represent changes in the average fares, rates, and other costs travelers actually paid.<p><p><hr>TIA is the national, non-profit organization representing all components of the $430 billion U.S. travel industry.

<html><head><title>TIA</title></head><body bgcolor="ffffff"><font size=-1>DATE:<br>March 7, 1996<br>CONTACT:<br>Dexter Koehl<br>Shawn Flaherty<br>(202) 408-2137</font><p><center><font size=+2>STATE TOURISM BUDGETSGROW MODESTLY</font></center><p>WASHINGTON, DC--State governments* plan to spend $413 million for travel and tourism development and promotion in fiscal year 1995-96, according to the Travel Industry Association  of America's 1995-96 Survey of State Travel Offices.  The 1995-96 figure is up 2.5 percent compared to fiscal year 1994-95.  <p>"This may seem like the battle of the big budgets, but it really is a battle for the big bucks.  Travel and tourism generates a huge return on investment---so these states are anteing up.  For a majority, the travel industry is their first, second, or third largest employer, and a major source of new jobs," explained TIA President & CEO William S. Norman.<p>The importance of travel to state economies is also reflected in the dramatic increase in state travel office budgets evident over the longer-term.  For example, in 1984-85, all 50 state travel budgets totaled $189 million--less than half of this year's $413 million. <p>The 1995-96 Survey of State Travel Offices provides comprehensive data on state travel office operations and is intended as an informational guide for state travel directors, as well as those in private industry. The survey presents a categoric breakdown of both the projected budgets for fiscal year 1995-96, as well as the actual expenditures for fiscal year 1994-95.<p>Illinois, with a budget of $31.5 million, bumped Hawaii out of first place in terms of size of total tourism budget.  Hawaii's budget was slashed 21 percent from FY 1994-95. Maryland  recorded the largest increase in its overall budget, rising 74 percent to $8.9 million.  Conversely, Washington state experienced the largest drop, declining 49 percent. The average budget for state travel offices is $8.5 million.<p>A considerable amount of each state's travel office budget is allocated for advertising purposes.  Texas takes the lead in advertising, budgeting $9 million for 1995-96.  The total advertising budget for all states* is $110 million, up 5.3 percent.  The average advertising budget for 1995-96 is $2.5 million.<p>The 1995-96 Survey of State Travel Offices is available for $475 through the TIA membership department at (202) 408-TIAA.<p><font size=-1>* Colorado is not included in these figures since voters in 1994 rejected a two-tenths of a percent tax hike to fund the Colorado Tourism Board's operation.  As a result, Colorado is now the only state without a government-funded tourism office to help market their product.</font><p><hr><p>TIA is the national, non-profit association representing all components of the $430 billion U.S. travel industry.
