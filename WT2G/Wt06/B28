<p align="center"><b>Latest National Household Survey Results
Sound Marijuana Alarm (Again)</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking at a formal press conference, both Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Drug Czar Lee Brown took
time out to once again urge Americans to denounce the use of
marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana use is illegal, dangerous,
unhealthy, and wrong,&quot; Shalala reaffirmed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Armed with preliminary estimates from the 1994 National Survey on
Drug Abuse, the duo remarked that while overall illicit drug use
(defined as once in the past month) among the population as a
whole rose only marginally in the past year, the number of
teenagers using marijuana has nearly doubled since 1992.&nbsp;
&quot;Anyone who thinks we've licked the drug problem in this
country is living in a fantasy land,&quot; the Secretary remarked
at the press conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the study's preliminary findings, teens using
marijuana at least once a month rose from 4% in 1992 to 7.3% in
1994.&nbsp; Shalala called the findings &quot;a wake-up call for
America.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Put in historical context, however, the latest adolescent use
statistics still remain far below the peak reached in 1980.&nbsp;
According to annual studies conducted by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, the number of high school seniors ever having
admitted to experimenting with marijuana dropped significantly
from 50.9 percent in 1980 to 38.2 percent in 1994.&nbsp; Although
neither Brown nor Shalala mentioned this data during the
conference, the Office of National Drug Control Policy did
specify that even with the recent increase in the number of
teenagers admitting to having used marijuana regularly, current
adolescent rates of marijuana use still rank well below what they
were fifteen years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown speculated that the latest increase in teen marijuana
consumption might be due to pot's glamorization by the
entertainment industry. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Todd McCormick Free On Bail!</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 7, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; At a
September 7 bail reduction hearing, medical marijuana user and
San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder Todd McCormick had his
bail dropped from $50,000 to $2,000.&nbsp; He posted bail at
approximately 4:55 p.m. the following day and is currently
staying with Don Wirtshafter at the Ohio Hempery in Guysville. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick was arrested on July 18 when Ohio State Patrolmen
discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his
van.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the cannabis, all of which
was visibly marked &quot;for medicinal use only,&quot; was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in
Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp; He is charged with
four felony drug counts. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Landmark State Decision Could
Spell Victory<br>
For McCormick's Upcoming Trial</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 10, 1995, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Civil liberty and personal privacy proponents achieved a major
victory last week when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled to severely
limit the rights of police to question citizens or search their
property after misdemeanor roadside traffic stops.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML President John Hartman applauded the court's ruling.&nbsp;
&quot;People in the cannabis community will be driving a little
easier [now] in the state of Ohio,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 4-3 decision, the court struck down the drug arrest of a man
whose car was searched following a routine traffic stop.&nbsp;
The court maintained that the evidence seized during the search was
invalid because the search itself was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; According to the AP,
&quot;The court said that although the driver gave his consent,
the search was improper because the deputy never told the driver
[that] he was free to go after the traffic stop and before the
drug search began.&quot;&nbsp; The law states that police cannot
automatically search a car based upon a traffic misdemeanor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Harry R. Reinhart praised the ruling.&nbsp; He
explained that hundreds of innocent Ohio motorists are stopped
each year by police and intimidated into having their automobiles searched
because law enforcement officials purposely neglect to inform
citizens of their legal right to say no. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One can only wait and see what potential ramifications this
decision may have on Todd McCormick's upcoming trial.&nbsp;
McCormick had his van searched after Ohio State Patrolmen pulled him
over &quot;because the curtains in [his] van were
closed.&quot;&nbsp; McCormick maintains that he did not give
police permission to search his vehicle. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the Ohio State Supreme Court ruling,

<p align="center"><b>Distinguished Chicago Judge Advocates
Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 14, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Posner, Chicago's chief federal appeals judge and one of
America's most prominent legal scholars, recommends that
marijuana use should be legalized as a way of reducing crime and
unclogging the courts.&nbsp; Posner, a Reagan administration appointee
once heralded by American Lawyer magazine as &quot;the most
brilliant judge in the country,&quot; is the highest ranking
judge to ever publicly advocate the repeal of marijuana
laws.&nbsp; His endorsement of marijuana reform was the focus of
a feature article in both <i>USA Today</i> and <i>The Times
Literary Supplement</i>, a British publication. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>USA Today</i> article, Posner stated that: &quot;It is
nonsense that we should be devoting so many law enforcement
resources to marijuana.&nbsp; I am skeptical that a society that
is so tolerant of alcohol and cigarettes should come down so hard
on marijuana use and send people to prison for life without
parole.&quot;&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>'s Senior Policy Advisor, Richard
Cowan, was also quoted in the story. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>USA Today</i> also ran an editorial endorsing the use of
marijuana as a medicine last month.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Secret Service Threatens Couple For Stamping
One Dollar Bills</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 11, 1995, Woodstock, New York:</b>&nbsp;
A couple who habitually brand their one dollar bills with a
marijuana leaf and the quote: &quot;I grew hemp,&quot; were
recently contacted by Woodstock police acting on behalf of the
Secret Service.&nbsp; Joy Beckerman and James Horn, owners of the
Heaven On Earth Hemp Store, report that the police came to them
with Xerox copies of stamped dollar bills and a written warning
from the secret service specifying that the practice of defacing
United States currency was a federal crime.&nbsp; Although Horn
admits that the local officers were laid back about the whole
issue, he claims that the notice stated that the U.S. Attorney
General would be contacted and charges would be pressed if the
couple didn't immediately stop the stamping. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While Horn fully admits to stamping many of his dollar bills with
the pro-hemp message, he is alarmed that the federal government
seems to be targeting him alone.&nbsp; Since Heaven On Earth
sells the &quot;I grew hemp&quot; stampers, the couple argues
that the government has no way of proving that the bills in
question were defaced by them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Horn says that he will continue to both sell stampers and stamp
some of his one dollar bills despite the warning.&nbsp; The
couple see their action as a way of informing the community of
hemp's industrial uses and its historical background as an
integral American crop. <br>

James Horn of Heaven On Earth @ (914) 679-4990.</i></p>

<p align="center">September 7, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Jury Rules That Hemp Seed Demonstration Is A
Protest, Not Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Madera, CA:</b>&nbsp; A jury
has acquitted three marijuana activists who challenged
authorities to prosecute them for publicly planting 20,000 hemp
seeds in me Sierra foothills.&nbsp; Hemp proponents Ron
Kiczenski, Doug Weissman, and Craig Steffens were all found not
guilty of felony cultivation.&nbsp; The trio, collectively known
as the Three Hawk Stand, were arrested by sheriffs deputies
following a July 4 public protest during which the defendants
planted hemp seeds in front of both media and local
authorities.&nbsp; Had they been found guilty, the three activists
each faced up to three years in jail and a $10,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The men were found innocent in spite of the court's efforts to
disallow the defense from presenting evidence that hemp can be
utilized as an industrial crop and that the defendants' action was
done strictly as a political protest.&nbsp; Earlier in the trial,
Judge John W. DeGroot had ruled that the only relevant issue in
the trial was whether or not the trio planted an illegal
crop.&nbsp; &quot;Being a protest is not a defense to the
[cultivation] charge,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Kiczenski believes that the Court's hardline approach
may have actually helped Three Hawk Stand's defense.&nbsp;
&quot;The prosecutor and the judge worked too hard,&quot; said
Steffens' attorney, Nancy Lord.&nbsp; &quot;The jury thought the
whole thing was rigged.&quot;&nbsp; The defendants were successful
in arguing that the seeds they had planted were legally
sterilized hemp seeds which were incapable of producing actual
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to reaching the three not guilty verdicts, the jury
also presented a prepared statement to the court regarding the
reasons behind and the potential impact of their decision.&nbsp;
Jury foreman Dean Mitchell read the following: &quot;Some jurors
agree with the cause in which you believe; some jurors are
totally opposed.&nbsp; Our verdict went outside of your
cause.&nbsp; The evidence left reasonable doubt in our
minds.&nbsp; Our admonishment to you three defendants is that we
are not sending you on a seed planting mission, but rather we
suggest you pursue your cause through alternative methods.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now that he's been acquitted, Kiczenski maintains that he will do
just that.&nbsp; Kiczenski plans to file a civil lawsuit
challenging the DEA's assumed control and jurisdiction over the
production of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kiczenski has received media attention in the past by mailing
marijuana to President Bill Clinton.&nbsp; He is a former High
Times &quot;Freedom Fighter of the Month.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Cannabis Patient Continues To Be
Denied Prescription<br>
Allegations of Civil Rights Abuses Prompt NORML Lawyers To Take
Action</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 2, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Recent
events have discouraged hopes that medical cannabis user Todd
McCormick will be legally permitted to use his prescribed
medicine -- marijuana -- while in jail.&nbsp; According to
McCormick, Judge Anthony Gretich is now requiring that an
American physician who has physically examined McCormick must
additionally submit a written statement supporting his
prescription for cannabis.&nbsp; McCormick must also secure a
local Ohio doctor to oversee the administration of his
prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick already has letters from three prominent American
doctors (<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.)
supporting his prescription.&nbsp; Inexplicably however, although
McCormick received these supportive statements on August 18, he
maintains that his public defender, John Schaffer, failed to file
any motions on his client's behalf until September 1.&nbsp;
McCormick had initially believed that the Court needed written
support from only one physician. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more alarming were recent reports of civil and
constitutional rights violations taking place against
McCormick.&nbsp; Following McCormick's live-from-prison telephone
interview with a local Ohio radio station, Warden Jim Dennis
reportedly forbade McCormick any further press contact.&nbsp; He
was also denied access to phone calls and visitors.&nbsp; In
response to these allegations, Cleveland attorneys Gordon S.
Friedman and Terry H. Gilbert of <b>NORML</b>'s Legal Committee
faxed a letter on September 1 to Warden Dennis informing him that
they bad been requested to investigate the abuse charges.&nbsp;
As a result of their letter, the Todd McCormick Alliance reports
that the warden has renewed McCormick's phone privileges and is
once again permitting him to speak to the media.&nbsp; The warden
is also allowing McCormick to use muscle relaxers to help
alleviate the pain and limited lateral head movement he suffers
as a result of acute nerve damage in his neck. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick is presently awaiting trial on four felony drug charges
following the discovery of 31 pounds of marijuana in his vehicle
by Ohio State Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the
cannabis, which was clearly marked &quot;for medicinal use
only,&quot; was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate
Use Club in Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp;
McCormick had previously founded a Compassionate Use Club in San
Diego. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A hearing to determine whether or not McCormick's $50,000 bail
should be lowered will be held on September 7, 1995. <br>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Court Of Appeals Reverses Czuprynski
Conviction</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1, Bay City, MI:</b>&nbsp; Ed
Czuprynski, the Bay City attorney who in 1992 was sentenced to 14
months in federal prison for possessing 1.6 grams of marijuana,
has had his conviction reversed by the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.&nbsp; Concluding that Federal Judge Robert Cleland
&quot;abused [his] discretion&quot; in his evidentiary rulings
during Czuprynski's trial, the higher court determined that the
prosecution lacked sufficient relevant evidence to show that Czuprynski
knowingly possessed marijuana.&nbsp; Czuprynski had maintained
throughout both his trial and conviction that the marijuana found
in his office had been planted and that his prosecution was political. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a written statement affirming the higher court's decision to
reverse, two of the judges admit that &quot;the [Czuprynski]
case...has occupied untold judicial resources.&quot;&nbsp; The
document also specifies that the amount of marijuana involved in
the case was &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;meager.&quot;&nbsp;
Federal sentencing guidelines for minor amounts of marijuana do
not recommend that a prison sentence should exceed more than 6
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski's September 1 victory is actually the second time that
his conviction has been reversed.&nbsp; Czuprynski first won a
reversal of his possession conviction in November of 1993, but the
conviction was later upheld following the government's
appeal.&nbsp; Czuprynski said that he would not be surprised if
the government chose to appeal this latest decision as well. <br>

Despite Availability Of Prescription Alternative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 7, 1995, Fort Worth, TX:</b>&nbsp;
Despite the fact that Alan McLemore has a doctor's prescription
for Marinol, jail officials continue to deny him access to the
medication because it is a schedule II narcotic.&nbsp; McLemore
maintains that he has no appetite without daily use of the drug and
has not eaten a meal in the past 34 days.&nbsp; McLemore had
previously been allowed to use Marinol while he was incarcerated
at the Jefferson County jail in Beaumont, Texas.&nbsp; He had maintained
a stable body weight of approximately 160 pounds during that
time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, McLemore's wife, Maggie Carter-McLemore, reports
that her husband is now undergoing an isolated 72-hour
&quot;observation period.&quot;&nbsp; Following this period,
McLemore is to begin intravenous force-feeding.&nbsp; Ms.
Carter-McLemore maintains that the law permits force-feeding only
as a last resort and believes that Fort Worth Federal
Correctional Institution authorities are in violation of the law
by not granting her husband the prior option of using
Marinol.&nbsp; In a recent audio-taped phone conversation with
his wife, McLemore stated: &quot;They may kill me in here.&nbsp;

supplies free marijuana to seriously ill patients based upon a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He is currently awaiting trial in
Ohio where he faces four felony charges resulting from the
discovery of 31 pounds of cannabis in his vehicle by Ohio State
Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; The marijuana was marked &quot;for
medicinal use only&quot; and McCormick maintains that it was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in his
hometown of Providence, Rhode Island. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At an arraignment last Thursday, Williams County Court of Common
Pleas Judge Anthony L. Gretick suggested that he might order the
Sheriff to allow McCormick to use cannabis while in jail if
McCormick could provide the court with written support by an
American physician.&nbsp; McCormick possesses a prescription from
a physician in the Netherlands that advises for the consumption
of ten grams of cannabis per day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to Gretick's suggestion, three prominent U.S. doctors
(<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.) wrote
letters supporting McCormick's need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
However, according to a Toledo Blade reporter covering the court
proceedings, the judge is now also requesting that a local doctor
be summoned to endorse and administer the prescription to
McCormick.&nbsp; As this report goes to press, no official action
has yet to be taken by Gretick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case gained national exposure this week when it was
mentioned in an August 21 <i>USA Today</i> editorial endorsing
the use of marijuana as a medicine for seriously sick
patients.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> had a letter supporting marijuana's
medical utility printed in <i>USA Today</i> the following day. <br>

Marijuana<br>
According To Recent Health Poll</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
recent poll by Mervin Field for the California Center for Health
Improvement indicates that although many Californians still
remain concerned about illicit drug use, the majority of the
state still support the medicinal use of marijuana.&nbsp; This
conclusion directly contradicts earlier statements made by Dr.
Andy Mecca, director of the state Department on Alcohol and Drug
Programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the California Health Poll, 57 percent of the
respondents stated that they favored granting doctors the ability
to legally prescribe marijuana to their patients.&nbsp; By
comparison, only 22 percent favored similar prescriptions for
cocaine.&nbsp; Ironically, cocaine is currently classified as a Schedule
II drug which allows for its medical use in certain instances
while marijuana remains classified by the federal government as
having &quot;no medical use.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>New York City Buyers Club Busted<br>
Apparent Nationwide Crackdown On Medical Marijuana Clubs
Continues</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; New
York City activists have reported that law enforcement officials
recently busted New York City's underground cannabis buyers
club.&nbsp; The New York club was one of over thirty such clubs
that currently operate and distribute medical marijuana to
seriously ill patients.&nbsp; Longtime AIDS and drug reform
activist Johann Moore was arrested at the scene and held
overnight.&nbsp; He is reportedly charged with one count of
felony sales. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bust of the New York City Medical Buyers Club--a small buyers
club that had consciously maintained a relatively low
profile--seems to support the notion that law enforcement
agencies across the country are beginning a concerted effort to
crackdown on medical marijuana clubs.&nbsp; In the past few
months, both Todd McCormick (San Diego Compassionate Use Club)
and Joanna McCkee (Green Cross Patient Co-op of Washington) have
been arrested and had their marijuana seized by law enforcement
officials. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Two NORML Chapters Fight For Their Rights...
And Win!</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Two NORML chapters recently emerged victorious in
their fights against local censorship restrictions.&nbsp; In two
separate incidents, Northcoast NORML (OH) and University of
Oklahoma NORML were initially denied access to public forums
because of their organization's marijuana-tolerant beliefs.&nbsp;
However, after threatening to take legal action in order to
defend their First Amendment rights, both chapters subsequently
prevailed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Northcoast NORML president, John Hartman, the local
chapter will now be allowed to display public service
announcements on the rear and/or side of Cuyahoga city
busses.&nbsp; Regional Transit Authority officials had originally
refused to post the organization's PSA's.&nbsp; However, upon
learning that an ACLU lawyer had accepted the case, the RTA
quickly reversed its opinion.&nbsp; The RTA has informed
Northcoast NORML that the group's displays must meet the same
requirements as do political advertisements and must bear the
organization's name and address.&nbsp; Hartman says that adhering
to these standards should not be a problem and hopes to use the
ads to raise awareness of the fact there have been over ten
million marijuana arrests since 1965. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a similar scenario, University of Oklahoma NORML will now be
permitted to run a month-long hemp exhibit in the display case of
the Norman (OK) Municipal Public Library.&nbsp; Originally, the
chapter's request to gain access to the display case was denied
by library management.&nbsp; OU NORML challenged this decision
and charged that the library was engaging in discrimination.&nbsp;
OU NORML further argued that the library's denial of their
request violated the written anti-censorship policy of the
National Library Association.&nbsp; Following this assertion, the library
promptly rewrote their own policy in order to justify their
previous decision.&nbsp; OU NORML then had an ACLU lawyer send
the library a letter requesting them to change their new policy
and grant the NORML chapter access to the public display
case.&nbsp; Library officials finally consented following the
ACLU's letter.&nbsp; The OU NORML hemp exhibit is slated to be on
display this upcoming February. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information regarding these cases, please contact
John Hartman at Northcoast NORML @ (216) 521-WEED and/or Michael
Pearson at University of Oklahoma NORML @ (405) 840-HEMP.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Mass Cann NORML Denied Permition
To Hold Hemp Rally<br>
By Board Of Selectmen</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 17, 1995, Marblehead, MA:</b>&nbsp;
Mass Cann: NORML has announced that it must cancel its scheduled
weekend Hempfest (Aug. 26-27) because of an abrupt change of
heart by the Royalston Board of Selectmen.&nbsp; Plans are
already underway to hold a protest on the green outside Royalston
Town Hall.&nbsp; The demonstration is slated to take place at
noon on August 26. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Steve Epstein, an attorney and Chairman of Mass Cann: NORML,
explained that the Royalston Board of Selectmen suddenly
&quot;changed its position and determined that the club did not have
the necessary permits [required] under state law to host the
event.&quot;&nbsp; Epstein further states that Mass Cann: NORML
had &quot;met [previously] with them on August 6 and were told
that no additional permits were required.&quot;&nbsp; Mass Cann:
NORML wasn't alerted to the fact that the group would need an
additional permit until August 11. The board refuses to allow the
event without the necessary authorizations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">William Downing, President of Mass Cann: NORML maintains that:
&quot;The decision of the board was motivated by an illegal
desire to prevent [our organization] from expressing [its]
opinions on marijuana prohibition.&quot;&nbsp; He additionally
states that: &quot;They could stop Hempfest because of [a permit
requirement, but] they cannot stop 'HEMP-PROTEST' because of the
First Amendment.&quot;&nbsp; Mass Cann: NORML had been hosting
events similar to Hempfest for approximately the past six years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information of the scheduled August 26
&quot;HEMP-PROTEST,&quot; please contact Steve Epstein, Esq. @

<p align="center"><b>Student Parking &quot;Not For the

Indiana School Board Votes To Institute Drug Free Parking Policy</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1995, Fishers, Indiana:</b>&nbsp;
Following directly on the heels of this past June's U.S. Supreme
Court decision upholding an Oregon public school policy mandating
urine tests for all athletes regardless of probable cause, a
Fishers school board is attempting to force high school students
to submit to drug tests before they are issued parking permits. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Principle Gary Wiersema was asked by the board to adopt the new
policy before school opens August 23.&nbsp; Wiesema maintains
that such a proposal should not be instituted so swifty and has advised
the board to move slowly on the issue.&nbsp; &quot;Kids still
have rights,&quot; he told the Palladium-Item after an initial
meeting with the board. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An attorney for the school has stated that he believes such a
measure would stand up in a court of law based upon the U.S.
Supreme Court's previous rulings regarding drug testing.&nbsp;
&quot;If the rationale to randomly test athletes is because of
safety,&quot; he told the Palladium-Item, &quot;[then] the school
has the ability to control who drives.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, between 10 and 20 separate schools have enacted random
drug testing policies for athletes in Indiana.</p>

past week, Richard Martinez's voice has weakened to the point
where it is now barely audible. Meanwhile, he continues to suffer
from life threatening staph infections, high blood pressure,
migraines, and possibly anemia. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Connie Theis, Martinez's registered nurse and the woman who
notified NORML of his situation, has requested that he be
transferred from Durango County Jail and placed in a nearby hospital.&nbsp;
Recently, she has written to Arizona Governor Fyfe Symington to
alert him of Martinez's increasingly ill health.&nbsp; The Office
of Human Rights in Phoenix is also attempting to get Martinez transferred
to a medical facility.&nbsp; Ms. Theis maintains that Martinez's
life is in danger every additional day he is forced to stay in
prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Martinez has yet to be convicted of any crime.&nbsp; He
is currently facing drug charges after being turned in to
authorities for possessing a coffee can of marijuana.&nbsp;
Martinez had been using marijuana as a therapeutic agent to help
relieve the pain he suffers daily after having been shot through
the left eye in 1991.&nbsp; He remains incarcerated in Durango
County Jail so that the state can continue to conduct competency
tests.&nbsp; Ms. Theis asserts that Martinez's head injury has permanently
damaged his right frontal lobe and maintains that he is mentally
incompetent to stand trial. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Resolution To Be Unveiled
At Upcoming Conference</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 9, 1995, San Diego, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
resolution calling for governments everywhere to &quot;immediately
rescind their policies of arresting ... marijuana consumers who
currently possess and/or cultivate cannabis for their own medical
use&quot; will be introduced by Dr. Erik Fromberg at the 37th
International Congress on Drugs and Alcohol Dependency.&nbsp; The
resolution further demands that governments start separating the
medical issue &quot;from the recreational drug issue and begin actively
studying cannabis' use as a therapeutic agent.&quot;&nbsp; Dr.
Fromberg is a representative from the Netherlands Institute on
Alcohol and Drugs (NIAD).&nbsp; The international conference is
scheduled to be held August 20-25 in San Diego, California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also attending the Congress will be the Todd McCormick
Alliance.&nbsp; The Alliance has declared an &quot;international
state of emergency on medical cannabis&quot; and is embarking on
an &quot;information blitz&quot; to raise public awareness.&nbsp;
The organization will be holding a round table discussion on the
medical use of cannabis on August 22 and is planning to hold a
public rally on August 25.&nbsp; The group is named after San
Diego Compassionate Use Club founder and medical marijuana user,
Todd McCormick.&nbsp; McCormick was arrested in Ohio on July 18
when State Highway Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty
pounds of marijuana in his van.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the cannabis was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate

<p align="center"><b>Registered Nurse Contacts NORML In An Appeal
To Save The Life Of Her Patient</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 4, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; In an
attempt to stimulate national attention and awareness to the
plight of her patient, Richard G. Martinez, neuro-rehabilitation
nurse and Martinez's legal guardian, Constance Theis, has
contacted <b>NORML</b> with a story of unparalleled injustice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After having been shot through the left eye in 1991, Richard
Martinez was left with an excruciatingly painful nerve disorder
known as trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp; In addition, many fragments from
the bullet could not be removed during surgery and still remain
lodged in Martinez's brain.&nbsp; The presence of these fragments
induces cognitive deficits and seizure disorders and also gives
rise to frequent bouts of intense nausea and severe
depression.&nbsp; To help alleviate Martinez's daily pain, he was
granted a legal prescription for Marinol -- a federally approved
THC synthetic drug.&nbsp; The Marinol, however, ended up being
far too expensive ($636.00 per month) for Martinez to afford on
his social security disability-based income.&nbsp; As a result,
Martinez turned to the next logical substitute, natural cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez was turned in to authorities for possessing marijuana by
a relative in exchange for a small financial reward.&nbsp; He now
sits in Durango County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona, where he is
forced to sleep on a dirty floor and is prevented from taking his
proper medication.&nbsp; While in jail, Martinez has suffered
numerous staph infections in the eye socket and ear.&nbsp; Staph
infections put tremendous pressure on the heart and, if left
untreated, can be fatal.&nbsp; The tremendous swelling from these infections
is causing green pus to flow from Martinez's right nostril.&nbsp;
In addition, Martinez's serious infections are destroying
valuable tissue and bone in his face.&nbsp; This deterioration
has gotten so extreme that Martinez now believes that his eye may
actually be &quot;rotting.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez is also experiencing critically high blood pressure and
is now at risk of suffering a stroke.&nbsp; This occurrence is a
natural physical result of untreated pain and infection.&nbsp;
The threat of a severe stroke -- in addition to his constant
fevers, infections, tissue deterioration, and ear aches -- makes
Martinez's incarceration highly life threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the reports of three separate physicians, Martinez's
head wound seriously damaged his right frontal lobe and has
rendered him mentally incompetent.&nbsp; Therefore, he can not legally
stand trial.&nbsp; The state, however, wants Martinez to appear
in court regardless.&nbsp; Consequently, psychologists at the
Durango County Jail are working round the clock to have Martinez
declared mentally competent.&nbsp; Ms. Theis maintains that this
process can last as long a seven or eight months -- a time frame
that she believes Martinez will not survive.&nbsp; The bitter
irony is that the state is trying to legally rehabilitate a man
with braln damage solely for the purpose of throwing him back in
jail.&nbsp; All this because Martinez was trying to alleviate
daily pain, nausea, and seizures with the only effective
therapeutic agent he could financially afford -- marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Constance Theis maintains that her patient's life is in danger
every additional day he stays in the Durango County Jail.&nbsp;
She can be contacted at the following numbers: (602) 790-1595
(home) or (602) 325-1300 EXT 4435 (work).</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 2, 1995, Seattle, WA:</b>&nbsp; Joanna
McKee, activist, medicinal marijuana advocate, and co-founder of
Washington's Green Cross Patient Co-op turned herself in to local
authorities to begin serving a two day sentence for leaving the
state against a judge's orders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mckee, 52, was arrested on May 3 when regional task force agents
raided her medical marijuana cooperative in Brainbridge
Island.&nbsp; According to authorities, approximately 130 marijuana
plants were seized during the raid. McKee's Green Cross Patient
Co-op is believed to have been the first &quot;Cannabis Buyers
Club&quot; in the nation aggressively targeted by the law enforcement
community.&nbsp; Over 30 such &quot;Clubs&quot; currently operate
throughout the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following her May arrest, McKee was released on her own
recognizance pending trial in September.&nbsp; However, a Kitsap
County Superior Court judge ordered her not to leave the
state.&nbsp; McKee recently defied this court order when she flew
to Washington DC to attend the National Institute on Drug Abuse's
first ever conference on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McKee's arrest and subsequent legal problems have garnered both
considerable local and national media attention.&nbsp; USA Today
mentioned her probable return to jail in its July 20 issue and all
three local network affiliates were on hand to cover McKee's
surrender to police on August 2. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, McKee's return to jail comes less than three weeks
after San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder, Todd McCormick,
was arrested by authorities while on route to Rhode Island.&nbsp; McCormick
faces felony drug charges. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Compassionate Use Club Founder
Arrested On Route To Rhode Island</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Longtime
activist and medical marijuana user Todd McCormick was arrested
and charged with two felony drug counts when Ohio State Highway
Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in
his van.&nbsp; McCormick's passenger, Natalie Byrd, was also
taken into custody and faces similar felony drug charges.&nbsp;
Both activists are currently being held at the Correction Center
of Northwest Ohio where bail has been set, without bond, at
$150,000 each. McCormick's preliminary hearing is scheduled to
take place today.&nbsp; Byrd's scheduled hearing has been
postponed to take place at a later date.&nbsp; McCormick, age 25, is
the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use Club.&nbsp; The
San Diego Club is one of approximately thirty Cannabis Buyers
Clubs located across the country.&nbsp; The purpose of the Clubs,
many of which have recently received favorable media coverage and
have been grudgingly tolerated by local law enforcement, is to
supply cannabis to seriously ill patients based upon a doctor's
recommendation.&nbsp; Typically, these patients are suffering
from the effects of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS),
glaucoma, and spinal disorders.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the marijuana found in his van was intended to be used to
establish a Compassionate Use Club in his home state of Rhode
Island.&nbsp; He told police that it was not for sale.&nbsp; All
of the cannabis dispensed at McCormick's San Diego Club was
donated and was available to patients on a &quot;no charge&quot;
basis.&nbsp; The 30+ pounds of cannabis was visibly labeled
&quot;for medical use.&quot;&nbsp; Based on the evidence seized during
McCormick's arrest in Ohio on the 18th, DEA agents subsequently
raided his Rolando, California house three days later.&nbsp; None
of the four residents staying at the house at the time of the raid
were arrested; however, a small quantity of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; Also confiscated by federal agents were videotapes,
books on the subject of legalizing marijuana, various computer
disks, film, and smoking paraphernalia.&nbsp; In addition,
numerous petition signatures calling for a California marijuana
legalization initiative were also seized, but have since been
returned.&nbsp; All four residents have said that they are
committed to making marijuana medically available to chronically
ill patients.&nbsp; Although the significant amount of marijuana
present and the rural venue do not make McCormick's case ideal
for a medical necessity defense, he feels that a number of Fourth Amendment
violations make his case winnable.&nbsp; Most importantly,
McCormick contends that law enforcement officials searched his
vehicle without his consent or a warrant.&nbsp; McCormick
maintains that one officer claimed to &quot;smell pot,&quot; at
which time McCormick voluntarily showed the trooper his
prescription for medical cannabis.&nbsp; At this point, his van
was searched and the bundles of marijuana were found.&nbsp;
McCormick acquired his prescription from a doctor in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Aside from being an activist on the front lines of the medical
marijuana issue, McCormick is also a medical marijuana
user.&nbsp; McCormick has battled cancer on ten different
occasions and first started smoking cannabis to alleviate the
significant side effects of radiation and chemotherapy.&nbsp; He now
uses the therapeutic effects of the drug to combat acute nerve
damage in his neck.&nbsp; This damage came about when the first
five vertebrae in his neck fused together as a result of the
cancer and greatly limits McCormick's lateral head
movement.&nbsp; McCormick attributes the regular smoking of
cannabis as the prime reason for the improvement in his condition
and lateral head mobility.&nbsp; He further maintains that the
prescription he acquired in the Netherlands makes it legal for
him to transport cannabis in all United Nations.&nbsp; Recently,
his prescription had enabled him to enter America through U.S.
Customs in Colorado while carrying cannabis.&nbsp; Those wishing
to donate funds to Todd McCormick's defense can send their

thanks to the hundreds of phone calls and letters from both

<p align="center">July 18,1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests Hit Ten Million
Mark...&nbsp; Drug Czar Compares Marijuana to Cocaine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from 1993 Justice Department
statistics (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimates that the total number
of marijuana arrests since 1965 will pass the ten million mark on
July 20th, 1995.&nbsp; Mounting at the rate of more than <strong>one
thousand per day</strong>, more than 80% of these arrests are
solely for personal possession.&nbsp; The balance are for
cultivation--often for personal use--or for sale, usually a
involving a very small quantity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To put these numbers in context: Marijuana arrests in 1993
(380,690) made up approximately <strong>one third</strong> of the
1.1 million total drug arrests that year.&nbsp; By comparison,
there were approximately 600,000 arrests for violent
crimes.&nbsp; This year, the Clinton Administration sought to
provide 100,000 new police.&nbsp; Now, if an arrest, transporting
the arrestee to jail, paper work, etc. ideally takes only 2
hours, and there is only one officer involved, then marijuana
arrests currently use the time of approximately one hundred
thousand police per year.&nbsp; There are approximately 550,000 state
and local police officers.&nbsp; Thus, approximately 20% of their
total time is consumed by marijuana arrests. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Obviously, this burden on police resources is not the same in all
jurisdictions.&nbsp; In 11 states, marijuana possession has been
decriminalized and the police typically issue citations rather
than arrest an offender.&nbsp; Additionally, in most major cities
marijuana possession is a very low priority.&nbsp; However, in
some smaller towns, it seems to be a major focus for the
police.&nbsp; For example, in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, police
searched Scott Bryant's garbage for marijuana residue for several days
before getting a warrant and shooting him dead on April 17.&nbsp;
He was unarmed and less than an ounce of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; In a small town in Oklahoma, paraplegic and medical
marijuana user Jimmy Montgomery was sentenced to 10 years for
possession of less than two ounces.&nbsp; He is still awaiting
release on a medical parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the prospect of being able to seize valuable property
under civil forfeiture has created an incentive to seek out
marijuana cultivation.&nbsp; This is believed to have been the
reason for the 1992 raid on multimillionaire Donald Scott's
estate near Malibu that resulted in his being killed by
police.&nbsp; No marijuana was found.&nbsp; The effect of these
increasing arrests on marijuana availability, however, seems to
be negligible.&nbsp; According to Joseph Califano, Chairman of
the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, &quot;American
children are telling us they are drenched in drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Clinton Administration is now devoting most of its efforts to
the suppression of marijuana.&nbsp; Drug Czar Lee Brown in a
press release on July 17 cited a survey commissioned by
Califano's group.&nbsp; Brown said that: &quot;91% of the
population blames illegal drug and alcohol abuse for the rate of
violent crime that we have in America today.&nbsp; This fact
alone should tell the media that they need to make the connection
between drug use and violent crime in their news
stories.&quot;&nbsp; However, in a letter to the editor of the
Summer issue of <em>Forbes Media Critic</em>, Califano himself
points out that marijuana &quot;has not been associated with high
levels of violence.&quot; In fact, most of the violence in our society
is associated with alcohol -- <strong>not marijuana</strong>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Perhaps even more misleading is the media advisory from Brown's
office announcing &quot;marijuana sends virtually the same
numbers to emergency rooms as cocaine.&quot;&nbsp; This statement
is supposedly based on numbers from DAWN, the Drug Abuse Warning
Network.&nbsp; In truth, the DAWN statistics say nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; First, they deal with emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>,
not causes of admission established by a doctor.&nbsp; The DAWN
figures further demonstrate that over 80% of marijuana mentions
are in conjunction with problems associated with alcohol,
cocaine, or some other drug.&nbsp; In cases where marijuana is
the only drug <strong>mentioned</strong>, the problem is almost
always a panic attack by inexperienced users.&nbsp; There is no
practical lethal dose of marijuana and the only adverse acute
effects of marijuana are transitory and not life or health
threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, the hospital emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>
of marijuana are neither qualitatively nor quantitatively
comparable to those caused by cocaine.&nbsp; However, the
children of America might get the impression from Brown's
statement that the risks associated with cocaine are no greater
than those associated with marijuana.&nbsp; This conclusion would
seem to be the antithesis of drug education.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
National Director Richard Cowan commented that the Clinton Administration's
drug policy concentrating on marijuana seems to be aimed at
avoiding &quot;inhale&quot; jokes at all costs.&nbsp; Another ten
million arrests is too high a price to pay for that.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Not All Marijuana Law Victims Are Arrested:<br>
Police Officer Who Fatally Shot Suspected Marijuana User Cleared
Of Criminal Charges</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 6, 1995, Beaver Dam, WI</b>:&nbsp;
According to a lengthy article in the <i>Madison Isthmus</i>, Detective
Robert Neuman -- the police officer who on April 28 fatally shot
suspected marijuana user Scott Bryant in his home -- has been
recently cleared of criminal charges by a Sheboygan County
District Attorney. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officer Neuman shot and killed twenty-nine year old Scott Bryant
on April 28 when he and three other police officers barged into
Bryant's mobile home executing a no knock/no announce warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist arrest; his seven year old
son, Colton, was present during the shooting.&nbsp; A total of
less than one ounce of marijuana was found in the apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">District Attorney Wells concluded that, &quot;The shooting of
Scott Bryant was not in any form justified.&quot;&nbsp; However,
he also determined that the shooting was
&quot;unintentional,&quot; and thus, could not file homicide
charges.&nbsp; Wells theorizes that, &quot;[Officer Neuman's]
hand may have clenched either as he jerked his weapon toward the
noise and struck the door, or in 'sympathetic physical reaction'
to his other hand, which was also grasping.&quot;&nbsp; A
gun-maker of the Beretta used by Neuman finds such an occurrence
to be unlikely since the Beretta's double action draw length
&quot;helps reduce the chance of ... inadvertent
discharges.&quot;&nbsp; Neuman claims that he has &quot;no
recollection of pulling the trigger.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wells also ruled out charges of criminal recklessness in the
Neuman shooting, claiming that the detective &quot;could not have
had a 'conscious, subjective awareness' that his gun handling
created a grave risk, since his partner was in the line of
fire.&quot;&nbsp; The <i>Isthmus</i> article further adds that
because of the employment of an &quot;outdated legal
definition,&quot; Wells also cleared Neuman of the charge of criminal
recklessness.&nbsp; As a result, Officer Neuman can return to
regular active duty. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The fatal shooting of Scott Bryant by law enforcement officials
is yet another example of the government's continued war against
marijuana users.&nbsp; In a similar instance, disabled Vietnam veteran
Gary Shepard was shot and killed by police in August of 1992 as
he and his family stood on the front porch of his home in rural
Kentucky.&nbsp; Shepard had been engaged in a day-long standoff
with law enforcement officials after he refused to let police cut
down the marijuana plants growing on his property.&nbsp; Perhaps
even more shocking was the October 2, 1993 fatal shooting of millionaire
rancher Donald Scott.&nbsp; Scott was killed when law enforcement
officials raided his Malibu property searching for 40 pounds of
marijuana.&nbsp; No marijuana was ever found.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Number Of Jail Inmates Experiences Third
Largest Increase Since 1983</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the most recent <i>Census of Jails
and Annual Survey of Jails</i> report, the jail population of the
United States rose by 30,638 inmates between July 1, 1993, and
June 30,1994.&nbsp; This growth marks the third largest annual
increase recorded since 1983. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more striking were the report's findings that: &quot;Since
1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a per
capita basis.&nbsp; During this period the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188.&quot;&nbsp;
Consequently, the report estimates that about 1 in every 398
adult residents (and 1 in every 212 men) are in a local jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Not surprisingly, the largest source of growth among inmates in
local jails was drug law violators.&nbsp; Because of increased
law enforcement and stiffer penalties under the &quot;War on
Drugs,&quot; the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of
drug offenses increased from 20,800 in 1983 to 91,000 in
1989.&nbsp; Subsequently, the percentage of inmates serving time
in jail for drug offenses has skyrocketed from 10% in 1983 to
nearly 25% in 1989.&nbsp; This figure accounts for more than 40%
of the total increase in jail population.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Prohibition Subject To New Legal
And Scientific Challenge: Petition Demands U. S. Government
Provide Finding On Marijuana's Abuse Potential As Required By Federal
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling marijuana prohibition a &quot;fraud and a
failure,&quot; longtime activist and former <b>NORML</b> National
Director Jon Gettman filed a rule making petition with the Drug
Enforcement Administration on July 10, 1995 demanding that the
agency immediately initiate proceedings to re-evaluate
marijuana's Schedule I status under the Controlled Substances
Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">By law, the DEA is required to forward such petitions to the
Department of Health and Human Services for a binding medical and
scientific evaluation.&nbsp; The petition is based on a
comprehensive review of recent scientific evidence demonstrating
that marijuana does not have &quot;sufficient abuse potential to
warrant Schedule I or II status under the Controlled Substances
Act.&quot;&nbsp; The CSA mandates that a scientific finding
affirming that a drug has a high potential for abuse is required
to maintain the complete prohibition of any drug or substance
under Schedule I.&nbsp; (21 USC 812(b)(1))&nbsp; <u>No such
finding </u><b><u>has ever existed</u></b><u> for marijuana</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DEA Administrator Constantine has claimed in an exchange of
letters that abuse potential is irrelevant to the scheduling of
drugs with no accepted medical use.&nbsp; When Gettman reminded Constantine
that this position was explicitly rejected by the U.S. Court of
Appeals in 1977 (NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 736), Constantine boldly
challenged him to pursue action in an April 21, 1995 letter to
United States Senator John Warner (R-VA).&nbsp; In this letter,
Constantine stated that: &quot;[The DEA is] unaware of any new
scientific studies of marijuana that would lead us to re-evaluate
its classification at this time; therefore no such evaluation is
now in process nor do we feel [that one is] necessary based on
the information available to us.&nbsp; [However,] if Mr. Gettman has
scientific data concerning marijuana which he wishes to bring to
our attention, we will be pleased to consider it, should he care
to share the documentation with us.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Constantine's statements, Gettman has produced a
279 page petition referencing nearly 170 scientific journals and
government reports.&nbsp; Of prime importance to Gettman's arguments
is the recent discovery of a cannabinoid receptor system in the
human body.&nbsp; This discovery has radically altered
contemporary knowledge about marijuana's effects on the body and the
brain.&nbsp; According to Gettman, &quot;These new findings
directly contradict many of the DEA's on-record findings of
'fact' which have been used to block prior reconsideration of
marijuana's scheduling status.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Until 1990, no one knew how marijuana affected the
brain.&nbsp; Marijuana prohibition has assumed that science would
eventually prove marijuana had a high potential for abuse.&nbsp;
Science has demolished that assumption, and established marijuana
prohibition as a cruel fraud upon the American public. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">No scientist has ever established that marijuana has a high
potential for abuse, and now we know that no science can.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Simply put, drugs with a high potential for abuse induce
self-administration in animals, and affect the production of the
neurotransmitter dopamine.&nbsp; Marijuana does neither.&nbsp; To
retain marijuana in Schedule I creates a double standard
forbidden by the 14th Amendment - one set of rules for all other
drugs, and a different set of rules for marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A 78 page booklet entitled <i>The Scientific and Legal Basis for
the End of Marijuana Prohibition</i> reviewing some of the
research cited in Gettman's petition will be forthcoming from <b>NORML</b>
at a cost of $10 plus $2.50 shipping and handling.&nbsp;
Summaries of the scientific and medical evidence supporting the
petition are available from <b>NORML</b> and will soon be
available on the Internet.&nbsp; Jon Gettman has also described
this new research in articles in the March and July 1995 issues
of <i>High Times</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[<i>Jon Gettman can be contacted for further information about
this rule-making petition c/o </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>.&nbsp;
Other activists who wish to file their own similar rule making
petitions with the DEA should refer to sections 21 CFR Ch. II
1308.44 of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice manual.</i>]</p>

<p align="center"><b>10 Million Arrests and NIDA; Bad Science
Used to Justify Bad Policies<br>
by Richard Cowan, National Director of NORML</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On July 20th, NORML will mark the 10 millionth
marijuana arrest since 1965.&nbsp; While there is no way to be
certain on what date the actual 10 millionth arrest will take
place, Justice Department records indicate that it will occur
around this time.&nbsp; Our choice of this particular date was
spurred by the fact that it will be the last day of a two day
conference on marijuana sponsored by NIDA, the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NIDA is supposed to be a scientific organization dedicated to
finding the truth about &quot;drug abuse&quot; and effective ways
to deal with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, NIDA long ago became a
politicized propaganda mill dedicated to justifying the continued
arrest of marijuana users.&nbsp; This problem is well illustrated
by an article by former NIDA head (and former Drug Czar) Robert
DuPont being run on newspaper op-ed pages as &quot;The Case
Against Legalizing Drugs.&quot;&nbsp; In it, DuPont exploits two
frightening sounding factoids about marijuana use in the
Netherlands. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, he says that from 1984 to 1992 adolescent marijuana use
increased by 250% in the Netherlands while it decreased by two
thirds in the US during that time.&nbsp; Even if one takes the dubious
American numbers at face value (They have been criticized by the
GAO and probably greatly understate real usage rates.), these
numbers hide more than thay reveal.&nbsp; DuPont fails to say that
-- even after 20 years of having marijuana readily available --
the rate of &quot;regular&quot; use (one or more times in the
last month) by Dutch adolescents in 1992 was <u>still below the
lowest use by American adolescents in the last 20 years</u>.&nbsp;
He also fails to say that regular use by American high school
seniors soared 40% in two years to 19% in 1994.&nbsp; All this
was while American marijuana users were being arrested at the
rate of 1,000 per day.&nbsp; Moreover, from 1984 to 1992 there
were almost 3 million Americans arrested on marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This is hardly a minor cost or a sign of a
successful policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Then he states that there has been a &quot;30% increase in
registered marijuana addicts&quot; in Holland.&nbsp; This is also
very misleading.&nbsp; The Dutch use the term &quot;addicts&quot;
very broadly to include both compulsive gamblers as well as
people who think that their marijuana use has become a
problem.&nbsp; Such persons are not registered as
&quot;addicts&quot; for any purpose other than being enrolled in
an out-patient therapy program.&nbsp; This is not the equivalent
of a methadone maintenance program. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1993, there were only 1,700 people enrolled in this program
out of a regular Dutch cannabis user population of approximately
650,000.&nbsp; This enrollment represents roughly one regular marijuana
user in 400.&nbsp; In the US we arrest the equivalent of one
regular marijuana user in 40 every year.&nbsp; Is that somehow a
better policy?&nbsp; Is being arrested harmless? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DuPont next uses these numbers out of context to project what he
says would happen if the US followed the Dutch model.&nbsp; He
claims that, &quot;The evidence from the Netherlands suggest that
if the United States were to legalize currently illicit drugs,
the numbers would probably increase from the present 12 million
to something like the 50 million who use tobacco or even the 103
million who use alcohol.&quot;&nbsp; DuPont had to dig through
and ignore all of the facts that I have cited in order to support
his predetermined conclusion.&nbsp; Why would someone do
this?&nbsp; What a bizarre view of the American people this
reflects. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, even the carefully selected numbers that DuPont cites
out of context do not support his conclusions.&nbsp; Indeed, why
-- after 20 years of having marijuana readily available -- hasn't
Dutch marijuana use increased to the level of tobacco or alcohol
use there?&nbsp; In any case, whatever the level of marijuana use
in the future, Dutch statistics on marijuana &quot;addicts&quot;
do not indicate that it would be a major social or public health
problem. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch consider their cannabis policies successful because
they have effectively separated cannabis from hard drugs.&nbsp;
Consequently, <u>their hard drug addiction rate remained stable
and they escaped the crack cocaine epidemic</u> that began in
America during the time of the decline in marijuana use that
DuPont cites as a triumph of American policy over the
Dutch.&nbsp; 'Twas a famous victory.&nbsp; I hope that America
does not have to suffer through any more of them.</p>

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">June 29, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Major Announcement</u></b><b>: Capricorn
Records To Issue HEMPILATION CD In Fall Supporting NORML And
Protesting Marijuana Prohibition</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Capricorn Records and NORML, the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, are collaborating
to put out a CD album this fall that will be a vocal protest
against the injustice of marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; <i>High
Times</i> Magazine, which covers the music scene in addition to
reporting on marijuana, helped assemble the talent.&nbsp;
Capricorn issued a press release from Nashville announcing the CD
and NORML issued the following statement from Washington. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Statement by NORML</b>:&nbsp; Since even before the days of
Harry Anslinger's aborted plans to arrest jazz musicians in the
1930s, there has been a connection between music, musicians, and marijuana;
however, it has been very hard to find connections between the
music business and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; <u>No
more</u>.&nbsp; Capricorn Records has broken down the closet door
by assembling an extraordinary group of today's hottest bands for
the first-ever benefit CD for NORML.&nbsp; It is appropriately
called HEMPILATION.&nbsp; The bands include the Black Crowes, Blues
Traveler, Cypress Hill, Drivin-N-Cryin, Gov't Mule (featuring
Warren Haynes), 311, Widespread Panic, Ziggy &amp; The Melody
Makers, and others.&nbsp; The artists are contributing &quot;HEMP&quot;
classics or original pieces. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The connection between NORML and Capricorn actually dates back to
the 1970's when Phil Walden, the President of Capricorn, served
on the NORML Board of Directors.&nbsp; When the HEMPILATION was
announced, Walden said he hoped that &quot;this project will not
only be a great source of entertainment, but will also help
spread the word about the many positive actions of NORML and the
benefits of hemp as more than a drug.&quot;&nbsp; Walden made
clear that the HEMPILATION wasn't an endorsement of using
marijuana but rather the belief that the criminal prosecution of
marijuana users was unjust and unfair.&nbsp; This, of course, is
NORML's position.&nbsp; We are not trying to get people to smoke
marijuana, but rather to get the government to stop arresting those
who do.&nbsp; &quot;HEMPILATION is a testament to these bands'
support of NORML's efforts to reform these laws,&quot; Walden
explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The liner notes for the CD will include more information about
hemp and marijuana prohibition and will contain a membership
application for joining NORML.&nbsp; This -- along with the
royalties donated by Capricorn and the artists -- will make an
enormous difference in the ability of NORML to work to end the
arrests of marijuana users.&nbsp; NORML naturally hopes that
everyone who buys the CD will become better informed and more
motivated to get involved in the defense of freedom, whether they
smoke marijuana or not.&nbsp; The HEMPILATION offers a way for
both music lovers and musicians to stand up for freedom. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We also hope that more people in the music business will be moved
by the example of Capricorn and the HEMPILATION artists to
support NORML and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; It takes
courage for a businessman like Phil Walden to take the lead in
supporting NORML, but when others see the public support for
Capricorn and the HEMPILATION, they may find that standing up for
one's beliefs is a very satisfying experience.&nbsp; In fact, the
music business has the power to change America.&nbsp; It remains
to be seen how many other musicians and music industry executives
will be inspired by the example of Walden and the artists on the HEMPILATION
and will come forward. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Almost ten million Americans have been arrested on marijuana
charges since 1965.&nbsp; If the music business really got behind
the marijuana reform movement, these arrests would stop.&nbsp; A
lot of musicians like to sing about pot probably even more like
to smoke it and they may think that this makes them look
&quot;cool.&quot;&nbsp; However, what is really &quot;cool&quot;
is standing up for freedom.&nbsp; Freedom Is NORML. <br>

Capricorn Records, (615) 320-8470.&nbsp; For information on music
industry's support for NORML call Steve Bloom, <i>High Times</i>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Ruling On Student Drug Testing
Expected To Decrease Pot Use And Increase Alcohol And Hard Drug
Use By Students</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 26, Washington, D.C.</b>:&nbsp; Comments
on the Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of
random drug testing of student athletes generally overlook the
fact that such tests do not detect alcohol use and are far less
effective in detecting the use of cocaine and other hard drugs
than marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana metabolites (not the drug itself)
are detectable in urine far longer than residues of cocaine,
etc.&nbsp; This will have the effect of encouraging the use of
hard drugs and alcohol which are far more dangerous than
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his opinion supporting the ruling, Justice Scalia wrote that
the &quot;Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective
expectations of privacy, but only those which society recognizes
as legitimate.&quot;&nbsp; After decades of hate propaganda to
justify arresting millions of marijuana users, the American
people have now been conditioned to believe that forcing someone
to urinate on command does not violate their legitimate&quot;
rights.&nbsp; What the Fourth Amendment <b><i><u>actually</u></i></b>
says:&nbsp; <b>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses and effects against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall Issue, but
upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.&quot;</b>&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson had intended
to put in the part about &quot;only those which society
recognizes as legitimate,&quot; but he forgot.&nbsp; He was
probably suffering from short term memory loss because he grew
hemp at Monticello.&nbsp; We are not going to be drug-free, just
unfree.</p>

<p align="center">June 22, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical
Association</i></b><b> Prints Article By NORML Board Chairman
Calling For Medical Access To Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical doctors should be legally permitted to
prescribe marijuana for their patients according to a commentary
in the June 21 issue of the internationally respected <i>Journal
of the American Medical Association</i>.&nbsp; The article is
written by NORML Board Chairman, Lester Grinspoon, MD of Harvard
Medical School and James B. Bakalar, also of Harvard, and does
not reflect the official position of the AMA.&nbsp; However, it
was printed after months of review by the JAMA editorial
board.&nbsp; The two page commentary gives a brief history of the
thousands of years of medical use of cannabis, including the
first part of this century in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Grinspoon and Bakalar argue that cannabis is much safer than most
of the drugs regularly prescribed by physicians (a lethal
overdose is virtually impossible) and that it is currently being used,
albeit illegally, by many thousands of people who have found that
no legally available pharmaceuticals work as well.&nbsp; (Eight
Americans receive free marijuana from the federal government
under a program closed to new patients in 1992.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The authors point out that in 1988 the Drug Enforcement
Administration's own chief administrative law judge, the late
Francis L. Young, called cannabis &quot;one of the safest
therapeutic agents known to man.&quot;&nbsp; He added that it met
the legal requirement of currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States.&nbsp; Young then ordered that
cannabis be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II, so that,
as with morphine and cocaine, it could be prescribed by a doctor.&nbsp;
Regrettably, the politically appointed head of the DEA rejected
this order and continued the DEA's policy of blocking medical
research with cannabis while claiming that there is no medical research
to support its use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commentary goes on to remind physicians that the AMA
originally opposed the federal Marihuana Tax Act in 1937 (passed
after testimony falsely claiming that cannabis caused violent crimes),
because it would interfere with cannabis' medical use.&nbsp;
Grinspoon and Bakalar conclude by saying that they are &quot;not
asking readers for immediate agreement&quot; that cannabis is
medically useful, but rather, they hope that physicians
&quot;will do more to encourage open and legal exploration of its
potential.&nbsp; The ostensible indifference of physicians should
no longer be used as a justification for keeping this medicine in
the shadows.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It remains to be seen if the extensive media coverage of the <i>JAMA</i>
commentary will lead to more attention to the book, <i>Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine</i>, (Yale University Press) by Grinspoon
and Bakalar.&nbsp; This book, published in 1993 and now available
in paperback, has been printed in Germany and France and will
soon be published in Italy.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it has not been reviewed
by a single major newspaper or magazine in the United
States.&nbsp; This blackout persists even though it has been
favorably reviewed by the <i>JAMA</i>, the <i>New England Journal
of Medicine</i>, and even by the conservative <i>National Review</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, the American mass media continue to give over
$800,000 per day in free advertising to the so-called Partnership
for a Drug-Free (sic) America, founded by the former CEO of a
major pharmaceutical company.&nbsp; The Partnership opposes
medical access to cannabis as a part of its campaigning for the
arrest of sick, dying and disabled Americans who use cannabis rather
than the pharmaceuticals, and the alcohol and tobacco sold by its
funders.&nbsp; How much longer will American physicians be
comfortable supporting the arrest of their patients in company with
the pushers of drugs that kill 500,000 Americans annually?</p>

<p align="center"><b>The Story Of Jimmy Montgomery And Other
American Victims Of Cannabis Prohibition Told At London Human
Rights Conference</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17,</b> London, U.K.:&nbsp; The violation
of the basic human rights of American cannabis users was the
subject of a panel discussion at the London Human Rights
Conference organized by Liberty, a British rights advocacy
group.&nbsp; For the first time, cannabis users were recognized
along with more familiar victims of government oppression.&nbsp;
Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director spoke on the human
rights violations committed against marijuana users in
America.&nbsp; Cowan told the conference about the shooting of
Scott Bryant and other suspected marijuana users.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Conference attendees were especially shaken by
the plight of Jimmy Montgomery, the paraplegic sentenced to 10
years in Oklahoma prison for less than two ounces of
marijuana.&nbsp; Montgomery remains in prison despite hundreds of
calls from around the world to the Oklahoma governor's office by
readers of NORML's weekly faxes.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is believed that Montgomery may be released
soon -- not because his arrest was unjust or that his sentence
was outrageous or because his life is in danger -- but simply
because Oklahoma prisons are so overcrowded that they must
release someone.&nbsp; While Montgomery's release, for whatever
reason, will be welcomed, the fact that the narcocracy can get
away with such an outrageous injustice, unreported by the
American media, clearly demonstrates that they can effectively
get away with anything.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Walter Cronkite Calls For Bipartisan
Commission To Study Alternatives To Drug War</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 20:</b>&nbsp; On the <i>Discovery Channel</i>
Special, &quot;The Cronkite Report: The Drug Dilemma&quot; Walter
Cronkite [former CBS news anchorman and regarded internationally
as one of the most trusted figures in America---ed.] called the
drug war a failure.&nbsp; Cronkite called for a bipartisan commission
to study the alternatives to prohibition.&nbsp; He concluded by
saying &quot;We cannot go into tomorrow with the same formulas
that are failing today.&quot;&nbsp; [&quot;And that's the way it
is.&quot;---ed.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Counting Down</u></b><b>: The Ten
Millionth Marijuana Arrest Will Take Place On July 20, The Last
Day Of A NIDA Anti-Marijuana Propaganda Fest</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from the U.S. Justice
Department arrest statistics, NORML has calculated that the ten
millionth marijuana arrest will take place on July 20.&nbsp;
While there is obviously no way of knowing the precise date of
such an event, the July date is a far more reasonable estimate
than most made in Washington.&nbsp; This particular date was
chosen to emphasize the role that government sponsored hate
propaganda, especially the politicized pseudo-science put out by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plays in maintaining
marijuana prohibition.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>On </u><b><u>July 19</u></b><u> and </u><b><u>20</u></b>,
NIDA is holding a &quot;National Conference on Marijuana Use:
Prevention, Treatment, and Research.&quot;&nbsp; The reference to
research is particularly ironic given NIDA's role in blocking
research on the medical uses of marijuana.&nbsp; According to
NIDA, the conference is a part of their &quot;Marijuana
Prevention Initiative.&quot;&nbsp; This is aimed at getting the
media to carry more propaganda to support the next ten million
arrests.&nbsp; NORML will be responding to what will undoubtedly
be billed as &quot;the latest research&quot; on marijuana.&nbsp;
This will probably include statements on how pot is far more
potent than it was in the past, even though NIDA's own numbers
show no increase in over ten years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the weeks ahead, NORML will be attempting to get the media to
report the astronomical arrest statistics. These numbers and the
politicization of science in service to prohibition will be the only
real stories.&nbsp; The ten millionth arrest will be a human
tragedy.&nbsp; If it is ignored, it will be a national disgrace.</p>

arrest contact this office -- or your attorney, if you're the

addressed by Richard Cowan at a three day Human Rights Convention
to be held in London from June 15 to 17.&nbsp; The Convention,
billed as &quot;A Festival of Rights,&quot; is being sponsored by
Liberty, a London based human rights organization.&nbsp; It is
expected that more than 3,000 people from around the world will
attend the conference.&nbsp; This will be the First time that the excesses
of America's war on marijuana users will be recognized as a
violation of human rights comparable to other forms of political
persecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that the international media and human rights
community will focus on the rising tide of violence and hatred
being inflicted on American cannabis users, which is being
ignored by the American media,&quot; said Cowan.&nbsp; He added,
&quot;having the persecution of cannabis users recognized at this
convention is a historic breakthrough in NORML's efforts to get

Recriminalization Bill</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12,</b> Salem, Oregon:&nbsp; The Oregon
Senate killed an effort to recriminalize marijuana possession

Directors, testified in support of the bill.&nbsp; The bill
(#2170) is short and succinct: <br>

A major daily newspaper reports that the Dutch chiefs of police
unanimously advise the Dutch government to make every possible
effort to promote the further decriminalization of
&quot;soft&quot; drugs [cannabis products---ed.] internationally. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>De Telegraaf</i>, Dutch policy makers have agreed
to postpone plans to overhaul Holland's drug policies until
September.&nbsp; In the mean time, all main political parties
(government and opposition) have all agreed to maintain the

Amsterdam Study Concludes That &quot;Tolerant&quot; Cannabis Laws
Do Not Lead To More Use</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 10,</b> Amsterdam, The Netherlands:&nbsp;
Contrary to what many people assume about the citizens of
Amsterdam, where the sale of cannabis in coffeeshops is allowed,
the majority of the population does not indulge in cannabis or
hashish. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Department of Social Geography of the Univ. of Amsterdam has
monitored the cannabis use of the Amsterdam population (ages 12
years-old and up) since 1987 by means of three large scale
household surveys.&nbsp; According to researcher Dr. Peter Cohen,
observing the period 1987-1994, the average age for first time
cannabis use in The Netherlands is a remarkably high twenty years
of age [as compared to 14 years-old in the U.S.---ed.]!&nbsp; The
research also indicates that despite the high numbers of
&quot;coffeeshops&quot; in The Netherlands, only 25% of the
population have ever used cannabis.&nbsp; In addition, only 6%
admit to using it daily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">From these extensive surveys, Dr. Cohen has been able to develop
a profile of the &quot;average&quot; cannabis consumer: well
educated, single, outgoing, around thirty years-old, and of Dutch
descent.</p>

they want more: a drug dealer's [users---ed.] back taxes or their
time in jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 14th Court of Appeals was asked to decide whether Mark
Stennett was punished sufficiently when, after his indictment for
marijuana possession, he was billed $49,070 by the State Comptrollers
Office.&nbsp; Since January 1990, the office has been allowed to
pursue such taxes known as the Texas Controlled Substances
Tax.&nbsp; It sells tax stamps to be purchased when a person obtains
contraband. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding Montana's tax
stamp, the court decided that since Stennett was paying the tax,
pursuing criminal punishment would constitute double jeopardy.&nbsp;
Defense attorneys have long made such a claim.&nbsp;
&quot;Anybody who has a drug case and also got hit with a drug
tax is entitled to have their case dismissed,&quot; said one of
Stennett's attorneys, Tom Moran, &quot;Any lawyer worth his salt,
when they hear about this case, will file (the proper paperwork)

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director, Richard Cowan, will be speaking at one
of the convention sessions about the inhumane treatment of Jimmy
Montgomery.&nbsp; Montgomery is a paraplegic who has almost died
several times while serving a ten year sentence in Oklahoma
prisons for less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; Despite
months of calling the Oklahoma Governor's office by hundreds of
concerned Americans, Montgomery is still being held in Oklahoma's
severely overcrowded prisons. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cowan will also speak about the killings by Wisconsin police of
two suspected cannabis users.&nbsp; One victim was a 15 year-old
boy allegedly shot by a drunken narc.&nbsp; &quot;I hope that the

delayed to July 12, supposedly because the June 21 schedule is
full.&nbsp; NORML urges that concerned citizens continue calling Oklahoma
Governor Keating and other state opinion leaders to urge that
Montgomery's case be dealt with immediately.&nbsp; It is
unfortunate that Oklahoma is to be subjected to international opprobrium
because it cannot find a way to free a man who did not belong in
prison in the first place.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6,</b> Salem, Oregon:&nbsp; In a surprise
move under new rules that allow for only one hour's notice to be
given before legislative hearings, the Oregon House of
Representatives voted 47 to 13 to re-criminalize the possession
of less than one ounce of marijuana.&nbsp; The bill would raise
the maximum fine for possession from $1,000 to $5,000 and the
minimum fine from $100 to $500 per gram.&nbsp; This would mean a
minimum fine of $2,800 per ounce.&nbsp; Although there is no
direct jail penalty, persons unable to pay the higher fines could
be jailed.&nbsp; The bill also makes it a crime to be &quot;under
the influence&quot; of marijuana without defining just what that
means. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1973, Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana,
but it does not have a higher rate of marijuana use than other
states.&nbsp; The sponsor of the bill cited the usual reasons,
the supposed &quot;increase&quot; in potency of marijuana, the
claim that it is the &quot;gateway&quot; to hard drugs (in 1973
it was the &quot;stepping stone&quot;), and the claim that 9 and
10 year-olds are smoking -- so adults mast be arrested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Critics point out that the bill would cost the state at least one
million dollars per year by requiring the appointment of public
defenders for indigent defendants, plus the cost of imprisoning those
who cannot afford the much higher fines.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This bill demonstrates that Oregon is not immune
to the massive hate campaign against cannabis users being waged
by the prohibitionist establishment and the mass media.&nbsp;
This week, Gannett News Service carried a three-part series
claiming that teenagers who use marijuana just once in a year are
ten times more likely to be involved in violent crimes than
non-users.&nbsp; Of course, no comparable numbers were given for
alcohol use.&nbsp; This is the sort of &quot;reporting&quot; that
leads to the shooting of a 15 year-old by a drunken narc, which
-- of course -- was not mentioned in the Gannett articles.&nbsp;
So much for their concern for teenage violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b><u>Update</u></b>:&nbsp; The U.S. Sentencing
Commission is considering an amendment that impacts cannabis consumers.&nbsp;
The following is from the Drug Reform Coordination Network
(DRCNet):</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier this spring, the U.S. Sentencing
Commission passed some amendments to the federal sentencing
guidelines that would reform the penalty structure for certain
drug offenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>One amendment</u>, passed 7-0, would change the plant-weight
ratio use for marijuana to 1 plant = 100 grams.&nbsp; (Currently
1 plant is considered 100 grams for 49 plants or fewer, but
becomes 1 kilo [1000 grams] for 50 plants or more, with the
effect that defendants convicted for 50 plants spend almost 3
times as long in prison as those convicted for 49 plants.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>A second amendment</u>, would provide a two point reduction in
offense level for certain non-violent, first time offenders who
qualify for the &quot;safety-valve&quot; exemption included in
last year's Crime Bill.&nbsp; This Amendment essentially matches
the exemption the law now grants from the mandatory minimum
statutes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendments will become law if Congress doesn't act by
November 1 to overturn them.&nbsp; <b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>:&nbsp;
What the Sentencing Commission </i><i><u>has not decided</u></i><i>
yet is whether the amendments will apply retroactively to current
inmates.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Please write the commission and ask them to make the following
amendments retroactive: </p>

32-3, the State Senate approved a bill that would end California's
unpopular &quot;Smoke A Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp;
The bill, SB 1198, would formally opt out of a federal mandate
requiring states to impose an automatic six-month driver's license
suspension for any drug offense, regardless of whether it is
driving-related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SB 1198 now goes to the Assembly, which recently killed an

the &quot;Smoke A Joint...,&quot; or else lose some $100 million

Medical Neglect Threatens Life</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 24,</b> Isolated in a cell with no way

stench of his untreated infections, suffers the pain of having to
tear off soiled bandages without any salve or ointments, and runs
the risk of life-threatening kidney and bladder infections because
guards cannot find the urine bag that his mother sent him.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Governor Keating's office claims to be doing
everything possible. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Governor Keating may be reluctant to look closely at the facts of
the Montgomery case.&nbsp; His office keeps telling callers that
Montgomery must have done something far worse than the trial records
indicate, because they do not want to believe that good people in
a small town, serving as jurors, could have done something so
terrible.&nbsp; He may be reluctant to recognize that the hate propaganda
fostered by the prohibitionist ideology that he espouses could
result in such a great injustice.&nbsp; Governor Keating should
spend a few minutes reviewing the record and then go and visit Jimmy's
prison cell and see and smell the stench of his lesions.&nbsp;
Then he might find the power and the courage to face the
consequences of hatred.&nbsp; The good people of Oklahoma have
been the victims of a crime of unspeakable evil, but it is
necessary to say that we are not damned by the evil done to us,
but rather by the evil done by us.</p>

might suggest that they are guilty for their indifference to the

explain why the only large scale testing of contraband marijuana,
sponsored by NIDA, shows no increase in potency since the early
1980's.&nbsp; As for it not being reported, the potent pot myth
has been repeated in almost every major publication in
America.&nbsp; It has become the single most accepted lie about
marijuana in the mainstream media.&nbsp; Recently, both <i>NEW
YORK</i> magazine and syndicated columnist George Will have
claimed that potency is 15 times higher than in the past.&nbsp;
Ironically, the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> cut that one sentence
from the Will column.&nbsp; NORML finds no valid evidence of any increase
in average potency.</p>

STILL IN PRISON: CONDITION DETERIORATING,<br>
AS GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DOES &quot;SPIN CONTROL&quot;</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 18,</b> Oklahoma City, OK.&nbsp;
Paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery remains in prison, and he is still not
receiving adequate medical care to properly treat his anti-biotic
resistant infections.&nbsp; As a result, his life remains in
danger.&nbsp; However, he is now receiving showers, a change of
clothes, clean bandages (from his mother), and is now able to
wash his clothes separately from the other prisoners.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The office of Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating is telling callers
that they are doing everything possible to get Montgomery
released to house arrest and they are actually urging people to
call and complain to the prosecutor, Richard Dugger, who blocked
his release.&nbsp; Callers have also received various versions of
spin control, depending on whom they talked to.&nbsp; One caller
was told that Montgomery had been selling marijuana to
children.&nbsp; Another was informed that since he was convicted
by a jury, he must have done something much more serious than
what &quot;the propaganda [NORML] is saying,&quot; but that the
state wanted him out of prison because he was costing them too much
money.&nbsp; A third caller was told that the Governor's staff
couldn't understand why this case was getting so much attention,
because they had not read anything about the case in the local media. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery will eventually be released, <b><i><u>if he doesn't
die first, and if you keep calling the governor's office.</u></i></b>&nbsp;
Your calls have clearly made the difference in the way he is
being treated.&nbsp; The State of Oklahoma may eventually free
him to house arrest, but they will not free the people of Oklahoma
from the chains of a lifetime of hate propaganda.&nbsp; NORML
would be interested in hearing any novel efforts at spin control
callers may have encountered from the governor's office.</p>

PROHIBITIONIST SUMMIT A PROPAGANDA FAILURE!&nbsp; ENTERTAINMENT
INDUSTRY LAUNCHES NEW &quot;ANTI-LEGALIZATION&quot; EFFORT</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 15,</b> Atlanta, GA.&nbsp; Prohibitionists
at a sparsely attended mayors conference were disappointed to
find organized opposition and minimal media coverage, which they
had to share with anti-prohibitionists.&nbsp; Bob Keizer, the
Dutch Minister who heads the Department of Alcohol, Drug and
Tobacco Policy of the Dutch Ministry of Health joined a group of
prominent American anti-prohibitionists--including the former
mayor of Hartford--to object to the misrepresentation of European
drug policies at a Press Conference on Monday, May 15th.&nbsp;
The day before the summit, reform activists demonstrated against
the conference from 1 to 4 PM. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference, billed as &quot;American Cities Against
Drugs,&quot; was held at tax-payers expense and had promised that
attendees would &quot;Hear from key European mayors about the
devastation Legalization is bringing to their cities.&quot;&nbsp;
Instead, attendees heard the former mayor of Stockholm warn
against flying KLM out of Amsterdam because the pilots may be
stoned on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference was more notable for announcing the formation of a
new prohibitionist propaganda effort by Hollywood known as the
National Drug Prevention League.&nbsp; This was founded by the
Entertainment Industries Council (EIC), which is sponsored by
such great moral leaders as Frank Sinatra, Aaron Spelling, and
Fred Silverman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now the wonderful folks who brought us <i>Reefer Madness, Mary
Jane</i>, and other film classics are pushing a new music video,
&quot;Will you be there tomorrow?&quot;&nbsp; The video purports
to present &quot;the legalization issue [as seen] through the
eyes of children.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps they will also make other
videos giving us their view -- &quot;as seen through the eyes of
children&quot; -- of other complex issues such as health care
reform, nuclear waste disposal, and flat rate versus progressive
taxation.&nbsp; &quot;Will you be taxed tomorrow?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">EIC says that it will be sponsoring an industry briefing session
on drugs and violence for Orlando-based entertainment executives
in July and is now organizing the industry's &quot;Drugs, Violence
and Youth, Truth or Tragedy Conference&quot; in October.&nbsp; Is
hypocrisy too complex a subject for a music video?</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 19,</b> Washington, D.C. NORML has joined
an international coalition of anti-prohibitionists in voicing its
support for Dutch drug policies-as they apply to marijuana.&nbsp;
In a letter to the Dutch Ambassador, NORML saluted the Dutch for
their cannabis policies.&nbsp; By making cannabis available in
almost 2,000 coffee shops around Holland, the Dutch have broken
the connection between hard drugs and cannabis.&nbsp; Instead of
studying the success of Dutch drug policies, American prohibitionists
are waging a propaganda campaign against our oldest and most
reliable ally, falsely claiming that peaceful Holland has become
a violent country as a result of its drug policies.</p>

the <i>Green Bay Press-Gazette</i>, in response to the April 17
shooting of their son, Scott Bryant, 29, by Dodge County sheriffs
detective Robert Neuman, parents Boyd and Shirley Bryant have
filed a wrongful death claim.&nbsp; Law enforcement's yield from
the Bryant killing; A very small amount of marijuana [According
to NORML activists in WI, less than 1 gram of marijuana was
discovered!) along with two .22-caliber rifles and five pellet guns.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed when he was killed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Beaver Dam lawyer Scott Rasmussen will be representing the
Bryants in their lawsuit on behalf of their dead son, his 8
year-old boy (who was home at the time of the shooting), and his

Kill Another Marijuana Suspect<br>
15 Year Old Shot By Narc Who Had Been Drinking</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 9,</b> Janesville, WI.&nbsp; Following the
fatal shooting of a marijuana suspect in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin
last week, 15 year-old Leon Kelly was shot to death by an
undercover officer who had been drinking.&nbsp; Kelly had
marijuana in his blood, according to police reports.&nbsp;
Shooting people is not considered the best way to test for
marijuana use, but a drug-free America comes first.&nbsp; There is
still no media coverage of these deaths, although most major
American newspapers have reported on the murder of a North
African immigrant in Paris.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Permissible Murders Happen Because Of
Permissible Hate Speech</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 6, 1990,</b> <i>The Los Angeles
Times</i> reported on the testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee
of then Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates in which Gates said
that casual drug users &quot;ought to be taken out and
shot.&quot;&nbsp; Gates made clear that he was talking about
marijuana smokers, &quot;who blast (sic, apparently one of
Gates's favorite words) some pot on a casual basis.&quot;&nbsp; Gates
went on to say that even casual use is &quot;treason.&quot;&nbsp;
If he had advocated genocide against any group other than
marijuana users, he would have been immediately removed from
office and Los Angeles might have been spared the terrible riots
that followed the acquittal of the police accused of beating
Rodney King.&nbsp; Gates was finally fired for incompetence after
that tragedy.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>1990,</b> Appearing on the television show, <i>Larry
King Live</i>, then drug czar William Bennett said beheading drug
dealers would be &quot;morally plausible&quot;.&nbsp; (He added,
&quot;There's no moral problem there.&nbsp; I used to teach
ethics---trust me.&quot;)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7, 1995,</b> <i>Boston Herald</i>
conservative columnist Don Feder calls for &quot;the Dresden
option&quot; to deal with illegal drugs.&nbsp; The reference to
the fire bombing of Dresden should be frightening to the citizens
of Los Angeles.&nbsp; As mentioned above, Chief Gates brought
them their own little Dresden.&nbsp; Hatred kills not just the
hated, but the haters and their silent allies.</p>

possible <b><i><u>using any means necessary, no matter what the

seriously also have not taken Conaway seriously.</p>

marijuana seized at $300,000, but knowledgeable observers
consider this a gross exaggeration.&nbsp; A spokesman for the
task force said that they consider McKee &quot;just another
marijuana grower.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McKee depends on a cane and a wheelchair to get
around and has spoken openly about providing marijuana for people
with AIDS, cancer, and various debilitating injuries.&nbsp; Last
week she told <i>Tacoma News Tribune</i> columnist C. R. Roberts,
&quot;There are a lot of people whose lives are depending on
this.&quot;&nbsp; Roberts wrote a column called &quot;Marijuana
may be illegal, but barring its medical use is the <i>real</i>
crime.&quot;&nbsp; His views reflect those of the majority of the
American people, but not those of the Clinton Administration
which is blocking research on the medical use of cannabis.&nbsp; President
Clinton is now celebrating the 50th anniversary of the defeat of

<p align="center"><b>PERMISSIBLE MURDERS IN AMERICA: ANOTHER
SUSPECTED MARIJUANA USER KILLED IN HIS HOME BY WISCONSIN POLICE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, Scott W.
Bryant, 29, was shot dead by police as they charged through the
door of his home with a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist the police in any
way.&nbsp; His seven year old son, who was sleeping in the next
room, had to watch his father die while an ambulance took 35
minutes to respond.&nbsp; Police later reported finding less than
3 grams of marijuana (one tenth of an ounce, enough for 2 or 3
&quot;cigarettes.&quot;) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This fatal shooting of a suspected marijuana user is just the
latest in a series of killings that have occurred over the last
several years.&nbsp; These incidents have generally been ignored
because the victims are accused of belonging to the one group in
America -- <i>suspected</i> marijuana users -- whom it is
apparently permissible to murder.&nbsp; These victims range from
the multimillionaire Donald Scott, shot dead in 1992 at his
estate near Malibu, to the disabled veteran Gary Shepard in the
hills of Kentucky in 1994.&nbsp; In all three cases the children
of the victims were present.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was killed by a
small army as he stood next to his wife, who was grazed by a
bullet, and his blood splattered on his four year old son.&nbsp;
None of these victims were in any way a threat to anyone.&nbsp; Donald
Scott did not even have any marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Media attention to these killings has ranged from slow to
non-existent.&nbsp; Even the Donald Scott case, which seemed to
have all the ingredients of a major news story -- money, intrigue
and beautiful scenery -- was not covered for more than 90 days
after the killing and was then quickly forgotten.&nbsp; The
police involved were never disciplined.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was a
poor man, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was crippled in Nixon's
war in Asia and killed in Clinton's war in America.&nbsp; His
killers are still on the job.&nbsp; It is unlikely that any
action will be taken against whomever shot Bryant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The media are looking for an action story with good pictures, so
they find a bunch of &quot;good ol' boys&quot; playing soldier
who say things ranging from the bizarre to the basic.&nbsp;
Somehow it is considered dangerous rhetoric -- and therefore news
-- when militia leaders say that they will defend
themselves.&nbsp; However, NORML has been trying to get the media
to look into the role of the National Guard in marijuana
prohibition for over a year and a half.&nbsp; Our report quotes
the head of the National Guard saying that their job is to make
America drug-free <b><i><u>&quot;using any means necessary, no
matter what the cost.&quot;</u></i></b> (emphasis added) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, as the militias and their conservative allies focus on
the shooting of the wife and son of the heavily armed white
supremacist Randy Weaver in Idaho, they ignore the shootings of citizens
who have been accused of having marijuana -- even when they did
not have any pot at all.&nbsp; Of course, indifference to the
killing of marijuana users is precisely what the mass media have
in common with the militias and politicians.&nbsp; While the
militias prepare for an invasion by the UN, the media are running
around the country looking for heavily armed groups that are a
threat to the rule of law.&nbsp; Both are missing the real
danger: the involvement of the U. S. military in domestic law enforcement
and the extension of unlimited power to the police under the
guise of the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">President Clinton has denounced the supposedly inflammatory
rhetoric of his critics, but he ignored the statement last year
by Thomas Constantine, the Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
that the &quot;non-violent drug user is a myth.&quot;&nbsp; This
is a blood libel that leads directly to the type of shooting that
occurred in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Former Bush Administration drug
policy advisor John Walters even mocked the suffering of
imprisoned Oklahoma paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery when his case was
reported by ABC television, saying, &quot;Apparently ABC couldn't
find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach clip in her
purse.&quot;&nbsp; Apparently, the minor technicality of a trial
has been by-passed, execution first, verdict later.&nbsp; Could
all of this be a clue as to why the people no longer trust their
government and the media? <br>

Governor, Tommy Thompson, at (608) 266-1212.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>GOOD NEWS! JIMMY MONTGOMERY TO BE FREED ON
TUESDAY!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thanks to the calls by the readers of these
weekly reports, Jimmy Montgomery is expected to be released to
&quot;house arrest&quot; next Tuesday.&nbsp; NORML will issue a
special bulletin as soon as he is free.&nbsp; NORML salutes
Governor Frank Keating, Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML, and
all who have worked to end this injustice.</p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML And ACLU Attack Legitimacy Of Anaheim
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Anaheim, In an well publicized
press conference, NORML and the Southern California American
Civil Liberties Union jointly announced that they have filed a
civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to
actively challenge Anaheim Ordinance No. 5396. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The controversial ordinance adds Sections 13.08.100.010 and
13.08.100.020 to the Anaheim Municipal Code and prohibits certain
prior drug offenders from the right to use public parks <b>for lawful
purposes</b>.&nbsp; This discriminatory legislation singles out
specific individuals from the general public based solely upon
their &quot;criminal&quot; history and forbids them from
participating in the many recreational, aesthetic, cultural,
associational, and other law abiding activities that generally
take place in city parks.&nbsp; Moreover, the restrictive Anaheim
ordinance remains in effect for three years <b>after</b> the
sentence has been served.&nbsp; Consequently, an individual
released from prison for marijuana cultivation in 1995 would be
effectively denied access from entering and/or participating in
any function taking place at a public park until the year
1998.&nbsp; Persons convicted of violating the ordinance face a
maximum six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both NORML and the ACLU charge that the Anaheim ordinance is
unconstitutional.&nbsp; Specifically, the lawsuit, <i>National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) v. City of
Anaheim</i> (95-2813 AAH), asserts that the legislation directly
violates NORML's right to free speech and assembly by precluding
members and speakers with prior drug convictions from both
attending and participating in a public rally for medical
marijuana that is scheduled to take place in La Palma Park.&nbsp;
The May 25th rally is being sponsored by NORML.&nbsp; The lawsuit contends
that, &quot;The absence of these NORML members from the rally
will, [in turn,] deprive the NORML members who can attend of
their right to associate with and exchange views with the absent
members.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML maintains that the Anaheim ordinance will greatly diminish
the force of NORML's message by disallowing several speakers from
voicing their opinions on the need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
In addition, because the enforcement of Sections 13.08.100.010
and 13.08.100.020 of the Anaheim Municipal code threatens to
exclude citizens who are non-members as well, NORML charges that
the ordinance &quot;interferes with NORML's ability to recruit
new members and to reach the full audience it would otherwise be
able to reach.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The joint lawsuit also alleges that the Anaheim ordinance
violates the plaintiffs' right to petition the government for
redress of grievances and the right to due process. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is activist and medical
marijuana patient, Craig McClain.&nbsp; Recently convicted for
growing five cannabis plants at his home, McClain is one of
NORML's scheduled speakers who is forbidden from entering La
Palma Park by the ordinance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In effect, &quot;the Anaheim ordinance makes [McClain's] speech a
crime,&quot; remarked ACLU Staff Attorney Mark Silverstein.&nbsp;
&quot;However well-intentioned, the...ordinance offers a false
hope about combating serious crime.&nbsp; Measures like this let
politicians off the hook, substituting phony rhetoric for
measures that work.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ACLU and NORML are asking for a preliminary injunction so
that McClain and other plaintiffs can legally attend the rally on
May 25. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information regarding the lawsuit, please contact Mark
Silverstein at Southern Cal. ACLU (213) 977-9500 x264 or Allen
St. Pierre at NORML (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center">April 27, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>NORML</b> REITERATES ITS
COMMITMENT TO NON-VIOLENCE</font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following the tragedy in Oklahoma City, it has
been suggested that groups that are critical of government
policies are somehow encouraging violence.&nbsp; Since its
inception, NORML has had a commitment to non-violence in the
tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp; NORML's principal
message is that marijuana prohibition is unjustified violence
against peaceful marijuana users.&nbsp; There have been almost
ten million marijuana arrests since 1965.&nbsp; Each of these
involves coercion and the threat of state violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML
said, &quot;Our message to the government, like that of the
'velvet revolution' that peacefully overthrew Communism in
Czechoslovakia, is that they need not fear us because we are not
like them.&nbsp; We want to end violence, not spread it.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML does not see the proposed anti-terrorist
legislation as a significant new threat to marijuana users, who
have almost no Constitutional rights remaining.&nbsp; It is the
narcocracy, not some &quot;new world order,&quot; that is the
real and present danger to our liberty.&nbsp; For sometime NORML
has been trying to get the media interested in the role of the
National Guard in domestic law enforcement, but to no
avail.&nbsp; As one witty observer complained, &quot;Why is it
that Americans are paranoid about the wrong things?&quot;&nbsp;
The problem with paranoia is that when you are fighting imaginary
devils you cannot see the very real evils.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Major Increase In British Teens Using
Cannabis</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 24,</b> <i>Reuters</i> reports that,
&quot;The number of 15 and 16-year-old British boys who have smoked
cannabis has tripled in the past three years and one third now
say they have used the <u>illegal</u> drug.&quot;&nbsp; [these
figures are the result of a recent poll conducted by Exeter
University for the BBC -ed.]&nbsp; The survey found that 32.9
percent of boys aged 15 and 16 and 27.3 percent of girls admitted
having smoked cannabis in 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This is compared to 11.3 percent of boys and 8.9 percent of girls
in 1991, according to <i>Reuters</i>.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 24,</b> London, UK, The traditionally
respected, high profile documentary program Panorama presented
some of the most extreme anti-cannabis propaganda that the UK
public has ever seen.&nbsp; The majority of the of the program
was filmed in the USA focused on four main health risks
associated with the use of cannabis, namely: addiction, birth
problems, mental deterioration and cancer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Various parts of the program were split up with excerpts of
groups of teenage age school children suggesting that cannabis:
&quot;isn't all that bad;&quot; &quot;it's just a bit of
fun;&quot; and &quot;it could be bad if you smoke it with
tobacco&quot; as the <i><u>only</u></i> defense against several
professors who were damning cannabis to hell. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Legalize Cannabis Campaign (LCC) is strongly contesting the
content and obvious bias of the program.&nbsp; It appears that

<p align="center"><b><i>Baltimore Sun</i></b><b>'s Front Page
Afflicted By &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;<br>
DEA Admits Shifting Agents From Cocaine To Marijuana Hunt</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 14,</b> <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> in a
lengthy headline story, &quot;Authorities hit the marijuana
trail, Police see resurgence of '60s drug&quot; pushed most of
the DEA's most successful propaganda lines.&nbsp; <i>The Sun</i>,
once the paper of H.L. Mencken, begins by giving the impression
that marijuana law enforcement has flagged during recent
years.&nbsp; Actually, the number of arrests has been increasing and
the 10 millionth marijuana arrest since 1965 will soon take
place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article by Marcia Myers also parrots the DEA line that
marijuana is &quot;3 to 5 times stronger than it was 20 years
ago,&quot; although even the head of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse claims only a 3-fold increase and there is little
evidence to support any actual increase.&nbsp; The head of Maryland's
marijuana eradication program is quoted as saying that growers
&quot;have been able to cultivate a crop that will literally
knock your socks off.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to citing this purported epidemic in barefootedness,
the article says that what it calls &quot;marijuana related&quot;
emergency room admissions have tripled in the last four
years.&nbsp; Actually, these numbers represent only emergency
room &quot;mentions&quot; of marijuana, and do not indicate that marijuana
was the cause of the visit.&nbsp; Had the reporter bothered to
check with the primary source on this data, she would have
learned that approximately 80% of such &quot;mentions&quot;
involve people who are actually having problems with other drugs,
but also &quot;mention&quot; having used marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article did break new ground in two areas:&nbsp; 1.) It
actually reported that forfeiture encourages police to work on
marijuana cases since the police agencies get to keep the
property they seize.&nbsp; 2.) It also revealed that the
Baltimore office of the DEA has shifted agents away from cocaine
cases to go after marijuana.&nbsp; They call this a &quot;more
balanced approach.&quot;&nbsp; This approach would be more
&quot;balanced&quot; only if one thinks that marijuana is somehow
as much a problem as cocaine, which this article implies.&nbsp;
Perhaps in the future <i>The Sun</i> will take a &quot;more
balanced approach&quot; to journalism and include a few more
facts with its ration of DEA propaganda.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Hair Testing For Marijuana Called
Unreliable, But Proceeds Anyway</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7,</b> In a copyrighted story by C.
Eugene Emery, <i>The Providence Journal</i> reported that even
though the developer of the new hair test for drugs acknowledges
that the test is not a reliable indicator of marijuana use, they
are testing for it anyway. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The test, marketed by Psychemedics of Cambridge, Mass. is
designed to detect trace residues of illicit drugs that may have
been used over the last several months.&nbsp; One advantage of
hair testing over urine testing is that cocaine and heroin are
not detectable in urine after a day or two, while marijuana
metabolites can be detected for weeks.&nbsp; The urine testing
has the effect of encouraging the use of cocaine and other hard
drugs over marijuana.&nbsp; Urine testing is also considered
relatively easy to beat. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>Providence Journal</i> story J. Michael Walsh of the
National Institute for Standards and Technology and former
executive director of President Reagan's Drug Advisory Council
was very critical of the reliability of hair testing in general,
but especially when used for detecting marijuana.&nbsp; Walsh
told the <i>Providence Journal</i> (which uses the hair test)
that, &quot;It is just inappropriate to deny employment or take
adverse action against an employee on the basis of such a
test.&quot; <br>

Pierre at NORML, (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>National Review</i></b><b> Reports On
Jimmy Montgomery; Paraplegic Now Receiving Better Treatment;
Hopeful Of Release Soon.</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an editorial in its <b>May 1</b> issue,
William F. Buckley, Jr.'s <i>National Review</i> commented on the case
of Jimmy Montgomery, a paraplegic sentenced to 10 years in
Oklahoma prisons for less than 2 ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; <i>NR</i>
noted that former deputy drug czar John P. Walters criticized ABC News
for reporting on the Montgomery case.&nbsp; Walters showed no
concern for Montgomery but rather complained, &quot;Apparently
ABC couldn't find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach
clip...&quot;&nbsp; NR observes that &quot;something is seriously
wrong with a drug policy that condones such treatment -- a point
that the drug warriors tacitly acknowledge by changing the
subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, Montgomery is now receiving proper medical care
and has been moved to another prison facility.&nbsp; It is hoped
that this move is in preparation for his being released to
&quot;house arrest.&quot;&nbsp; Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML
reports that the numerous calls received by the Oklahoma
governor's office helped save Jimmy's life.&nbsp; <i><u>NORML
expresses its gratitude to all who called</u></i>.&nbsp; NORML
also expresses its sympathy to the citizens of Oklahoma City for
the tragic deaths in the Federal Building bombing.&nbsp; Hunting
down these cowardly murderers is the proper use for law
enforcement.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibitionists React Hysterically To ABC
News Program Critical Of Drug Prohibition And Condemn &quot;Drug
Legalization In Europe&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaints of John Walters about ABC's
reporting on the Jimmy Montgomery case were in a <i>Washington
Times</i> op-ed article published the day before the ABC program
actually ran.&nbsp; Walters also continued the prohibitionist
practice of claiming that &quot;drug legalization in Europe&quot;
has been a failure.&nbsp; He was later joined in the chorus by A.
M. Rosenthal, former managing editor of <i>The New York Times</i>,
who typically cited Zurich's Needle Park as an example of the
failure of &quot;drug legalization.&quot;&nbsp; None of them
offered any analysis of the Dutch policy of tolerating cannabis sale
in &quot;coffee shops.&quot;&nbsp; Instead they tried to paint
Holland as a violent crime-ridden country.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Long Island Student Suspended Just For
Wanting To Write A Paper On The<br>
Economics Of Hemp</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 19,</b> A high school student from Long
Island (NY) called NORML's national office to report that she was
suspended from school briefly for having indicated that she was
going to write her term paper on the economics of hemp.&nbsp; Her
principal relented when she mentioned something about the First
Amendment ... which was also written on hemp (paper).</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Atlantic Monthly</i></b><b> Work On
Marijuana Prohibition Wins Prestigious</b><br>
<b>&quot;National Magazine Award.&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>'s two part article (<b>August/September,
1994</b>) on marijuana prohibition by Eric Schlosser won the
National Magazine Award reporting prize.&nbsp; Schlosser wrote
about the extremely high sentences given to people convicted of
marijuana trafficking offenses in contrast to lesser penalties
given to people convicted of violent offenses.&nbsp; <u>NORML
congratulates Schlosser and </u><i><u>The Atlantic</u></i>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>HUNDREDS PROTEST AGAINST DRUG ENFORCEMENT
ADMINISTRATION'S HARASSMENT OF SICK AND DYING AT SAN FRANCISCO
CANNABIS BUYERS CLUB<br>
AGENTS FOLLOW AND VIDEO TAPE PATIENTS AS THEY LEAVE CLUB</b><br>
<b>PREPARING A BUST?</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 11 - Over 500 citizens demonstrated
peacefully in front of the Federal Building in San Francisco
against the harassment by DEA agents of patients leaving the
nations largest Cannabis Buyers Club.&nbsp; Agents of the Drug
Enforcement Administration conspicuously followed and video taped
persons leaving the Club.&nbsp; The Club was originally founded
to provide people with AIDS access to cannabis to overcome the
nausea and loss of appetite associated with the disease and the medications
given for it.&nbsp; The Club now openly provides cannabis to over
4,000 sick, dying, and disabled Americans with a wide range of
medical problems.&nbsp; Patients must bring letters from their doctors
saying that no legally available medications help them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is believed that the DEA's actions may be in preparation for
shutting down the club, which operates in open defiance of the
DEA's suppression of any use or study of cannabis for medical purposes.&nbsp;
A hearing will be held later this month by the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors to determine if the city should declare a
medical emergency to try to forestall any such action by the DEA.&nbsp;
Nothing that the city could do would be legally binding on the
DEA, but it is thought that the DEA might be inhibited by the
fear of adverse publicity.&nbsp; So far the national media have
largely failed to report on the persecution of those who use
cannabis medically, but large scale demonstrations in San
Francisco might draw unwanted attention to this policy.&nbsp;
This is a risk that the DEA may have to take to maintain its
reputation for utter ruthlessness and avoid clear proof of the
need for medical cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director, visited the club
in February a staffer told him that one of the first things they
have to do with their clients is help them get over their fear of their
government.&nbsp; Even in liberal San Francisco, sick, dying, and
disabled Americans have to live in fear of the Federal
government.&nbsp; This harassment of people leaving the Club may
also be intended to reinstall such a fear.&nbsp; The Club will be
open on Good Friday.&nbsp; Will the DEA crucify the helpless? <br>

<p align="center"><b>MEANWHILE IN OKLAHOMA, PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY IS HAND-CUFFED TO A PRISON BED; LIFE IN DANGER; DENIED
PROPER MEDICAL TREATMENT; NO ACCESS TO SHOWER</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 13 - Lexington, OK, Jimmy Montgomery, a
paraplegic who was featured on a recent ABC News Special about
the excesses and failures of the Drug War, spends his days
handcuffed to a prison bed in Oklahoma without adequate medical
treatment for the anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower
body.&nbsp; He is no longer in a cell with 40 other prisoners,
but he has no access to a shower, even though the prison in which
he is confined received Federal funds two years ago for building
such a facility for the disabled. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Friends believe that Montgomery, who is serving 10 years for less
than 2 ounces of marijuana, may die within days if he is not
moved to University Hospital in Oklahoma City.&nbsp; There he
could be properly treated and could be visited by his mother who
is unable to visit him in prison.&nbsp; What a mockery it would
be if he died over Easter weekend while politicians, bureaucrats
and prison guards celebrate their &quot;salvation.&quot;&nbsp;
Jesus wept. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 6 - Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon,
(R. NY) chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee has
introduced a bill (H.R. 1453) to deny tax-exempt status to
organizations such as NORML and the Cato Institute, the widely
respected libertarian think tank, that &quot;advocate the legalization
of certain drugs.&quot;&nbsp; Previously, Rep. Solomon has also
introduced legislation to prohibit the expenditure of government
funds to study alternatives to drug prohibition.&nbsp;
Representative Solomon's fear of truth is well founded. &nbsp; He
certainly must know that any such study would result in a
condemnation of marijuana prohibition, as have all other large
scale studies conducted over the last hundred years.&nbsp; Last
year on the floor of Congress Mr. Solomon called NORML
&quot;wacky but dangerous.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Sentencing Commission Accepts NORML's
Recommendations To Reform Federal Sentencing Guidelines For
Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 10 - Washington, D.C. -- The U.S.
Sentencing Commission announced it's approval of a proposed
amendment (#37) to federal sentencing guidelines pertaining to
the government's assigned weight of marijuana produced per plant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the late 1980's, the federal guidelines for domestically
grown marijuana offenses have not been based on the actual weight
of the plants, but rather on an arbitrarily assigned weight equivalent.&nbsp;
Under the current guidelines, 49 plants or fewer are considered
to weigh 100 grams each, but 50 or more plants are considered to
weigh 1,000 grams each. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Commission was persuaded by representatives from NORML, The
Drug Policy Foundation, Families Against Mandatory Minimums
(FAMM) and the Cato Institute who testified that <u>present
guidelines have created a &quot;sentencing cliff&quot; in which
persons convicted of cultivating 50 plants must be incarcerated
up to four times longer than an individual convicted of
cultivating 49 plants</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, a change in the guidelines helps to rectify the
&quot;home cultivation/bulk possession&quot; discrepancy.&nbsp; <i><u>For
example</u></i>: an individual convicted of cultivating marijuana
must serve the same five year sentence as someone who possessed
99 kilograms (218 pounds) of 'packaged' marijuana, despite the
fact that the plants would have produced less than 10 kilograms
(22 pounds) of usable marijuana.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted 7-0 to
approve a 100 gram per plant ratio for all plants, <i>regardless</i>
of the number involved.&nbsp; Unless Congress intervenes, the
Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law on
November 1, 1995. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>NORML salutes the tireless efforts of FAMM for its great work
on this issue!</u> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For further information on the U.S. Sentencing Commission's
recommendations please contact the commission at (202) 273-4590

<p align="center"><b>Iowa Senate </b><b><u>Removes</u></b><b>
Mandatory Minimum Sentences For Drug Offenders</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 12 - <i>The Des Moines Register</i>
reported that the Iowa Senate &quot;in an effort to clear out prison
space for the most serious criminals [passed a bill] that would
waive the mandatory minimum sentence now on the books for drug
offenders if they didn't use a firearm or commit an assault in
connection with the crime.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b><u>Update</u></b><b>: Jimmy Montgomery
Shares Prison Cell With 40 Prisoners</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 6,</b> Wheelchair-bound Jimmy Montgomery
has been forced to share a cell with <i>forty</i> other prisoners
who risk infection from the chronic anti-biotic resistant
infections afflicting the lower half of his body.&nbsp; On
Monday, Jimmy was picked up by law enforcement officials and sent
back to prison in Lexington, Oklahoma to serve the balance of a
ten year sentence for possession of less than two ounces of
pot.&nbsp; According to Oklahoma NORML Coordinator Michael
Pearson, cannabis reform activists in Oklahoma (and nationwide)
have been calling the Governor and the chief of the Bureau of
Corrections. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pearson says that &quot;Jimmy's case is getting incredible
statewide media exposure.&nbsp; The Montgomery case is seen by
even the most conservative politicians as demonstrating why non-violent
offenders shouldn't be taking up valuable prison space.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile... Willie Nelson's Pot Charges
Dropped</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 4, Waco, TX</b> About the time that
Oklahoma was re-imprisoning Jimmy Montgomery, an undoubtedly
relieved McLennan County District Attorney decided to drop
marijuana possession charges against Willie Nelson rather than
appeal an adverse cour ruling.&nbsp; The court had ruled that the
enormously popular Texas singer/songwriter had not been properly
advised of his rights and also that there was not probable cause
to search his Mercedes.&nbsp; Police had spotted the remains of an
alleged marijuana cigarette in the ash tray of Nelson's car when
they found Nelson taking a roadside nap.&nbsp; Since many Texans
who drive Mercedes roll their own tobacco cigarettes as an economy
measure, the police were not justified in assuming that the
cigarette was anything other than harmless tobacco, which is
still legal.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nelson is very candid about his marijuana use and
has even talked about having smoked marijuana on the roof of the
White House when Jimmy Carter was President -- a few years after Montgomery
was paralyzed in an industrial accident.&nbsp; Had Nelson been
tried and convicted he could have been sentenced to six months in
jail ... and the District Attorney might have had to leave the
country.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The contrast between the treatment of Nelson
with that of Jimmy Montgomery illustrates the extreme disparity
in consequences for the one thousand Americans who are arrested
everyday on marijuana charges.&nbsp; For some, it is only an
embarrassment.&nbsp; Others find their lives ruined.&nbsp; It is better
to be rich, famous and healthy than to be poor, obscure and
crippled -- especially if you want justice.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Police Chief Of Hawaii County Suffers From A
Case Of 'Reefer Madness'</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 24,</b> In a letter written to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Hawaii County Police Chief Wayne G.
Carvalbo stated: &quot;We request the reference to
&quot;hemp&quot; be deleted from executive Order Number 12919 ...
From a local law enforcement standpoint, we view the promotion of
hemp in Executive Order 12919 as a vehicle being utilized by pro
marijuana groups to promote the legalization of marijuana.&nbsp;
The proponents are using the false environmental arguments to
promote the use of a drug that bears substantial health risks to
the user.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>OKLAHOMA RE-IMPRISONS PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY ON POT CHARGE; FAMILY FEARS FOR HIS LIFE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 4 - Today the State of Oklahoma
re-imprisoned paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery who has been confined
to a wheelchair for over twenty years and who suffers from
chronic anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower body.&nbsp;
Montgomery was sentenced in 1992 to ten years in prison for
possession of less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; In 1993,
after serving almost a year of his sentence and nearly dying
twice because of the failure of the state of Oklahoma to provide adequate
treatment for the highly communicable infections, Montgomery was
released on an appeals bond arranged by NORML Legal Committee
member C. Rabon Martin.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery was actually convicted of possession
with intent to distribute marijuana, based on the testimony of an
acquaintance who had been arrested -- by a lawman named Lawless
-- for cocaine possession.&nbsp; This man was then given a
lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Montgomery.&nbsp;
The police then attempted to seize the house in which Montgomery
lived.&nbsp; The house belongs to his elderly mother and there
was never any allegation that she knew of any of the alleged
marijuana use.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is widely -- but illegally -- used by
people with spinal chord injuries for the relief of pain and
spasm in their paralyzed limbs.&nbsp; Presumably the state of
Oklahoma will give Montgomery opiates, tranquilizers and muscle
relaxers instead of marijuana.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the state
previously failed to provide adequate medical care for him, which
endangered not only Montgomery, but also the other prisoners with
whom he was confined.&nbsp; Montgomery's family fears for his
life, not only from the infections, but also from other prisoners
who may fear infection by being confined with him.</p>

<p align="left">(Montgomery was also convicted of possession of
&quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; -- pipes -- and of possession of
two guns in the commission of a drug related felony.&nbsp;
Drive-by shootings by people in wheelchairs are a major problem
in small towns in Oklahoma.&nbsp; The only evidence of intent to distribute
was the testimony of another officer who claimed that he had
never seen anyone with two ounces who was not a major
dealer.&nbsp; This officer was subsequently arrested and charged
with embezzling from the police property room.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction
and sentence based solely on this officer's testimony -- <i>without
issuing a written opinion to explain this action</i>.)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery's appearances at the National Press
Club and at a protest in front of the White House on November 15,
1994, National Medical Marijuana Day, were ignored by the
national media -- although some did complain about the smell of
marijuana smoke at the Press Club.&nbsp; NORML notes that Thomas
Jefferson said &quot;I tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Montgomery's attorney, C. Rabon Martin will
be seeking a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court in
Oklahoma City.&nbsp; Martin can be reached at 918-587-9000.&nbsp;
The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be reached at
405-521-2342.&nbsp; An ABC Television News Special &quot;<u>America's
War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions</u>&quot; will feature the
Jimmy Montgomery story on Thursday, April 6 at 10PM Eastern.</p>

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">March 30, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Editor of Arkansas Times Comes out of Her
&quot;Smoky Little Closet&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing in her regular column, Mara Leveritt, the senior
editor of the widely respected weekly <i>Arkansas Times</i>
revealed that she has smoked an average of one &quot;joint&quot;
per day for the last twenty years.&nbsp; Leveritt, who was named
Arkansas Journalist of Year by the University of Arkansas explained
that her purpose was not to encourage the use of marijuana, but
to spur a more rational discussion of marijuana
prohibition.&nbsp; By speaking out she hopes to make it more
difficult to demonize marijuana users. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">She said that &quot;we have come to accept as normal a most
dangerous form of political correctness: a situation in which
those on one side of the issue feel safe to speak, while any would-be
opposition exposes itself to heightened scrutiny.&quot;&nbsp; She
went on to say that &quot;If long term, regular users like myself
felt free to articulate their experiences with marijuana, the
walking, talking evidence that we represent would put our
marijuana laws to shame....&nbsp; And as we get older, our lives
begin to make the lies that have been broadcast about marijuana
look even more ridiculous.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Associated Press story on the article, Leveritt
acknowledged having belonged to NORML. NORML salutes her courage
and urges others who talk about the truth to stop living a lie.&nbsp;
Speaking the truth is a wonderfully liberating experience.&nbsp;
We have it on the highest authority that it will make us free. </p>

<p align="center">[Ms. Leveritt can be reached at 501-375-2985.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alleged white House Shootist Reportedly
Smoked Pot and Listened to Rush Limbaugh<br>
A Dangerous Combination?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the testimony of a friend, Francisco Duran, who
is accused of spraying the White House with bullets, allegedly
smoked marijuana and listened to Rush Limbaugh before setting out for
Washington.&nbsp; His friend who smoked marijuana with him, but
did not listen to Rush Limbaugh, said he tried to talk him out of
his plan to attack the President.&nbsp; Since marijuana -- unlike
alcohol -- is not conimonly associated with acts of violence,
marijuana users who listen to Rush Limbaugh are urged to watch
out for violent impulses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>New Test Allows Parents to Test Their
Children's Rooms for &quot;Drugs&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a major breakthrough in the technology of cementing family
values Barrington Technologies of New Providence, New Jersey, has
introduced a home drug detection kit, &quot;DrugAlert,&quot; that allows
parents to surreptitiously check their children's room and
personal belongings for drug residues. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A March 29 <i>Washington Post</i> story on the test quoted a
staff therapist at the Family Therapy Institute of Alexandria,
Virginia, saying that &quot;It usually takes two or three years
after a child is using before their behavior becomes so deviant
that parents are aware of their drug use, and by that time they
are well into addiction.&quot;&nbsp; He did not suggest at what
age parents might start using these tests, but presumably it
should be up to three years before there is any indication of a
problem.&nbsp; According to the Partnership for a Drug-Free (sic)
America, the median age of first drug use by children is 12 and
half.&nbsp; Therefore regular testing might begin at age 9.&nbsp;
The <i>Washington Post</i> story also reported on home urine
tests that are being sold.&nbsp; Parents can also collect their
children's urine samples from an early age.&nbsp; There are
conflicting opinions on the relative merits of surreptitious and
forced testing as tools to help the child mature in a drug-free
environment. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The DrugAlert kit supplies a small pre-moistened pad which
picks up drug residues when wiped across items that may have come
into contact with illicit drugs.&nbsp; To demonstrate the technology,
company executives spread cocaine over common objects - such as a
baseball trophy which one would expect a drug using child to
bring into contact with drugs.&nbsp; The surfaces were then wiped
with the DrugAlert pad and the pad was tested and demonstrated
the presence of the cocaine.&nbsp; It was not explained <i>where</i>
the company got the cocaine, whether from the DEA, the CIA, or
the Iran/Contra connection. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The company warns that children might pick up drug residues
without actually using drugs, and a company executive also
admitted that the company had not considered the possibility that children
might use the test to check their parents rooms for drugs.&nbsp; <u>Perhaps
the D.A.R.E. program could provide children with the tests so
that more parents could be reported to the police and thereby
saved from drugs</u>.&nbsp; Employers [such as editors or
producers -ed.] might test their employees' personal belongings
to detect drug traces.&nbsp; Presumably the tests will not detect
the residues of alcoholic beverages so that teenage binge
drinking will not be detected and personal liberty will not be
undermined. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Plants Thrive In Downtown Tel Aviv<br>
Is Marijuana Decriminalization Coming To Isreal?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 24, The <em>Jerusalem Post</em> (JP) ran an article
featuring the actions of the country's most evident marijuana
reform organization, The Green Revolution. </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Israel has a growing marijuana-smoking population and many
    of them believe that the drug, being natural rather than
    chemical, should be legalized. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, the drive towards legalized growing and smoking of
cannabis gained new momemtum.&nbsp; While the legalization
movement has been going on here for some time, the movement in
Tel Aviv has exploded.&nbsp; Over the past year, there have been
rallies and smoke-ins at Tel Aviv nightclubs, and organizers have
produced T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons and pamphlets carrying
the familiar shape of the cannabis leaf. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But buttons and signs aren't enought to bring about such a
radical change.&nbsp; [Marijuana reform group] The Green
Revolution has discovered the green thumb.&nbsp; Armed with
seedlings and a smile, about 15 revolutionaries have turned to
gardening.&nbsp; Their mission: to turn Tel Aviv into a marijuana jungle. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On one Friday afternoon in January, members of the group targeted
the Tel Aviv landscape, tilling the soil with about 1,000
seeds.&nbsp; The result: marijuana is growing all over downtown
Tel Aviv. 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [The JP further reports] After the Green Revolution made
    its strategy public, hundreds of others planted seeds, and
    not just in Tel Aviv.&nbsp; Sprouts have been spotted in Or
    Yehuda and Givatayim.&nbsp; Budding cannabis has been spotted
    around Tel Aviv City Hall, in the planters of Carlebach Steet
    office buildings and down other main streets. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [But, there are detractors. -ed.] Dr. Benny Avrahami,
    director of the Tel Aviv Municipal Anti-Drug Authority. He
    admits that marijuana is hardly in the same league as hard
    drugs...though he considers marijuana to be the
    &quot;gate-opener&quot; to harder drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Avrahami thinks that legalizing marijuana could lead to the
    collapse of Isreali society. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;<i><u>If marijuana was to become legalized, in my opinion,
it would be social suicide for Isreal</u></i> [emphasis added
-ed.].&nbsp; So many of our youth would feel free to use it and
the more users, the more addicts.&nbsp; How can we afford to have
this when they are in the army and part of a society that may be
called up at a short notice to serve?&quot; 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * One month after the fast seeds were planted, the group set
    out to see what had become of their gardening
    adventure.&nbsp; The payoff: 5-cm.-high marijuana plants around
    downtown... [Green Revolution members] will continue their
    fight for legalization, planting and campaigning, because
    they really want to be law-abiding citizens.&nbsp; But until
    that happens-- they'll just keep breaking the law. 
</blockquote>

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">March 23, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alcohol Industry Association Hires Former
Head Of Drug Enforcement Administration</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">John C. Lawn, the former head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) has been appointed as Chairman and CEO of
the &quot;Century Council,&quot; which is described in the
March/April issue of <i>Healthy Drinking</i> magazine as being
&quot;the most prominent of the hundreds of programs supported by
the licensed beverage industry.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The appointment is seen as an extension of the efforts of the
alcohol industry to separate itself from the illegal drugs.&nbsp; <i>Healthy
Drinking</i>, supported by the alcohol industry, hails the
appointment, &quot;anxiously&quot; hoping that Lawn's connections
in the prohibitionist propaganda industry will help de-couple
alcohol from other drugs in prohibitionist propaganda. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The magazine wrongly states that the DEA has &quot;scrupulously
avoided confusing use with abuse and drinking with drugging, a
stance which seems beyond the ken of other federal agencies like Health
and Human Services.&quot;&nbsp; The alcohol industry seems
unaware that the DEA is now claiming that alcohol prohibition was
a success.&nbsp; For example, an official 1994 DEA publication,
&quot;How to Hold Your Own in A Drug Legalization Debate&quot;
(page 29) cites two prohibitionists who claim that alcohol
prohibition worked because it reduced alcohol consumption.&nbsp;
The Michigan Drug Czar Robert Peterson is quoted as saying that
&quot;Since the repeal of Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot;&nbsp;
This sort of statement is common in prohibitionist
propaganda.&nbsp; Much of the hard core constituency of drug
prohibition <i>also</i> supports alcohol prohibition -- but they
generally keep it low key. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the magazine approvingly quotes Lawn using a standard
DEA line: &quot;Illicit drugs .... are illegal because they are
dangerous.&quot;&nbsp; Does this indicate that the alcohol
industry is betting its future on the assertion that alcohol is <u>not</u>
&quot;dangerous&quot; by the standards of a government that is waging
a war on marijuana, which by every objective measure is far less
dangerous than alcohol? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, said that
&quot;the appointment of Lawn is not only cynical and
hypocritical, but also very misguided.&nbsp; The alcohol industry
is not going to protect itself from the prohibitionists by
pretending that alcohol isn't a drug.&nbsp; Lawn may well be able
to marginally influence some of the prohibitionist propaganda or
legislation passed by alcohol using (and abusing) legislators,
but this is more likely to lull the alcohol industry into
unwarranted complacency rather than to protect them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The alcohol and tobacco industries need to learn that their best
protection from the therapeutic state is to tell the truth about
freedom and stop trying to pretend that their products aren't
'drugs.'&nbsp; Further, does the alcohol industry really want to
declare war on its natural allies in the anti-prohibitionist
movement in order to appease the prohibitionists who have them
next on their lists?&nbsp; Who is advising the alcohol industry
on this, the ghost of Neville Chamberlin?&nbsp; Or perhaps the
ghost of Harry Anslinger?&quot; </p>

Drinking</i> at 206-525-0449.&nbsp; For more information of a
comparison of alcohol and marijuana contact Allen St. Pierre at
NORML 202-483-5500. </p>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a one-hour news special, ABC News correspondent Catherine
Crier [a former Felony Chief Prosecutor and a State Civil

reduction&quot; -- the treatment of addicts with drugs and
therapy rather than incarceration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The hour takes Crier to cities around the country, and to Europe,
where tactics that to many appear risky and dangerous are
currently employed.&nbsp; Should and could they be successfully
used here?&nbsp; Experts -- and addicts -- offer their thoughts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Execution Delayed For Convicted
Marijuana &quot;Kingpin&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 22, <i>The Washington Times</i> reported that in
Birmingham, Alabama, &quot;A judge yesterday blocked the
execution of a drug kingpin nine days before he was to become the
first person put to death by the U.S. government since 1963. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Nearly Fifty Percent Of Coloradans Approve

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 19, The Associated Press (AP) reports that &quot;From
the Amazon jungle to Ipanema beach, marijuana is part of a daily
routine for many Brazilians. Routine, but illegal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now, for the first time, the country is seriously discussing a
proposal to end jail time and fines for the use and possession of
the drug. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>AP</i> reports that Congress is scheduled to vote on

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under current law, marijuana users can be sentenced to 2 to 3
years in prison for possessing as little as 20 grams of
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>AP</i>, three South American nations --
Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela -- already have systems similar
to the one proposed by Jobim, while the possession of small
amounts of marijuana is completely legal in Columbia and Peru. <br>

<p align="center">March 16, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Testifies Before U.S. Sentencing
Guideline Commission</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 15, Washington, D.C., NORML National Legal Committee
member Marvin Miller, Esq., of Alexandria, VA led a group of
NORML witnesses who testified before the U.S. Sentencing
Commission and urged the adoption of proposed guideline changes
that would benefit marijuana-related defendants in federal court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller, a former member of the NORML Board of Directors and a
nationally prominent criminal defense attorney, urged the
commission to adopt two proposed guideline changes.&nbsp; The first,
proposed amendment #37, would correct an inequity in the current
guidelines regarding the weight assigned to marijuana plants, for
purposes of sentencing.&nbsp; Currenfly, if the offense involves less
than 50 marijuana plants, each plant is presumed to weigh 100
grams.&nbsp; However, if the offense, involves 50 plants or more,
each plant (including the first 49) is presumed to weigh one kilo
(1000 grams).&nbsp; This formula has created a &quot;sentencing
cliff&quot;-- causing an individual convicted of possessing 50
plants to receive a significantly longer sentence than an
individual convicted of possessing 49 or fewer plants; and an
individual convicted of possessing 100 plants (even if they are
seedlings) is sentenced the same as someone convicted of
distributing 100 kilos of bulk marijuana (although the 100
seedlings would not possibly produce anywhere near that amount of usable
marijuana). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller testified that the 100 gram per plant formula reflects
more accurately the actual potential yield from a single
marijuana plant, and urged the Commission to amend the guidelines
accordingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller also testified in favor of proposed guideline amendment
#42, regarding the treatment of wet marijuana (fleshly harvested
marijuana) for sentencing purposes.&nbsp; Currently the wet
marijuana is weighed as is, with the defendant receiving a longer
sentence under the current weight-driven guidelines.&nbsp; Under
the proposed amendment, when marijuana has a moisture content
sufficient to render it unusable without drying it, an
approximation of the weight without such excess moisture content
is to be used.&nbsp; Miller told the Commission they should be
looking at the usable amount of marijuana, rather than the bulk
amount -- for sentencing purposes generally -- and urged them to scale
back the penalties overall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, NORML Board member David Boaz, Executive Vice
President of the Cato Institute, testified on behalf of the
Institute regarding marijuana.&nbsp; Boaz pointed out to the Commission
that there were approximately 784 marijuana offenders convicted
in 1992 for whom the minimum guideline range was greater than the
applicable minimum mandatory sentence.&nbsp; &quot;The cost of
keeping those 784 people in prison for one year is
$16,310,000.&nbsp; If we estimate that they would average four
additional years in prison based on current guidelines, the
taxpayers would be paying more than $65 million in additional
costs for those prisoners...&nbsp; We would be better served by
keeping violent criminals in prison longer by freeing up beds now
used by marijuana offenders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other NORML witnesses included former Board member and
cultivation expert Ed Rosenthal of California, and NORML/BACH
activist Lennice Werth of Virginia (who uses marijuana as a medicine).&nbsp;
Rosenthal focused on the issue of the presumed weight of a
marijuana plant, and Werth urged the Commission to find a way in
the guidelines to accommodate those who cultivate marijuana for
medical use.&nbsp; These standout activists were joined by FAMM
Director Julie Stewart and the Drug Policy Foundation Legislative
Director Cheryl Epps.&nbsp; Also present, but not testifying, was
NORML Board member Keith Stroup. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The U.S. Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law
in 180 days unless the Congress enacts laws otherwise.&nbsp; For
more information on the U.S. Sentencing Commission hearings and
the time frame in which the Commission can act on NORML's
recommendations, contact the U.S. Sentencing Commission's office
of Public Relations at 202-275-4500.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Congressman Seeks To Halt Free-Speech
On Information Superhighway</b><br>
<b>(Or George Orwell Call Home)</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">October 6, Washington, D.C., prohibition fanatic U.S.
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-NY) extended his opposition
to any criticism of prohibition to include the Intemet.&nbsp; The following
are excerpts from an October 6 speech Rep. Solomon delivered on
the House floor: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my attention that
drug legalization advocates are using the electronic information
superhighway to organize the legalization movement and share information
on drug use.&nbsp; The information superhighway was certalnly not
created to propagate such misinformation and the criminal
activity associated with it.&nbsp; This use was brought to my attention
by drug legalization opponents who use the information
superhighway everyday in their vocations.&nbsp;
[Anti-prohibitionists don't use computers in their vocations?
-ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Apparently the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) recently entered remarks which I personally made in
opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an example
of 'rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.'&nbsp; Because I
believe, along with 95 percent of America [myth of consensus
-ed.], that the use of illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as
an enemy of drug users.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Speaker, I am
honored.&nbsp; <b><i>The use of illegal drugs is an anathema to
the social and moral fabric of our Nation</i></b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Pro-drug use and legalization messages on the information
superhighway through Internet are wrong...&nbsp; As more and more
Americans jump onto this latest technological advancement, more
and more citizens will have access to this ill-advised
information.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive Americans.&nbsp; As Congress reviews this very important technology
during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by pro-drug
organizations and individuals for the propagation of this ilk
must be addressed.&nbsp; <b><i>As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs</i></b>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director Richard Cowan comments:
&quot;Representative Solomon continues to demonstrate his fear of
free and open discussion.&nbsp; This is typical of the statist
mind-set.&nbsp; NORML believes that freedom has nothing to fear
from the truth--so it is appropriate that Solomon is running
scared.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>'Drug Peace' In the Middle East?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 14, The <i>Hayward Daily Review</i> reports that &quot;a
panel of experts Monday recommended that Israel's parliament ease
laws agalnst the use of marijuana and hashish.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana &quot;Kingpin&quot; Qualifies For </b><b><u>First</u></b><b>
Federal Execution In 32 Years</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 13, <i>Reuters</i> reports that U.S. authorities have
notified David Chandler, 42, that his death sentence will be
carried out March 30 in the first federal execution in 32 years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>Reuters</i>, Chandler was convicted in 1991 in
Alabama of hiring another individual to kill a member of his
marijuana smuggling ring who had become an informant.&nbsp;
Chandler is the first federal inmate to receive a death sentence
under the 1988 Omnibus Crime Bill.&nbsp; The federal Bureau of
Prisons sald five other inmates are awaiting execution under the
same drug kingpin law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Reuters</i> reports that prison officials acknowledged that
Chandler's execution, which would be carried out by lethal
injection, could be delayed by his filing of a new appeal. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[NORML <b><i><u>strongly</u></i></b> protests the potential
execution of David Chandler.&nbsp; Mr. Chandler should not be
exposed to an ill-conceived death penalty statute solely because
of his alleged role in a marijuana trafficking operation.&nbsp;
Executing this man, in the name of the 'Drug War', will not deter
or hinder a single nanogram's worth of &quot;drugs&quot; from
being cultivated, sold or consumed in the U.S.&nbsp; <u>So why do
it</u>?&nbsp; For more information on Mr. Chandler's dreadful
plight, contact the Alabama ACLU, Olivia Turner, 205-262-0304.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Founder of 'Our Church' Receives 10-Year
Sentence In Marijuana Case</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 11, <i>The Morning News</i> (of Northwest Arkansas)
reported that Tom Brown, the controversial founder and former
leader of Our Church, was sentenced in federal court to 10 years in
prison.&nbsp; Brown was also fined $17,500 and had 39 acres of
land forfeited to the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown asserts that the church uses marijuana as part of its
religious service. <i>The Morning News</i> reported that
&quot;Our Church and its members say they have a constitutional right
under freedom of religion to use [marijuana, as a form of
sacrament,] during their church services. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Brown] attempted to argue his case at the sentencing hearing,
but [U.S. District Judge] Waters wouldn't allow it.&nbsp; Brown,
disregarding Waters...said he would have been found innocent if
he had been allowed to argue that his religious freedom permitted
him to use marijuana in church services. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It was an invalid indictment, an invalid prosecution, an
invalid conviction,&quot; Brown said. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Legislation About To
'Disappear' From Colorado Law</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 6, The Colorado House effectively ended one of the
nation's first medical marijuana laws when it passed Senate Bill
95-1020.&nbsp; The official death of the medical marijuana law
will occur when Governor Roy Romer (D) signs the new bill --
which deletes older, &quot;obsolescent&quot; legislation -- into
law in the coming weeks. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;Dangerous Drugs Therapeutic Act&quot; which established
provisions for the disbursal of marijuana for medical purposes
has been on the books since 1979.&nbsp; However, due to the law's wording--which
necessitated approval from the National Cancer Institute, the FDA
and the DEA--reportedly no one ever received cannabis to smoke
during the program's 16-year existence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>[Conversely,] Missouri Senate To Consider
&quot;Medical Necessity&quot; Defense<br>
For Citizens Using Medicinal Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 28, The Missouri Senate agreed to hear Senate Bill
457, introduced by Sen. Joseph Moseley, which succinctly states: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    No criminal or civil penalty shall apply to any person for
    the act of possessing marijuana provided that requirements of
    the following two subdivisions of this section are met
    simultaneously: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    (1) A practitioner authorized to prescribe Schedule II
    controlled substances for human use certifies in writing that
    the person is under the professional care of the practitioner
    for a duly diagnosed condition; and <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    (2) The aforementioned practitioner certifies in writing that
    the person needs marijuana as part of a therapeutic regimen
    directed against the duly diagnosed condition.

<p align="center"><b>Texas Criminal Defense Attorney Indicted On
Marijuana Charges<br>
Goes On Hunger Strike To Protest Lack Of Marinol</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 23, The Beaumont Enterprise reported that a former
Jefferson County prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer is
protesting his marijuana-related arrest by refusing to eat solid
foods. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In what can only be described as a bizarre case, Alan D.
McLemore, 43, was arrested at his home February 8 on marijuana
cultivation and gun charges. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Background] McLemore has had a life long battle with clinical
depression.&nbsp; In time, McLemore received a prescription for
Marinol [synthetic marijuana pill -ed.].&nbsp; McLemore found that
Marinol not only stabilized his depression, it also curbed his
craving for alcohol.&nbsp; Due to the high cost and very limited
quantities of Marinol, McLemore supplemented medication with marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Finally able to lead a normal life, McLemore got a law degree,
became an assistant district attorney, and eventually opened his
own law office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon his arrest in February, McLemore, after posting bond,
returned to jail because he felt as though he could not honor the
judges order that he not consume marijuana while out on
bond.&nbsp; McLemore stated that he didn't want to have his
mother lose her home (McLemore's mother put her home up for the
$l00,000 bond) because of his desperate need for an effective
medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">During McLemore's hunger strike, he has lost as much as 25
pounds.&nbsp; McLemore, in an issued statement from jail,
reported by the <i>Beaumont Enterprise</i>, said, &quot;Uncaring
legislatures, that have been totally corrupted by money, have
denied me and millions of others the relief this wonderful plant
provides.&nbsp; I have no liberty; the pursuit of happiness has
been denied me; and life is therefore a burden that I'm anxious
to relinquish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Largest Drug Testing Company Reports A Steep
Decline In<br>
Positive Drug Tests -- Except MARIJUANA!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 6, SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories reported
that there has been a drastic reduction in the number of people
testing positive for drug use -- while at the same time, the rate
of positive test results for marijuana shot up. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SmithKline found that of more than 3.6 million drug tests
performed at their labs last year, 7.5 percent were positive for
drug use, a drop of 0.9 percentage points from 1993.&nbsp; Those
testing positive for marijuana use rose 7.2 percents to 47.1
percent of all positive tests.&nbsp; Second was cocaine at 23.9
percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Associated Press</i> reports that SmithK1ine Beecham said
&quot;a change in the screening threshold for marijuana required
by the Department of Transportation (DOT) could account for the increase
in positive tests for marijuana use.&nbsp; [<b>NORML</b>
agrees.&nbsp; Beginning on January 1, DOT regulations mandate
that the threshold for positive marijuana screen be lowered from
100ng to 50ng.&nbsp; Reducing the &quot;cut-off&quot; level by
50% readily explains why positive urinalysis' for marijuana went
up. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The survey isn't based on a scientific sampling of workers

<p align="center"><b>Head Of DEA Claims That The U.S. Is Losing
&quot;War On Drugs&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 9, The <i>Boston Herald</i> reported that the DEA's

hyped War on Drugs is a half-hearted campaign... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;No matter how much we seize, it doesn't seem to change the

chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Constantine went on to say that, &quot;<u>To use that euphemism
of a 'War on Drugs' or a 'War on Crime', </u><b><u>I have not
seen that yet</u></b><u>.</u>&quot;&nbsp; He further added,
&quot;When you have a war, that means as citizens--you make
sacrifices (harkening back to the World War II days of food
rationing and Gold Star mothers).&nbsp; <u>That's what I call a
war and it's a national will</u>.&quot;&nbsp; [emphasis added

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director, asked, &quot;Just what

Cannabis Buyers' Club</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 26, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> published a detailed
article on the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Francisco.&nbsp; The
following are selected excerpts; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This is a different kind of drug store...dozens of people sit on
rummage-sale couches and folding chairs, smoking high-grade
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is business as usual at the Cannabis Buyers' Club, a
flourishing illegal marijuana market rooted in civil
disobedience.&nbsp; But this is a club no rational person would
aspire to join.&nbsp; Doing your shopping here means you are sick
or dying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The underground pharmacy is part of a growing movement aimed at
gaining sick people the right to use marijuana.&nbsp; Across the
country thousands of patients with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis and other illnesses defy the law daily to
treat their ailments or ease their pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In San Francisco, long known for its tolerance, authorities have
chosen to ignore the law, saying that sick people who can benefit
from the plant should be able to buy it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">'I have no problem whatsoever with the use of marijuana for
medical purposes,&quot; said [San Francisco] Mayor Frank Jordan,
a former police chief.&nbsp; &quot;I am sensitive and
compassionate to people who have legitimate needs.&nbsp; <u>We
should bend the law and do what's right</u>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[In opposing the use of marijuana as medicine] Mike Heald, Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman, said marijuana is strictly
controlled because the public does not believe that smoking it is
proper behavior.&nbsp; [Mr. Heald is enveloped in the &quot;myth
of consensus&quot; -ed.] He said marijuana, like alcohol and
tobacco, is a &quot;gateway&quot; substance that leads to the use
of hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD -- a contention
disputed by marijuana advocates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The club was founded in 1991, and more than 3,000 people bearing
notes from their doctors have flocked to the...club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Some that have claimed to have benefited from the club] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* AIDS patient Jon Bush gained 30 pounds in the past six months
[with the use of marijuana] <br>

Support Medical Marijuana Research</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 21, Three prominent state senators from Iowa sent a
letter to Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) prodding him to pressure the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allow a long
delayed medical study of the therapeutic effects of marijuana on
patients with AIDS.&nbsp; [This letter is representative of the
numerous letters that have been sent by elected state officials
all over the U.S. to federal representatives and officials within
the government.&nbsp; To date, 36 states have passed legislation
expressing their desire to see marijuana be made more readily
available for patients coping with life and/or sense-threatening
diseases or ailments.&nbsp; The problem is a recalcitrant and
unresponsive federal bureaucracy. -ed.] A selected excerpt of the
IA state senators letter follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are respectfully asking that you consider contacting Dr.
Philip Lee, Asst. Sec. for HHS, and express your support for
allowing the first research project concerning medical marijuana
in over a decade.&nbsp; Our only objective is to find out exactly
how safe and effective marijuana is in treating glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, AIDS and AIDS-related wasting syndrome, and
cancer.&nbsp; Many patients in Iowa, as well as the rest of the
United States, are eagerly anticipating the results from Dr.
Abrams' study [the long delayed study -ed.], and we ask that you
encourage this to happen.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>Liberty Lovers -- Beware The Ides Of March!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Excerpts from FIJA release] On March 15, wholesale florist
Yvonne Regas of Sparks, NV will be arraigned in U.S. District
Court in Reno, on charges of (1) Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; (2)
Aiding and abetting Obstruction of Justice; and (3) Jury
Tampering. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Before deciding that such dastardly behavior deserves swift, sure
punishment -- such as the three to six years in prison this could
cost Ms. Regas, if convicted -- consider what she actually did:
she and a few friends put brochures published by Fully Informed
Jury Association (FIJA) under the wiper blades of cars parked
near the courthouse, during the trial of her son and ex-husband,
among others, on drug charges.&nbsp; That's it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">These brochures -- which have been distributed similarly by
untold numbers of people at hundreds of court houses around the
country over the past five years -- explain the rights, powers, and
responsibilities of trial jurors.&nbsp; Often, the brochures are
handed to all who enter the court house. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The point of the leafleting has been to advise jurors that they
possess the power to judge the law itself, and not just &quot;the
facts&quot;, as most modern jury instruction insist.&nbsp;
&quot;Jury nullification of law&quot; means that &quot;the
governed -- if informed of their power as jurors -- can
&quot;just say no&quot; to bad laws, and thereby check and
balance the government.&nbsp; [It is for this reason that NORML
supports the efforts of FIJA. Just imagine if every juror in a
marijuana-related case knew that they possess the power and
authority to nullify &quot;bad law&quot;.&nbsp; Is it possible
that there would be a marked reduction in criminal convictions
for marijuana-related &quot;crimes&quot;?&nbsp; Further, would
the government then realize that they've been operating under the
`myth of consensus' and substantively amend the law? -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Regas case has attracted some of the nation's premier
constitutional lawyers: Dr. Nancy Lord, Larry Becraft, and
(possibly) Jonathan Emord.&nbsp; They see this as a watershed
case for both the First and Sixth Amendments, and believe that
conviction of Ms. Regas could result in erosion of the rest of
the Bill of Rights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Regas is convicted, Nancy Lord fears it could also lead to
prosecutions [and certainly intimidation -ed.] of FIJA activists
around the country. </p>

<p>[To find out more about the Regas case, contact <b>LAWYERS FOR
LIBERTY</b>, c/o Nancy Lord, 1718 Peachtree St. NW, ste. 499,
Atlanta, GA 30309 or call 404-963-6932.&nbsp; For further information

<p align="center">February 23, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Watch International And The DEA Combine
Forces To Kill<br>
Colorado Hemp Bill With Two Powerful Weapons: Lies And Threats</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Denver, CO, Colorado's Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Energy voted down Senate Bill
132, the Colorado Hemp Production Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by state senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
sought to 1.) establish a commission to study hemp as a cash crop
and the federal laws governing hemp cultivation [Similar to the
commission recently established by Kentucky's governor. -ed.],
and 2.) create a 'vehicle' for the establishment of a legal hemp
industry in Colorado.&nbsp; The measures were voted down 4-3 and 6-1
respectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While it is unfortunate that the citizens of Colorado are
temporarily unable to enjoy the economic benefits of a legal hemp
industry, the most disturbing aspect of these hearings was the apparent
impact of testimony provided by The Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) and Drug Watch International (DWI)
[prohibitionist organization -ed.]. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, DWI representative Beverly Kinard gave bizarre testimony
that included wild misrepresentations about hemp production, the
health effects associated with marijuana use and the groups and
individuals who advocate changing the laws governing marijuana.
Some of Mrs. Kinard's more notable direct quotes follow: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Dutch National Board of Drug Prevention is extremely
    concerned because even with low THC marijuana, high
    concentrations of THC may be produced in some organs.&nbsp;
    [There is no such office entitled the &quot;Dutch National Board
    of Drug Prevention&quot;. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Legalizing drugs in the Netherlands brought the crime rate
    up 400%.&nbsp; [&quot;Drugs&quot; are not legal in Holland
    and the violent crime rate has declined over The last 12 years.
    -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Hemp oil [derived from marijuana seeds -ed.] causes skin
    cancer overnight on laboratory rats.&nbsp; [Hemp seed oil is
    sold in health food stores. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Marijuana affects every cell, every system and every organ
    in the body. The mental disorders include acute toxic
    psychosis, panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions,
    depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia, depression and UNCONTROLLABLE
    HOSTILITY.&nbsp; [Emphasis not added!&nbsp; If so, why has violent
    crime declined in Holland? -ed.] 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While NORML contends that nearly all of Mrs. Kinard's testimony
was nonsensical, the DEA proved DWI one better.&nbsp; Special
Agent in Charge of the DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division, Philip
W. Perry, testified that the DEA strongly opposes any
democratically-inspired challenges to their supreme control of
marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; In his written testimony, Agent
Perry asserts that &quot;In cases where federal and state law are
in opposition, the question of which law would control is well
settled.&quot;&nbsp; Agent Perry felt it necessary to reiterate
for the committee: &quot;Let us be clear that what we are talking
about in this Bill is marijuana.&nbsp; Calling it
&quot;hemp&quot; on the basis of an artificial threshold level of
psychoactive ingredient does not erase the fact that it is
botanically and legally the same plant.&quot;&nbsp; [Yes, that is
exactly the point! -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Agent Perry concluded by forcefully reasserting the federal
government's recalcitrant position regarding hemp and even more
bizarre, his interpretation of the parental-like role of federal
law enforcement: &quot;Although I am not an expert in the
economics of crop production [question: why then are you
testifying in an agriculture committee hearing? -ed.]...With 31
years of service in law enforcement...I can tell you, in my
professional opinion, this legislation is no more than a shallow ruse
being advanced by those who seek to legalize marijuana.&nbsp; The
people of Colorado deserve to be protected from this sort of
subterfuge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such
protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's
command.&quot; [Emphasis added. -ed.] 

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on this legislative debacle, including
copies of the DWI and DEA's tendentious written testimonies,
please contact Allen St. Pierre, NORML, 202-483-5500.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>DEA's Next Target: Hawaii</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 13, Kailua-Kona, In a letter from the mayor of Hawaii
County to the DEA, Mayor Stephen K. Yamashiro's executive
assistant asserted that the Mayor is totally supportive of hemp activist
Roger Christie's efforts to establish a legal hemp industry on
Hawaii. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Executive Assistant R.B. Legaspi writes, in part, that Mr.
Christie has secured the Mayor's endorsement and that &quot;The
Mayor [has] offered the use of county lands for an experimental
project growing low grade hemp for commercial purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his letter, Mr. Legaspi pointed out to the DEA that this past
June 7, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919, which
amongst other things, recognizes hemp as a &quot;Food
Resource&quot;. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter concludes with a reiteration, &quot;Mayor Yamashiro
does endorse...the cultivation of hemp and its conversion to
products useful to mankind.&quot;&nbsp; [Editor's note: Despite
the Mayor's pragmatism and support, the County of Hawaii is not
going to be able to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The DEA will
likely employ the same heavy-handed tactics that it successfully
used in the above cited case in Colorado and deny Mr. Christie
his permit needed to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The disproportional
level of influence and power the DEA asserts over
democratically-elected local and state officials is a clear
violation of the 9th and 10th Amendments.] </p>

production, please contact either activist Roger Christie,

<p align="center"><b>Top U.S. General Says The U.S.'s
Multibillion - Dollar 'Drug War'<br>
Has Accomplished Little</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, The Associated Press (AP) reported that Gen.
Barry R. McCafferey recently told law makers that despite a well
organized and costly-counter-drug operation, &quot;these current
efforts are not achieving their purpose. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;A multiyear effort involving substantial resources and
enormous energy and creativity,&quot; McCafferey said, &quot;has
not had the effects we desired.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">AP reports that McCafferey portrayed an insatiable drug market
able to adapt to law enforcement agencies by quickly changing
drug routes and methods of production. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gen. McCafferey acknowledged the difficulty of tackling the drug
problem, but like any true believer he concluded: &quot;I Think
part of the problem has been our decision to call it a war...I
prefer to think of it as a cancer.&nbsp; I don't think about
achieving victory but about dealing with the problem.&quot;&nbsp;
[NORML's National Director Richard Cowan's comment: &quot;With
this kind of mentality, America will always be engaged in a
&quot;drug war&quot; until we die of the cancer of prohibition
-ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>The New York Times Magazine Runs A Very High
Times-Type Article</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 19, The <i>New York Times Magazine</i> ran a lengthy
cover article entitled &quot;Marijuana in the 90's&quot;.&nbsp;
The article examined indoor marijuana cultivation from the point
of view of an avid gardener [Writer Michael Pollan is Harper

<p align="center"><b>Michigan Lawyer Still Being Persecuted By
The Feds<br>
After Serving Eight Months In Prison For </b><b><u>ONE</u></b><b>
Joint!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Bay City, Michigan, in the latest twist in a
federal marijuana case involving attorney Edward Czuprynski, the
full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, all fifteen
judges, ruled <i>en banc</i> that a search of Czuprynski's law
office and home was constitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski was federally indicted in May, 1992 for 1.6 grams of
marijuana [about a joint -ed.].&nbsp; Following a trial, he was
sentenced to serve a whopping 14 months in a federal penitentiary.&nbsp;
After eight months, however, a panel of three judges on the U.S.
Court of Appeals ordered Czuprynski's release from prison in July
of 1993 and ruled in his favor four months later on constitutional
grounds, the first of seven issues Czuprynski raised on appeal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon the government's appeal, the full court's recent decision
examined only one raised constitutional issue and sent the case
back to the original three judge panel to review and rule on the
remaining six issues. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the 11-4 split decision, the dissenting justices commented
that they &quot;can not condone the type of prosecutorial
overkill that has taken place here,&quot; adding that &quot;it
only points out the great expense of this court's time and
resources in hearing a case <i>en banc</i> [which involves] such
an insignificant amount of marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski said he is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court and has secured the commitment from the American Civil
Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild to support his
effort. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski commented that &quot;I may have lost the latest
battle, but I'm confident I'll win this war,&quot; adding that,
&quot;the conviction against me resulted from a real railroading
that trampled all over my rights.&quot; </p>

a joint so that the clip would meet our standards guidelines.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Pot Case Could Set Precedent In Kansas</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 3, The <i>Topeka Capital-Journal</i> reported on the
conviction of two Douglas County residents suspected of watering
172 marijuana plants.&nbsp; The defendants Nancy Hadley and
Michael Wyman were charged with multiple felonies [including
intent to distribute, conspiracy, etc...] that could have yielded
them more than 40 years in prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wyman's attorney, Pedro Irigonegaray, commented that the
defendant was willing to admit to the possession charge, but not
to the multiple charges for distribution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML National Legal Committee (NLC) member William K. Rork</b>,
Hadley's attorney, asserted that the government erred in
assigning the potential weight of the 172 plants at 840 pounds. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rork and Irigonegaray called upon <i>High Times</i> editor Ed
Rosenthal, an expert on cannabis cultivation, to refute the
government's assertion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rosenthal testified that 1.) the total bud yield from the 172
plants when mature would have been approximately 9.6 pounds and,
2.) the shelf life of marijuana is indefinite if frozen.&nbsp;
Therefore, the defendants were able to effectively claim that the
marijuana they were alleged to possess was compatible with
personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The jury agreed.&nbsp; Hadley and Wyman will likely receive
probation on two misdemeanor charges according to Irigonegaray. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Capital-Journal</i> reports that one officer said this
case sets a dangerous precedent [For law enforcement! -ed.]. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If anyone doubts the importance of the role played by
marijuana prohibition in undermining the Constitution, consider
the case currently before the Supreme Court, <u>Arizona v. Evans</u> (#93-1660).&nbsp;
The case at bar, which threatens the Fourth Amendment
requirements of a valid warrant, involves an arrest for
possession of &quot;a baggie&quot; of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Because marijuana is so widely used by so many Americans, the
enforcement of prohibition frequently brings up constitutional
challenges that impact the lives of all non-violent citizens. </p>

With </b><b><i>The National Review</i></b> </p>

<p>I.)&nbsp; February 8, <i>USA Today</i> ran an editorial in
response to the Clinton administration's request for an increase
in &quot;drug warring&quot; funds.&nbsp; Selected excerpts from
the editorial follow: </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Something just doesn't make sense about the USA's drug
war.&nbsp; It's like no one wants to win.&nbsp; Tuesday, the
Clinton administration paraded out a new drug fighting plan for
1996.&nbsp; It proposes spending a record $14.6 billion -- $1.3
billion more than this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Federal and state governments have spent $250 billion trying to
&quot;control drugs&quot; in the past 15 years, with the bulk of
the money going to law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-And still, Congress appears dissatisfied.&nbsp; Preening for his
presidential bid, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says the Clinton
administration drug policy &quot;is still based on the
blame-the-society-first approach to crime and punishment.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    <i>That's a great sound bite.&nbsp; But it ignores the facts.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    <i>And as long as politicians continue to do that, the nation
    will continue to lose the war on drugs.</i>&nbsp; [emphasis
    added -ed.] 
</blockquote>

<p>II.)&nbsp; February 20, <i>The National Review</i>'s &quot;The
Week&quot; editorial section observed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    After campaigning as a tough-on-crime conservative, New York
    Governor George Pataki wants to cut sentences for drug
    dealers.&nbsp; There is no contradiction here.&nbsp; To
    fulfill his promise of keeping violent criminals locked up
    longer, Governor Pataki needs to free up prison space
    increasingly occupied by non-violent drug offenders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    ... Resources that could be used to incapacitate robbers,
    rapists, and murderers are instead used to imprison
    small-time drug dealers [and individuals who simply possessed
    small amounts of contraband --ed.].&nbsp; Pataki has
    recognized the recklessness of this policy.&nbsp; <i>Will
    Congress</i>?&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.]

Assignment: </b><b><u>Study The Drug War And Make<br>
Recommendations</u></b><b> -- The Jury's in -- Their
Recommendation:<br>
</b><font size="4"><b>Decriminalize Marijuana!</b></font> 

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 9, The following are selected excerpts from the <i>Baltimore
Sun</i>'s front page article: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -In a report meant to rekindle debate over drug policy, a
    Baltimore grand jury suggests that marijuana be
    &quot;decriminalized&quot;... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -&quot;It is time to take a very serious look at the drug
    problem in Baltimore City.&nbsp; Removing the profit from the
    drug trade maybe the only way to resolve it,&quot; says the report
    from the grand jury, which was assigned by a judge to study
    drug legalization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The grand jury says striking down laws against possessing
    small amounts of marijuana is an &quot;honest response&quot;
    to a finding that authorities seldom enforce such laws. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The report was hailed by Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who since 1988
    has advocated a national debate on alternative approaches to
    fighting drugs.&nbsp; &quot;I was pleased they came down on
    the side of making the war on drugs more of a public health
    war rather than a criminal justice war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -When the grand jury was sworn in for a four-month term on
    Sept. 12, Baltimore Circuit Judge Joseph P. McCurdy Jr. told
    it to look into the issue of drug decriminalization.&nbsp;
    &quot;<u>Many of us feel that the war on drugs has not
    succeeded, that we are losing ground with each passing day,
    that we are wasting resources and that we have to look at
    this problem anew</u>,&quot; he said.&nbsp; [Amen. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    David C. Condliffe, executive director of the Drug Policy
    Foundation, praised Baltimore as a city on the cutting edge
    of a &quot;sane&quot; drug policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    He noted that the Clinton administration yesterday announced
    a policy that shifts a larger percentage of drug fighting
    money away from treatment and prevention, and toward law
    enforcement.&nbsp; Pointing to the grand jury report, he said,
    &quot;Washington is simply out of step with the
    citizens.&quot;&nbsp; [NORML concurs -ed.]

<p align="center"><b>French Commission Narrowly Votes To
&quot;Decriminalize&quot; Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 4, <i>Le Monde</i> reports that members of the
Henrion commission, appointed in March by Simone Veil, Minister
of Social Affairs, Health and Cities, to study a 1970 law
concerning the criminal penalties for drug possession in France,
have made some remarkable observations and recommendations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commission was asked whether the distinction between hard and
soft drugs should be upheld.&nbsp; According, to <i>Le Monde</i>
&quot;the commission judged that 'one can simply state that drugs
are more or less dangerous,' cannabis and its derivatives
(marijuana, hash, hash oil) being classified among the least
dangerous.&nbsp; By a close vote (9 out of 17), a majority
favorable to the decriminalization of the use and possession of
small amounts of quantities emerged.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Le Monde</i> reports that there are varying estimates of how
many French citizens consume marijuana.&nbsp; The government
estimates 1 to 3 million users, while Sofres estimates a range of
4 to 5 million marijuana consumers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members supporting marijuana decriminalization purposed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana prior to the age of
    16. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana in public places. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strengthening the laws against driving while intoxicated on
    marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Creating misdemeanor laws dealing with individuals under the
    influence of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strictly banning the use of marijuana by public safety
    professionals (e.g.: flight controllers, high speed train
    operators, airline pilots, etc...) 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members of the commission that favor changing the laws
went on to further state &quot;<b><u>If there is no deterioration
in the situation over the next two years, one could then envisage true,
regulated commerce under strict control of the State</u></b>,&quot;
according to <i>Le Monde</i>.&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.]

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>European Parliament
Commission Favors Legalization of Cannabis</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recognizing the success of the Dutch policy of separating
marijuana from hard drugs, The European Parliamentary Commission
on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs voted Monday for &quot;cannabis
decriminalization.&quot;&nbsp; The full European Parliament is
expected to vote on this recommendation later in February.&nbsp;
Usually the parliament follows the recommendation of the relevant
commissions, but the United States is expected to bring maximum
pressure to prevent the replication of the Dutch success in
separating cannabis from hard drugs. </p>

<p>(For more information contact the European Parliamentary
Commission on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs in Brussels.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Drug Czar and Partnership For
A Drug-Free (sic) America<br>
Hold a Closed -- by Invitation Only -- &quot;Briefing&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Washington -- At the last minute, it was decided that a
&quot;briefing&quot; held this afternoon at the Old Executive
Office Building adjacent to the White House by Drug Czar Lee
Brown and James Burke, Chairman of the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America and the former CEO of pharmaceutical giant
Johnson and Johnson, was &quot;by invitation only.&quot;&nbsp;
This may have been done because of embarrassing questions having
been asked at their New York press conference on January
16.&nbsp; Consequently, the media were excluded from the
Washington version.&nbsp; This is unusual in Washington, where
media attendance at such &quot;briefings&quot; is generally
encouraged. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the New York meeting the Partnership announced a series of new
radio and television and print ads which American media are now
running as a part of their support for the continuing arrest of
millions of Americans for using marijuana.&nbsp; That briefing,
like the ads, warned about the horrifying dangers of the
marijuana crisis now sweeping America and causing terror in our
streets, the main drug concern of both the White House and the
Partnership.&nbsp; The purpose of the briefings -- and the
apparent reason for their being by invitation only -- seems to be
the growing panic among prohibitionists about being asked
critical questions.&nbsp; The media have so seldom been critical of
any claims about marijuana made by the Partnership or the Drug
Czar's office that the prohibitionists have not yet developed a
strategy for answering them.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, it may
have been decided not to risk having anyone present who might
disrupt the meeting by asking questions. </p>

<p>(Please do not call either the Drug Czar's office at
202-395-6618 or especially the Partnership at 212-922-1560 and
ask them any questions.&nbsp; That sort of thing just upsets
them.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Maine Governor Ends
Helicopter Marijuana Searches</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On February 1 the Associated Press reported that Maine
Governor Angus King is discontinuing helicopter flights searching
for marijuana growing in rural areas of Maine.&nbsp; Governor King
said the flights were &quot;too expensive for the return.&nbsp; I
think it's intrusive.&quot;&nbsp; The Maine Civil Liberties
Union, which has represented four Maine families who objected to
the invasion of their privacy by flights -- in which no marijuana
was found -- hailed the Governor's action. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The AP story reporting the Governor's action quoted an anonymous
undercover agent as saying that an anonymous &quot;marijuana
trafficker&quot; had told him that anonymous &quot;local growers
had increased their yield substantially in 1994 in response to a
cessation in flights.&quot;&nbsp; Presumably the AP was unable to
find any anonymous supporters of privacy rights to quote
anonymous victims of the overflights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML has published a special report on the role of the National
Guard in domestic marijuana eradication including the extensive
use of helicopters in both urban and rural areas. </p>

<p>(For copies of this NORML Report contact Allen St. Pierre at
NORML -- 202-483-5500.&nbsp; For more information on Governor
King's decision to cancel helicopter overflights for marijuana cultivation
contact Maine Civil Liberties Union Legal Counsel, Christopher
Branson at 207-773-5651.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Chief Coroner of Canadian
Province of British Columbia Calls for Consideration of
Legalizing Cannabis.</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>The Vancouver Sun Times</i> reported in a January 21 story
that Vince Cain, the chief coroner of British Columbia, said that
&quot;the so-called war on drugs which is conducted by the
criminal justice system can only be regarded as an expensive
failure.&quot;&nbsp; Cain went on to say that &quot;Police officers
have told me they're wasting their time on this social
issue.&quot;&nbsp; These comments came in a report entitled <i>Illicit
Narcotic Overdose Deaths in B.C.</i> published by the British
Columbia provincial government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, Cain used the
report to urge that the provincial Attorney General consider
legalizing the sale of marijuana.&nbsp; The report was discussed further
Tuesday at a meeting of provincial and federal law enforcement
officials.&nbsp; A senior Royal Canadian Mounted Police rejected
the report saying, &quot;we want a drug free society.&quot;&nbsp;
He then went on to say that the vast majority of Canadians have
used alcohol and tobacco. </p>

<p>(Chief coroner Cain can be reached at 604-660-7737.&nbsp; The
B. C. Attorney General can be reached at 604-387-5008.) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Kentucky Governor Creates
&quot;Hemp Fiber Crop Task Force&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones, reversing his previous
position on hemp cultivation, has created a special task force to
study the restoration of what once was one of Kentucky's most important
legal crops.&nbsp; (Illegal marijuana is currently the most
valuable cash crop in Kentucky.)&nbsp; In the late 19th century,
Kentucky produced more than 90% of the nation's hemp, which is
also the marijuana plant.&nbsp; This action has long been urged
by former NORML Board member and Kentucky Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is possible to grow varieties of hemp that have virtually no
psychoactive ingredients.&nbsp; It is generally recognized as one
of the most versatile agricultural plants, and it is cultivated
for non-drug purposes in China and most of Europe.&nbsp; There is
a strong demand for hemp fiber for clothing in America, but The
Drug Enforcement Administration opposes its cultivation in the
United States because it would send the wrong message: that
American farmers have been kept from growing an agricultural
staple as part of the propaganda campaign for marijuana
prohibition. </p>

<p>(For more information on the Hemp Fiber Taskforce call Jim
Claycomb at 502-564-2611) </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>At Last, an O. J. Simpson
Marijuana Story (almost)</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On January 20, <i>New York Newsday</i>, in a cover story,
reported that new NORML Board Member and 1993 Nobel Laureate, Dr.
Kary Mullis, the inventor of DNA testing, has said that he would
testify that he &quot;wouldn't rely on the tiny blood samples
collected as solid proof of anyone's guilt.&quot;&nbsp; Now, if
O. J. would just read <i>Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine</i>
(Yale University Press) co-authored by NORML Board Chairman,
Lester Grinspoon, M. D. of Harvard, perhaps the book would be
reviewed and someone might report on the arrest of sick and dying
Americans as a part of the suppression of medical access to
cannabis. </p>

<p align="center">January 26, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Dutch Justice Minister Wants
to &quot;Regulate&quot; Marijuana Supply</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a January 21 interview with the Dutch newspaper <i>De
Volkskrant</i> (The People's Newspaper) published in The Hague,
the capital of The Netherlands, the Dutch Minister of Justice, Mrs.
Winnie Sorgdrager, said she wants to &quot;regulate the supply of
cannabis products&quot; being sold in more than 1,300 coffeeshops
around the country. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article explained that Sorgdrager is following her party's
opinion &quot;that the current policy allowing retail sale of
marijuana and hashish has to have its <u>logical sequel in
arranging the supply of the products...&quot;</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dutch policy is that &quot;the sale of cannabis products at
the 'frontdoor' of the coffeeshops is tolerated by the Justice
ministry but the supply at the 'back door', or even more, large
scale production, are strictly prohibited.&nbsp; Criminals have
therefore taken over that part of the market.&quot;&nbsp; Sorgdrager
said that she believes that &quot;we have to dispose of this
hypocrisy about that back and front door.&quot;&nbsp; She is
working with her colleagues in the Health Ministry on a Drug
Report to be issued this summer. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Most of the hashish sold is still imported (smuggled in), but
most of the marijuana is now grown in the Netherlands.&nbsp; The
smuggling is especially dominated by violence-prone gangs from
North Africa and Lebanon.&nbsp; The article goes on to explain
that &quot;Sorgdrager is seriously considering a division and
regulation of the cannabis market....&quot; separating the
domestic cannabis from imported hashish smuggled in by criminals
from abroad.&nbsp; The objective is to create a means of
supplying the Dutch market while preventing exports. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch have followed the current policy for many years, so
if there were any serious social or individual health problems
associated with cannabis use, it would have become obvious by now.&nbsp;
It is also worth noting that, until recently, most of the
cannabis consumed was imported hashish which is much more potent
than most marijuana.&nbsp; This means that the &quot;new potent marijuana&quot;
line pushed by the DEA has no relevance to the Dutch experience
or to the supposed threat posed to America by the average
marijuana consumed today which -- according to the U.S. National
Institute on Drug Abuse -- is between 3 and 4%, far below the
average for hashish. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article also explained that Sorgdrager does not want to
use the terms &quot;liberalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot;
but prefers to use the term &quot;regulation.&quot;&nbsp; The
Dutch have long been pressured by France, Belgium and the United
States to arrest marijuana users, but the Germans, Swiss and others
in Europe are moving toward the Dutch model.&nbsp; The Dutch
policy generally is to try to reduce the level of violence in
their country, which nationwide has about half as many murders as does
Washington, D.C., alone.&nbsp; Amsterdam is slightly larger than
Washington, but has less than one tenth the number of murders. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On January 12th, NORML carried an exclusive report on the
protests by the Dutch government to the United States concerning
misrepresentations by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
regarding Dutch drug policies and their social
consequences.&nbsp; The DEA has not yet responded.&nbsp; The
statement by the Dutch Justice Minister has also been ignored by
the American media, while <i><u>The Wall Street Journal</u></i>
ran an editorial today entitled &quot;Eighth Grade
Potheads.&quot;&nbsp; If the editorial's hysteria was well
founded The Netherlands should resemble the United States, Bosnia,
or some other violence ridden society and should have a very high
rate of marijuana use and hard drug addiction.&nbsp; <u>Just the
opposite is the case.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While American prohibitionists commonly claim that &quot;the
Dutch legalized drugs and it did not work,&quot; in fact all
drugs remain illegal in The Netherlands.&nbsp; As is the case in
the U.S., most Dutch &quot;drug related&quot; violence is the
result of prohibition, not of the drugs themselves -- except for
alcohol -- again as in the U.S.&nbsp; While it is Dutch policy to
tolerate the small scale sale and possession of cannabis, -- and
no one is arrested for the possession of personal amounts of any
other drug -- the sale of hard drugs is vigorously
prosecuted.&nbsp; Any &quot;cannabis coffeeshop&quot; which is
suspected of selling hard drugs is closed immediately.&nbsp; <u>One
of the primary objectives of the &quot;coffeeshop&quot; policy is
to separate cannabis from the hard drugs.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This policy has been very successful, hence the DEA opposition
to it. Maintaining the connection between marijuana and hard
drugs is a vital component of U.S. drug policy.&nbsp; This is the basis
for the claims that marijuana is a &quot;stepping stone&quot;,
&quot;threshold&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot; to using other drugs.&nbsp;
The success of Dutch policy demonstrates that this is just the
opposite of the truth, so the Dutch policy must be misrepresented
until they can be pressured into merging the drug markets through
blanket prohibition as has been done in the U.S. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In fact, very few marijuana users in America ever become hard
drug users, but the ratio is even lower in The Netherlands.&nbsp;
Ironically, <u>marijuana use by Dutch teenagers is much lower
than in the U.S.&nbsp; Over 30% of U.S. high school seniors have
used marijuana in the last year, while only 12% of Dutch 18 year
olds have ever used cannabis</u>.&nbsp; It is Dutch policy to
strongly discourage teenage cannabis use through honest drug
education that is credible and effective -- because it does not exaggerate
in order to frighten politicians, editorialists and other
impressionable subgroups. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, announced today
that NORML will begin a program to encourage American opinion
leaders -- and ordinary citizens -- to visit The Netherlands to
see for themselves the success of Dutch cannabis policy.&nbsp;
&quot;When Americans ask what would happen if we legalized
marijuana, they don't have to use their imaginations to find
out.&nbsp; They can just use their passports.&nbsp; Americans
certainly don't need to go to Holland to get marijuana, but they
should go to Holland to be reminded of what we all used to know:
FREEDOM WORKS.&quot; </p>

with three long-term sentences he felt forced to make in recent

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Curtin, citing restrictive sentencing guidelines in federal drug

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>Judge Curtin also told </u><i><u>The Buffalo News</u></i><u>
that, &quot;He ... feels Congress should take a close look at the

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since May 1993, an estimated 50 senior federal judges (out of 849

&quot;Boycotting&quot; judges have cited excessive punishment via

declining to hear drug cases. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Curtin told <i>The Buffalo News</i> that the bigger issue is that
today's anti-drug program isn't working.&nbsp; He said he would
rather see the federal government spend more money on education, counseling,

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 11, Atlanta, Georgia, In the tradition of Live Aid and

HEMP AID - a Benefit for the Re-legalization of Marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">James Bell (Founder of Georgia NORML) and Theresa Yarbrough,
current Director of GA NORML, hope that the First Annual event
will not only raise consciousness of the impact that marijuana
prohibition has on the lives of millions of Americans, but that
it will also raise much needed cash which will be used to fight
legal battles and help to secure the freedom of marijuana prisoners. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bell knows the impact of the marijuana laws.&nbsp; He's presently
finishing a two year sentence in a Georgia Prison Work Camp (for
the sale of few ounces of marijuana). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Yarbrough learned the peculiar and excessive effects of marijuana
prohibition when she was arrested in 1993 for possession of one
pound of marijuana in her home.&nbsp; Later convicted, she was sentenced
to ten years probation and banished from residing in GA's
District 31 -- <u>removed from her community for possessing
marijuana</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both activists have been instrumental in organizing some of the
largest pro-hemp events.&nbsp; The two organizers want it to be
known that 1.) HEMP AID is not intended to be a 'Let's smoke pot event'

to secure a national head-line rock group for the First Annual

its effects: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: If they put you in charge of the war on drugs,
what would you do? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: Legalize Marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: And then? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: And then we would save an enormous amount of
taxpayer money, specifically on the penal system, which is
overloaded with marijuana abusers.&nbsp; It's unbelievable.&nbsp;
When I did the <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>, every guard I talked
with who had worked in a prison had this opinion: Legalize
marijuana.&nbsp; There's no reason these kids should be here.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is just like any other thing that might not be good for
you.&nbsp; If you do too much of it, it can screw up your
life.&nbsp; But it [marijuana -- ed.] can't screw up your life
like cocaine or heroin or downs or ups or LSD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: Is this an admission that you still smoke pot --
or was that just a phase you went through as a kid? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: I take the Fifth.&nbsp; Considering the fact that
it's still illegal ... put it this way: Considering the fact that
I've used it in the past, and know what it is, and seen the
results of it, I don't view it as a dangerous drug.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But I don't want to advocate anything like [smoking pot] in
print, because it's a different thing for different people.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: So what would you say if your kids came to you
one day and said: &quot;Dad, did you ever take drugs in the
Sixties and Seventies?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: I would say, &quot;No, it was the
Eighties.&quot;&nbsp; Yeah, I would be honest with them.&nbsp;
And I'd tell them exactly what each drug does to you. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: You realize that, having admitted these things
now, you've just disqualified yourself from being a Supreme Court
justice or the attorney general. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: Well, I didn't say I inhaled. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Dutch Minister of Foreign
Affairs Takes Issue With DEA<br>
Briefing Paper That Slanders Dutch Dutch Policy</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 9, The Hague, The
Netherlands.&nbsp; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hans van Mierlo
criticized the United States Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) for misrepresenting the commitment of the Dutch government
to enforce drug law violations, for misrepresenting the
prevalence of cocaine consumed by the citizens of the city of
Rotterdam, and for generally misrepresenting Dutch drug policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the request of a Member of
the Dutch Parliament, Minister van Mierlo responded to a recently
released DEA briefing paper entitled, &quot;<u>How to Hold Your
Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</u>&quot; [NORML Weekly News
Release, 11/3/94): The entire letter follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;The Minister will point out to
    the American Authorities that Dutch drug policy is falsely
    represented in a manual of the American Drug Battle Agency
    [DEA --ed.].&nbsp; The manual mentions that the police in the Netherlands
    are instructed not to take action against the street trade of any
    drug.&nbsp; That is not true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In many municipalities in
    the Netherlands, the policing and prosecution of street
    traders of drugs is a high priority.&nbsp; Special cell space
    is reserved for that purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Furthermore, according to
    the DEA manual, a study of the entire Rotterdam population of
    individuals fifteen years and older showed that 3.3% of this
    population uses cocaine.&nbsp; What the research showed was that
    3.3% of the entire population of Rotterdam between fifteen to nineteen
    years old mentioned that they had used cocaine [emphasis added
    - ed.].&nbsp; It is totally irresponsible to state that all
    of these people are cocaine users and ridiculous to relate
    the figures to the total Rotterdam population. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, data in the manual
    is not all wrong, but stripped of their context and therefore
    easily misinterpreted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The mistakes made will be
    discussed with the American Authorities by the Minister of
    Foreign Affairs.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Richard Cowan, NORML National
Director, said that &quot;NORML is proud to have brought this
matter to the attention of the Dutch government.&nbsp; The
Netherlands is one of America's oldest allies.&nbsp; John Paul
Jones refitted his ships with Dutch supplies, including hemp rope
and sails, during the American Revolution and wrote movingly of the
kindness of the Dutch people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML believes that the DEA lies
about Dutch drug policy to create the impression that Dutch
tolerance of marijuana sales is a failure.&nbsp; In fact it is a
great success.&nbsp; If Americans want to see how freedom works,
they should visit the Netherlands.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On November 29, 1994, in an
important court test of a classic unfunded federal mandate,
Medina County Municipal Court Judge Dale H. Chase ruled that
Ohio's mandated suspension of an individual's driver's license
for minor possession of marijuana is unconstitutional. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An excerpt from Judge Chase's
two-page decision follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;...suspension/revocation of the
    driver's license of an individual convicted of possession of
    drug paraphernalia is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
    to the Constitution of the United States on the basis that
    there is no 'rational relationship' between a license suspension
    for violating a drug law and the Ohio statutes dealing with legal
    operation of motor vehicles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision to suspend a
    driver's license for a violation of certain statutes which
    are not related to operation of vehicles would be no different
    than a decision to suspend an individual's vendor's license
    or other license issued by the state to conduct activities
    within the State of Ohio, to the extent that the licensing
    statute is not rationally related to the criminal statute
    involved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Accordingly, the Court
    finds... mandating license suspension for certain offenses,
    is unconstitutional.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>

Report&quot;).</b>&nbsp; The study was commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia in 1938 in order to discover the truth about
marijuana, which had been hastily prohibited a year earlier. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study was completed in 1944,
published by Jaques Cattell Press (Lancaster, PA), and released
to the public in early 1945.&nbsp; <b>&quot;Its findings revealed
that marijuana's harmful effects had been greatly
exaggerated,&quot; explained NORML National Director Richard
Cowan.&nbsp; &quot;The report's conclusions demonstrate that the
War Against Marijuana Consumers has been a fraud from its
beginning.&quot;</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The massive research project was
carried out by a team of scientists from the New York Academy of
Medicine and the commissioners of the New York Departments of Correction,
Health, and Hospitals.&nbsp; It was the most thorough, extensive
marijuana fact-finding mission since the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission released its monumental report in 1894. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report was
comprised of a series of studies -- from sociological observations
to controlled, scientific studies involving the consumption of
marijuana by subjects in a laboratory setting.&nbsp; <b>Among the
report's conclusions:</b> </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Mental Illness --</b>
        &quot;Indulgence in marihuana does not appear to result
        in mental deterioration.&nbsp; ... Marihuana does not
        change the basic personality structure of the
        individual.&nbsp; It lessens inhibition and this brings
        out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions but it
        does not evoke responses which would otherwise be totally
        alien to him.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Violence --</b>
        &quot;There was no aggressive or violent behavior
        observed.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Crime --</b>
        &quot;Marihuana is not the determining factor in the
        commission of major crimes.&nbsp; Juvenile delinquency is
        not associated with the practice of smoking marihuana.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Addiction --</b>
        &quot;The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Gateway to Hard Drugs --</b>
        &quot;We have been unable to confirm ... that marihuana smoking
        is the first step in the use of such drugs as cocaine,
        morphine, and heroin.&nbsp; The instances are extremely
        rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
        with addiction to these other narcotics.&quot; </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the report stressed,
&quot;The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana
smoking in New York City is unfounded.&quot;&nbsp; The depth and
thoroughness of the study make these conclusions relevant beyond
1940s New York. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report provided
invaluable descriptive data and dispelled many of the myths which
led to the prohibition of marijuana.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
essentially ignored and had virtually no effect on the burgeoning
national policy of prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The January 12,1945, <i>New York
Times</i> article &quot;Experts Discount Marijuana as Big Factor
In Crime but Drive on It Will Be Pressed&quot; reassured a
frightened public that marijuana would remain outlawed.&nbsp;
Every large-scale study done over the last century has arrived at
the same conclusion; all have been ignored. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of course, prohibitionists have
played an active part in making sure that the reports are
ignored.&nbsp; Today they claim that marijuana is now so much
stronger than it was in the past that it is virtually a different
drug, rendering all previous conclusions useless.&nbsp; For
example, the December 26 <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> blamed
a rap album for promoting marijuana &quot;20 times stronger than
grass of the past&quot; (&quot;Kids and Marijuana: The Glamour is
Back,&quot; p. 12).&nbsp; In actuality, potency has not
substantially increased over the past 20 years.&nbsp; (A report
on marijuana potency is available from NORML.) </font></p>

SPECIAL REPORT</p>

<p align="center">December 16, 1994 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Conservative Columnist
William F. Buckley, Jr.,<br>
Writes of His Sister's Cancer Chemotherapy<br>
and Her Need for Medical Marijuana</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In his syndicated column distributed on December 16, William
F. Buckley, Jr., the conservative author and talk show host,
writes about his younger sister's cancer and her need for medical
access to marijuana &quot;because she is undergoing an agonizing
jolt of chemotherapy.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">To the question, &quot;How does she know cannabis would help
her?&quot; Buckley responds - &quot;Dumb question.&nbsp; A) She
knows, or knows of, people who have had relief from the
wretchedness she suffers from, from a puff or two of marijuana;
and B) so what if it did not work?&nbsp; ... What are we afraid
of, that while recovering from cancer and taking a marijuana
cigarette she will become a crack addict?&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">One of the persons she knows who has written about his use of
cannabis for chemotherapy is Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor
of Buckley's <em>National Review</em> magazine.&nbsp; As Buckley
notes, Brookhiser found that it takes only a one or two puffs on
a marijuana cigarette to stop immediately -- the nausea of
chemotherapy.&nbsp; It usually works, but if it does not, there
are no side effects.&nbsp; In contrast, the very expensive
anti-nausea pharmaceutical Zofran causes headaches in as many as 40%
of those who use it and can cause liver damage, etc. Yet the
narcocracy cites Zofran as the reason that there is no need for
medical marijuana.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Buckley also writes of his frustration in not knowing where to
buy marijuana himself in New York City ... where it is almost
ubiquitous.&nbsp; This reflects one of the sad ironies of people
in his situation: <u>the older a person is, the harder it is to
find marijuana</u>.&nbsp; The prohibition that is justified on the
grounds that it protects children actually makes it most
difficult for adults, and especially for the ill, to find
marijuana when they need it most.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In any other context it might be amusing to think of someone as
recognizable as Buckley lurking around Washington Square trying
to &quot;score&quot; a few dollars worth of pot.&nbsp; He makes
light of this problem, but it really is not feasible for someone
in his position to do what he otherwise would do.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">One assumes that at least after this column is published - the
Buckleys will eventually get marijuana, but what of the hundreds
of thousands of others? He laments that &quot;thinking on the subject
is so far gone in putrefaction that the simplest questions go
unanswered.&quot; Actually, most of the putrefaction starts here
in Washington.&nbsp; Surveys show that the overwhelming majority
of the American people are in favor of medical access to
marijuana.&nbsp; Newt, please note.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Buckley concludes his column by reporting that researchers in San
Francisco have been ready for two years to do a study of the use
of marijuana &quot;in treating the wasting syndrome associated with
AIDS, but they cannot obtain the necessary marijuana from the
government.&quot; Buckley asks, &quot;If somebody discovered that
marijuana would *cure* AIDS, would the narcs still prowl the
street for vendors?&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Yes.&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; NORML's experience suggests that the
narcs would redouble their efforts.&nbsp; They know that the
survival of the narcocracy depends on the suppression of medical
marijuana.&nbsp; This is no petty crime that the narcs are
covering up ... as anyone who has endured chemotherapy, or AIDS,
or so much other suffering, would tell us, if they did not have
to live and often die in fear.<br>

related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">December 15, 1994</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Drug Enforcement
Administration Continues to Block Study on<br>
Use of Marijuana to Alleviate Symptoms of AIDS</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">When the Clinton administration bowed to DEA pressure against
making marijuana medically available, it promised to allow
privately funded research, but it continues to block an FDA-approved
protocol study on the effect of marijuana on the AIDS Wasting
Syndrome by Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Dr. Abrams has been seeking approval for his research for <strong>two
and a half years</strong>.&nbsp; The FDA has already approved Dr.
Abrams' research.&nbsp; The protocol has been supported by the
Physicians Association for AIDS Research, the nation's oldest and
largest association of physicians interested in AIDS treatment
and research, and by the Federation of American Scientists.&nbsp;
The only legal supply of marijuana for the study is from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).&nbsp; NIDA has the
marijuana in stock and has no other compelling requests for its
use.&nbsp; NIDA has supplied marijuana to every FDA-approved
protocol for several decades, yet it has delayed Dr. Abrams' study
for over 2 years.&nbsp; <strong>Without marijuana, the research
is impossible.</strong><br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">A December 9 meeting that was to decide whether the U.S.
government would permit or prohibit the study was postponed by
Dr. Philip Lee, the Assistant Secretary for Health, due to &quot;scheduling
conflicts.&quot;&nbsp; The meeting will be rescheduled,
supposedly later in December. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">At issue are scientific freedom and compassion for patients.
Support for Dr. Abrams' protocol is not necessarily support for
the medical use of marijuana, it is simply support for the
resolution of this controversy through science rather than
ideology.&nbsp; Similarly, the medical use of marijuana is not equivalent
to marijuana legalization.&nbsp; Thousands of AIDS patients are
already risking arrest to use marijuana illegally for the wasting
syndrome.&nbsp; The medical use of marijuana has been rejected by the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claiming there is not
enough research, yet now it is trying to kill research.&nbsp;
Science, not politics, should decide this issue.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Dr. Alan Leshner, the Director of NIDA, can be reached at
301-443-6480 (fax 301-443-9127). Dr. Philip Lee, Assistant
Secretary for Health, can be reached at 202-690-7694 (fax
202-690-7203).&nbsp; The offices of Dr. Lee and Dr. Leshner
acknowledge that they have been receiving a substantial number of
phone calls, faxes, and letters in support of Dr. Abrams' study from
those who value scientific freedom over the ideological
suppression of research.<br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Vermont's Largest City
Supports Medical Marijuana</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">October 24, The City of Burlington, like numerous other
municipalities and states [Note: 36 states, including Vermont,
have passed resolutions in support of medical marijuana], passed
a resolution stating, in part: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Significant scientific and medical studies have
        demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical
        supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural
        form, has important therapeutic actions that are often of
        critical medical importance to persons afflicted with a variety
        of life and sense-threatening illnesses; </li>
    <li>Courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in
        treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of
        &quot;necessity&quot; in the treatment of glaucoma,
        cancer, AIDS, and multiple sclerosis, and conditions of
        permanent pain and/or paralysis; </li>
    <li>The people of the State of Vermont believe that well
        trained medical professionals should be responsible for
        determining a patient's routine of medical care, and; </li>
    <li><u>Seriously ill Vermonters and other Americans are
        suffering unnecessarily </u><em><u>because of federal policies</u></em><u>
        which legally prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use</u> [emphasis
        added]. </li>
</ul>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The resolution resolved, &quot;the Burlington City Council
memorializes the President and the United States Congress to end
federal prohibition against marijuana's legitimate medical use by
creating a rational system of prescriptive medical access to
marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Senator Bob Kerry
Supports Medical Marijuana --<br>
on the Advice of Willie Nelson</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Oct. 12, <em>The Wayne Stater</em>, student newspaper at Wayne
State College, reports that Sen. Kerry (D-NE) spoke to a group of
students from the Wayne State College NORML chapter and indicated,
&quot;I have no problem with legalizing marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; 
There has only been one other individual who has brought this
topic to my attention.&nbsp;  That was [entertainer] Willie Nelson, and
it seems to work for him.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: Sen. Kerry easily won re-election despite his opponent
trying to link his statements concerning medical marijuana to
drag use in general.&nbsp;  Kerry's opponent, republican Jan Storey even
went so far as to say that Kerry's support for medical marijuana
was an &quot;implicit endorsement&quot; of drug use.&nbsp;  For more
information on the encounter with Sen. Kerry at Wayne State College,

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Traverse City (MI) Seeks
Resolution From State<br>
in Its Ability to Decriminalize Marijuana</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">December 6, <em>The Record Eagle</em> reported: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>City Commissioners will ask the state Legislature to make
    it legal for cities to decriminalize the use of small amounts<br>
    of marijuana. </p>
    <p>Commissioners passed a resolution... addressing the issue
    of William Bustance, president of the Traverse City chapter of 
    the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. </p>
    <p>In the summer, Bustance and other members of NORML had
    circulated petitions asking the commission to put the
    question of decriminalizing the use of less than an ounce of
    marijuana to a public vote. </p>
    <p>On advice of city attorney W. Peter Doren, commissioners
    took no action on the petitions, even though enough signatures had
    been collected to place the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot. </p>
    <p>Doren advised commissioners that it would be illegal for
    them to enact a law contrary to state law. State law prohibits
    cities from decriminalizing controlled substances, including
    marijuana. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">This legal quandary led the Traverse City to pass a resolution
stating in part: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A Resolution Memorializing The Governor And The
    Legislature Of 
    The State Of Michigan To Remedy State Policies In which
    Inhibit And Prevent Local Governments In Creating Ordinances
    That Make Small Amounts Of Marijuana A Civil Infraction </p>
    <p>[The bill which prohibits cities from invoking Home Rule
    privileges regarding controlled substances] ... <em>has
    created a
    inequity in the Home Rule Act by allowing the City of Ann
    Arbor
    to keep in their charter a civil infraction law for small
    amounts of marijuana and by not permitting the citizens of
    Traverse City the opportunity to place a similar ordinance on
    the ballot before the voters</em> [emphasis added]. </p>
    <p>[Ibid.] ... has created the threat and expense of
    litigation to
    the City of Traverse City ... </p>
    <p><em>The National Drug Control Strategy calls for the
    empowerment of
    communities however, the very spirit of the community is
    threatened by the [prohibiting state law], that denied ballot
    access to a Certified Initiatory Petition in Traverse City</em> 
    [emphasis added]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The Commission resolved to &quot;memorialize the State of
Michigan and it's officials ... to investigate and hold public
hearings into state policies which prohibits placing a [certified petition] on
the ballot that would make a civil infraction for small amounts
of marijuana ...&quot;<br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>California's Progressive
Marijuana Decrim Law Undone;<br>
&quot;Smoke A Joint, Lose Your License&quot; Takes Effect</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">December 1, California's 18-year-old marijuana
decriminalization era ended today, as Gov. Wilson's new
&quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law took effect.&nbsp; 
Under the old law, possession of marijuana was punishable by a
maximum $100 fine, which was often paid like a traffic ticket.&nbsp;  The
new law requires a mandatory six-month license suspension for any
drug offense, regardless of whether the offense has any relation
to driving.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">California NORML denounced the new law as a costly attack on
California's marijuana decriminalization law, which has saved the
state an estimated $1 billion in court and enforcement costs.&nbsp; 
State officials admit that they made no attempt to figure the
costs of the new law, which is expected to send thousands of
minor marijuana offenders back into court to defend their
privilege to drive.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Apologists have tried to pretend that the new law was needed to
comply with federal law, under which the state would lose $54
million in highway aid if it failed to enact &quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose
Your License.&quot;&nbsp;  In fact, the law specifically allows states
to opt-out of the license suspension requirement and still
receive full highway funding by a joint resolution of the
Governor and legislature.&nbsp;  Every state west of Texas has passed an &quot;opt-out&quot;
resolution.&nbsp;  However, Gov. Wilson vetoed an opt-out that was
passed unanimously by the legislature two years ago.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The new law comes in the face of two new driving safety studies
by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration,
both of which found that marijuana is markedly less hazardous
than alcohol.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Under the new law, drivers face a longer license suspension for
having pot in their home than for speeding with an open liquor
bottle in their car.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[For more details on the &quot;gutting&quot; of California's
marijuana decriminalization law, contact California NORML

<p align="center">December 1, 1994 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>World AIDS Day</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Reports on World AIDS Day fail to note the widespread but
illegal medical use of cannabis by People With AIDS (PWAs) to
relieve the nausea and loss of appetite associated with both the disease
and the medications given for it.&nbsp;  There are many thousands of
PWAs using Cannabis Buyers' Clubs (CBCs) in major cities around
the country. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Australia to Review
Country's Cannabis Policies</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Australian government officials have convened a task force to
review the country's policies regarding cannabis.&nbsp;  Officials
attending the meeting announced the creation of the Ministerial Council
on Drug Strategy (MCDS).<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">According to MCDS's draft resolution, the council will examine
the therapeutic uses of whole smoked cannabis and commission a
study of the social impact of various actual and potential legislative
responses to cannabis and its many uses.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The MCDS media release noted that the impetus for reviewing
Australia's cannabis laws was that recent public opinion polls
indicate Australians do not widely support the blanket
prohibition of cannabis.&nbsp;  Federal Justice Minister Duncan Kerr
said the report will make a significant contribution to the
debate on cannabis in Australia.&nbsp;  &quot;The report shows that 75%
of people surveyed believed the use or possession of small
quantities of cannabis should not be a criminal offense and over
50% of those surveyed felt that such activities should be
legal.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[For more information on Australia's review of its cannabis
policy, please contact Dr. A. Wodak, Director of Alcohol and Drug
Service at Sydney's St. Vincent's Hospital, (011) 61-2-331-4344.] </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Potent Pot Myth Down
Under</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported on November 22
that &quot;Doctors warned today that a new, more potent hybrid
variety of marijuana known as 'skunk' was being grown in Australia
and had the potential to cause 'intense paranoia' in users.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) claimed in
a recently released report that &quot;skunk has been referred to
overseas as 'mad weed.'&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: &quot;Skunk&quot; is a term used for a pungent variety of
marijuana.&nbsp;  It is not known as &quot;mad weed&quot; in either
Amsterdam or the United States, where it is popular.&nbsp;  For a report on
the &quot;potent pot&quot; myth, contact NORML.] </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>In the Face of 'Drug
War'<br>
Bolivian President Favors Legalization</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">According to a November 7 Voice of America (VOA) report,
Bolivian President Gouzalo Sanchez de Lozada warned that South
American drug traffickers seek to &quot;Colombianize&quot; his country.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Later, in the V0A broadcast, President Sanchez de Lozada said he
personally believes that drugs should be legalized because
prohibition of substances for which there is a high demand has never worked.
But he said that, as President of Bolivia, he cannot afford to
defend that position because the decision on whether to legalize
drugs must be made in the consuming countries. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">0n November 25, London's <em>Sunday Mirror</em> ran a story
with the headline <strong>&quot;I Gave Pot to my Parents.&quot;</strong>
Richard Branson tells how he once persuaded his elderly parents to
smoke a cannabis joint.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: More and more elderly Britons are discovering the medical
uses of cannabis.] </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>German Minister: Sell
Hashish in Cafes</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">United Press International (UPI) reported October 26:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;If Germany is serious about fighting drug dealers,
    it should take a leaf out of Holland's book and make soft drugs like hashish freely available in cafes,&quot; said Heidi Moser, social minister
of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Moser said a distinction should be made between hard drugs and
cannabis, which she said is &quot;not as dangerous as previously
assumed.&quot;&nbsp;  Moser concluded that &quot;what was most dangerous
of all is criminalizing it [cannabis use].&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Smuggler Swallows Record
Amount of Hashish</strong></font></p>

<p>In Tokyo, according to a November 18 Reuters news article:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Airport police revealed the arrest of a British man who
    swallowed an extraordinary 4.4 pounds of hashish [sealed in
    condoms or balloons] in a bid to smuggle the drug into Japan. </p>
    <p>&quot;We could not believe it,&quot; an airport police
    spokesman said.&nbsp;  &quot;We think it is a world record for this
    sort of thing.&nbsp;  It is twice the amount we've seen before.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;It took two days for him to pass all the packages
    through his system after we arrested him,&quot; the spokesman
    said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: Even if the man had digested all 4.4 pounds it would
not have been fatal or caused any lasting effect.] </p>

Dutch Parliament Have Tried Pot</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">A Reuters news article reported November 19 on a Rotterdam
University study showing that 93% of Dutch legislators drank
alcohol -- and that more than one in four had used marijuana, but most
had not done so recently.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Researchers at Rotterdam University concluded that Dutch
legislators' consumption of alcohol and marijuana was broadly in
line with that of the Dutch population as a whole. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Kentucky Governor Looks
Into Creating a Legal Hemp Industry</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">A November 24 story in <em>The Lexington Herald-Leader</em>
reported that Kentucky farmers are looking for a crop to supplant
burley (tobacco), so the state is looking to the past to find
one: cannabis sativa... hemp.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's the same plant some still grow in Kentucky, but
    illegally: Marijuana.</p>
    <p>Governor Brereton Jones yesterday set up a task force to
    study whether a drug-free strain of hemp can again be a
    viable crop in Kentucky.&nbsp;  Fibers from the plant stalk could be
    used in paper and fabric production, he said.</p>
    <p>He said: &quot;If there are crops which can be grown
    legally for a profit in Kentucky, which we currently are not
    growing, then we as public officials have a duty to examine
    these crops and provide answers for the farmers of
    Kentucky.&quot;</p>
    <p>The 17-member task force will study potential markets and
    legal barriers, Jones said in a news conference.</p>
    <p>When the task force makes its recommendations by October
    30, 1995, &quot;we will know whether Kentucky can produce a
    drug-free hemp.&quot;</p>
    <p>Jones took a preemptive strike at potential critics,
    chastising those who might misrepresent his intentions.&nbsp;  While
    he supports the idea of legalizing hemp production, &quot;I am
    opposed to the legalization of marijuana,&quot; he said.</p>
    <p>Gatewood Gaibraith, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate
    who has advocated legalizing marijuana and resurrecting the
    state's hemp industry, was not named to the task force.</p>
    <p>Jones said including him would have made the task force a
    &quot;political<br>
    committee.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: Prior to federal Marijuana Prohibition in 1937,
Kentucky was the leading producer of hemp in the United States.
There were no related social problems reported during the state's 200-year
period of hemp cultivation.] </p>

Register Staff Writer</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">George McMahon sat down on the steps of the Capitol building
in Des Moines Saturday, leaned back, fired up a marijuana
cigarette and casually inhaled -- and he wasn't breaking any laws. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">McMahon, who suffers from a rare genetic defect that causes
muscle spasms and nausea, is one of eight people in the United
States authorized by the federal government to use the drug legally. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;My hospital bills used to be thousands of dollars. Now I
smoke a plant,&quot; McMahon, of Bode, told more than 30 people
gathered Saturday for a rally in support of legalizing the drug
for medical purposes. &quot;I smoke marijuana because it makes me
better. The other pills I took made me worse.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Most who attended the rally, including McMahon, agreed that both
corporate and government interests have prevented the drug's
wide-spread legal use. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;They're fighting dirty, like in the 1930s when they said
marijuana will make you mean,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;They're
using weapons against you that you don't understand.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Barbara Douglass of Storm Lake, another person who may use
marijuana legally, also attended the rally. Douglass suffers from
multiple sclerosis. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Carl Olsen of the group Iowans for Medical MarUuana, which
sponsored the rally, said he remains optimistic about favorable
legislation becoming law. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;The legislators aren't afraid they won't get elected for
supporting this issue,&quot; he said. &quot;The public supports
this issue.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Iowa Sen. Merlin Bartz, R-Grafton, who did not attend the rally
but has agreed to draft legislation supporting the legal medical
use of marijuana, said judgments about the drug's proper use
should be left to the medical community. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;There are all other types of prescription drugs that are
considered illegal if not used under the direction of a
doctor,&quot; Bartz said, &quot;and for some reason (marijuana)
has been singled out as something that cannot be legally
prescribed by a doctor. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;In no way is that an endorsement of legalizing the
drug,&quot; he added. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Not all Iowa lawmakers agree. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Rep. Philip Wise, D-Keokuk, who teaches high school, did not
attend the rally Saturday but said he would oppose such
legislation. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;Having dealt with teens for the last 26 years, the last
thing we need to do at this juncture is send the message that the
use of any drugs, including softer drugs, is acceptable,&quot; he
said. </p>

<TITLE>Marijuana: Politics vs. medicine</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B><CENTER>Marijuana: Politics vs. medicine</CENTER></B><P>
By JANET RORHOLM<BR>
Pilot Staff Writer 
<P>
	It's been a taxing, uphill battle the entire way, but Barb Douglass and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</A> refuse to give up.  The two advocate the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes, so that those who need it and want it can get it. <P>
	Just back from a two-day National Conference on Marijuana Use Prevention, Treatment and Research sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., the two were given some hope that their perseverance has not been in vain and hope remains that somewhere in the not too distant future, marijuana will once again be available for medicinal purposes. <P>
	This Saturday they continue their battle in Des Moines as Iowan's for Medical Marijuana rally at noon on the West Steps of the Capitol Building to publicize their cause and try to get lawmakers' support. <P>
	Marijuana, they claim, is a "miracle drug" and politics is getting in the way of medicine, causing needless suffering and mental anguish on the part of patients. <P>
	Their opinion -- although neither are a doctor or scientist -- carries weight.  Douglass, who lives in Lakeside, and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, of Bode, are two of only eight medical patients in the United States who are legally prescribed marijuana. <P>
	Every month, the two receive 300 marijuana cigarettes from the federal government as part of what is now a "21-year experiment" to evaluate the benefits for marijuana on specific illnesses.  Douglass, who has been on the program since 1991, and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who has been on the program since 1990, are prescribed 10 cigarettes a day to help ease their pain.  Douglass, who at one time was blind from multiple sclerosis, is now only legally blind and she credits marijuana for the partial restoration of her sight.  The drug also acts as a relaxant for the spasticity that occurs in her legs due to MS. <P>
	<a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who suffers from a neurological disorder called Nail Patella Syndrome causing muscle spasms and brittle bones, has had 20 operations to date and is in a constant state of pain.  Marijuana not only eases that pain, it improved his condition, relaxing muscle spasms without the awful side effects that other legal prescription drugs induce, according to <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>. <P>
	While disappointed that the Washington, D.C. conference officially spoke towards the harmful effects of illegal drug use from state department heads and ways to keep juveniles and adults away from drug use, privately, Douglass and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who were invited to the conference, received solid support from the audience full of counselors, doctors and scientists.  "It wasn't the scientific convention we thought it was going to be," Douglass said. <P>
	However, support is growing for their cause and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> can feel it.  Today, 36 states have passed laws that allow marijuana for medical use with Iowa being one of them.  Debate among physicians about prescribing marijuana is getting louder in some circles although doctors still remain fearful about promoting it, afraid that there will be a mad dash to their door, according to <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>.  In June an article entitled "Marijuana as Medicine: A Plea for Reconsideration" was published by two doctors in the American Medical Association to add to the list of professionals supporting the drug for medical use. <P>
	The article claims much of what marijuana patients have testified to -- marijuana has been found useful as an anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant in spastic disorders, as an appetite stimulant in the wasting syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection and is also useful for relieving phantom limb pain and menstrual cramps.  It has also been helpful in treating glaucoma, nausea from chemotherapy in cancer patients, epilepsy, arthritis, MS and spinal fluid injuries. <P>
	The problem, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said, remains among law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which adamantly opposes any legalization of marijuana. <P>
	A bill is anticipated in Congress hopefully within this year or next to legalize marijuana use for medical purposes.  <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass said they have been contacted by Barney Frank and Pat Buchanan for input on possible legislation for debate by lawmakers. <P>
	"The problem we have now, is not telling senators to support us, privately, many of them already do, but to tell others.  Their problem is they don't know who to talk to," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said. <P>
	Other organizations advocating the legalization of marijuana for recreational use are also muddying up the issue, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> claims.  "They're doing their ever loving best to help us at the same time they promote their cause, but we're not worried about that.  That's not what we stand for, that's not what we're after," he said. <P>
	While <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass hope that one day all of those suffering from illnesses have access to marijuana, their immediate mission remains smaller and much more personal.  Both would like to see their friend Ladd Huffman, a Vietnam veteran suffering from MS, and McMahon's daughter Linda, who also suffers from the same genetic disorder as her father, given permission to use marijuana for their illnesses.  Huffman was already approved as a marijuana patient for the same program that <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass are in but the program was put on hold in 1992 and no one besides the eight already receiving marijuana were given the drug. <P>

<P>
	This has been going on for too many years now.  Local MS sufferer Barbara Douglass is again going to a rally at the capitol to plead for the legalized use of medicinal marijuana. <P>
	Despite all of the study, all of the talk and all of the need, lawmakers are still dragging their feet on this issue.  It seems both cruel and ridiculous. <P>
	Doctors have prescribed marijuana for relief of the pain that accompanies several chronic conditions, including AIDS.  Barbara Douglass can tell you what it has meant to her condition. <P>
	Dont get us wrong.  Marijuana is a drug.  We are not calling for it to be legalized for recreational use, or treated as anything less than a potent drug. <P>
	It should be controlled by doctors who can fully inform users of its benefits and limitations -- most definitely operation of a motor vehicle.  It should be controlled by prescriptions, as are so many important drugs with much stronger effects on the body.  And like other prescription drugs, the laws should stomp hard on those who obtain or use it illegally. <P>
	We must get to that point where we can separate marijuana as a prescription medicine from the war on drugs, which we continue to support with all of our hearts.  We can accept the former without giving an inch on the latter. <P>
	Once again, they will rally this August on the steps of the capitol, while the people who work in there ignore the plea. <P>
	How in the world can the federal government and state board of pharmacy examiners expressly approve of the use of medicinal marijuana for relief of Barbara Douglass condition, then deny it to others with the same condition or those similar in terms of chronic pain and debilitation? <P>
	Maybe it is the politicians blocking this use who need a medicinal dose... <P>
	Of compassion. <P>

<TITLE>1994 Iowa Legislative Survey</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><FONT SIZE=6><B><CENTER>1994 Iowa Legislative Survey</CENTER></B></FONT><P>
     Last December, we sent a medical marijuana survey to all 150 members of the newly elected Iowa Legislature, asking for support for a resolution calling upon the federal government to make marijuana medically available by a doctor's prescription, and asking that the medical necessity defense be enacted into Iowa law.  Two Iowa Senators, Merlin Bartz (Republican, Grafton) and Elaine Szymoniak (Democrat, Des Moines), have agreed to draft legislation for us and have assigned interns to work on our suggestions.  We're extremely optimistic that at the least we will get a public hearing on our proposals in the Iowa Senate this year.  It would be extremely helpful if you'd sit down right now and write a letter to one or more of our supporters in the Iowa Senate expressing your support.  You can write to them at the Iowa Statehouse, Des Moines, Iowa 50319, or at their home addresses (listed below).
<P>
     Here are the responses we've received so far from our legislative survey:

November 23, 1995                                              515-262-6957

<h1><center>Iowa Legislative Survey Results</center></h1>
<pre><b>     Iowans for Medical Marijuana sent a Legislative Questionnaire to each 
of the 100 members of the Iowa House of Representatives and to each of the 
50 members of the Iowa Senate.  Our questionnaire asked: "Will you lend 
your support in demanding that the Federal Government allow Iowans with 
legitimate medical needs to use marijuana for medical purposes?"  We 
received 43 replies from the Iowa House of Representatives (43%), and 16 
replies from the Iowa Senate (32%).  10 of those responding in the Iowa 
House of Representatives were in favor of our proposal, 21 of those 
responding were unsure, and 13 of those responding were opposed.  10 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor of our proposal, 5 were 
unsure, and 2 were opposed.  The results seem to better than last year.  
Last year, 3 of those responding in the Iowa House of Representatives were 
in favor of our proposal, 7 were unsure, and 8 were opposed, while 7 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor, 3 were unsure, and none 
were opposed.  The response to the survey was much better this year than 
last year.

     Carl Olsen, coordinator for Iowans for Medical Marijuana, said, "We're 
doing a good job of educating the Legislature about the medical benefits of 
marijuana.  Many of them were unaware of the present conflict between state 
and federal law."  Since 1979, Iowa law has allowed prescription of 
marijuana.  Federal law has never allowed prescription of marijuana, but 
the federal government had been supplying marijuana to patients on a 
selective basis under a program of compassionate care.  In 1992 the federal 
government decided to stop accepting new applications for its compassionate 
care marijuana program.  Only eight Americans remain on the federal program 
and two of them live in Iowa.  Olsen said, "Health care should be a basic 
fundamental right for everyone, not just the eight people who now receive 
federally grown marijuana.  It's time the federal government stopped 
playing games with people's lives and allowed doctors to prescribe 
marijuana to all patients who need it."

     A federal bill, H.R. 2618, similar to Iowa's medical marijuana law, 
Iowa Code  124.206(7)(a), was introduced in the U.S. House of 
Representatives on Monday, November 13, 1995.

<PRE>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT:

     The trial court found that Rev. Brown could not submit evidence as to 
his religious establishment and exericse, to the jury.  The court based 
it's decision on the Fifth Circuit's decision in 1967, in Leary v. U.S., 
383 F.2d 851.  In doing so, the court ignored all the precedent to 
compelling interest and least restrictive means developed since Reynolds 
v. U.S., 98 U.S. 244 in 1878.  Even more significant of it's prejudice, 
the court refused to recognize the established precedent of the Eighth 
Circuit in Warner v. Graham, 675 F.Supp. 1177, in 1987 and a half dozen 
decisions reached under the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 
including the Eighth Circuit decision in Rust v. Clarke, 851 F.Supp. 377 
in 1994.
     The trial court summarily dismissed all defenses advanced by Rev. 
Brown regarding Natural Law, Common Law, the Declaration of Independence, 
the U.S. Constitution, Necessity, and the lack of Federal powers under the 
Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, without allowing any showing 
of evidense, testimony, or argument.  In doing so it abused its discretion 
and deprived Rev. Brown of even a shadow of a fair trial under DUE 
PROCESS.
     The trial court threatened Rev. Brown's assisting attornney in a 
letter dated October 25, 1994.  The court refused to hold a hearing on a 
motion for clarification of attorneys duties ex parte which is required as 
this is a matter of attorney client privelege.  The trial court created 
rules for standby counsel which substantially deprived Rev. Brown of the 
assistance of counsel.  This constitutes an abuse of discretion on the 
part of the trial court.
     The trial court refused to question two jurors who were overheard 
discussing the case and making disparaging remarks about the defendant on 
a break the second day of trial.  The trial court refused to substitute 
the extra jurrors for these two prejudiced jurors and substantially 
deprived Rev. Brown of Due Process.
     For all these reasons, Rev. Brown has been deprived of his 
constitutional rights and has been deprived of Due Process.  For these 
reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and appropriate 
relief granted to him.

<PRE>STATEMENT OF INTRODUCTION

     The Defendent / Appellant, Rev. Tom Brown Pro Per, seeks to introduce 
this appeal by casting the eye of the Court on some issues that should be 
kept in mind as the Court considers the case at hand.  This case is only 
one in a long series of battles of the vaunted War on Drugs.  As in any 
war, looking back over the past thirty years, we can see lots of 
casualties.  The question is, how many more bodies will be heaped on the 
Alter of National Paranoia ?  A wise man once said that those who refuse 
to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.  Perhaps the Court could 
look at another war we waged on ourselves, another war bred in ignorance 
and fed on lies and corruption.
     In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. at page 700, Justice Taney 
announces the decision of the Court saying:

        "The question before us, is whether the class of persons
   described in the plea of abatement compose a portion of this
   people and are constituent members of this sovereignty.  We
   think they are not, and that they are not included under the
   word citizen in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none
   of the rights and priveleges which that instrument provides
   for and secures to citizens of the United States.  On the con-
   trary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and
   inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dom-
   inant race, and whether emancipated or not, yet remained sub-
   ject to their authority, and had no rights or priveleges but
   such as those who held power and the government might grant
   them.
        It is not the providence of the Court to decide upon the
   justice or injustice, the policy or the impolicy of these laws.
   The decision of that question belonged to the political or
   law making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and
   framed the Constitution.
        The language of the Declaration of independence is equa-
   lly conclusive.  It proceeds to say; 'We hold these truths to
   be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are
   endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
   among them is life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness;
   that to secure these rights, governments are instituted, deri-
   ving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'...
        The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the
   whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instru-
   ment at this day, would so be understood.  But it is too clear
   for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended
   to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed
   and adopted this declaration; . . ."

     The Court will see these words again in the decisions which have 
refused to recognize the religous use of plants.  Not all courts have 
refused to recognize over 5,000 years of recorded human history, but the 
words of those who have are redolent with the scent of the Dred Scott 
decision, and the bodies of those who perished in the attempt to make up 
for the cowardice of the Dred Scott court.  Time after time those courts 
strain to justify the denial of rights which no man can claim did not 
exist and were not exercised among the peoples who wrote the Declaration 
and the Constitution.  And as Justice McLean's dissent shows below, 
despicable and vile acts perpetrated by men who happen to occupy positions 
of power are not unprecedented.  There was no Truth to the assertion that 
"no one thought of disputing" the issue of slavery at the time of the 
revolution.  There was no Truth to the statement that "they formed no part 
of the people who framed and adopted this Declaration."  In fact:

        "Crispus Attucks, a Negro, was the first man killed by
   the British in the Boston Massacre.  The five thousand Negro
   soldiers who fought in the revolution . . .  Three quarters of
   the Rhode Island Regiment passing in review at Yorktown in
   1781 were Negroes. (Afro-American Encyclopedia, 1974)

But this truth was known in 1856 as we see in Justice McLean's dissent:

        "In the Convention, it was proposed by a committee of
   eleven to limit the importation of slaves to the year 1800,
   when Mr. Pickney moved to extend the time to the year 1808.
   This motion carried . . .  In Opposition to the motion, Mr.
   Madison said; 'Twenty years will produce all the mischief
   that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves;
   so long a term will be more dishonerable to the American
   character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution'
   Madison Papers.
        But we know as a historical fact that James Madison, that
   great and good man, a leading member in the Federal Convention,
   was solicitous to guard the language of that instrument so as
   not to convey the idea there could be property in Man."

     So the lies and deceit of the Taney majority went on to result in a 
war of unprecedented proportion on this soil.  More died in it than in 
WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combined.  And we paid a hard price for that 
clever though despicable interpretation of History and precedent.  The 
question is posed here, what price will this Court chose to be paid.  The 
Rev. Brown comes to this Court as a Man of Honor, with empty hands and 
outstretched arms.  Rev. Brown comes before this Court as the result of an 
act of conscience, inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.  The Court is 
refered to the words of James Michner, in his book Covenent.  As we 
listen, a young African is asking an old adviser as to the choice of 
weapons he should carry;

        "How do I protect myself ?"
        "Integrity is a good shield.  He paused.  Did I ever come
   armed to your fathers krall ?  Couldn't he have killed me in a
   moment if he wished?  Why didn't he?  Because he knew that if he
   killed a Man of Honor, he'd soon have on his hands, men with
   none.  And then the whole thing falls apart. (pg. 91)

     Later in the book, another character is remembering her brother who 
became a spy and sold the secrets of the government.

        "When she tried to decipher how he had been seduced into
   committing his mortal sin - the betrayal of his nation and his
   peers - she began to think of the role words play in life.  Our
   family was keen on word games.  Wexton and I played them const-
   antly.  I think I first came to suspect him when he cheated one
   day.  Altered the meaning of a word in order to win.  At Cambridge
   he altered the meanings of great words and ended a traitor.
   Back in Salisbury, walking within the shadow of the Cathedral,
   she thought: Integrity in words protects integrity in life.
   If a word is corrupted, everything that stems from it will be
   evil."

     And so it is that we have evil in our own time, and in our own place. 
A creeping, seductive evil that knows every nook and cranny of the 
administrative, legislative and judicial branch of government.  And it is 
born in a series of little lies, lies told, lies repeated, and lies which 
become the bricks of the foundation of our life.  And the question is, 
will this Court end the lies.
     There are already over ten million marajuana felons in our nation.  
We outnumber all the judges, prosecutors, police, drug bureaucrats, and 
military by about two to one.  How much longer will thirty perceent of our 
population be treated as a "subordinate and inferior class of beings . . . 
(who) had no rights or priveleges but such as those who held power and the 
government might grant them."  How much longer will we be expected to 
suffer in peace while the abuses of our rights continue unabated?  How 
much longer will the courts decide questions of the burdening of religous 
establishment and exercise one way for the Roman Catholic Church, and 
another for Our Church ?  Is it too soon to address the question, is the 
issue not ripe enough ?  You can dam the river, but you can't stop the 
rain.  Please, for God's sake and our own, stop the lies and live in the 
truth !

<PRE>STATEMENT OF THE CASE

     In 1988, four residents of northwest Arkansas founded Our Church.  
They sent out letters to friends and neighbors they thought would want to 
be a part of Our Church.  The letters were unsigned. (Exhibit A 1,2).  
Rev. Tom Brown recieved these letters.  He immediately made photocopys of 
the letters - as instructed - and passed them to others who he thought 
would be interested.  The first person he took them to turned out to be 
one of the origional writers of the letters.  That person expressed 
interest, denied any knowlege of Our Church, and asked to be kept 
informed.  Rev. Brown heard rumors of someone trying to get permission 
from the local Unitarian Church to hold services there, but no more after 
that.
     In January of 1994, about the 10th, Rev. Brown awoke from a dream to 
a feeling of overwelming peace and expectation of great good fortune.  It 
was an unprecedented experience.  He felt like he had been touched by the 
hand of God.  He did not remember any details of the dream, just the 
extraordinary feeling upon awakening.  He located the letters several 
day's later while organizing his file cabinet.  He realized that Our 
Church was what the dream had been about.  It was time to stand up and 
start practicing his relationship with God openly, the way God intended.
     Rev. Brown owns a forty acre parcel of Ozark mountain property known 
as South Slope Farm.  He deeded one acre of that land to Our Church on 
February 14, 1994; the day we dedicate to Love, Valentines Day. (Exhibit B 
1,2).  He contacted all his friends and asked who would like to start Our 
Church with him - including the origional founders whom he still had not 
identified.  They all said they knew the Truth of Our Church, but were 
afraid of the persecution which Rev. Brown has come to know so well.  They 
refused to join openly, but each in their own way contributed something to 
getting Our Church organized.  Then he went to strangers and finally eight 
other folks signed the papers to start Our Church Incorporated, as a 
non-profit, religous corporation in the State of Arkansas. (Exhibit C 
1,2,3,4,5).  Although it is not required in the State of Arkansas they all 
agreed to a Statement of Purpose (C-5) which can not be changed except by 
unanimous agreement of all official members.
     The Deed to the acre of land owned by Our Church at Antioch Arkansas, 
is restricted by covenants as to the use of the land. (A-2)  Our Church 
Inc. is not so encumbered.  Each of the origional incorporators sought to 
establish their own branch of Our Church at their home location; or in the 
case of the Family Church of the New Dawn, preceeded the establishment of 
Our Church.  FCND was founded in 1982 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Official 
membership in Our Church is established by a notorized statement submitted 
to the CEO of the Corporation, signifying intention to join Our Church 
Inc. and abide by the Statement of Purpose.  The purpose of Official 
membership is to become a public, open and living example of Our Church, 
so our Brothers and Sisters in God can take heart and begin to openly live 
their lives in keeping with their knowledge of the God of their own 
understanding and their Higher Power.
     On March 29, 1994, members of Our Church Inc. met with Washington 
County Sheriff Kenneth McKee and other law enforcement officials in 
Fayetteville, Arkansas.  They discussed the plans of Our Church at Antioch 
to plant and distribute herbs and plants given to us by God for our 
Spiritual discernment and Physical nourishment.
     On Easter Sunday, April 3, 1994, Our Church at Antioch, held it's 
first service and consecration of land. 
     On August 2, 1994, Rev. Brown was accosted by DEA agents and 
Sheriff's deputies while tending the garden at Our Church at Antioch.  
They attempted to murder him, and when that failed, they stole four 
hundred and thirty five marijuana plants and three peyote plants that were 
growing there.
     July 31, was the last regular service at Our Church at Antioch.  
Since then services for Washington County, Arkansas residents have been 
held at the Family Church of the New Dawn, 1027 Hickery St., Fayetteville, 
Arkansas.  Each member church of Our Church Inc. is financially and 
theologically independent of Our Church Inc.; founded and organized by the 
membership of that church.  This is a congregational organization similar 
to the Southern Baptist Convention.  Other branchs of Our Church are 
operating in Mt. Shasta, California; Boulder, Colorado; Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma; Bee Branch, Atkins and Little Rock, Arkansas.
     On August 11, 1994, Rev. Brown was arrested and charged with growing 
marijuana and peyote, and possession of marijuana with intent to 
distribute in violation of Federal Law.  Rev. Brown insisted on the right 
to control his own case, and to not give over representation to an 
attorney, and requested the assistance of counsel.  Two seperate attorneys 
were appointed who refused to research or help Rev. Brown to research the 
law, to prepare motions, question witness's, etc. and were discharged by 
the court.  The third attorney recieved a threatening letter from the 
judge and sought to withdraw.  The judge appointed her as standby counsel 
and ordered her to not do the defendant's bidding.
     Rev. Brown attempted to testify to the Grand Jury and spent two days 
waiting while it met, but was refused.  An indictment was returned on 
September 14, 1994.  On November 4, 1994, Rev. Brown filed a motion to 
recuse the Judge based on Arkansas State Police documents which show Judge 
Waters to have been involved in a criminal conspiracy to smuggle drugs and 
move women around the country for purposes of prostitution in the 1970's 
prior to his appointment to the bench.  Judge Waters denied the motion.
     On November 8, 1994, the government filed a motion in limine which 
sought to deprive the defendant of all his defenses.  On November 28, 
1994, a hearing was held which resulted in Judge Waters finding that Our 
Church was a sincere establishment and exercise of religion, and that Rev. 
Brown's acts of growing marijuana and peyote were acts affected by the 
Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, and that the government had a 
compelling interest in prohibiting that act because Congress had passed a 
law with severe criminal penalties for violating the law.  Rev. Brown 
attempted to introduce documents and witnesses to show that the attitude 
of law enforcement had changed since the passage of the law, and that 
there had been a change in the scientific knowledge also, but Judge waters 
refused to review or entertain any such evidense or witnesses.  Rev. Brown 
properly protested.  Rev. Brown would have shown that there was no Federal 
Jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause for prosecuting Our Church of 
Antioch, Arkansas, and Rev. Tom Brown, but Judge Waters refused to allow 
any presentation of any issue except as to the question of the sincerely 
of Rev.  Brown's religous exercise.  Rev. Brown had attempted to obtain 
subpeona's for witnesses to the hearing, Judge Waters granted the 
subpoenas but then issued them for the wrong date, so the witnesses could 
not show up for the hearing.  Rev. Brown protested but Judge Waters 
refused to allow any correction to be made.  Rev. Brown attempted to 
introduce evidence and witnesses that Rev. Brown's acts were necessary to 
prevent a greater evil, a necessity defense, but Judge Waters refused to 
allow any such introduction into the record, or to allow the use of that 
defense.
     On October 25, 1994, Judge Waters wrote a letter to advising attorney 
Leslie Borgogoni in which he threatned to not reimburse her for expenses 
of the defense of Rev. Brown.  In response, she filed a motion for 
clarification of duties.  At the hearing on that motion, Rev. Brown 
protested the fact that it was not conducted ex parte.  His motion was 
overruled.  Borgogoni attempted to withdraw as advising counsel but Waters 
made her standby counsel instead.  He wrote a set of rules for her which 
specifically directed her to not perform any task at the direction of Rev. 
Brown until and unless he gave up his pro per status.
     On November 19, 1994, a criminal trial was held.  Rev. Brown was 
repeatedly stopped from presenting evidense and testimony in his defense.  
Judge Waters repeatedly interupted Rev. Brown and made disparaging remarks 
about him and his attempt to defend himself.  Although Waters had admitted 
that Rev. Brown was engaged in a sincere exercise of his religion, Rev. 
Brown was denied the right to present evidence of his religion, the 
Constitution, Natural Law, Common Law, and government documents related to 
the issues of compelling interest and least restrictive means.  On 
November 30, 1994, Rev. Brown was convicted and incarcerated without bail 
in the County Jail.
     Rev. Brown immediately attempted to get access to a law library in 
order to prepare motions for new trial, etc., but was denied that access 
until January 28, 1995.  By this time the time limit on motions had 
passed, and Waters overruled all motions on that basis.
     Rev. Brown has been denied a fair trial, due process in keeping with 
the published precedent of the Eighth Circuit, and the protection of the 
Constitution and the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  The 
prosecution of Rev. Brown for growing plants given to us by God, and 
giving away the leaves and flowers of those plants for free, no cost, no 
exchange, no renumeration whatsoever; exceeds Congressional powers granted 
by the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  In addition, Rev. 
Brown was unconstitutionally denied the assistance of counsel.  For all 
these reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and 
appropriate relief granted.
     In closing, Rev. Brown notes that he has been forced to prepare this 
brief without the assistance of counsel, and he requests that a liberal 
construction and interpretation be given to this document.

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">George McMahon sat down on the steps of the Capitol building
in Des Moines Saturday, leaned back, fired up a marijuana
cigarette and casually inhaled -- and he wasn't breaking any laws. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">McMahon, who suffers from a rare genetic defect that causes
muscle spasms and nausea, is one of eight people in the United
States authorized by the federal government to use the drug legally. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;My hospital bills used to be thousands of dollars. Now I
smoke a plant,&quot; McMahon, of Bode, told more than 30 people
gathered Saturday for a rally in support of legalizing the drug
for medical purposes. &quot;I smoke marijuana because it makes me
better. The other pills I took made me worse.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Most who attended the rally, including McMahon, agreed that both
corporate and government interests have prevented the drug's
wide-spread legal use. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;They're fighting dirty, like in the 1930s when they said
marijuana will make you mean,&quot; McMahon said. &quot;They're
using weapons against you that you don't understand.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Barbara Douglass of Storm Lake, another person who may use
marijuana legally, also attended the rally. Douglass suffers from
multiple sclerosis. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Carl Olsen of the group Iowans for Medical MarUuana, which
sponsored the rally, said he remains optimistic about favorable
legislation becoming law. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;The legislators aren't afraid they won't get elected for
supporting this issue,&quot; he said. &quot;The public supports
this issue.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Iowa Sen. Merlin Bartz, R-Grafton, who did not attend the rally
but has agreed to draft legislation supporting the legal medical
use of marijuana, said judgments about the drug's proper use
should be left to the medical community. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;There are all other types of prescription drugs that are
considered illegal if not used under the direction of a
doctor,&quot; Bartz said, &quot;and for some reason (marijuana)
has been singled out as something that cannot be legally
prescribed by a doctor. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;In no way is that an endorsement of legalizing the
drug,&quot; he added. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Not all Iowa lawmakers agree. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Rep. Philip Wise, D-Keokuk, who teaches high school, did not
attend the rally Saturday but said he would oppose such
legislation. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">&quot;Having dealt with teens for the last 26 years, the last
thing we need to do at this juncture is send the message that the
use of any drugs, including softer drugs, is acceptable,&quot; he
said. </p>

<B><CENTER>Marijuana: Politics vs. medicine</CENTER></B><P>
By JANET RORHOLM<BR>
Pilot Staff Writer 
<P>
	It's been a taxing, uphill battle the entire way, but Barb Douglass and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">George McMahon</A> refuse to give up.  The two advocate the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes, so that those who need it and want it can get it. <P>
	Just back from a two-day National Conference on Marijuana Use Prevention, Treatment and Research sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., the two were given some hope that their perseverance has not been in vain and hope remains that somewhere in the not too distant future, marijuana will once again be available for medicinal purposes. <P>
	This Saturday they continue their battle in Des Moines as Iowan's for Medical Marijuana rally at noon on the West Steps of the Capitol Building to publicize their cause and try to get lawmakers' support. <P>
	Marijuana, they claim, is a "miracle drug" and politics is getting in the way of medicine, causing needless suffering and mental anguish on the part of patients. <P>
	Their opinion -- although neither are a doctor or scientist -- carries weight.  Douglass, who lives in Lakeside, and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, of Bode, are two of only eight medical patients in the United States who are legally prescribed marijuana. <P>
	Every month, the two receive 300 marijuana cigarettes from the federal government as part of what is now a "21-year experiment" to evaluate the benefits for marijuana on specific illnesses.  Douglass, who has been on the program since 1991, and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who has been on the program since 1990, are prescribed 10 cigarettes a day to help ease their pain.  Douglass, who at one time was blind from multiple sclerosis, is now only legally blind and she credits marijuana for the partial restoration of her sight.  The drug also acts as a relaxant for the spasticity that occurs in her legs due to MS. <P>
	<a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who suffers from a neurological disorder called Nail Patella Syndrome causing muscle spasms and brittle bones, has had 20 operations to date and is in a constant state of pain.  Marijuana not only eases that pain, it improved his condition, relaxing muscle spasms without the awful side effects that other legal prescription drugs induce, according to <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>. <P>
	While disappointed that the Washington, D.C. conference officially spoke towards the harmful effects of illegal drug use from state department heads and ways to keep juveniles and adults away from drug use, privately, Douglass and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>, who were invited to the conference, received solid support from the audience full of counselors, doctors and scientists.  "It wasn't the scientific convention we thought it was going to be," Douglass said. <P>
	However, support is growing for their cause and <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> can feel it.  Today, 36 states have passed laws that allow marijuana for medical use with Iowa being one of them.  Debate among physicians about prescribing marijuana is getting louder in some circles although doctors still remain fearful about promoting it, afraid that there will be a mad dash to their door, according to <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A>.  In June an article entitled "Marijuana as Medicine: A Plea for Reconsideration" was published by two doctors in the American Medical Association to add to the list of professionals supporting the drug for medical use. <P>
	The article claims much of what marijuana patients have testified to -- marijuana has been found useful as an anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant in spastic disorders, as an appetite stimulant in the wasting syndrome of human immunodeficiency virus infection and is also useful for relieving phantom limb pain and menstrual cramps.  It has also been helpful in treating glaucoma, nausea from chemotherapy in cancer patients, epilepsy, arthritis, MS and spinal fluid injuries. <P>
	The problem, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said, remains among law enforcement and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which adamantly opposes any legalization of marijuana. <P>
	A bill is anticipated in Congress hopefully within this year or next to legalize marijuana use for medical purposes.  <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass said they have been contacted by Barney Frank and Pat Buchanan for input on possible legislation for debate by lawmakers. <P>
	"The problem we have now, is not telling senators to support us, privately, many of them already do, but to tell others.  Their problem is they don't know who to talk to," <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> said. <P>
	Other organizations advocating the legalization of marijuana for recreational use are also muddying up the issue, <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> claims.  "They're doing their ever loving best to help us at the same time they promote their cause, but we're not worried about that.  That's not what we stand for, that's not what we're after," he said. <P>
	While <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass hope that one day all of those suffering from illnesses have access to marijuana, their immediate mission remains smaller and much more personal.  Both would like to see their friend Ladd Huffman, a Vietnam veteran suffering from MS, and McMahon's daughter Linda, who also suffers from the same genetic disorder as her father, given permission to use marijuana for their illnesses.  Huffman was already approved as a marijuana patient for the same program that <a href="mailto:mmcmahon@trvnet.net">McMahon</A> and Douglass are in but the program was put on hold in 1992 and no one besides the eight already receiving marijuana were given the drug. <P>

<P>
	This has been going on for too many years now.  Local MS sufferer Barbara Douglass is again going to a rally at the capitol to plead for the legalized use of medicinal marijuana. <P>
	Despite all of the study, all of the talk and all of the need, lawmakers are still dragging their feet on this issue.  It seems both cruel and ridiculous. <P>
	Doctors have prescribed marijuana for relief of the pain that accompanies several chronic conditions, including AIDS.  Barbara Douglass can tell you what it has meant to her condition. <P>
	Dont get us wrong.  Marijuana is a drug.  We are not calling for it to be legalized for recreational use, or treated as anything less than a potent drug. <P>
	It should be controlled by doctors who can fully inform users of its benefits and limitations -- most definitely operation of a motor vehicle.  It should be controlled by prescriptions, as are so many important drugs with much stronger effects on the body.  And like other prescription drugs, the laws should stomp hard on those who obtain or use it illegally. <P>
	We must get to that point where we can separate marijuana as a prescription medicine from the war on drugs, which we continue to support with all of our hearts.  We can accept the former without giving an inch on the latter. <P>
	Once again, they will rally this August on the steps of the capitol, while the people who work in there ignore the plea. <P>
	How in the world can the federal government and state board of pharmacy examiners expressly approve of the use of medicinal marijuana for relief of Barbara Douglass condition, then deny it to others with the same condition or those similar in terms of chronic pain and debilitation? <P>
	Maybe it is the politicians blocking this use who need a medicinal dose... <P>
	Of compassion. <P>

Press Release:                                      Contact:   Carl Olsen
November 23, 1995                                              515-262-6957
</b></pre>
<h1><center>Iowa Legislative Survey Results</center></h1>
<pre><b>     Iowans for Medical Marijuana sent a Legislative Questionnaire to each 
of the 100 members of the Iowa House of Representatives and to each of the 
50 members of the Iowa Senate.  Our questionnaire asked: "Will you lend 
your support in demanding that the Federal Government allow Iowans with 
legitimate medical needs to use marijuana for medical purposes?"  We 
received 43 replies from the Iowa House of Representatives (43%), and 16 
replies from the Iowa Senate (32%).  10 of those responding in the Iowa 
House of Representatives were in favor of our proposal, 21 of those 
responding were unsure, and 13 of those responding were opposed.  10 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor of our proposal, 5 were 
unsure, and 2 were opposed.  The results seem to better than last year.  
Last year, 3 of those responding in the Iowa House of Representatives were 
in favor of our proposal, 7 were unsure, and 8 were opposed, while 7 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor, 3 were unsure, and none 
were opposed.  The response to the survey was much better this year than 
last year.

     Carl Olsen, coordinator for Iowans for Medical Marijuana, said, "We're 
doing a good job of educating the Legislature about the medical benefits of 
marijuana.  Many of them were unaware of the present conflict between state 
and federal law."  Since 1979, Iowa law has allowed prescription of 
marijuana.  Federal law has never allowed prescription of marijuana, but 
the federal government had been supplying marijuana to patients on a 
selective basis under a program of compassionate care.  In 1992 the federal 
government decided to stop accepting new applications for its compassionate 
care marijuana program.  Only eight Americans remain on the federal program 
and two of them live in Iowa.  Olsen said, "Health care should be a basic 
fundamental right for everyone, not just the eight people who now receive 
federally grown marijuana.  It's time the federal government stopped 
playing games with people's lives and allowed doctors to prescribe 
marijuana to all patients who need it."

     A federal bill, H.R. 2618, similar to Iowa's medical marijuana law, 
Iowa Code  124.206(7)(a), was introduced in the U.S. House of 
Representatives on Monday, November 13, 1995.

<TITLE>1994 Iowa Legislative Survey</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><FONT SIZE=6><B><CENTER>1994 Iowa Legislative Survey</CENTER></B></FONT><P>
     Last December, we sent a medical marijuana survey to all 150 members of the newly elected Iowa Legislature, asking for support for a resolution calling upon the federal government to make marijuana medically available by a doctor's prescription, and asking that the medical necessity defense be enacted into Iowa law.  Two Iowa Senators, Merlin Bartz (Republican, Grafton) and Elaine Szymoniak (Democrat, Des Moines), have agreed to draft legislation for us and have assigned interns to work on our suggestions.  We're extremely optimistic that at the least we will get a public hearing on our proposals in the Iowa Senate this year.  It would be extremely helpful if you'd sit down right now and write a letter to one or more of our supporters in the Iowa Senate expressing your support.  You can write to them at the Iowa Statehouse, Des Moines, Iowa 50319, or at their home addresses (listed below).
<P>
     Here are the responses we've received so far from our legislative survey:

<PRE>STATEMENT OF THE CASE

     In 1988, four residents of northwest Arkansas founded Our Church.  
They sent out letters to friends and neighbors they thought would want to 
be a part of Our Church.  The letters were unsigned. (Exhibit A 1,2).  
Rev. Tom Brown recieved these letters.  He immediately made photocopys of 
the letters - as instructed - and passed them to others who he thought 
would be interested.  The first person he took them to turned out to be 
one of the origional writers of the letters.  That person expressed 
interest, denied any knowlege of Our Church, and asked to be kept 
informed.  Rev. Brown heard rumors of someone trying to get permission 
from the local Unitarian Church to hold services there, but no more after 
that.
     In January of 1994, about the 10th, Rev. Brown awoke from a dream to 
a feeling of overwelming peace and expectation of great good fortune.  It 
was an unprecedented experience.  He felt like he had been touched by the 
hand of God.  He did not remember any details of the dream, just the 
extraordinary feeling upon awakening.  He located the letters several 
day's later while organizing his file cabinet.  He realized that Our 
Church was what the dream had been about.  It was time to stand up and 
start practicing his relationship with God openly, the way God intended.
     Rev. Brown owns a forty acre parcel of Ozark mountain property known 
as South Slope Farm.  He deeded one acre of that land to Our Church on 
February 14, 1994; the day we dedicate to Love, Valentines Day. (Exhibit B 
1,2).  He contacted all his friends and asked who would like to start Our 
Church with him - including the origional founders whom he still had not 
identified.  They all said they knew the Truth of Our Church, but were 
afraid of the persecution which Rev. Brown has come to know so well.  They 
refused to join openly, but each in their own way contributed something to 
getting Our Church organized.  Then he went to strangers and finally eight 
other folks signed the papers to start Our Church Incorporated, as a 
non-profit, religous corporation in the State of Arkansas. (Exhibit C 
1,2,3,4,5).  Although it is not required in the State of Arkansas they all 
agreed to a Statement of Purpose (C-5) which can not be changed except by 
unanimous agreement of all official members.
     The Deed to the acre of land owned by Our Church at Antioch Arkansas, 
is restricted by covenants as to the use of the land. (A-2)  Our Church 
Inc. is not so encumbered.  Each of the origional incorporators sought to 
establish their own branch of Our Church at their home location; or in the 
case of the Family Church of the New Dawn, preceeded the establishment of 
Our Church.  FCND was founded in 1982 in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Official 
membership in Our Church is established by a notorized statement submitted 
to the CEO of the Corporation, signifying intention to join Our Church 
Inc. and abide by the Statement of Purpose.  The purpose of Official 
membership is to become a public, open and living example of Our Church, 
so our Brothers and Sisters in God can take heart and begin to openly live 
their lives in keeping with their knowledge of the God of their own 
understanding and their Higher Power.
     On March 29, 1994, members of Our Church Inc. met with Washington 
County Sheriff Kenneth McKee and other law enforcement officials in 
Fayetteville, Arkansas.  They discussed the plans of Our Church at Antioch 
to plant and distribute herbs and plants given to us by God for our 
Spiritual discernment and Physical nourishment.
     On Easter Sunday, April 3, 1994, Our Church at Antioch, held it's 
first service and consecration of land. 
     On August 2, 1994, Rev. Brown was accosted by DEA agents and 
Sheriff's deputies while tending the garden at Our Church at Antioch.  
They attempted to murder him, and when that failed, they stole four 
hundred and thirty five marijuana plants and three peyote plants that were 
growing there.
     July 31, was the last regular service at Our Church at Antioch.  
Since then services for Washington County, Arkansas residents have been 
held at the Family Church of the New Dawn, 1027 Hickery St., Fayetteville, 
Arkansas.  Each member church of Our Church Inc. is financially and 
theologically independent of Our Church Inc.; founded and organized by the 
membership of that church.  This is a congregational organization similar 
to the Southern Baptist Convention.  Other branchs of Our Church are 
operating in Mt. Shasta, California; Boulder, Colorado; Oklahoma City, 
Oklahoma; Bee Branch, Atkins and Little Rock, Arkansas.
     On August 11, 1994, Rev. Brown was arrested and charged with growing 
marijuana and peyote, and possession of marijuana with intent to 
distribute in violation of Federal Law.  Rev. Brown insisted on the right 
to control his own case, and to not give over representation to an 
attorney, and requested the assistance of counsel.  Two seperate attorneys 
were appointed who refused to research or help Rev. Brown to research the 
law, to prepare motions, question witness's, etc. and were discharged by 
the court.  The third attorney recieved a threatening letter from the 
judge and sought to withdraw.  The judge appointed her as standby counsel 
and ordered her to not do the defendant's bidding.
     Rev. Brown attempted to testify to the Grand Jury and spent two days 
waiting while it met, but was refused.  An indictment was returned on 
September 14, 1994.  On November 4, 1994, Rev. Brown filed a motion to 
recuse the Judge based on Arkansas State Police documents which show Judge 
Waters to have been involved in a criminal conspiracy to smuggle drugs and 
move women around the country for purposes of prostitution in the 1970's 
prior to his appointment to the bench.  Judge Waters denied the motion.
     On November 8, 1994, the government filed a motion in limine which 
sought to deprive the defendant of all his defenses.  On November 28, 
1994, a hearing was held which resulted in Judge Waters finding that Our 
Church was a sincere establishment and exercise of religion, and that Rev. 
Brown's acts of growing marijuana and peyote were acts affected by the 
Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, and that the government had a 
compelling interest in prohibiting that act because Congress had passed a 
law with severe criminal penalties for violating the law.  Rev. Brown 
attempted to introduce documents and witnesses to show that the attitude 
of law enforcement had changed since the passage of the law, and that 
there had been a change in the scientific knowledge also, but Judge waters 
refused to review or entertain any such evidense or witnesses.  Rev. Brown 
properly protested.  Rev. Brown would have shown that there was no Federal 
Jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause for prosecuting Our Church of 
Antioch, Arkansas, and Rev. Tom Brown, but Judge Waters refused to allow 
any presentation of any issue except as to the question of the sincerely 
of Rev.  Brown's religous exercise.  Rev. Brown had attempted to obtain 
subpeona's for witnesses to the hearing, Judge Waters granted the 
subpoenas but then issued them for the wrong date, so the witnesses could 
not show up for the hearing.  Rev. Brown protested but Judge Waters 
refused to allow any correction to be made.  Rev. Brown attempted to 
introduce evidence and witnesses that Rev. Brown's acts were necessary to 
prevent a greater evil, a necessity defense, but Judge Waters refused to 
allow any such introduction into the record, or to allow the use of that 
defense.
     On October 25, 1994, Judge Waters wrote a letter to advising attorney 
Leslie Borgogoni in which he threatned to not reimburse her for expenses 
of the defense of Rev. Brown.  In response, she filed a motion for 
clarification of duties.  At the hearing on that motion, Rev. Brown 
protested the fact that it was not conducted ex parte.  His motion was 
overruled.  Borgogoni attempted to withdraw as advising counsel but Waters 
made her standby counsel instead.  He wrote a set of rules for her which 
specifically directed her to not perform any task at the direction of Rev. 
Brown until and unless he gave up his pro per status.
     On November 19, 1994, a criminal trial was held.  Rev. Brown was 
repeatedly stopped from presenting evidense and testimony in his defense.  
Judge Waters repeatedly interupted Rev. Brown and made disparaging remarks 
about him and his attempt to defend himself.  Although Waters had admitted 
that Rev. Brown was engaged in a sincere exercise of his religion, Rev. 
Brown was denied the right to present evidence of his religion, the 
Constitution, Natural Law, Common Law, and government documents related to 
the issues of compelling interest and least restrictive means.  On 
November 30, 1994, Rev. Brown was convicted and incarcerated without bail 
in the County Jail.
     Rev. Brown immediately attempted to get access to a law library in 
order to prepare motions for new trial, etc., but was denied that access 
until January 28, 1995.  By this time the time limit on motions had 
passed, and Waters overruled all motions on that basis.
     Rev. Brown has been denied a fair trial, due process in keeping with 
the published precedent of the Eighth Circuit, and the protection of the 
Constitution and the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  The 
prosecution of Rev. Brown for growing plants given to us by God, and 
giving away the leaves and flowers of those plants for free, no cost, no 
exchange, no renumeration whatsoever; exceeds Congressional powers granted 
by the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution.  In addition, Rev. 
Brown was unconstitutionally denied the assistance of counsel.  For all 
these reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and 
appropriate relief granted.
     In closing, Rev. Brown notes that he has been forced to prepare this 
brief without the assistance of counsel, and he requests that a liberal 
construction and interpretation be given to this document.

<PRE>STATEMENT OF INTRODUCTION

     The Defendent / Appellant, Rev. Tom Brown Pro Per, seeks to introduce 
this appeal by casting the eye of the Court on some issues that should be 
kept in mind as the Court considers the case at hand.  This case is only 
one in a long series of battles of the vaunted War on Drugs.  As in any 
war, looking back over the past thirty years, we can see lots of 
casualties.  The question is, how many more bodies will be heaped on the 
Alter of National Paranoia ?  A wise man once said that those who refuse 
to learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.  Perhaps the Court could 
look at another war we waged on ourselves, another war bred in ignorance 
and fed on lies and corruption.
     In Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. at page 700, Justice Taney 
announces the decision of the Court saying:

        "The question before us, is whether the class of persons
   described in the plea of abatement compose a portion of this
   people and are constituent members of this sovereignty.  We
   think they are not, and that they are not included under the
   word citizen in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none
   of the rights and priveleges which that instrument provides
   for and secures to citizens of the United States.  On the con-
   trary, they were at that time considered as a subordinate and
   inferior class of beings, who had been subjugated by the dom-
   inant race, and whether emancipated or not, yet remained sub-
   ject to their authority, and had no rights or priveleges but
   such as those who held power and the government might grant
   them.
        It is not the providence of the Court to decide upon the
   justice or injustice, the policy or the impolicy of these laws.
   The decision of that question belonged to the political or
   law making power; to those who formed the sovereignty and
   framed the Constitution.
        The language of the Declaration of independence is equa-
   lly conclusive.  It proceeds to say; 'We hold these truths to
   be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are
   endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
   among them is life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness;
   that to secure these rights, governments are instituted, deri-
   ving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'...
        The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the
   whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instru-
   ment at this day, would so be understood.  But it is too clear
   for dispute, that the enslaved African race were not intended
   to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed
   and adopted this declaration; . . ."

     The Court will see these words again in the decisions which have 
refused to recognize the religous use of plants.  Not all courts have 
refused to recognize over 5,000 years of recorded human history, but the 
words of those who have are redolent with the scent of the Dred Scott 
decision, and the bodies of those who perished in the attempt to make up 
for the cowardice of the Dred Scott court.  Time after time those courts 
strain to justify the denial of rights which no man can claim did not 
exist and were not exercised among the peoples who wrote the Declaration 
and the Constitution.  And as Justice McLean's dissent shows below, 
despicable and vile acts perpetrated by men who happen to occupy positions 
of power are not unprecedented.  There was no Truth to the assertion that 
"no one thought of disputing" the issue of slavery at the time of the 
revolution.  There was no Truth to the statement that "they formed no part 
of the people who framed and adopted this Declaration."  In fact:

        "Crispus Attucks, a Negro, was the first man killed by
   the British in the Boston Massacre.  The five thousand Negro
   soldiers who fought in the revolution . . .  Three quarters of
   the Rhode Island Regiment passing in review at Yorktown in
   1781 were Negroes. (Afro-American Encyclopedia, 1974)

But this truth was known in 1856 as we see in Justice McLean's dissent:

        "In the Convention, it was proposed by a committee of
   eleven to limit the importation of slaves to the year 1800,
   when Mr. Pickney moved to extend the time to the year 1808.
   This motion carried . . .  In Opposition to the motion, Mr.
   Madison said; 'Twenty years will produce all the mischief
   that can be apprehended from the liberty to import slaves;
   so long a term will be more dishonerable to the American
   character than to say nothing about it in the Constitution'
   Madison Papers.
        But we know as a historical fact that James Madison, that
   great and good man, a leading member in the Federal Convention,
   was solicitous to guard the language of that instrument so as
   not to convey the idea there could be property in Man."

     So the lies and deceit of the Taney majority went on to result in a 
war of unprecedented proportion on this soil.  More died in it than in 
WWI, WWII, Korea, and Vietnam combined.  And we paid a hard price for that 
clever though despicable interpretation of History and precedent.  The 
question is posed here, what price will this Court chose to be paid.  The 
Rev. Brown comes to this Court as a Man of Honor, with empty hands and 
outstretched arms.  Rev. Brown comes before this Court as the result of an 
act of conscience, inspired by the Holy Spirit of God.  The Court is 
refered to the words of James Michner, in his book Covenent.  As we 
listen, a young African is asking an old adviser as to the choice of 
weapons he should carry;

        "How do I protect myself ?"
        "Integrity is a good shield.  He paused.  Did I ever come
   armed to your fathers krall ?  Couldn't he have killed me in a
   moment if he wished?  Why didn't he?  Because he knew that if he
   killed a Man of Honor, he'd soon have on his hands, men with
   none.  And then the whole thing falls apart. (pg. 91)

     Later in the book, another character is remembering her brother who 
became a spy and sold the secrets of the government.

        "When she tried to decipher how he had been seduced into
   committing his mortal sin - the betrayal of his nation and his
   peers - she began to think of the role words play in life.  Our
   family was keen on word games.  Wexton and I played them const-
   antly.  I think I first came to suspect him when he cheated one
   day.  Altered the meaning of a word in order to win.  At Cambridge
   he altered the meanings of great words and ended a traitor.
   Back in Salisbury, walking within the shadow of the Cathedral,
   she thought: Integrity in words protects integrity in life.
   If a word is corrupted, everything that stems from it will be
   evil."

     And so it is that we have evil in our own time, and in our own place. 
A creeping, seductive evil that knows every nook and cranny of the 
administrative, legislative and judicial branch of government.  And it is 
born in a series of little lies, lies told, lies repeated, and lies which 
become the bricks of the foundation of our life.  And the question is, 
will this Court end the lies.
     There are already over ten million marajuana felons in our nation.  
We outnumber all the judges, prosecutors, police, drug bureaucrats, and 
military by about two to one.  How much longer will thirty perceent of our 
population be treated as a "subordinate and inferior class of beings . . . 
(who) had no rights or priveleges but such as those who held power and the 
government might grant them."  How much longer will we be expected to 
suffer in peace while the abuses of our rights continue unabated?  How 
much longer will the courts decide questions of the burdening of religous 
establishment and exercise one way for the Roman Catholic Church, and 
another for Our Church ?  Is it too soon to address the question, is the 
issue not ripe enough ?  You can dam the river, but you can't stop the 
rain.  Please, for God's sake and our own, stop the lies and live in the 
truth !

<PRE>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT:

     The trial court found that Rev. Brown could not submit evidence as to 
his religious establishment and exericse, to the jury.  The court based 
it's decision on the Fifth Circuit's decision in 1967, in Leary v. U.S., 
383 F.2d 851.  In doing so, the court ignored all the precedent to 
compelling interest and least restrictive means developed since Reynolds 
v. U.S., 98 U.S. 244 in 1878.  Even more significant of it's prejudice, 
the court refused to recognize the established precedent of the Eighth 
Circuit in Warner v. Graham, 675 F.Supp. 1177, in 1987 and a half dozen 
decisions reached under the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 
including the Eighth Circuit decision in Rust v. Clarke, 851 F.Supp. 377 
in 1994.
     The trial court summarily dismissed all defenses advanced by Rev. 
Brown regarding Natural Law, Common Law, the Declaration of Independence, 
the U.S. Constitution, Necessity, and the lack of Federal powers under the 
Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, without allowing any showing 
of evidense, testimony, or argument.  In doing so it abused its discretion 
and deprived Rev. Brown of even a shadow of a fair trial under DUE 
PROCESS.
     The trial court threatened Rev. Brown's assisting attornney in a 
letter dated October 25, 1994.  The court refused to hold a hearing on a 
motion for clarification of attorneys duties ex parte which is required as 
this is a matter of attorney client privelege.  The trial court created 
rules for standby counsel which substantially deprived Rev. Brown of the 
assistance of counsel.  This constitutes an abuse of discretion on the 
part of the trial court.
     The trial court refused to question two jurors who were overheard 
discussing the case and making disparaging remarks about the defendant on 
a break the second day of trial.  The trial court refused to substitute 
the extra jurrors for these two prejudiced jurors and substantially 
deprived Rev. Brown of Due Process.
     For all these reasons, Rev. Brown has been deprived of his 
constitutional rights and has been deprived of Due Process.  For these 
reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and appropriate 
relief granted to him.

<CENTER><H3>New developments and updates from the ACIJ</H3></CENTER>

<HR WIDTH=100%>

<H3>WELCOME TO THE ACIJ</H3>
<PRE></PRE>
This news page sets out some of the main activities of the Centre over 1995 and more recent times, and indicates some future directions. The news page will be updated as time permits and developments occur.<P>
Over the past year, there has been a steady stream of publications, seminars, books, courses and education resources put out by the Centre, all helping to raise the profile of journalism teaching at UTS.<P>
The Centre receives infrastructure support and subcontracting work for student publications from the University, but no direct funding, Salaries and running costs are paid for largely out of earnings from sales of publications, seminar fees, etc. Ideas and offers on funds for the Centre are invited. All donations are tax deductible.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Awards to the Centre</H3>

In a clean sweep for the ACIJ, the Journalism Education Association in 1995 awarded its four annual prizes for print journalism to the Centre's two serial publications, Reportage and Snoop. The national Osmar White Awards for Student Journalism are made in tribute to the veteran war journalist. Snoop investigative journalism magazine was jointly awarded Best Student Publication for its second issue which focussed on the private investigation industry and privatisation of public services. A story it carried on the privatisation of prisons was awarded Best Postgraduate News Feature. In Reportage Media Bulletin, a story on a long forgotten document on the cost of the Olympics won Best News Story, while the cover story of issue No 3 on media harassment of a sex discrimination witness won the Best Undergraduate News Feature.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Reportage Media Bulletin</H3>

Reportage is Australia's only magazine looking at the work and performance of journalists, together with research on journalism practice. Reportage has published research on journalism issues including the sources used by Australia's foreign correspondents, the nature of reporting of Aboriginal deaths in custody, and the media representation of the Mabo debate. Student pieces in the magazine have won two JEA awards in 1995. The public response to the magazine has been impressive. Some recent reader feedback includes "most interesting" from Prof Noam Chomsky, and "excellent" from John Pilger. Subscribers are welcome. <P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Snoop</H3>

Snoop is a magazine of investigative journalism, and is produced twice a year primarily by journalism students in the "Publications: Techniques and Practice" class. Snoop is a competitive outlet for high quality journalism from UTS student journalists. The magazine itself and an article from it won two prizes in the JEA awards last year. The magazine has undergone a major redesign with the current issue, and consideration is being made for changing its style further during 1996. <P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Hidden Stories Seminar Series:</H3> 
<H4>The death of 'truth' on East Timor</H4>

On 16 October 1995, the Centre held a seminar to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing of five Australia-based journalists in Balibo, East Timor, and the killing on 8 December 1975, of another Australian journalist in Dili. Extensive media coverage resulted in part from the ACIJ seminar. The Centre also published a new booklet, titled 'The Balibo Incident in Perspective', by former Australian consul to Dili, James Dunn, who wrote: "The killing of the journalists was undoubtably the worst and the most wanton act of its kind in the history of Australian journalism". The booklet became the focus of much media and government attention. Copies are still available.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Young People and the Media Seminar</H3>

The Centre held a sell-out seminar at the State Parliament House theatrette in November 1995, to examine the effects of the media reporting on young people. The Centre has previously published detailed research on how young people are portayed in the media. It attracted high-profile journalists and media producers, as well as many young people and youth workers. A joint project with Sydney City Council, the seminar brought together those on both sides of the cameras (and pens) to develop an alternative way of reporting young people. A publication is planned.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Signposts to Asia and the Pacific</H3>

This AusAID-supported project is a World Wide Web information database, on which Chris Conlon has been working half-time since June 1995 with Anna-Marie Antonio recently joining as a part-time researcher. The database will provide hard-to-get information primarily on countries of our region, in what will become a major tool for Australian journalists. Wendy Bacon and Alan Knight are principal researchers on the Project Team. The project is due for completion in June 1996.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>George Munster Award for Freelance Journalism</H3>

This national award for freelance journalism is administered by the Centre and was presented at a small ceremony in November. This year the $1,000 award was won by Jim Colman for a series of articles on urban planning and design issues published in The Sydney Review. A special commendation was also given to Jill Margo for her series on mens health in the Sydney Morning Herald. It is the tenth year the award has been made, and it is advertised nationally each year in July. It is Australia's only national award for freelance journalism.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Continuing Education Program</H3>

Our program of continuing education courses has been developed by Bonita Mason, the Centre's continuing education officer. These professional development courses have proved popular with journalists and others wanting to both polish and develop new skills. Courses conducted have included: Feature Writing; Sub-editing for Print Journalists; Power Searching for Media Professionals; Journalism for Organisations; Journalism for Community Groups; and Publishing on the Web. The 1996 schedule of courses is available on from our ACIJ homepage.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Internet Research Project</H3>

A Vice-Chancellor's Development Fund grant is being used to develop internet-based journalism research. Research has commenced to assess internet access and useage as well as conduct story and background research and to develop contacts. The difficulties and opportunities of internet-based research have been established and a journalism research project is underway.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Relationship with University of Papua New Guinea</H3>

The visit to PNG by Peter Cronau in June 1995 allowed the Centre to initiate a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information in Development (SPCenCIID) at the University of Papua New Guinea (UPNG) and the ACIJ. The draft MOU allows for co-operation on a number of levels between UPNG and UTS. For example, selected articles from the UPNG journalism students' newspaper, Uni Tavur, will shortly be appearing on the ACIJ Internet Site. In August Associate Professor Wendy Bacon visited UPNG to teach in their new Graduate Certificate in Investigative Journalism. A UPNG book on the media in the Pacific area is being distributed in Australia by the Centre.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Nius Bilong Pasifik</H3>  

'Nius Bilong Pasifik' is a book on the media in the Pacific region, published by the University of Papua New Guinea Press and distributed in Australia by the ACIJ. The book includes a chapter on the media coverage of the conflict on Bougainville. It is a book 'unique in its topic and scope', so one reviewer said.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Under Pressure: the Asia Pacific Media</H3>

The Centre is to publish in April 1996 a book with the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA) and the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), titled 'Under Pressure: the Asia Pacific Media', with contributions from a wide range of Asia and Pacific journalists and researchers. This has developed from an IFJ/MEAA conference held in Sydney in 1995.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Books in development</H3>

Three books are presently in development. In early manuscript form is one book on Sources and another on Media Accountability. Being finalised is 'Everybody's Business', a resource book on company and land searches.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>Visitors to the Centre</H3>

The Centre is the focus of overseas visitors interested in journalism education. We have recently hosted visits from journalists, editors, researchers and educators from Singapore, the Solomon Islands, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, the USA, Canada, Britain, Hong Kong, and student journalists from Brazil and Spain.<P>
<PRE></PRE>

<H3>How you can help</H3>

The Centre needs support in many ways and everyone can assist. For example there is a 10% discount available for a limited period on several publications the Centre has including 'Nius Bilong Pasifik' and our library research guide 'Mastering the Maze'. Please consider giving these and other ACIJ publications as gifts. We are also looking for new people for our Continuing Education Program. If you have ideas that you think the Centre may be interested in, tell us. <P>
ACIJ NEWS PAGE will be a regular feature our web site outlining our ideas, projects and directions. Look in on us again soon.

On 20 September 1996, Kalafi Moala, editor of the "Tonga Times", deputy editor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, and a Member of Parliament, 'Akilisi Pohiva, were found in contempt of Parliament and sentenced to 30 days in jail. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The decision by the mainly unelected Legislative Assembly, was in regard to the publication in the newspaper's September 4 edition of a planned notice of impeachment intended to have Justice Minister Tupou removed from office for allegedly accepting a Parliamentary allowance while visiting the Atlanta Olympic Games for which he also had no formal permission of the Assembly to attend.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The motion of impeachment had not in fact been tabled as the newspaper report stated. It was finally tabled on September 23, and the Assembly then voted that the Minister has a case to answer. Formal impeachment proceedings may now follow.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
On October 2, the Tongan Parliament was closed until July 1997 by the Cabinet, citing absences and pressure of other business. Accordingly, the impeachment proceedings cannot proceed till then. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In the meantime, the journalists and the MP remain in the custody of jail authorities.

October 15, 1996.  A decision handed down by the Supreme Court in Tonga yesterday means that the jailed Tongan journalists are now free. The court ruled that the journalists, jailed for contempt of Parliament on September 20, had been detained illegally. David Robie reports on the decision for the <A HREF="/../cafepacific/resources/david_aspac.html">Asia-Pacific Network</A>.

Images of East Timor representing the period 1942 to 1996.</p>

The pictures present only a sample of an exhibition put together by Dr Andrew McNaughton, titled</p><br> <h2>"Betrayed, But Not Beaten"</h2></p><br>

This exhibition was displayed as part of the Oporto Conference in Sydney in June 1996 and has been on display at the New South Wales Parliament building (Sydney) and in Parramatta.  In late 1996 the exhibition will tour Malaysia and the Phillipines.</p>

Photographers whose work was displayed included: Damian Parer, Elaine Briere, Penny Tweedie, Oliver Strewe, Mike Richardson, Peter Rodgers, Jenny Groves, Ross Bird, Steve Cox and Max Stahl, as well as organisations such as Reuters (NY), 'Sydney Morning Herald' and the Melbourne 'Age'.</p>

Enquiries about the exhibition should be directed to Dr Andrew McNaughton, PO Box 751, Darlinghurst  NSW  2010, Australia.</p><br><br>

THE BALIBO INCIDENT IN PERSPECTIVE</B></FONT><BR>
by James Dunn
<BR><IMG VSPACE=1 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The deaths of five Australian-based journalists in Balibo, East Timor, on 16 October 1975 was "undoubtably the worst and the most wanton act of its kind in the history of Australian journalism," writes James Dunn, former Australian diplomat. The prior knowledge of the Australian government to the impending Indonesian invasion of East Timor meant that the journalist's deaths were covered-up and have been to this day. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=4>"Making a Difference" looks at how infotainment news values, like 'conflict', have dominated coverage of Aboriginal and ethnic issues in the Australian media. <p>The video gives a voice to those affected by negative coverage, and shows how perceptions of indigenous and ethnic people have been shaped. <p>The video concludes that by balancing traditional news values with empowering images, it is possible to make news positive. </font>

<FONT SIZE=+3><B>'Powers and Prospects: <BR>Reflections on Human Nature and the Social Order'
<BR><IMG VSPACE=1 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR> 
By Professor Noam Chomsky</B></FONT>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=1 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR><BR>
<font size=+2>"The reason for official secrecy is, as usual, hatred of democracy: fear that the primary enemy, the domestic public, might not appreciate what is being done in their name and with their money."</font>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=1 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR><BR>
<BR><IMG HSPACE=6 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif">
<font size=+1>Noam Chomsky has been described as "the world's greatest dissident" and "arguably the most important intellectual alive". For 30 years, his dissident views have alerted an increasingly concerned public to the true nature of power. His perceptive descriptions of how the public is excluded from decision making and policy formation, provide new insights into major events in the world today. 
<BR><IMG HSPACE=6 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif">From East Timor to the Middle East, from the nature of democracy to our place in the natural world, from the intellectual responsibility of writers to anarchic visions, from international politics to the politics of language, 'Powers and Prospects: Reflections on Human Nature and the Social Order' provides a scathing critique of orthodox views, the media and government policy. 
<BR><IMG HSPACE=6 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif">Chomsky lifts the veil of lies diverting the public from knowledge of the heinous acts being committed in their name. He reveals how the 'new' world order is a re-marketing of the same old disorder. Chomsky's refreshingly clear views of the world and the nature of things are supported by a wealth of detail.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=6 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif">The works contained in 'Powers and Prospects' reflect the latest thinking of Chomsky on a broad range of themes. The book is developed from a series of addresses he delivered to sellout audiences on his 1995 visit to Australia.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=6 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif">Noam Chomsky is Professor of Linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, USA, and is an internationally acclaimed philosopher, scholar and political activist. His many books include 'The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism', 'Towards a New Cold War', 'The Culture of Terrorism', 'Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media', 'Deterring Democracy', 'Year 501: The Conquest Continues', and 'World Orders: Old and New'.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=1 SRC="/resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The three copies of Noam Chomsky's new book, 'Powers and Prospects', have been won in our competition which closed on 10 April 1996.
<BR>The winners are 
Robert Roche from Palmyra in Western Australia; P Taylor, from Brisbane, Australia; and David White from Bradford, England.
<BR>The answer to the question "What did then Foreign Minister Gareth Evans say about Chomsky?" is, of course, Chomsky "should confine himself to linguistics".
<BR>Congratulations to the winners and thanks to all those who entered our competition. We got over 70 replies with lots of late entries too.
<BR>To those who didn't win you can still order your copy of the book by using the form below.

The day of the western foreign correspondent is almost over. The safari suited reporter who interprets Asian events and files his stories down crackling telephone lines already exists more in the minds of adventure novelists than in the electronic reality of the late twentieth century. News no longer moves in one direction, back to the Western metropolis on linear cables. Instead, journalists across the world are increasingly bound together in a seamless web of information which covers almost everyone and everything, from the glass towers of Hong Kong to the jungles of Cambodia. It follows that any discussion of the future of international reporting must go beyond the metropolis and its neo-Orientalist preconceptions; it must also consider un-western perspectives of News.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Bouncing the News</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Journalists can no longer hide behind national boundaries, ignoring the impact of their reporting on neighbouring countries. Satellite television, interactive news services, improved telephone and fax services and the internet do not acknowledge border checkpoints, challenging politicians' attempts to censor or direct news. But these new technologies, spread by rapidly rising affluence, also allow wrong or insensitive reports to bounce rapidly around the region's media, encouraging disharmony and discrimination. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Reports of a racist politician receiving support in Australia can be transmitted instantly to audiences across the ASEAN nations, threatening negotiated trade and diplomatic arrangements. Asian governments which may not themselves espouse media freedoms can choose to interpret such reports as evidence to support caricatures of Australians as unreconstructed white supremacists. Australian reporters meanwhile can be characterised as "congenital liars" by Asian politicians seeking to bolster sagging domestic political support. Reports detailing ruling family corruption in Jakarta can likewise be regarded as a direct insult to the national interest and constructive international diplomacy.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Fiction or Friction</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Australia which has the longest tradition of a free press in the region, is in danger of being unfairly castigated for its journalists' robust approach to reporting, if not their insensitivities to non-Western cultures. Australian working journalists' lack of self-analysis means that many assume that value systems which they learn in Australia are universal. When foreign correspondents with such views arrive in south east Asia, this ignorance of "other" media procedures, can be interpreted as cultural arrogance. The collision between differing  journalism value systems can result in what  Singapore's Senior Minister, Lee Kuan Yew calls "friction". Australian journalists' long held identification with what they call Western interests and what many Asians identify  as the old colonial powers make them easy targets for increasingly well connected and articulate Asian critics. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Even conservative news organisations recognise the need for change. The former Editor in Chief of The Australian , Paul Kelly, said that  Australian journalists should try to be sensitive to cultural differences, as a matter of professionalism:
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>

<TD>"I think that we still find it difficult in as much as our cultural predilections are to the  United States and to the UK, and we must continue to cover those parts of the world because they're important in their own right and their certainly very much the areas of interest for a lot of our readers. But by the same token it's enormously important for us to expand and improve our coverage of Asia far more than what we've been able to do. I think this is going to be an ongoing and difficult challenge for the Australian media."

Australians are coming to understand what many Asians have long recognised. Negative and stereotypical reporting is not only inaccurate and ethically wrong; it can have a direct and rapid impact on national economies as well as international relations.  Singaporean consumers can easily choose other than "racist" Aussie beef. Malaysians can send their children to someone else's universities. Wealthy Indonesians can do their Christmas shopping in Hong Kong instead of Sydney.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Attacks on the ABC and SBS signal a crisis for the independence of Australia's public broadcasting system. The Australian Centre for Independent Journalism held a public seminar in August to discuss the situation. This report by Sumegha Agarwal.</FONT>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=5 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<IMG HEIGHT=32 ALT="T"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/../resources/T_cap.gif">he present crisis in public broadcasting arises out of three recurring questions surrounding public broadcasting. These are questions of effective control or editorial independence, the changing role of a national broadcaster, and the issue of continued funding for a public broadcaster.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">While these questions get discussed, the process of doing so is eating into the very fundamentals of public broadcasting.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">The spectre around role of public broadcasting is raised so much that it could mean facilitating the breach of an election promise by the present government. In his election campaign, Prime Minister John Howard committed in the party manifesto on public broadcasting to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding and triennial funding for the ABC and SBS. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">

<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">On July 16, the Minister for Communications and Arts, Senator Alston, announced that ABC funding will be immediately reduced by 2 per cent, and for the next financial year will be reduced by a further $55 million with no further guarantees beyond that. SBS too is groaning under a 2 per cent cut to its budget.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">The budget cuts have angered and frustrated thousands of people in the country and thus while 30,000 thronged the Domain in Sydney on August 4 to raise their voice in support of the ABC, at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), journalists, journalism students and journalism educators assembled one morning, on August 15, to discuss the crisis in public broadcasting. The seminar was organised by the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism (ACIJ) at UTS, and was chaired by Alan Knight, Director of the ACIJ.

<IMG HEIGHT=32 ALT="L"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/../resources/L_cap.gif">iz Jacka, a media analyst and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences at UTS, Quentin Dempster of the ABC's 7.30 Report, Jeune Pritchard, Talks Editor with the ABC's Radio National, and Daniela Thorsch, of SBS TV's Insight current affairs program, discussed their concerns about public broadcasting.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">On the role of public broadcasting Dempster quoted Robert Hughes's analysis of American culture which identified the lack of a mainstream public broadcasting system in the USA as a contributing factor to the collapse of social cohesion in that society. Referring to the Port Arthur massacre where Howard announced that Australia would not be following America in its gun culture perversity, Dempster said if Howard does not take a similar un-American course when deciding on the future of public broadcasting in Australia "it will be a national tragedy."

<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">

<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">Robert Hughes has argued that in an American context, Nixon, Reagan and Bush had aggressively attacked the American public broadcasting system. Dempster said, in an Australian context, one could delete Nixon, Reagan and Bush and insert Fraser, Hawke, Keating and Howard. The agenda is to marginalise the ABC, to continue the strangulation of funding under Hawke and Keating.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">Dempster argued the Howard government has no mandate from the public to interfere with the ABC, when a Senate select committee headed by Senator Richard Alston last year concluded "that the basic structure of the ABC is sound and that the need for a quality national broadcaster is greater today than it was a decade ago."
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">Now this same person, in his new capacity as Minister for Communications and Arts has announced a review of the ABC Charter, into its role and functions. The standing of the Alston committee findings is now uncertain.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">

<BR><IMG HEIGHT=32 ALT="J"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/../resources/J_cap.gif">eune Pritchard argues that the outcome of the Bob Mansfield review can be predicted. The ABC has accepted a $55 million cut next year, and is likely to see a collapsing of the networks. Pritchard considers the existence and survival of public radio as a national issue. "It is a issue in this country. It is about cultural and intellectual life in this country."
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">Liz Jacka said, "The present attacks behove us to think very carefully about how public service broadcasting serves the whole community and to think about those sections of the community that don't use public service broadcasting, and about the role of public service broadcasting in this particular time."
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">Alan Knight said,"It's simply not possible to insulate news and current affairs, as their wider organisations go into tail spins." Less competition caused by less resources devoted to public broadcasting would inevitably mean less of the specialised reporting needed to cover increasingly complex issues in a faster moving world, Knight added.

"The SBS newsroom is one of the best equipped newsrooms in the country. But there is no one in it anymore," said Daniela Thorsch. "You can go in and throw something and you would not hit anybody, all you will is the pot plants which are about to be taken away because they are too expensive.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">"The cuts that have happened at SBS are far greater than 2 per cent. The reason is that our entire budget is far too small for what we are attempting to do. We have this constant problem of taking on new programs, new ideas, new directions and not having the money to fund them."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<IMG HEIGHT=32 ALT="A"ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/../resources/A_cap.gif">ccording to Thorsch, the budget cut means losing around 75 people out of a total staff of 766. "On top of that almost all the freelancers and all the casuals have been put off. All the people who are working there are trying to hold the whole thing together, people are going down like flies. The greatest staff loss is happening among journalists in television and radio - people who make programs, who contribute to doing what we're meant to be doing." 
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">Thorsch said the Budget cuts could mean reducing the quality of what is being produced now  meaning fewer documentaries and in-depth programs, and less variety. "People are feeling helpless, hopeless, alienated. The redundancy process has been very painful and morale sapping. They worry 'will we be merged with the ABC?' I cant see that the ABC can even contemplate any such expansion, given the problems they have themselves."
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">News and current affairs programming has had many changes to accommodate the budget cuts. The focus has now shifted to international news and the future of locally produced programs like Insight is very uncertain.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">In the middle of all these redundancies, said Thorsch, a lot of money is being put into capital and equipment development. A new TV studio and a child care centre have been approved recently, and digital television is looming.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>

<IMG VSPACE=3 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

This submission has been collated from contributions from  members of the Department of Social Communication and Journalism at UTS and the Centre for Independent Journalism following discussions between members and with students. It is specifically concerned with the reporting of news and current affairs at the ABC and is based on extensive practitioner and academic experience in the field by all contributors.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The submission identifies a series of concerns by the contributors that we seek to have taken into account by the ABC Review. It is organised around the Inquiry's Terms of Reference with a special focus on news and current affairs in Section 3 (a). It concludes with seven summary recommendations.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

News and current affairs are central to  nine of the 11 radio, television and multi-media services provided by the ABC. The work of journalists, therefore, is integral to the interpretation and delivery of these services according to the current ABC Charter. A  particular form of professional journalism has developed at the ABC that has little currency in the commercial sector. It has been shaped and cultivated by its statutory standing as an independent and public institution and by specific requirements of the Charter. In taking seriously its commitment to the development of public affairs and ethical journalism, the ABC has developed forms of journalistic practices that have fostered the innovation of cultural representations, various genres of public affairs and the application of diverse informational technologies.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

As the Terms of Reference clearly state, the inquiry is required to review all ABC services and Mr Bob Mansfield has clearly stated his intention to rewrite the ABC's Charter (The Australian. August 23, 1996). Since this inquiry was established, there has been marked restructuring by current management including  substantial reductions in the staffing, resourcing and presentation of ABC news and current affairs.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR> 

This submission argues that recommendations from this Review  can provide the grounds to interrupt the current approach to restructuring  at the ABC and recommend a series of changes to the government and to the broadcaster that address the Review's terms of reference without striking at the broadcaster's  core news and current affairs functions.

<H3>REVIEW OF ABC FUNCTIONS</H3>

<H3>Section 1.</H3>

This submission argues that national news and current affairs and related programming is the central aspect of the ABC's focus and effectivity which is directed towards developing the public life and dialogue about Australian society and Australia's role in the world. Any refinement of the scope of current ABC activities need to ensure the enhancement and not the reduction of these public life services.

<H3>Section 2.</H3>

The importance of the ABC's presence as a non-commercial broadcasting sector has been heightened under current government policy objectives. The Broadcasting Services Act, 1992 is concerned primarily with providing for competitive commercial services and has severely reduced directive regulation in programming services. Given this context - and in light of the anticipated outcome of accelerated competition from the Government's 1997 inquiry into commercial broadcasting  under the Act - the role of the ABC in providing programming that is not dependent on competitive markets is essential. Given this:

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

a) The ABC needs to review and enhance its historical role as a major innovator in programming and the use of new technologies.
Such a commitment to innovation requires risk-taking in the programming field that carries the possibilities of failure. It is this risk-taking which generates innovation, however, and constitutes the central difference between the public and commercial broadcasting sectors.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

b) In particular, the ABC needs to strengthen and diversify its forms of news and current affairs services. A strong national news and current affairs base acts not only to provide information but inspires the extension of public affairs across programming genres to feed locally produced programs such as comedy and drama.

<H3>Section 3.</H3>

a) This submission will concentrate largely on the following section with regard to the nature of ABC news and current affairs. It includes specific discussion pieces about different aspects of news and current affairs from various contributors and is organised as separate discussions about i)  independence,  ii)   accuracy,  iii)  impartiality and  iv)  comprehensiveness as identified in the terms of reference.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

i) Independent  news and current affairs require structural, political and cultural distancing from powerful influences that can shape news and current affairs. These include influences from commercial, professional and political sources. Given the inevitable restructuring of the ABC funding base and the reductions in public funding, major considerations are necessary.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=10 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">*Future funding options need to be structured to ensure they have no direct impact on the content of news and current affairs programming. There is clear evidence that direct commercial funding of media sources influences both editorial and marketing strategies in the commercial media sectors.  More indirect funding approaches, such as the example of Britain's Channel Four funding structure, provides an example of a commercial funding base that has implemented effective accountability measures for market influences. A similar policy approach in Australia, however, would require dramatic policy changes. 
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">*Journalists' own professional culture needs to be considered. It is important that sufficient resources are provided to ensure journalists can act and evaluate news and current affairs independently of other media sources and agendas (such as a dependence on AAP news service and ratings competition with commercial services). It therefore requires a cultural independence from intra-professional pressures to conform to new agendas that can only develop from a strongly resourced and institutionally supported foundation of independent journalistic practice.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">* It is important that the principle of ABC's funding be  clearly redefined as public  as distinct from political.   To overcome wide-spread concerns that the Review was convened as a form of political interference, the inquiry needs to be specific and judicious in its definitions of the terms of reference and its subsequent recommendations for regulations and mechanisms to ensure clear distinctions between the ABC as a provider of 'public 'rather than directly 'political' services. The interpretation of the requirement for news and current affairs to be accurate, impartial and comprehensive, as discussed below, is an opportunity for just such clarifications.

ii) Accurate  news and current affairs requires extensively researched, documented,  factually correct and well-argued  information. Accurate news and investigations, therefore, requires a strong research base. This includes journalist access and training on the Internet, the provision of extensive and accessible library resources, and the expenses to cover extensive investigations of issues. Both journalists and library staff need to be able to have the time and resources to access commercial online databases such as DIALOG, AUSINET, LEXIS-NEXIS. It is only because the ABC has provided such a resource and training base up to now, that it has achieved its status as the standard bearer of professional, accurate and ethical journalism. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In particular, the ABC's historic achievements in  Investigative Journalism needs to be understood as a major incentive to provide a highly professional and well resourced news and current affairs department. The investigative role played by the ABC in Australian current affairs was clearly identified in a 1993 research project by the  Australian Centre for Independent Journalism.( The Journalism and The Law, ACIJ, 1993). The project found ABC television and radio to be Australia's major outlet for investigative journalism followed by The Age and Sydney Morning Herald newspapers.  In examining 20 individual investigative stories across Australia between 1989 and 1992 , it was clear that very little substantial investigative journalism was pursued by commercial television outlets or by News Ltd newspapers. Stories covered by the ABC alone included a Golden Walkley award winning program on Four Corners on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody which contributed to the establishment of a National Royal Commission. They also included reports on deaths caused by asbestos and an exposure of scientific fraud. These and many other stories had been originally seen by researchers in commercial television who simply did not have the time, resources or editorial support to pursue the difficult issues or evidence involved. Necessary resources required for this form of journalism  can include seemingly minor details such as funding to meet interviewees  in order to assess credibility. Without a commitment to such detail, accuracy in news and current affairs cannot be sustained. Loss of this kind of resource support can lead to a professional culture that does not encourage or facilitate the 'pro-active' form of journalism required for innovative and accurate current affairs. Discouragement in such pro-active journalism has already been noted by some commentators about sections of ABC news that have been suffering cost-cutting for some time. This needs to be investigated and rectified immediately.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The Australian Centre for Independent Journalism and UTS's Department of Journalism broadly define investigative journalism as involving in-depth research and the publication of information and fresh perspectives which are socially significant. It is on the basis of the ABC's current affairs achievements that its programs  continue to be used as the benchmark for high quality journalism in Australian journalism schools as well as training centres overseas. The UTS department has about 40 undergraduates who major in Journalism each year and has the largest postgraduate journalism education department in Australia. In hand with other department's around the country, UTS draws heavily on ABC news and current affairs as a professional yardstick. Moreover, the University of Papua New Guinea's South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information in Development (SPCCID) also extensively uses ABC approaches to news and current affairs to formulate the foundations of their professional practice. It should remain a central consideration, therefore, that the ABC news and current affairs does not only provide important domestic and internation new, but also provides an essential educational resource  in other  countries in the development of quality journalistic professional practice.

iii) Impartial  journalism is one of the most contentious aspects of ABC news and current affairs and needs clear definition. The government has  openly criticised ABC news for 'bias' and, according to the SMH,  the new ABC Chair Donald McDonald was instructed by Communications Minister Richard Alston's department to instil <I>'higher standards of professionalism and integrity to provide a greater level of public confidence in the ABC's objectivity' </I>(our italics) (SMH July 13, 1996 p39).

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

It needs to be clearly understood that objectivity and impartiality have quite different meanings in journalistic practice. Public discussion around issues of bias at the ABC, however, has not fully recognised these differences. The way the inquiry defines what good professional practice in news and current affairs should be, provides an opportunity to distance itself from  allegations of political interference.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The notion of journalistic objectivity  needs to be understood as being rooted in the early development of professional practice in western journalism at the turn of the century. It is scientifically based and promotes the notion that the news sources can be quantitatively measured and delivered through definable techniques of data collation. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

This notion continues in certain public discourses of media criticism and is promoted particularly by institutions such as the political party system. This is because a technical idea of measurable media representations through content analysis is a quick and effective form of critique and defence in a marketing strategy that relies heavily on immediate responses to media reports.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Journalists and social scientists have for many years, however, been working to reformulate the principle of fairness in reporting to take account of the social context in which reporting occurs. What has emerged as the most commonly understood notion of fairness is that of impartiality  or balance.  These notions imply a series of value judgements which are made in the collation and presentation of public affairs material. These judgements depend on training and education. As a form of professional practice impartiality requires the practitioner to be able to argue they  shaped and presented their news in the most informed, well-researched and fairly-presented form possible. Whilst this approach may not always provide for an quantifiably equal representation of all interests involved, it may be the professional judgement of the journalist - ie made from a self-consciously reflective distance - that some interests require more extensive or more critical coverage than others. This approach recognises journalism as an evaluative and contextualised professional practice.  Rather than inhibiting this approach, a genuinely impartial  news service needs to ensure that the conditions and culture of reflective reportage is encouraged. This approach can be made explicit and accountable through  mechanisms such as implementable Codes of Standards or Ethics. Conflating the broad notion of impartiality to a notion of objectivity and its technical breaches of 'bias'  can only quell intelligible forms of professional practice and diminish the excellence of ABC news and current affairs.

iv) Comprehensive  news and current affairs services require a commitment to a range of audience needs that cannot be met by market mechanisms. Moreover, the provision of news and current affairs as a national service must be retained to ensure that the diversity of this comprehensive service is commonly shared by the various 'publics' that make up the nation and the domain of a national public affairs. This aspect of the submission focuses on three areas. First, it discusses diversity in domestic news, secondly, the restructuring of South East Asian news bureaux and thirdly, the use of multimedia to enhance news and current affairs services at the ABC.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">

<BR><IMG HSPACE=10 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">* A comprehensive national news service requires the representation of a great range of domestic sources  and issues, thereby ensuring strong and ongoing input into the provision of service by state and regional journalists. A comprehensive and diverse output can only be provided by a similarly comprehensive and diverse input. This needs careful practical consideration in light of the closures of regional offices currently underway and the reduction of specialist or 'round' reporting. Only through such structural and programming diversity  can news and current affairs give voice to many 'publics' who are denied access through commercial news. In particular, we can point to the ongoing criticism by organisations such as the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Death in Custody (1991), The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's national Inquiry into Racist Violence (1991) and the University of Technology, Sydney's Racism, Ethnicity and the Media Project (1994)  over reporting of indigenous Australian  affairs.  Whilst the ABC has lead Australian news and current affairs in addressing changes to the coverage of these issues, its committment to an interpretation of comprehensive   news and current affairs requires a specific definition in terms of providing media voices and services to people denied access by commercial programming.

<BR><IMG HSPACE=10 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">** The ABC's commitment to comprehensive reporting has ensured that it is the only news organisation that produces its own news from South-East Asia. Despite Government and Opposition agreement on the need to be better informed about the region to our north, most Australian based news organisation largely have used generic news produced by foreign owned international news services to report the region. While such agencies can be relied on to offer mainstream stories (particularly those of interest in New York, London and Paris), they cannot produce Australian specific stories which could be of great importance for Australian businesses, Government and community groups.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The ABC sought to address this problem by correctly making South East Asia a news priority and maintaining and expanding the most extensive network of Radio and Television news bureau in Asia (David Hill. 'Speech Notes', Sydney: ABC Corporate Relations. 27.3.94). ABC Foreign Correspondents were based in Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore (to be closed this year) and Bangkok, with part-time stringers located in Kuala Lumpur, Phnom Penh and Manila. In comparison, News Ltd which owned one national  and six metropolitan daily  newspapers (representing more than two thirds of metropolitan newspaper distribution in Australia), had only two correspondents in the region, both reporting for the national daily, the Australian.  Channel Nine had a British stringer operating under contract in Hong Kong. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

These centres are already under consideration for restructuring. Reorganising the news services in a way that continues to delivers excellence in international news could include:
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">- slowly replace the use of generalist reporters carrying country specific responsibilities with specialist reporters with a region wide brief, as does Asiaweek. Savings from closed bureaux could provide for country visits by the journalists who would largely work from Australia by telephone and the Internet.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">- expand the use of locally based casual journalists (stringers) who could be properly paid in light of savings from not having to supply expatriate accommodation.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">- Maintain key bureaux with long-term appointments rather than short-term contracts, a practice which has proven successful for the Far Eastern Economic Review.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">- Ensure that all appointments require proficiency in at least one Asian language.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">- Implement a training course which introduces all prospective foreign reporters and editors to the region's histories, cultures, politics and economies.
<BR><IMG HSPACE=8 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">- Nominate a sub-editor/producer to act as an Asian desk editor whose work is to ensure that stories from Asia are not displaced by ephemeral local, US or British sources stories as has been implemented by the West Australian.

<BR><IMG HSPACE=10 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif">***The ABC's commitment to the innovative use of new technologies and and their use in the development of news and current affairs services is well represented by  ABC Internet publishing and research. This week the ABC's online site is one year old. This site already demonstrates the ABC's commitment to not only providing forums for critical discussion and debate about new and emerging media technologies, but also to explore the potential of these media to serve new audiences or to  allow for new and productive kinds of interaction. Hot Chips was the first Australian television show to have its own Website. The http:// Website experimented with the ways in which a television program could interact with a Website, and vice-versa: 'a Website which drives a TV show, and a TV show which drives a Web-site. In addition, a 'radio incarnation' called Click-on was developed creating a particularly interesting media-mix. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In a related innovation, the ABC's 'Explore Your Interests' page shows another dimension in providing high quality information and entertainment services to the growing online community. Annonated lists which review relevant sources are organised and presented in a visually interesting way that help combat 'information overload'. The ABC has provided a significant and useful Internet presence that provides an excellent learning resource for Journalism students who are coming to terms with the problems and potential of new media technologies. It is the breadth and depth of content and research behind it that ensures that this Website does not degenerate into an irrelevant technology site.


<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

(b) This submission has argued that strong national news and current affairs services are foundational to the development of the range of social dialogues necessary to develop a national identity in a culturally diverse country like Australia. It provides the basis for a shared information service that should be developed from a diverse set of structural and cultural conditions for practices in journalism and broadcast programming as argued above.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

c) The ABC's capacity to contribute to a sense of national identity will be most felt by rural and other marginal communities and groups not well served by the commercial sector, such as youth and children. It is these groups that suffer the greatest impact and loss of services by budget-driven restructuring . Yet it is these communities whom the ABC is again required by the Terms of Reference to specifically serve. Restructuring of ABC services needs to be organised in a manner that can provide this strong foundation in public affairs from which a diversity of quality and cross-genre programming can be developed in focussed areas.

<H3>Section 4.</H3>

The submission calls here for particular consideration to be given to the nature and conditions of employment in news and current affairs. Given the Review's instructions to make its considerations in the context of the government's 'broader fiscal strategy', strategies of employment rationalisation become primary.  While this submission recognises restructuring will lead to some employment cutbacks it has argued that this should not occur in the core or foundational services of news and current affairs when it diminishes the employee's  capacity to meet their public broadcasting responsibilities.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

 A further important consideration in restructuring is not just the numbers of people employed but which people continue to be employed at the ABC. Alongside the Special Broadcasting Service, the ABC is the only mass media institution in Australia that is legally bound (under section 22B of the Public Services Act) to adopt equal employment practices to ensure career opportunities for women, Aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and people with physical or mental disabilities. Since 1988, the ABC has implemented action programs to this end, most notably there are employment targets to encourage indigenous and non-Anglo Australian to seek jobs in the ABC and to encourage women to seek promotions to senior management.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Change in the mass media's workforce composition is inevitably slow and incremental. Australian experience has shown that it will not occur without a formal institutional commitment to affirmative action programs. Moreover, these programs immediately impact on parrallel programming policies. As indigenous media trainer Lester Bostock reminds us, it is less likely that a white news editor will choose a racist story, angle or image if there is an indigenous (or non-Anglo) journalist sitting nearby.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

These employment programs are crucial, therefore, to the future of the ABC. The best way to guarantee the provision of independent news and current affairs, high quality locally produced information and entertainment and services for significant groups that are currently not well served by other broadcasting services, is to train and maintain a workforce that is culturally and socially diverse.

<B>Section 1. Preamble</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

We present this joint submission as academics with professional and personal interests in the future of the ABC. The Public Service Broadcasting Research Group (PSBRG) is a University-based research group which began a process of constructive analysis of the ABC well before the announcement of this review. This project began when there was very little academic debate about public service broadcasting. The PSBRG consists of Professor Elizabeth Jacka, Dr Helen Wilson, Dr Gay Hawkins and Maureen Burns. For the purposes of this submission the PSBRG has been joined by Associate Professor Glyn Davis and Associate Professor Jennifer Craik, well respected academics from the Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy, who have published widely on broadcasting issues. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

We strongly object to the implementation of severe and debilitating cuts prior to the Review, while acknowledging that the organisation of the ABC could be streamlined subject to clear agreement about aims and priorities. We also strongly object to the 'private' nature of the review. The ABC is arguably the most significant part of Australia's cultural, social and political life, and it has been so for 64 years. To deny public participation in an open review shows an extraordinary disrespect for the high regard in which Australians hold the ABC.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

We thus urge you to open the findings of the review to public consideration and debate. The views of the various communities of interest in Australia, (who are after all the funders and the audiences of the ABC ) should not be ignored. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In particular we urge you to achieve consensus with ABC Management, so that any agreed changes are implemented effectively. As we suggest later, this consensus could be formalised in a seven yearly agreement between the ABC and Government.</FONT>

<B>Changing Australia</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The past two decades in particular have reflected a more diverse Australia, with moves away from a unified identity of assimilation based on British heritage. At the same time, there have been two significant moves in technology and ideology. In the first, the growth of multi media has allowed for more diversity and narrowcast choice options for minority groups. The second has seen a movement in public policy away from the assumptions of further growth of Government for all, and a move towards selective and
targeted Government services.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Therefore a review of the ABC and its charter must take into account both the ability of some groups to access and presumably pay for minority services, and the move away from public sector provision of services which can be provided by the markets. The latter view works within an ideological framework that is flawed and it is within those flaws and omissions much of this submission is placed.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
When the ABC was set up by the Lyons Government in 1932 during the Depression, it was to provide a national broadcaster because the commercial services did not and would not provide the links needed to make us a nation. While the nineties are not the thirties, there are certain similarities which need to be taken into account.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The depression and the rise of extremist political views led to world war. The post war welfare state and development of public sector services, in part, recognised the need for social cohesion and senses of belonging. The present economic situation and some of its political consequences, have undermined some of the presumed certainties of the past four decades.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are fewer stable and long term jobs, fewer areas offering lifetime careers and a diminished public support ethos. We often work in many places, part time or casually and more and more of us are working from home. Those in full time jobs work more hours and we spend substantial time commuting.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There has been a greater emphasis on individualism and rights and less on collectivity and responsibilities.  Changes in gender roles and in workforce participation have altered roles within and between families and communities and the lower birthrate and ageing of the population means changes in living patterns and social connections.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Recognition of the problems we have caused for indigenous Australians and the growth of proportions of those from non anglo backgrounds change the social relations and cultures of Australia. We are a diverse collection of peoples and lifestyles with fewer icons in common and less opportunity for becoming familiar with the new and strange.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We have also been and are still a relatively tolerant country. While we are still racist and often unaware of our own prejudices, we have moved a long way from white Australia, banning blacks from swimming pools and beating up 'reffos'. These were all present when  I grew up here in the 40's and 50's. It has taken considerable effort to create a social climate in which scapegoating of minority groups is seen as unacceptable. We need to look at what is happening in parts of Europe and the USA as warnings of the consequences of loss of social cohesion, change and insecurity where there is no overarching sense of communality.

<B>TONGAN COURT FREES JAILED TIMES EDITORS
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<A HREF="/../cafepacific/resources/david_aspac.html">Asia Pacific Network: 14 October 1996</A>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
By DAVID ROBIE in Sydney</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR><Font size=3>Tongan pro-democracy MP and publisher 'Akilisi Pohiva and two newspaper editors have walked free after the Supreme Court ruled that they had been detained illegally.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Chief Justice Nigel Hampton ordered Pohiva, publisher of the controversial newsletter Kele'a, and Tongan Times newspaper editor Kalafi Moala and deputy editor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, to be set free on October 14. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
New Zealand civil rights lawyer Barry Wilson, acting for the Commonwealth Press Union, tonight told Asia-Pacific Network from Nuku'alofa that their release was encouraging for emerging democratic freedoms in the kingdom. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"The court found that the three had not been covered by the normal safeguards for a trial provided under the constitution," he said. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Wilson successfully filed a writ of habeas corpus last Friday after two earlier attempts had failed.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Amnesty International had declared the three political prisoners and international media freedom groups, and human rights movements had mounted several appeals for their release.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
A petition organised by the the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism and Pacific Media Watch and signed by more than 170 academics, journalists, media commentators and students was faxed to King Taufa'ahau Tupou on Friday seeking his intervention to free the men. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Wilson said: "I'm also not happy with the jail conditions under which the men were being held."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
He implied that they were being treated differently as political prisoners. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Pohiva had been jailed for contempt of Parliament for 30 days on September 20 after having leaked an impeachment notice against Justice Minister Tevita Tupou.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Moala and 'Akau'ola were jailed for publishing the leaked document in a front-page story in the Taimi 'o Tonga on September 4. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The court found that constitutional provisions such as Clause 10 for trials and sentencing under law, and Clause 11 providing for indictments, defence procedures and the right to call witnesses were breached. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
It also found that the three men had not been correctly found guilty by the Legislative Assembly of the offence they were accused of Under Clause 70 of the constitution.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Tongan government defended its the parliamentary action, saying the journalists broke the law and should be accountable. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Earlier, Kalafi Moala had challenged the Parliament over the "historical trial", claiming the three men were given a prejudiced hearing in the Legislative Assembly. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In an article in the Tongan Times headlined "We didn't get a fair trial", Moala defended his paper's action in publishing an untabled motion seeking the impeachment of Justice Minister Tevita Tupou for allegedly going to the Atlanta Olympics and being paid full parliamentary allowances. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The impeachment notice was tabled in the  Assembly the following week after Pohiva, Moala and 'Akau'ola, were jailed. But the House has since been suspended until the middle of next year. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
'Akau'ola had earlier been detained in February for 26 hours because of a letter published in the Tongan Times alleged to have "angered" Police Minister Clive Edwards.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"We firmly believe we didn't do anything wrong," said Mr Moala. "What we published was factual and truthful. It is true that the people's representatives had already signed a petition calling for the impeachment of the Justice Minister because he travelled to the Olympics even though his request for leave was refused."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Moala said it was also true that the motion had been registered and placed in the deputy speaker's files so had been already in the parliamentary process.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"This newspaper only reported that the petition had been submitted, the allegations of the petition, and who were the MPs who had signed it." 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In a separate article, Pohiva said the Justice Minister, who had filed contempt charges against them, should not have been allowed to participate in the parliamentary "jury that found us guilty". 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
A government statement denied speculation that Parliament had been suspended to prevent debate on the impeachment motion until next year, but admitted some MPs had expressed "surprise and disappointment" over the move.

<FONT SIZE=3>Media commentators see the jailings of two journalists and an MP whistleblower in Tonga as the most serious threat to media freedom in the South Pacific since the Fiji coups in 1987.

Multinational loggers claim the new royalty is the straw to break the industry's back -- that the industry is being asked to pay more than 50 per cent of income in tax revenue (36 per cent to government and 15 per cent to landowners) and that most foresters are operating at a loss. This, say the loggers, is the "kiss of death" to a planned timber processing industry.</Font size=3>

<B>ACIJ condemns attack on media freedom in Tonga
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
 The following information was released on 23 September by the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism. Copies were forwarded to His Royal Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou of Tonga, and His Excellency Prime Minister Baron Vaea of Tonga.</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=2 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<CENTER><H2>CONDEMNATION OF ATTACK<BR> ON MEDIA FREEDOM IN TONGA</H2></CENTER> 

The jailing of two journalists and an MP whistleblower in Tonga in September is a backward step for press freedom in the Pacific, says the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"Governments everywhere should resist the tempation to interfere in the role of the media in bringing information to the public, no matter how unfavourable that information may be," says Mr Peter Cronau, Editorial Director of the ACIJ.
"The ACIJ calls for the immediate release from jail of the journalists and the MP."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The three were jailed following the publication in the weekly Times of Tonga on September 4 of details of an untabled impeachment motion to the Legislative Assembly alleging misconduct by Justice Minister Tevita Tupou. Mr Tupou is alleged to have visited the Atlanta Olympics without the formal permission of the Assembly and to have received the daily allowance for attending parliamentary sessions despite having been out of the country. The journalists, Times editor and publisher Kalafi Moala and his deputy editor, 'Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, and the MP, 'Akilisi Pohiva, have each been jailed for 30 days for contempt of parliament. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Last month the Tongan government refused entry to an Agence France-Presse news reporter to cover a regional media conference, allegedly for previous critical reporting.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"The publics' right to information is paramount to any passing embarrassment that may be felt by government," says Mr Cronau. "The details of the allegations about a pending call to sack a parliamentarian should be able to be discussed by the public.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"The international ethics code for journalists requires respect for the right of the public to truth as every journalist's first duty. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"The Assembly's decision to jail the three is another worrying signal to Tonga's pro-democracy movement that the road to democracy in Tonga promises to be a rocky one."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Tonga's parliament is made up of a 28-member Legislative Assembly dominated by 19 unelected representatives of Tonga's noble families plus nine publicly elected representatives. Tonga's hereditary monarch, King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV, appoints and chairs a Privy Council of nine unelected ministers.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The jailed MP, 'Akilisi Pohiva, leads the Democracy Party which in 1996 won a majority of the nine elected seats of parliament. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ACIJ's call comes as a chorus of criticism spreads across the Pacific from media associations including Reporters Sans Frontiers, the International Federatiopn of Journalists, Pacific Journalism Review, Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, Pacific Islands News Association, Pacific Freedom of Information Network.

 The editorial board of the <B>Pacific Journalism Review</B> has forwarded the following letter to the Prime Minister of Tonga. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Prime Minister<BR>

Kingdom of Tonga<BR>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Your Excellency
<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We urge your Parliament to release without delay the two imprisoned journalists - Taimi 'o Tonga editor Kalafi Moala and deputy editor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola - and Member of Parliament 'Akilisi Pohiva. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The action taken against the three people for alleged contempt of Parliament is draconian and unbecoming of a nation that has a Constitution guaranteeing under Clause 7 "there shall be freedom of speech and the press".
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We note that Mr 'Akau'ola had already been detained by authorities in February amid widespread international condemnation and an Agence France Presse correspondent was barred from attending a regional media convention in Nuku'alofa last month for alleged critical reporting. We regard the latest action as yet a further unwarranted attempt to intimidate the news media in Tonga.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says, "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=10 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<CENTER><B>International Federation of Journalists Protest on Tongan Jailings</B></CENTER> 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The International Federation of Journalists, the World's largest organisation of journalists, representing more than 400,000 journalists in 95 countries, is dismayed at the jailing of two journalists and one journalist Member of Parliament in Tonga for contempt of Parliament for reporting impeachment of a cabinet member prior to the charge being heard by Parliament.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
On behalf of the regional office of the IFJ, I write to condemn the jailing of these three journalists. This act of punishment is a clear violation of freedom of expression and opinion.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Given the widespread anxiety of human rights organisations and journalist colleagues in the Asia-Pacific region, I hope you will intervene to release unconditionally those journalists that have been jailed. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The IFJ also asks you to intervene to guarantee the rights of journalists in Tonga, who belong to our member organisation, the Pacific Journalists Association.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We are concerned that this attempt to punish and intimidate journalists and to impose systems of media control are an offence to democracy and undermine the capacity of people to participate openly in society. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We hope that you will take action to ensure the highest respect for freedom of expression within the institutions of the kingdom of Tonga. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
I have had the opportunity of meeting personally one of the arrested, MP 'Akilisi Pohiva, who represented Tongan journalists at the Pacific Journalists Association meeting in Suva in 1993 and the IFJ Asia-Pacific meeting in Sydney in 1995.

<B>The following message was received on September 24 in response to protests to the Tongan government by Pacific Journalism Review and the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism:</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
On behalf of the editor, Kalafi Moala, subeditor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, and the staff of the Taimi 'o Tonga newspaper, I would like to convey to you our sincere thanks for the support that you, and the various media organisations affiliated, have made in the attempt to release the two journalists who are imprisoned up to this moment, including Member of Parliament 'Akilisi Pohiva.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We are very happy to understand that there are people somewhere who are willing to stand up to protect our rights to disseminate information and attempt to sustain and restore freedom of speech and of the press, not only throughout the region, but in this tiny kingdom. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Kalafi Moala and Filokalafi 'Akau'ola have been shifted yesterday to the main prison, Hu'atolitoli, while Pohiva, due to his illness, is being treated at the Vaiola Hospital.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
While in hospital there is a police officer there to make sure that only his immediate family and people who come to pray together with him visits. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Pohiva may return to jail after he recovers. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
At the moment it is only the Parliament [which] can make the decision to decline the penalty or decrease the number of days imposed on the three to be imprisoned.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We are facing difficulty at the moment with only two reporters and not only that but we have yet to be granted any opportunity to visit our editor and his assistant for further advice regarding the operation of the newspaper. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Yours,
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>On September 26 the Tongan Prime Minister's office forwarded an Information Paper to the ACIJ outlining details of the charges. The main points follow: </B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
 The Tongan Times falsely reported that Parliament was impeaching the Minister for Justice and for ther "wrongdoings" which they falsely listed. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
This is the equivalent of publishing that someone was being tried in court, when in fact no complaint had been filed. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Therefore the Tongan Times had breached the right of the House and of the Minister of Justice, to be reported correctly about. Secondly it also violated the right of the public to receive information from the product which they had bought.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Accordingly, the House, based on Clause 70 of the Constitution, charged Messrs Moala and 'Akau'ola with libellous publication, and therefore contempt of the House. ...
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
As confessed by 'Akilisi Pohiva in the House, after two weeks of probing by the House, it was he who gave the Tonga Times the libellous information and for publication. Accordingly, he too, based on Clause 70 of the Constitution, was charged with contempt of the House. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
[Note: Clause 70 of the Constitution states - If anyone shall speak or act disrespectfully in the presence of the Legislative Assembly it shall be lawful to imprison him [sic] for thirty days and whoever shall publish any libel on the Legislative Assembly, may be imprisoned for not exceeding thirty days.]
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Although contempt charges are not accompanied by hearings as in a court trial, Parliament allowed the three men full opportunity to ansmer the allegations, and to have legal counsel. Moala and 'Akau'ola had a legal counsel, Pohiva did not.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Hearing took place the whole of Thursday morning and afternoon, fully attended by the press and the public.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
After lengthy debate, the House, on the evening of 19th Sept, 1996, voted on two matters. The first was whether the accused were guilty or not guilty of contempt of the House. The House voted by 19 to 2 that they were guilty. The second matter the House voted on was the penalty ... The House voted 10 to 8 in favour of imprisonment for 30 days. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
[Note: The vote to find the men guilty was passed 19-2. Fifteen eligible voters are unelected appointees of the King. Of the nine elected representatives, four voted 'guilty', two voted 'not guilty', and three were unable to vote (Pohiva and two absentees). On the vote on whether to apply a penalty of jailing, all seven present elected representatives voted against the penalty. It passed 10-8.] ... 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
AFP and Radio Australia (and Radio New Zealand) contacted the Prime minister's Office for information ... no other media service in the world has condescended to ask the Tongan Government, or the office of Parliament, for the facts.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Despite this above, Government has received numerous ill researched and therefore, incorrect, unjust, biased and malicious press condemnations. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
As evident from the facts above, the issues were not freedom of the press, nor the right of the public to be informed about matters of public interest.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The actual issues, suppressed by most of the overseas media, were the right of the House and the Minister for Justice to be reported truthfully, and the right of the people to correct information from the newspaper they paid for.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Both of these are fundamental human rights, and are elementary demands of the principles of natural justice. Both rights, however, were violated by Moala, 'Akau'ola and Pohiva, and are still being violated by many overseas organisations and Media Services.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Despite this regretable reality, of Media Terrorism against Tonga, we are still hopeful, that reputable Media Services such as those noted below, will one day ask for the facts, and will one day publish them:
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
World Press Freedom Committee (USA), Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, Pacific Journalism Review (PNG), National Press Club (PNG), Pacific Star Pty Ltd (PNG), World Association of Newspapers (France), Word Publishing Co Ltd (PNG), Journalists Training Organisation (NZ), NZ Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union, Amnesty International (UK), New Zealand Herald, and many other print and radio media. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The history of the Media provides very meagre evidence of voluntary corrections of misinformation. To do so, is bad for the actual authors of the misinformation, for the reputation of the Media organisation, and of course for their sales.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Accordingly we accept with deep sorrow, that despite all the foregoing, there is no way at all for the misinformation to be corrected, or for the corrections to be equally highlighted as the misinformation was, by the Media services involved.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Our primary duty of course is not to the press, especially those with proven injustices. Our primary duty is to our people, and they are aware of all the above facts.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
[Note: There followed a statement that the motion to impeach the Justice Minister had been tabled in the House of Assembly on September 23, and that "The House then voted that there is a case to answer.".]

<B>RSF PROTEST TO THE KING OF TONGA</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Your Excellency,</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Reporters Sans Frontieres, an independent organisation working to defend press freedom worldwide, wishes to strongly protest against the imprisonment of newspaper editors.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
According to our information, Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, deputy editor of the Tongan weekly Taimi O Tonga , and the Auckland based editor Kalafi Moala have each been sentenced to one month in jail for contempt of parliament. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
On 23 February 1996, Filokalafi 'Akau'ola had already been arrested and detained following the publication of letters concerning Minister of Police Clive Edwards. He was kept in custody for 26 hours before being released on bail and ordered to appear in te Magistrates' Court on Wednesday 26 February to face criminal charges that he had threatened a civil servant, under section 57 of the Tongan criminal code. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The police had also raided the newspaper office in search of the original copy of the offending letter.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We protest against the imprisonment of Filokalafi 'Akau'ola and Kalafi Moala as a direct attack on press freedom and as a disproportionate sentence. Press freedom and freedom of expression are to be respected, and we request the release of these two journlists and ask you to do everything in your power to ensure that press freedom is allowed to exist in Tonga.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We thank you for your attention and would welcome your comments.

<B>Asia-Pacific Network reports Tongan government on 'media terrorism'</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Tongan government denounces 'media terrorism' </B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Tongan government today bitterly condemned international media organisations protesting over the jailing of two journalists and an MP, accusing them of waging "media terrorism" against the Pacific kingdom. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Acting Chief Secretary 'Eseta Fusitu'a said the government had received a series of "incorrect, unjust, biased and malicious" press condemnations following last week's jailing of two newspaper editors and a commoner parliamentarian who is also a publisher and broadcaster. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Taimi 'o Tonga editor Kalafi Moala and subeditor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola and pro-democracy movement leader 'Akilisi Pohiva were jailed on Friday for 30 days for contempt of Parliament after the weekly newspaper published a story about an untabled impeachment notice. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The front page story in the September 4 edition under the headline "Parliament impeaches minister for justice" reported allegations of abuse of office against Justice Minister Tevita Tupou. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Since the three men were jailed, the motion has been tabled this week in the Legislative Assembly and the parliament voted there is a case to answer.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Radio Tonga said it was the first time the Assembly had approved a motion to impeach a minister.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Acting Chief Justice John Lewis has refused a Supreme Court application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the two journalists, Moala and 'Akau'ola. Pohiva did not seek an appeal. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Media protests have continued to flow into the kingdom.</B> 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In a statement defending government actions faxed to several protesting media organisations today, including the Papua New Guinea-based Pacific Journalism Review and the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, Fusitu'a claimed the issue was not one of "freedom of the press, nor the right of the public to be informed about matters of public interest". 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
He said the issues were "the right of the House and the Minister for Justice to be reported truthfully, and the right of the people to correct information" in the newspaper.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"Both of these are fundamental human rights, and are the elementary demands of the principles of natural justice," Fusitu'a said. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"Both rights, however, were violated by Moala, 'Akau'ola and Pohiva, and are still being violated by many overseas organisations and media services. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"Despite this most regrettable reality, of media terrorism against Tonga, we are still hopeful that reputable media services will one day ask for the facts, and will one day publish them."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
He praised Agence France-Presse news agency, Radio Australia and Radio New Zealand for contacting the government for information. But condemned a list of protesting media organisations.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Fusitu'a criticised the World Press Freedom Committee (USA), Australian Centre for Independent Journalism (Sydney), Pacific Journalism Review (PNG), National Press Club (PNG), Pacific Star Pty Ltd (PNG), World Association of Newspapers (France), Word Publishing Co Ltd (PNG), NZ Journalists Training Organisation (NZ), NZ Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union, Amnesty International (UK) and the New Zealand Herald and "many other" print and radio media.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"The history of the media provides very meagre evidence of voluntary corrections of misinformation. To do so is bad for the actual authors of the misinformation, for the reputation of the media organisation, and of course for their sales," Fusitu'a said.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
However, media monitoring sources in Sydney said the government had failed to recognise the difference between the role of "news gathering" media organisations and those "protesting" over the jailing. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Among other reactions,the International Federation of Journalists, the world's largest organisation of journalists, representing more than 400,000 journalists in 95 countries, expressed "dismay" and appealed for their release.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"This act of punishment is a clear violation of freedom of expression and opinion," said senior vice-president Christopher Warren in a letter to King Taufa'ahau Tupou.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"Given the widespread anxiety of human rights organisations and journalist colleagues in the Asia-Pacific region, I hope you will intervene to release unconditionally those journalists that have been jailed. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"The IFJ also asks you to intervene to guarantee the rights of journalists in Tonga, who belong to our member organisation, the Pacific Journalists Association.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Warren said the IFJ was concerned that this attempt to punish and intimidate journalists and to impose systems of media control "are an offence to democracy and undermine the capacity of people to participate openly in society".
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Tonga's 28-member Legislative Assembly is dominated by 19 unelected representatives of Tonga's noble families plus nine elected people's representatives.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Although a majority of the people's representatives voted for the contempt ruling, all seven present voted unanimously against the prison sentence (the overall vote was 10-8 in favour).
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
One of the jailed men, 'Akau'ola was detained for 26 hours last February after his newspaper published a letter criticising Police Minister Clive Edwards. An Auckland-based Agence France Presse correspondent who has reported Tongan affairs closely, Michael Field, was barred from entering the kingdom for last month's Pacific Islands News Association convention.

<B>PCRC letter to Tongan Prime Minister</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Your Excellency,</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Please accept our peaceful greetings and best wishes. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Please also accept our humble apologies for this unsolicited intrusion but our collective conscience prompts us to convey to Your Excellency our great concern about the jailing of Kalafi Moala, Filokalafi Akau'ola and Akilisi Pohiva. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We do not question the existence of the Kingdom's legislation relating to contempt of Parliament nor do we challenge the right of His Majesty's Government and Parliament to enact and execute such legislation. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
However we humbly proffer the view that the letter and spirit of such legislation is in violation of the universal right to freedom of expression and opinion which is entrenched in the Kingdom's Constitution. As such the Kingdom's contempt of Parliament legislation is unjust and oppressive. As a consequence the jailing of the three men is unjust and oppressive.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We therefore beseech Your Excellency that it is in the interests of His Majesty's Kingdom and Government for your Excellency to initiate proceedings in Parliament to ensure the immediate release of the 3 men and the eventual annulment of the Kingdom's contempt of Parliament legislation. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Sir we humbly beg leave and again apologise for this intrusion. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=10 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Yours in Peace<BR>

<B>Regional and international appeals to Tonga continue</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Regional and international condemnation of the Tongan Legislative Assembly's jailing of journalists Kalafi Moala and Filokalafi 'Akau'ola continues as the pair go into their second week of detention in the kingdom. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In the latest appeals to free the Tonga 2, who are now held in Tonga's main prison:<BR>
The chairperson of the Media Council of Papua New Guinea, Anna Solomon, appealed to Tonga's King Taufa'ahau Tupou to do "what is right by your people." She said as the people of the Pacific Islands approach the 21st century "we expect our leaders to honestly take stock of outmoded draconian legislations that impede the course of democracy and throw out those laws which only serve the interests of the privileged few."
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The president of the Media Association of Solomon Islands, Julian Maka'a, said the 30-day jail sentence is "too harsh." "This action will no doubt really strengthen the focus for change in Tonga," he said. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists, through executive director Wayne Sharpe, urged the King to "intervene and show your commitment to freedom of expression by ensuring the immediate release of the journalists." 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The World Press Freedom Committee, which links 37 journalistic organisations on five continents, said the people of a country have "the right to information about the activities of their government and its officials. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
"Those who flout such fundamental rights only diminish the international image of their countries," World Press Freedom Committee executive director Dana Bullen said.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>BACKGROUND</B><BR>
Moala and 'Akau'ola were on September 20th jailed for 30 days for "contempt" of the Legislative Assembly. This was because their newspaper, the weekly Times of Tonga (Taimi 'o Tonga), published details of an impeachment motion against Tonga's Minister of Justice, before it was submitted to the Legislative Assembly. The minister, who is appointed by the king and not elected, was alleged to have received his daily allowance for attending Legislative Assembly sessions even though he was in Atlanta leading Tonga's delegation to the Olympic Games.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Times of Tonga was given details of the motion by pro-democracy movement parliamentarian 'Akilisi Pohiva. Moala and 'Akau'ola said they believed Pohiva had already submitted it to the clerk of the assembly. Pohiva was also jailed for 30 days by Tonga's Legislative Assembly, which is dominated by representatives of the kingdom's noble families and Ministers who are appointed by King Taufa'ahau Tupou.

<B>PINA appeal given to King of Tonga</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
An appeal for the release of jailed Tongan journalists Kalafi Moala and Filokalafi 'Akau'ola has been personally handed to the Palace in Nuku'alofa, Tonga, by a representative of the regional Pacific Islands News Association (PINA).
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Nina Ratulele, PINA's Freedom of Information Network coordinator, gave the letter of appeal to the king's private secretary, 'Ofa Tu'i'onetoa, during a meeting at the Palace. Tu'i'onetoa said he would pass it on to King Taufa'ahau Tupou immediately.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The appeal is from PINA's president, Monica Miller, of American Samoa, on behalf of PINA members throughout the region.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Ratulele also met the Speaker of Tonga's Legislative Assembly, the Honourable Fusitu'a. She gave him a letter from the PINA president asking for his support for the appeal. The Honourable Fusitu'a assured Ratulele he would read the letter carefully.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Ratulele has also been given permission to visit the jailed journalists by Tonga's Police and Prisons Minister, Clive Edwards. Prison authorities say Moala has told them he does not want visits from anyone except close relatives. But Ratulele hopes to see him and 'Akau'ola later today. The pair are now ending the first week of their detention.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
[Note: Radio Australia reports that the two jailed journalists have declined to meet with PINA reporesentative, Nina Ratulele. No reason was stated.]
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Ratulele flew to Tonga from Fiji to deliver the appeals, visit the jailed the journalists, lobby on their behalf, and meet with PINA's members in the kingdom. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
PINA and the Pacific Freeedom of Information Network coordinated through the PINA Secretariat in Suva have led international appeals to free Moala and 'Akau'ola. PINA said Moala and 'Akau'ola were jailed for doing their duty - informing the people of Tonga about a matter which they had a right to know. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>Tonga Chronicle, 26 September 1996<BR>
Court rejects appeal on jailed journalists</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>NUKU'ALOFA:</B> Acting Chief Justice John William Lewis refused in the Supreme Court on Wednesday an ex-parte application for a writ of habeas corpus from Ekealafi Moala, editor of Taimi 'o Tonga, and his assistant Filokalafi 'Akauola. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In handing down his judgment, Justice Lewis said that the Legislative Assembly had absolute privilege in [its] decision to detain the two journalists.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Parliament was entitled to absolute privilege over its internal proceedings and in a sense it was properly entitled to determine what words or actions will amount to contempt and the sanction which it should impose upon a person whom it found to have committed a contempt to the house, the judge said.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The applicants had asked that they be released from what they claimed was unlawful or unjustifiable detention because they were not members of the Legislative Assembly.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The said article was not published in the presence of the Legislative Assembly. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Legislative Assembly could not lawfully invoke the Constitution upon them because the Assembly, which had a vested interest in this matter as the body that charged [them], found them guilty and sentenced them to 30 days in prison and because the procedure adopted by the Legislative Assembly was unfair and unjust.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Respondents were the Kingdom of Tonga and the Minister of Police. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
A People's Representative in the Legislative Assembly, Samuela 'Akilisi Pohiva, No 1 People's Representatives for Tongatapu, and two journalists have been imprisoned for 30 days after being found guilty of contempt against the Assembly on September 20.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The three began serving their sentences when the House adjourned shortly after midnight on September 20.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
After spending his first night's imprisonment at the Police Training School, Kolofo'ou, Mr. Pohiva was transferred under guard to Vaiola Hospital where he remained today after suffering from asthma attack. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The two journalists are being held at Hu'atolitoli Prison Station as of Wednesday, but since last week they [have been] held at two different police stations.

MEDIA BILL LINKED TO SWORD OF DAMOCLES<BR>
Commission to dictate what journalists write</B> 
<P>
By John Millet<BR>
SECTION 28 of the proposed National Information and Communication Bill portrays the authority created by the Bill as Dionysius to media's Damocles. 
<P>
It reads in part: "Where the authority considers that it would be in the interest of the public to do so, the authority may .... suspend for such period ..... or revoke the certificate.
<P>
A media owner who operates without a certificate faces possible imprisonment up to four years. The Media Commission Bill is to media workers what the National Information and Communication Bill is to the media owners. Its Sword of Damocles is Section 12 which reads: "For the purpose of exercising its powers and functions, the Commission may make such orders, give such directions and do such other things as it sees it fit."
<P>
This means that the Commission could direct or order a journalist, writer, announcer, compere or presenter to write or say something. Failure to comply with an order or direction could bring a fine up to K2000. 
<P>
Section 28 makes it mandatory for the commission to withdraw a certificate of registration from a journalist, writer, announcer, compere or presenter whom the Commission finds to be "guilty of a serious offence which is detrimental to the interest of the public .... "
<P>
Whereas the Media Commission is mainly concerned with media workers. Its jurisdiction extends to media owners as well. That is the two Bills as drafted contain the potential for overlapping jurisdictions and contrary determinations but neither says which would prevail. This comes about in Section 19 of the Media Commission Bill.
<P>
"The Commission may make rules providing for the regulation of the media and its affairs ... "
<P>
Wasn't the CRC's first recommendation to the National Parliament that ".... existing legislation on the media provides sufficient rules in controlling the behaviour of the media industry and the government should not consider proposing any new restrictive laws ? And wasn't its final recommendation to the effect that licensing would be introduced only if self-regulation failed ? It would appear that somebody has made a judgment that self-regulation has failed. Who made such judgment and when, and where and how was it made ? 
<P>
A brief reading of these two Bills strongly suggests that their drafters have come up hard against truth, faced by many would-be regulators before them in liberal democratic societies, that it would not be easy to limit freedom of expression without destroying it. They have resolved the dilemma nevertheless with the heavy-handed approach, impossing unacceptable risks on society. The Media Council should quickly propose alternative arrangements. 
<P>
According to the Bills, how much power does the Minister wield, specifically and bluntly, can he "stack the board" ? The Minister in effect selects the chairman and deputy chairman and the director general of the National Information and Communications Authority and may terminate their appointments on grounds of "inefficiency, incapacity or misbehaviour". The Minister also selects three of the ten board members at this absolute discretion, one with specified experience and three representatives of particular interest groups. The Minister is not required to accept or consider nominees of the specified interest groups. Overall, apart from the ex-officio nominees of the Department of Finance and National Planning the board is very much the Minister's creation.
<P>
The Minister nominates the chairman and deputy chairman of the Media Commission. Various interest groups nominate the other seven members. The Minister, therefore, would not control the Commission. Nor would he control the Media Supervisor Supervisory Committee, provided for under the Media Commission Bill, unless the Commission wished him to do so by default. 
<P>
The main direct risk therefore would be for media owners rather than for media workers. It would take the form of the Minister or his creation closing premises down in the "interests of the public", after having given the owner the opportunity to present his case. Of course, indirectly, owner's risk is also worker's risk.
<P>
This would appear to make the media accountable to the MInister; and, under our structure of government, the allocation of Ministerial portfolios is the absolute prerogative of the Prime Minister of the day. Is this what "media accountability" means?
<P>
All media premises must be registered and licenced with the authority, renewable annually at unprescribed fees. Penalty - up to K10,000 for a corporation and K5000 for each director, default four years and six months imprisonment respectively.
<P>
The authority may revoke registration or suspend it for an unspecified period if, inter alia, it considers that it would be in the "interest of the public to do so", provided the certificate holder has first had the opportunity to put his case.
<P>
All journalists, writers, radio announcers and television comperes or presenters must apply annually for registration with the Commission and pay the associated fees (amount not specified) penalty K1000 for a first offender and K2000 for any subsequent offence.
<P>
The Commission may hold renewal or registration, inter alia, if the applicant "has failed to give a satisfactory explanation of any matter relating to his conduct or... practise.. "
<P>
The Commission shall withdraw a certificate of registration if it finds, inter alia that the holder is guilty of a serious offence which is detrimental to the interest of the public and the media industry." Aggrieved parties may seek a court review of the Commission's action. An unregistered practitioner faces a fine of up to K2000.
<P>
Complaints of improper conduct are to be heard by a Media Supervisory Committee. The Minister appoints no fewer than three certificate holders to the committee. The Commission may appoint any number of any persons to the committee. The Commission's proceedinhgs shall be closed to the public. 
<P>
Evidence shall be given on oath and witnesses may be examined. The committee may, as a result of an inquiry, suspend the defendant from practise; impose of a penalty of up to K5000; order compensation to be paid to the court for deregistration. Both the plaintiff and the defendant may appeal within 21 days to the court.
<P>
The National Information and Communications Board comprises 10 members, three of them ex officio. The other seven are appointed by the Minister, three in his absolute discretion. Three appointees represent the media, the rural sector the telecommunications respectively. One aoppointee is to be experienced in commercial law and business practise. The Minister may terminate an appointment on grounds of "inefficiency, incapability or misbehaviour." The appeals provision appears to be circular which is tantamount to there being no appeals provision. Six members form a quorum. Matters are decided by majority vote for the members present and voting. The chairman has a deliberate vote and a casting vote.
<P>
Paradoxically in a wider context of government's general privatisation policies the Authority has the power - nay, the obligation - as drafted the Bill would make it mandatory to own and operate media enterprises. Other powers include: providing guidelines on program content, determining local content, giving written instructions, requiring a licensee to discuss any matter or to give evidence or produce any document likely to assist the Authority. 
<P>
Section 62(m) requires the Authority to "authorise and promote ownership of broadcasting services". This meaningless statement would take on meaning for existing investors if it meant "local" ownership. This point needs clarification. The word "shall" in S26 should be replaced by the word "may". 
<P>
The Media Commission will comprise nine people, five of them will be nominated by private interest groups: journalists, lawyers, unions, churches, women. The Judicial Services Commission will nominate. The NEC will appoint the chairman and the deputy chairman. The Media Commission itself will nominate one member. The Act provides for alternatives and, potentially confusing, for "acting" members also.
<P>
Appointments may be terminated by NEC for the usual reasons and for "misconduct in respect of his ofice or otherwise." The Commission shall meet at least once a quarter. Six members constitue a quorum.<BR>

<HR>
<P>
The Australian Centre for Independent Journalism has rejected claims of
censorship over a Bougainville article written by Sydney-based freelance
journalist Max Watts,
<P>
Watts and supporters have distributed their claims widely by the Internet.
<P>
But ACIJ director Alan Knight has responded to a letter from the
Bougainville Freedom Movement by rejecting the claims.
<P>
Watts had claimed that an article about Bougainville television news
coverage had been censored because it was not published in Reportage Media
Bulletin, a magazine devoted to media issues.
<P>
However, the article was instead published earlier this month on ACIJ's
website, The Online Journalist - on the Pacific Media Watch page
under the title <A HREF="bougno.html">No news on Bougainville</A>. 
<P>
"I told Mr Watts that we would place his article on our home page which has
an international readership, in a section specifically related to Pacific
matters," Knight said.
<P>
"Clearly this is not suppression of information, merely an editorial
decision to run the material in an appropriate place."<BR>

EAST TIMOR JOURNALIST IN COMA AFTER ATTACK IN DILI</B>
<P>   
An East Timorese journalist has fallen into a coma after being attacked by
eight-men in the capital, Dili.
<P>
Police say Gaudensius Mau, who works for a Jakarta-based newspaper, was
beaten near a police dormitory.
<P>
Police chief, Lieutenant Colonel Beno Kilapong, says the identity and
motive of the attackers is still unknown.
<P>
In the past week, tension has mounted over an interview given by East
Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop, Carlos Belo, to a German magazine.
<P>
The bishop was quoted as saying that Indonesian troops had treated the East
Timorese people like dogs after invading the former Portuguese colony in
1975.<BR>

Tiong Hiew-king, whose Malaysian logging group Rimbunan Hijau owns The
National daily newspaper in Papua New Guinea, is the new head of the Ming
Pao publishing group in Hongkong, says a new report..
<P>
Yu Pun-hoi sold his controlling stake in Ming Pao newspaper to Tiong in
October, according to the joint report "China's Challenge: Freedom of
Expression in Hongkong" prepared by the Hongkong Journalists' Association
and Article 19.
<P>
The report was presented at this week's Intersections with Asia: The Future
of International Journalism conference organised by the Australian Centre
for Independent Journalism at the International Media centre in Sydney.
<P>
Mr Yu "apparently needed the money to finance his ambitious satellite
television operation, the China television Network (CTN), the major market
for which is in Taiwan".
<P>
The Rimbunan  Hijau group's media interests have steadily grown in the past
few years. As well as The National in PNG, founded in 1993, it also owns
two radio stations in New Zealand and other news media.<BR>

INDONESIAN JOURNALIST MURDERED</B>
<P>
In Indonesia, a crusading investigative journalist has been murdered apparently for articles he has published on government corruption and land disputes.<P>
Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, a correspondent for the Yogyakarta daily 'Bernas', was fatally beaten in his home on August 13.<P>
Syafruddin died from injuries sustained during a beating by two unidentified men who fled on a motorcycle immediately after the attack.<P>
The men visited Syafruddin's house and beat him with iron bars inflicting serious injuries to his head and stomach. <P>
Syafruddin was transferred to the intensive care unit of a Catholic hospital in Yogyakarta, but never regained consciousness. He died in the hospital three days later. <P>
According to local sources, Syafruddin's murder may be related to his articles on land disputes and government corruption in Bantul, the Yogyakarta suburb that he covered for 'Bernas'.<P>
The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists has written to President Suharto to express alarm over the murder. <P>
The CPJ called on the Indonesian leader to order a complete investigation into Syafruddin's death as well as public disclosure of the investigation's findings.<P>
Further details of the killing have now appeared in current issue of 'TAPOL Bulletin', the magazine of the UK-based Indonesian human rights watchdog, TAPOL.<P>

MEDIA WATCH GROUP CONCERNED ABOUT LEGISLATION PLANS
<P>
By Neville Togarewa</B>
</BR>
Pacific Media Watch has voice "serious concern" over the Constitutional Review Commission's draft legislation to register journalists and media organisations.
<P>
PMW co-directors Peter Cronau and David Robie issued a statement on Sunday urging the commission to "seriously reconsider the implications of its legislative moves during its two weeks of consultations".
<P>
PMW is an independent group of journalists and academics monitoring censorship and media freedom issues in the Pacific region.
<P>
"PMW notes that the proposed legislation is out of step with the recommendations of the CRC media committee's findings in June that supported self-regulation, and it appears to be in violation of the democratic principles of news media and journalist independence," Mr Cronau and Mr Robie said.
<P>
They cited Clause 9 of the International Federation of Journalists' Declaration of Principles of Conduct which states: "Journalists worthy of that name shall deem it their duty to observer faithfully (the code). Within the general laws of each country, the journalist shall recognise in professional matters the jurisdiction of colleagues only, to the exclusion of every kind of interference by governments or others."
<P>
Mr Cronau and Mr Robie said PNG had a long and proud tradition of a vigorous and independent news media which had contributed much to building the nation.
<P>
The commission's media committee, comprising Trade Union Congress general secretary John Paska and MPs Iairo Lasaro and Gerald Beona, will begin consultative meetings this week.
<P>
They will meet representatives of the PNG Journalists Association, Telekom and PNG Communication Workers Union today.<BR>

<P>
National editorial (Nov 18): 
STOP THE ROT AT NBC</B>
<P>
THE National Broadcasting Corporation began as a commission 23 years ago
this month.
<P>
Prior to 1973, radio broadcasting in the territories of Papua and New Guinea
was divided between the two authorities - the Australian Broadcasting
Commission's PNG service which began in 1946; and later, the Australian
administration's Department of Information and Extension Services network.
<P>
The ABC invested substantial funds in the development of radio in PNG.
Broadcasting House at 5-Mile was opened on Sept 5, 1962, and was acclaimed
as the most up-to-date facility of its kind in the Southern hemisphere.
<P>
The ABC's programs were initially directed at an expatriate audience; the
commission saw that as its duty to Australians working in a colonial
situation.
<P>
Hospital matrons had their daily injection of Gwen Meredith's radio serial
'Blue Hills', an Aussie version of 'The Archers'; and the hills were alive
with the sound of Maria Callas, Yehudi Menuhin, and the GUM Footwear Band.
<P>
At the end of the day, 'Evening Meditation', introduced by a piece of music
called 'Highland Lament' - Scottish, not PNG Highlands - sent the dimdims
scurrying for their last double whisky before bed.
<P>
It was Aunty at her most stiff upper lip.
<P>
As the years passed, the ABC began to take Papuan and New Guinean listeners
into account, with a number of innovative programs designed to inform and
entertain.
<P>
In particular, news services in Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu joined the
English-language broadcasts; the ABC played an honourable role in the
dissemination of information to the people of this country for some 20 years
before independence in 1975.
<P>
DIES, on the other hand, provided an essential locally-oriented service to
the districts in both territories. Radio East Sepik was the first station
opened, and others soon followed.
<P>
Rural information programs from agriculture, health, education and law
enforcement personnel played a major role in their broadcasts, and they
began a news service designed to reach as many listeners as practicable in
their own language.
<P>
Some stations were broadcasting news in up to six languages; the lingua
franca were Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu.
<P>
With self-government looming in November 1973, both the ABC and DIES moved
to establish one national broadcaster; by 1975, very few of the
newly-created provinces were without radio stations.
<P>
And what a success they proved to be! By the seventies, the radio network,
carried through three services, was a model for developing nations. Free
from political interference, and with program variety and standards that
would have done credit to any international broadcaster, the NBC looked set
for a prime role in the establishment and development of this brave new
nation.
<P>
What went wrong?
<P>
The national broadcaster of today is a pitiful shell of that splendid
organisation.
<P>
By the eighties, the seeds of its doom had already been sown. Successive
governments were not content to leave well alone. Appointment after
appointment to the then-commission were made for reasons of political
convenience.
<P>
Nepotism and personal greed became the hallmarks of far too many at
management level; the highly talented staff, nurtured over so many years,
were powerless in the face of arrogance, neglect, and ignorance.
<P>
Year after year, the national budgets reflected the abysmal attitude of
those responsible for the NBC's budget; taking inflation into account, the
NBC's income progressed steadily backwards, while the buildings,
transmitters, and equipment, all donated by Aunty ABC in 1973 and valued
then at more than K5 million kina, slowly rotted away.
<P>
And the future?
<P>
Emphatically yes, the NBC must have a future. Its services have never been
needed more than they are today. In the field of political education alone -
shamefully and scandalously neglected by every government since independence
- the role of the NBC could be amply justified.
<P>
And yes, the expertise to revive, stabilise, re-structure and redirect the
NBC is available - not at some horrendous cost from overseas experts, but
right here in the nation's capital.
<P>
All that is required is a national government that cares enough to identify
and exploit that wealth of knowledge and experience - and reap the benefit.<BR>

Justice Minister Arnold Marsipal yesterday told Parliament that cartoonists
ought to, as a matter of courtesy, inform leaders if they are going to use them
as subjects of illustrations.
<P>
Mr Marsipal was responding to concerns raised by Wewak MP and former Attorney
General Bernard Narokobi about a cartoon in The National newspaper yesterday
dipicting Sir Michael Somare's comments that the judiciary was misinterpreting
the legislator's intentions. The cartoon shows a judge urging criminals to "go
home and behave" with Sir Michael Somare thinking "too very soft".
<P>
Mr Narokobi saw the cartoon as potentially demeaning to the integrity of the
judiciary and wanted to know whether it represented the views of the Justice
Minister and if not, what was he going to do about the cartoonist and the
publisher.
<P>
Mr Marsipal said that PNG is a democratic country and the freedom extends to
the media and artists.
<P>
He said that it did not represent his views as he respects the law and the
judiciary.

Hundreds of radio broadcasters employed by the National Broadcasting
Corporation and their families will go hungry from today because there is no
money to pay their fortnightly wages.
<P>
What a shame.
<P>
At a time when politicians find plenty of time to criticise private media
groups and use government resources to curb press freedom, they have
shamelessly forgotten about their number one media responsibility - to keep the
national and the provincial radio stations on air.
<P>
Having discarded it and handed over responsibility to provincial governments
without providing funds, they have delivered the final blow to the staff.
<P>
Only this week the Prime Minister stood up in Parliament and acknowledged the
importance of radio as the only means of communication that can get messages
across to the bulk of the people of Papua New Guinea whereas newspapers reach a
much smaller audience, especially in the rural areas.
<P>
That is true. So why is it that successive governments have never allocated
enough funds to NBC to carry out its duties as specified in the Broadcasting
Commission Act ?
<P>
In the 1997 general elections, the Government will need the NBC like never
before.
<P>
Only the radio network can enable the Government to talk directly to the people
quickly and with so much ease.
<P>
The leaders of today will be judged by history as the very ones who destroyed
the people's radio network. They slowly but surely suffocated it over 21 years
until today when they finally delivered the last blow to the staff and their
families. May the Karai Service and all the provincial radio stations rest in
peace. We weep at the passing of a great radio service.

NO PAY FOR 2000 NBC STAFF<BR>
Corporation lacks funds after overspending
<P>
By ENNIO KUBLE</B><BR>
PORT MORESBY: Pay cheques of more than 2,000 employees of the National
Broadcasting Corporation nationwide will no longer be honoured by the Bank
of Papua New Guinea.
<P>
Although the bank could not be contacted to confirm this, sources from the
NBC finance department said their workers will be without pay for the two
pay-days of this month.
<P>
The source said that due to over-expenditure, both operational and salary
funds for November were used up in the first week of this month.
<P>
As there are no more funds available to transfer to the banks by the Finance
Department, pay cheques are being dishonoured since early this week, the
source said.
<P>
The source said the management is thinking of using the December's funds but
that depends on approval from the Finance Department.
<P>
Attempts to get comments from the officer in charge of the NBC finance
failed.
<P>
Finance Department officials were also unavailable for comment yesterday.
However, Radio Western Highlands station manager Winterford Suharupa said
his staff were aware of the problem.
<P>
Mr Suharupa said officials from the head office here had not informed him.
However, he received the information from other sources.
<P>
He said it is true that the NBC had run out of money for this month.
However, the ordinary employees should not be penalised for that.
<P>
He said the NBC should find alternative ways to pay the staff.
<P>
Mr Suharupa said he had deposited his cheque on Thursday and was not sure
whether the bank would release the money or not.
<P>
He said though his staff have performed their normal duties this week, it
would be different next week.
<P>
And the kind of action they will take will be determined in the next week's
meeting, he said.
<P>
He also said his station has not received any funding from the provincial
government for this year's operations. The K15,000 budgeted by the
provincial government has not been released, he added.<BR>

<h1>PINA concerned over new threats to free expression</h1>
<Font size=3><B>PMW18: Pacific Islands News Association: 19 November 1996</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
The Pacific Islands News Association (PINA) today again appealed to the
Tongan authorities to respect the fundamental human rights to freedom of
expression and information.
<P>
PINA president Monica Miller, of American Samoa, expressed deep concern over
events in the kingdom in the past few days.
<P>
They indicate a continuing effort to intimidate pro-democracy movement
members who exercise their right to free speech and news organisations who
report what they say, she said.
<P>
PINA said Tongan police on Friday November 15 took to the police station and
questioned pro-democracy politicians 'Akilisi Pohiva and Teisina Fuko and
Times of Tonga newspaper deputy editor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola.
<P>
The police released 'Akau'ola after about half an hour, PINA said. Pohiva
and Fuko were detained overnight before being released without being
charged.
<P>
The pair are both People's Representatives in the kingdom's Legislative
Assembly.
<P>
They were then given notices from the police saying they are under
investigation for alleged sedition and for defamation of King Taufa'ahau
Tupou lV, PINA was told.
<P>
The police action followed publication in the Times of Tonga of an interview
with Fuko and further comments published in Pohiva's pro-democracy
publication Kele'a.
<P>
PINA has English translations of the comments, which were published in the
Tongan language.
<P>
In any nation which respects fundamental rights the supposedly offending
comments would be regarded as legitimate comments on a matter of public
interest, Miller said.
<P>
The comments were in reaction to statements by the king in a Tongan
magazine, Matangi Tonga.
<P>
The king was critical of the People's representatives in the Legislative
Assembly.
<P>
The assembly is dominated by representatives of the kingdom's noble families
and by ministers who are appointed by the king and not elected. It also
includes People's representatives - such as Pohiva and Fuko - elected by
Tonga's commoners.

SPJ JOINS TONGAN PROTESTS</B>
<P>
I am distressed to learn, again, that the Tonga government has targeted a
journalist for arrest and detainment. As we did in September, the Society of
Professional Journalists calls upon the government to end its campaign of
intimidation against reporters.
<P>
Free societies have a vigorous and free press able to report freely on actions
and issues of interest to the citizens.  
<P>
SPJ also joins with the Pacific Media Watch in expressing great alarm at
reports regarding the possible registration and licensing of journalists.
Such actions would compromise the independence of the press and certainly
would raise questions about who is -- and who can't become -- a "registered
journalist" -- in Papua New Guinea.  
<P>
SPJ believes a free press means just that -- a press free to report,
accurately, fairly and with balance and responsibility, the developments in a
community. 
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>

2 TONGAN MPs FACE CHARGES OF SEDITION</B>
<P>
AUCKLAND: Tongan pro-democracy politicians who were taken into police
custody on Friday were out of jail yesterday and vowing to fight sedition
charges laid against them over their writings.
<P>
For the leader of the pro-democracy movement, Legislative Assembly member
'Akilisi Pohiva, it was the second spell in jail in the kingdom this year
while for another MP, Tesino Fuko, it was his first spell in jail.
<P>
Both men told AFP in a telephone interview yesterday they were picked up by
police from their homes on Friday night on documentation signed by Attorney
General Tevita Tupou.
<P>
Tupou is also the Minister of Justice and earlier this year Pohiva launched
a bid to have him impeached for going to the Atlanta Olympic Games in the
US without permission of the assembly.
<P>
When the independent Times of Tonga published details of Pohiva's notice of
impeachment the assembly sent Pohiva, Times editor kalafi Moala and deputy
editor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola to jail for 30 days for being in contempt of
the assembly.
<P>
They served 26 days in jail before the Supreme Court ordered their release
because procedures used by the assembly had been found unconstitutional.
<P>
Pohiva and Fuko said they were taken to jail because of articles they have
written.
<P>
"They put us in jail and then yesterday (Saturday) subjected us to a very
long, five-hour interview," Pohiva said.
<P>
"They told us it would go on for several days, but yesterday (Saturday)
they released us."
<P>
Pohiva said international publicity, including an appeal by Amnesty
International, was behind their quick release.
<P>
However, they have been charged with sedition although no dates for
hearings have been given.
<P>
He said his interrogation was related to an article he had written in his
pro-democracy movement's Kele'a newspaper.
<P>
Tonga's 100,000 commoners elect nine representatives while the kingdom's 30
nobles elect nine of their own to sit in the 30-seat assembly.
<P>
The 12 members of cabinet are appointed for life terms by the Pacific
island's King Taufau'ahau Tupou IV. - AFP<BR>

PACIFIC MEDIA WATCH PROTESTS OVER TONGAN ARRESTS</B>
<P>
Pacific Media Watch today protested over the reported arrests of two Tongan pro-democracy politicians and a journalist on sedition charges.
<P>
"We protest over the campaign of media harassment and suppression of freedom of expression by the Tongan government which has led to the detention of journalists and politicians for the third time in less than a year," PMW said in a statement.
<P>
PMW also voiced its "serious concern" over recent developments in Papua New Guinea where reports have said the Constitutional Review Commission was promoting draft media legislation designed to introduce registration for journalists and media organisations.
<P>
Pacific Media Watch is an independent group of journalists and academics monitoring censorship and media freedom issues in the region.
<P>
According to Amnesty International, two Tongan politicians, 'Akilisi Pohiva and Tesino Fuko, are reportedly being detained in police cells in Nuku'alofa while the deputy editor of the <B>Taimi 'o Tonga</B> newspaper, Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, has been released.
<P>
Amnesty said they were believed to be facing sedition charges over newspaper articles calling for greater democracy in the kingdom.
<P>
'Akau'ola was arrested with two pro-democracy supporters in February for "angering" Police Minister Clive Edwards.
<P>
On September 19, 'Akau'ola, his editor Kalafi Moala, and Pohiva, were jailed for 30 days for alleged contempt of Parliament for publishing a story about an impeachment motion against a minister. The motion for proceedings to begin was adopted by the Legislative Assembly the week after their jailing.
<P>
The Supreme Court ordered their release a week early because their imprisonment breached constitutional rules.
<P>
Pacific Media Watch called for the release of the detained Tongans.
<P>
It also urged Papua New Guinea's Constitutional Review Commission to seriously reconsider the implications of its legislative moves during its two weeks of "consultations".   
<P>
"PMW notes that the proposed legislation is out of step with the recommendations of the CRC media committee's findings in June that supported self-regulation, and it appears to be a violation of the democratic principles of news media and journalist independence," the statement said.
<P>
Pacific Media Watch cited Clause Nine of the International Federation of Journalists' "declaration of principles of conduct" which states: "Journalists worthy of that name shall deem it their duty to observe faithfully [the code]. Within the general law of each country the journalist shall recognise in professional matters the jurisdiction of colleagues only, to the exclusion of every kind of interference by governments or others."
<P>
Papua New Guinea has had a long and proud tradition of a vigorous and independent news media and has contributed much to building the nation, says the statement.

TONGA:  RELEASED  PRISONERS  OF  CONSCIENCE  DETAINED  AGAIN</B>
<P>
Amnesty International is alarmed about apparent Tongan Government attempts to intimidate journalists and pro-democracy politicians following the arrest today by Tongan police of two politicians and a journalist believed to be held on sedition charges. 
<P>
"For the third time this year journalists and politicians have been detained in Tonga as a result of peacefully criticising the government," Amnesty International said today.
<P>
"Only last month we welcomed the early release from prison of two of those arrested today whom we considered prisoners of conscience -- now it appears they are facing imprisonment again for similar activities but under different legislation."
<P>
The two politicians, 'Akilisi Pohiva and Tesina Fuko, are reportedly still being held in police cells in Nuku'alofa while deputy editor of the Times of Tonga, Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, has been released. They are believed to face sedition charges related to newspaper articles calling for greater democracy. 
<P>
In Tonga, a minority of [nine] members of parliament are elected by the general
population while another 21 seats are held by cabinet ministers, appointed by King Taufa 'ahau Tupou IV, and by nobles, traditional representatives of the King in the villages.
<P>
'Akilisi Pohiva is a pro-democracy leader and Tesina Fuko is the representative of the Ha'apai group of islands in the northeast of Tonga. Filokalafi 'Akau'ola had already been arrested with two other pro-democracy supporters in January for inciting Police Minister Clive Edwards to anger.
<P>
'Akilisi Pohiva and Filokalafi 'Akau'ola were imprisoned on 19 September by the
Legislative Assembly for contempt of Parliament but were released after three weeks by the Supreme Court which ruled their jailing violated the Constitution and the Rules of the House.
<P>
They had been imprisoned together with the editor of the Times of Tonga, Kalafi Moala, following the publication in the newspaper of a motion criticising the Minister of Justice. 
<P>
Their imprisonment was based on the claim that the motion had not been formally
submitted before publication on 4 September. But the Secretary of the Peoples'
Representatives group of parliamentarians had reportedly handed in the motion at the office of Parliament 11 days before it was published. 
<P>
"Tonga cannot escape international scrutiny of its human rights record by virtue of its size and isolation," Amnesty International said.

<P>
<I>
The Federal Government has Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
organisations in its sights, threatening major funding cuts and
showing little sympathy for self determination. But when <A HREF="../journos.htm#htarare">HECTOR
TARARE </A>spoke to long time Aboriginal activist Kevin Williams he
found hope rather than despair.</I>
<P>
The mood in Aboriginal organisations over the months since the
election of the new Howard Federal government has been one of
pessimism and a feeling that gains so slowly won may be reversed.
But one activist Kevin Williams, University of Technology, Sydney
law student and leader in the Tharawal community in Sydney's west
thinks that solidarity in fighting cutbacks may bring positive
results to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Instead
of destroying the movement for indigenous rights the Coalition
attacks may bring back its lost unity of purpose.
<P>
Williams has been part of the ups and down of the Aboriginal civil
rights movement for the past 30 years. He was one of a stolen
generation of Aboriginal children who spent their childhood in
institutions. From his days as a student activist in high school
to the heady time of the tent embassy outside Parliament House
in Canberra in 1972, Williams has been part of many major events
of Aboriginal history.
<P>
Looking back on the past 50 years of the Aboriginal civil rights
movement, Williams acknowledges the contribution of his mother's
generation to the struggle for equality.
<P>
&quot;My mother is 66 years old and before her time we just had
to accept what was given to us. From her generation onwards, we
started to realise we didn't have to accept this any more. We
don't have to take what is given to us, we don't have to do what
they tell us to do,&quot; Williams said.
<P>
He stresses the importance of generations passing on the baton
of experience. &quot;I have the greatest respect for the people
of my mother's generation who started the movement and who gave
us a platform to follow on with. I see it as really important
for my generation to pass the enthusiasm on to my children, to
say 'okay the fight's not won, you've got to keep fighting.
<P>
&quot;We have to do something for the next generation and make
sure that we constantly put before society that they can't do
what they have done to us in the past and get away with it.&quot;
<P>
Williams believes the progress which Aboriginal people have made
through their collective action has led to complacency in younger
Aboriginal people who no longer appreciate the struggle of previous
generations.
<P>
&quot;I think the younger generation coming through behind us
have lost the knowledge of what it is to fight for something that
you haven't got. These days it seems more easy for us to understand
that we've got something because we get access to things. The
fight has lost a bit of the early edge to it.&quot;
<P>
The Coalition government's threats of financial cuts to education
and social programs may present a rallying point to re-activate
Aboriginal civil rights programs. Many communities report that
factional disputes threaten to undo much of the work of the civil
rights movement. Part of the explanation for such disputes relates
to previous government policies in the nineteenth and twentieth
century when Aboriginal people were moved to establish new &quot;communities&quot;
regardless of differing social backgrounds.
<P>
Rallies which were held in Canberra and the major cities in May
indicate that young Aboriginal people are taking up the challenge
of resistance once again.
<P>
Kevin Williams thinks the development of a closer alliance between
Aboriginal people from city and rural areas is a high priority
in achieving self determination. The Mabo decision in the High
Court and the subsequent native title legislation has emphasised
land demands in rural areas. Aboriginal communities in cities
see the divisions between rural and urban Aborigines as a remnant
of the colonial period.
<P>
Williams is concerned that divisions in the Aboriginal movement
will reinforce attitudes which whites perpetrated in the past,
especially the view that city Aborigines are not authentic.
<P>
&quot;What we see happening in a number of cases is that we are
taking on those kinds of tools that were used to oppress us in
the past. Even in our communities some people are defining ourselves
in terms of skin colour in exactly the same way that white governments
of the part used to do with us,&quot; Williams said.
<P>
One issue which may bring Aboriginal people together could be
the failure of governments to implement the recommendations of
the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Royal
Commission presented a devastating picture of social conditions
in Aboriginal communities. Health standards, housing and unemployment
were shown to be at Third World levels yet governments have still
done little to address the problems.
<P>
Williams is critical of this failure. He is part of UTS's Aboriginal
research unit, Jumbunna's project on government responses to the
Royal Commission. The research findings are disturbing. &quot;The
recommendations of the Royal Commission have mostly not been implemented
or not implemented to the level that they should have,&quot; Williams
said.
<P>
&quot;The level to which Aboriginal people are oppressed daily
by the conditions around them leads to them being oppressed by
legal systems. We have to look no further than the gaols and the
courts.&quot;
<P>
Williams' advice to younger Aboriginal leaders is simple. &quot;What
I say is to be as informed as you possibly can. If you're informed
and know what your rights are, and know how to stand up and speak
up on issues, then that's the best way to deal with racism&quot;.

<P>
&quot;THE biggest one was the break in at the school&quot;, said
Peena Geia. &quot;The Justice Group really got a hold of them
and we brought them all back down to the school and stood over
them. They were not allowed to have any lunch. We punished them
in that way, 'Nothing, until you clean up this mess!'&quot;
<P>
The &quot;mess&quot; she refers to was the work of a dozen teenagers
who broke into the Home Economics room of the local school, defecated
in cooking pots and rubbish bins, threw frozen meat around and
turned the freezers off.
<P>
&quot;They had to clean up and make up for it. And nobody was
to leave. They were under supervision from morning until afternoon.
We just showed them and since then they've never broken in,&quot;
she said proudly.
<P>
Peena Geia is the Aboriginal spokesperson for the Palm Island
Justice Group. The youngest member of the group, Peena is a formidable
woman, a devout Christian with unstoppable energy.
<P>
The Palm Island Justice Group is run by a group of 25 highly respected,
local, Aboriginal elders. They believe the mainstream juvenile
justice system has failed their community. Prior to the group's
formation in 1993, most juvenile offenders from Palm Island ended
up in Queensland detention centres.
<P>
In Queensland, Indigenous kids make up 45 per cent of the youth
in detention yet only comprise four per cent of the total juvenile
population. Despite the extensive findings of the 1991 Royal Commission
into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander youth, nationwide, between the ages of ten and 17, are
still 19 times more likely to be held in detention than other
kids.
<P>
But these alarming statistics no longer apply to Palm Island (nor
do they apply to the several other Aboriginal-Torres Strait Islander
communities which have also adopted a local justice system). In
fact, a staggering 70 per cent of young offenders brought before
the Palm Island Group do not re-offend - a remarkable achievement
in stopping young people becoming victims of the criminal justice
system.
<P>
Kowanyama, an Aboriginal community near Magnificent Creek on the
Mitchell River delta in far North Queensland, has also formed
an elders' group. The Kowanyama Justice Council is made up of
18 elected representatives from the Kokobera, Kokomnjena and Kunjen
or &quot;top end mob&quot; clans.
<P>
In 1993, the Kowanyama Justice Council's first year, the rate
of juvenile offending dropped from 540 cases to two. One year
later, local police statistics showed a significant reduction
in local crime. Break and enter fell by 82 per cent from 207 charges
in 1993 to 37 charges in 1994. Charges for theft fell by 91 per
cent, and assault by 68 per cent.
<P>
The elders of the Kowanyama Justice Council are understandably
proud. For many, it is the first time in their lives that they
have been able to have an impact in their community. In Kowanyama,
some of the older women from the Justice Council also volunteer
to be the &quot;barefoot&quot; night patrol. Three nights a week,
armed with a stick, they walk the streets. Breaking up fights,
sending children back home, they keep a watchful eye on community
members.
<P>
In 1995 the Palm Island, Kowanyama and Pompuraaw (another remote
Aboriginal community in Cape York) Justice Groups received the
Australian Prevention of Violence Award by Government Heads of
State. The success of the Justice groups is heartening for their
old people. The Justice groups had received no more than $5000
per year in one-off grants from the Queensland Corrective Services
Commission.
<P>
Operating as informal courts, the Palm Island Justice Group and
Kowanyama Justice Council call people to appear before them. On
Palm Island, the Group's elders command such respect that, despite
having no formal enforcement power, nobody has yet refused to
appear in the tiny local court where meetings are held. Both Groups
provide peaceful settlements to local conflicts with an emphasis
on making offenders responsible for their actions. The &quot;clean-up&quot;
punishment was successfully invoked for another group of Palm
Island teenagers who vandalised the school. For two weeks they
were made to clean up the school, the pre-school, kindergarten
and school grounds. &quot;The teacher was amazed, because they
cleaned up so well,&quot; said Peena. &quot;They even dug out
all the sand and they found that there were two extra steps which
the teachers never knew they had! Now that really stopped them.
Then their attendance was really good after that!&quot;
<P>
In Kowanyama the Justice Council elders drove a group of boys
who had stolen a car, several kilometres out of the community.
They were then left to walk all the way back home.
<P>
The humiliation was very real. Crucial to the success of these
justice groups is the role of &quot;shame&quot;, explains Peena,
&quot;It sure has an impact because they know that it's a shame
thing with our people. Many of our people know that they can misuse
the white man's law, but they know they can't do it amongst their
own. They know the Murri law is stronger, it always was and it
always will be. Our laws are very real, and if they, (Europeans),
did not interfere in the first place we wouldn't have all the
trouble we have today.&quot;
<P>
The roots of the juvenile justice problems in these communities
lie with the legacy of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal
Affairs which governed them until 1986. The Department, for example,
established a reserve on Palm Island in 1918. Until the late 1960s,
the threat of being sent from the mainland missions to Palm Island
was the heaviest sanction a Department manager could invoke. In
1996 the State government finally ceded control to the local Aboriginal
Council.
<P>
Nowadays the term &quot;community&quot; describes a large settlement
of dispossessed survivors. Unemployment in many Aboriginal communities
soars at 90 per cent. Elders in Palm Island and Kowanyama deplore
the lack of opportunities available to their young and acknowledge
that a lot of youth crime occurs because of sheer boredom.
<P>
In Kowanyama, the Justice Council is actively working with the
local police, local Aboriginal Council and state school to try
to increase opportunities for the unemployed and school age kids.
A new disco, BMX track, swimming pool, and indoor cricket hall
are part of this initiative. An annual excursion for young people
to other Aboriginal communities in the Cape York region, and regular
trips with their elders out bush, are now regularly organised.
<P>
Banjo Patterson, &quot;ol Runkie Banjo&quot; as he is affectionately
known, is a Kowanyama elder. 68 years old, he is from the Kokomnjena
clan and worked for most of his life on the cattle properties
in far North Queensland. Kowanyama was also once a mission. As
he says, &quot;I was brought up the hard way&quot;. Banjo is highly
respected, feared and admired by many young people. As a Justice
Council elder, he tells the parents of kids in trouble. &quot;Make
sure you look after them, take good care of them. That's what
you're there for, to take good care of them children, rear them
up proper way, not just running them loose. When they get out
of hand, they're gone forever. You might not ever catch up on
them again.&quot; A lot of parents don't seem to understand. They
say, &quot;You can't boss somebody else's children around, you
can't!' We say, 'Well, if you don't do it, someone else has to
do it, someone else has to straighten it up elsewhere'. So we're
trying our best to straighten things up to make things good for
the parents ... someone got to do it.&quot;
<P>
Despite the Kowanyama Justice Council's success in reducing juvenile
crime, Banjo is aware of the Group's limitations. &quot;They listen
there while we give them talking up, they'll listen to us there.
But soon as they walk through the door, they do the same thing
again,&quot; he laughs. 'Yeah, you've got to keep at 'em you know.
And then, they might learn, sooner or later. That's why we're
trying our hardest, we're still trying. Most of them are getting
a bit better, not much, but they still got a lead on us, you know,
and we're going to try and get that back to make things go normal
you know, make it good.&quot;
<P>
Both groups know the importance of sitting down and talking to
their troubled youth. Many meetings involve hours of counselling.
The kid's relations are also asked to attend. The Palm Island
elders are always delighted when teenagers regarded as &quot;hard
cases&quot; come back, stepping shyly into the courtroom to give
their quiet thanks for having received advice when it was most
needed.
<P>
&quot;We've had a couple of young ones come in and be bold in
their way. 'We don't have to listen to you!', they say and they
try and storm out. Then we jump up and hit the table and stop
them in their tracks. Then you'd have old Bill speak very steady
and they'd sit down. 'You walk out that door and you'll get the
biggest shock of your life. You'll be going out and put out by
police escort; put off this place so quick and smart you won't
know what hit you!'&quot; said Peena. She nods affirmatively,
as if to say, &quot;Of course this is the way it should be.&quot;
<P>
In Kowanyama, elders have punished some juvenile offenders by
banishing them from the community or by giving them a public belting.
Elders believe that for many of the &quot;harder cases&quot; the
possibility of ending up in prison is no longer a deterrent. After
a few young men broke into the Aboriginal Council and damaged
the building, it was decided by their families, community elders
and Council staff to publicly belt them. While acknowledging that
not everyone agreed to the punishment, a staff member said, &quot;I
must say that the public belting was in no means sinister ...
It was done in public where everybody could see. The beltings
were given by an uncle of two of the men and the third person
was given a belting by his grandfather.&quot;
<P>
Public beltings are regarded by some as a controversial solution
to juvenile offending. When visiting Kowanyama I asked people
about their opinion of the &quot;floggings&quot;. Without qualification,
local educators, police and administrators supported the idea.
I also went to the local school and spoke to two boys about the
Justice Council. Both believed the elders are doing their best
for their community and that the other kids who had been publicly
punished deserved it. I later spoke to two other boys who had
been before the Kowanyama Justice Council elders on numerous occasions.
They admitted that their old people scared them, but they defended
the right of the elders to punish them. &quot;They don't care
about anybody!&quot;, one defiant boy said. But when I asked him
what he would do if he was an old man and his kids were the ones
in trouble, he quickly answered, &quot;Flog 'em!&quot;.
<P>
The use of punishments such as public beltings has without a doubt
been a controversial issue in recent debates about the use of
Aboriginal law and custom. On the one hand, various people in
some communities believe it is their right to apply the law in
that way. On the other, punishments such as beltings and spearing
breach international human rights treaties such as the Convention
on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture.
<P>
Whether a community uses customary law, and to what degree it
uses it, also raises issues about Aboriginal self-determination
and peoples' rights. In Kowanyama, elders believe that applying
Aboriginal law is in the interest of their community and its people.
It is their right - their collective right - to live in peace
without an unacceptable level of violence and crime. And if belting
juveniles is the way to achieve that, they see it as their right
to use it as a punishment. For Kowanyama elders, their solution
is an exercise in self-determination.
<P>
But how an Aboriginal community deals with community strife will
depend on what each community considers acceptable. What's done
in relation to juvenile offenders in Kowanyama may not be an acceptable
solution for a similar problem in other Queensland communities.
The use of public beltings or other such punishments will, in
some areas, be seen as violating the offender's human rights.
Obviously, the tension between &quot;self-determination&quot;
and human right standards is still an issue which needs to be
worked out.
<P>
The elders know their justice groups are not simply about crime
prevention. Their commitment is to restoring Aboriginal structures
of authority. Australian and international experts often discuss
the need for effective alternatives to jailing the young. It is
inspiring to see a group of old people have such a positive impact.
In Palm Island and Kowanyama, grass roots justice is working.
The elders are proud. As one elder said, &quot;It is keeping our
people out of prison and seeing that justice is done within the
community.&quot;

<P>By <A HREF="../journos.htm#hterare">Hector Terare</A></CENTER>
<P>
AN UNIMPOSING grey building in Elizabeth Street in Sydney has
been, at various time a social club, cinema and headquarters of
the Knights of the Southern Cross, a secret organisation within
the Catholic Church. The owners of the unremarkable looking building,
the trustees of the Cyprus - Hellene Club want to sell the building
to developers and move the club to outer suburbs.
<P>
But members of the Aboriginal community and their supporters regard
the building as a site of national significance. On January 1938
as white Australia celebrated 150 as a British colony and nation,
100 Aboriginal men and women gathered in the then Australian Hall
to mourn the loss of their land and demand basic human rights.
<P>
The meeting was the first nation wide civil rights protest. It
was called a &quot;Day of Mourning and Protest&quot; and those
who took part risked severe penalties for taking part in the protest.
Some of the protest leaders were removed from missions and reserves
by white managers when they tried to address local protest meetings.
<P>
The Aboriginal History Committee, which is leading the fight to
preserve the building has sought a Permanent Conservation Order
on the building.
<P>
The Aboriginal History Committee was formed at the University
of Technology, Sydney (UTS) in 1994 to pursue issues related to
Aboriginal history and heritage in response to the threat posed
to the Day of Mourning Site. Students and staff who formed the
committee decided to focus on the issue of preserving the site,
while also pursuing other issues related to Aboriginal history
and heritage.
<P>
The Committee, which is now a permanent body will soon hold a
forum to establish a national history body.
<P>
Ronald Briggs, Chairperson of the committee recognises the 1938
meeting in the Elizabeth Street building as the beginning of the
Aboriginal civil rights movement. 
<P>
&quot;We all need to value the contributions made by those who
have struggled to ensure that we have basic rights,&quot; Briggs
said.
<P>
When plans for the sale and demolition of the building were announced
in 1994, the Committee fought for a Commission of Inquiry. Esme
Beaupark, the Secretary of the Committee, an Aboriginal student
at UTS, who commenced tertiary study in her late fifties played
a key role in the successful fight for the Commission of Inquiry.
She died after a short illness in January this year.
<P>
At a Commission of Inquiry in 1995 Beaupark and other Aboriginal
activists, supported by the Australian Heritage Commission, National
Trust and Sydney City Council argued for a Permanent Conservation
order on the building.
<P>
More than one year after the inquiry, the NSW Minister for Urban
Affairs, Craig Knowles, has neither publicly released the findings
of the Committee, nor announced the decision on the conservation
order.
<P>
Briggs recently outlined the reasons for seeking a permanent order.
<P>
&quot;Since the onset of European occupation, most traditional
sites of significance have been obliterated. The errors of the
past must not be repeated. The building at 150-152 Elizabeth Street
Sydney is a site of contemporary Aboriginal heritage&quot;, Briggs
said.
<P>
The 1938 rally was attended by activists who are now recognised
as leaders in the struggle for Aboriginal civil rights. Among
those present were Jack Patten, William Ferguson, Pearl Gibbs,
Pastor Doug Nicholls, Margaret Tucker, William Cooper and Jack
Kinchella.
<P>
Those who attended the Day of Mourning put forward a ten point
recommendation which many see as the basis of Federal Government
intervention in Aboriginal Affairs.
<P>
&quot;My involvement with trying to save the Day of Mourning Site
has shown that a lot of people out there are still pretty ignorant.
I suppose legally our rights have been enhanced with civil rights,
land rights and Mabo but socially and politically we have much
more to achieve&quot;, Briggs said.
<P>
Once a Permanent Conservation Order has been granted, the Aboriginal
History Committee has proposed that the building be developed
as an Aboriginal History Centre. The Centre would include a museum
to Aboriginal heroes, resource and information centre, a base
for Aboriginal Heritage Tours and a theatre for films plays, public
lectures and special events.
<P>
According to a statement published by the Aboriginal History Committee,
&quot;the building provides a physical and atmospheric link to
the 1930's era. It evokes sensations of the 1938 event which could
not be re-created in a modern setting&quot;.
<P>
At a rally outside the building in March this year, supporters
of the campaign were joined by descendents of the civil rights
leaders to demand that the site be preserved for future generations.
<P>
The protesters heard a passionate call from the son of Jack Kinchela
to preserve the building. Pauline Gordon, the daughter of Jack
Patten attended with her grandson, Joe. Another link with the
1938 protest was June Barker, the grand-daughter of William Ferguson.
Ms Barker spoke to protesters about the significance of the Day
of Mourning Site for all Aboriginal Australians.
<P>
Ronald Briggs described the emotion at the March 9 rally this
year as older descendants told the young in attendance about the
courage of their great grandparents who attended the Day of Mourning
and Protest fifty eight years ago. &quot;Many people cried openly
as they entered the building,&quot; Briggs said.
<P>
There have been 629 Permanent Protection Orders granted to preserve
sites of white heritage in New South Wales.
<P>
The campaign to save the Cyprus-Hellene Club building is the first
bid for a Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage
Act for a site of Aboriginal Historical Significance.
<P>
The campaign to save the Day of Mourning site is not merely about
preserving a building. It is also about changing the belief, held
by many Australians that Aboriginal history ended with colonisation,
and that Aboriginal heritage is limited to cave paintings and
similar remnants of pre-1788 life.
<P>
Until now Aboriginal heritage claims have been dealt with through
National Parks and Wildlife legislation. Members of the Aboriginal
History Committee argue that Aboriginal heritage claims should
be pursued like non-Aboriginal claims, through national and state
heritage acts.
<P>
 The Aboriginal History Committee is seeking public support for
the preservation campaign. Aboriginal and non Aboriginal people
are encouraged to write to Mr Bob Carr, Premier of New South Wales
and Mr Craig Knowles, Minister for Planning, expressing concern
that the findings of the 1995 Inquiry have not been released.

<P>
Indonesia's decision to proceed with the construction of the country's
first nuclear reactor in Java, raises serious safety concerns
in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, recent studies by the
Australian National University (ANU) show. The studies of nuclear
fallout predict that most of northern Australia would be covered
in radioactive cloud. Yet emergency plans for this part of Australia
are far from ready to deal with this disturbing scenario.
<P>
The Assistant Director of Emergency Management Australia (EMA),
Robin Herron admits that EMA has no nationally coordinated emergency
plan for the spread of radioactive cloud from a reactor accident.
Herron said that Australia did not have an emergency plan in the
case of this type of accident in Java or in South-East Asia because
this is an &quot;unrealistic scenario.&quot; Yet leading Indonesian
activists and academics have concerns that this scenario is very
realistic (see box).
<P>
Herron rejects the findings of the recent fallout studies done
by ANU because he says Indonesia is too far away. Although conceding
he has not read the ANU study, Herron says that the levels of
radiation would be very low and a radioactive cloud would disperse
before reaching Australia. He argues that the water cooled reactors,
built since Chernobyl, would contain the radioactive leakage if
an accident occurred.
<P>
According to Mr Mick Lucas, Director of the Northern Territory
State Emergency Service (NTSES), the Northern Territory has no
plans for a nuclear reactor accident. According to Lucas the only
emergency plan SES can fall back on for a reactor accident is
a &quot;storm surge plan&quot;. (A storm surge happens when the
cyclone whips up the tides to create a flood).
<P>
A key problem with this approach to emergency services is that
although nuclear fallout doesn't recognise state boundaries, the
response to the accident is determined by these boundaries. The
response to a radioactive cloud spreading over northern Australia
would require coordination of a number of different plans from
different states. While cooperation between states, such as between
the Northern Territory and Queensland, allows for cross border
operations, it is not an actual plan for mobilising emergency
resources.
<P>
Herron says that EMA has a comprehensive contingency plan to deal
with radiation leakage from a nuclear powered ship. However this
plan is based on organising the evacuation of a major city, for
example clearing the population of an area of three to four kilometres,
not a whole state. EMA also has an emergency plan if radioactive
debris were to fall to Australia.
<P>
The recently released nuclear fallout studies by Dr John Taylor
at the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies, ANU, predict
that an accident would be most detrimental for northern Australia
during summer when fallout would cover the region within 48 hours.
Dr Taylor says that although his model had allowed for a reduction
in the radioactive concentration of the cloud as it travelled
from central Java, radioactivity would still be 75 percent of
the levels at the site of the accident.
<P>
The study was not based on a Chernobyl style accident but could
be applied to map fallout for any type of reactor accident.Dr
Taylor said in the months from December to February the cloud
could travel south quite quickly and it would be &quot;a good
idea&quot; to have a radiation detector somewhere off the coast
of Darwin, such as at Christmas Island. He said that if there
were rainfall just after the accident, this would probably increase
the amount of radioactive particles that reached Australian soil.
Dr Taylor said rainfall after the Chernobyl accident in 1986,
increased the dosage of fallout England received.
<P>
This study confirms the conclusions of an earlier study done by
the Strategic Centre at ANU, 1991.
<P>
If one of Java's reactors leaked radiation, Indonesia would be
obliged by international regulations to notify its neighbours,
including Australia, and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) as soon as possible. However when the Chernobyl reactor
overheated it was several days before the Soviets notified any
of their neighbours. It was only after the high levels of radiation
in the atmosphere were detected by monitoring equipment in central
Europe that the Soviet Government admitted that there had been
an accident.
<P>
Alternatively if Indonesia failed to notify Australia of an accident,
the release of radioactive cloud into the atmosphere could be
picked up by the air radiation monitors located in either Darwin
or Perth. Filter papers which collect the sample particles are
sent to the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) in Melbourne
for analysis. Currently, however radiation monitoring occurs on
a weekly basis, too slow for the early detection of high radiation
levels.
<P>
According to Malcolm Cooper from ARL this radiation testing process
could be sped up. He said if the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
currently being internationally negotiated, was implemented, Australia
as part of an international network of monitoring stations would
make daily checks on air radiation levels.
<P>
If daily checks were made Cooper said that within four hours of
receiving the test samples ARL scientists would be alerted to
abnormally high radiation levels. So if radioactive fallout was
collected on samples taken in Darwin in a 24 hour period, the
samples flown to Melbourne and tested within four hours, it would
take approximately 30 hours before State Emergency Services (SES)
were notified. This leaves the respective SES's 18 hours in which
to organise the evacuation of their state, or else organise alternative
safety shelters.
<P>
Cooper said that AL was &quot;looking at incorporating&quot; an
automatic radiation detector into its system within two years.
He said this system was &quot;the best sort of early warning device
for accidents&quot; used around the world. This device automatically
processes samples every 24 hours, bypassing the need for a laboratory
examination. With this system in place the notification time of
an accident would be shortened.
<P>
Assuming SES's storm surge plan was activated there may easily
be some teething problems because the storm surge plan has never
been tested. Cyclone Tracey was the closest that Darwin came to
a storm surge. Lucas from the Northern Territory's SES said Cyclone
Tracy was mild compared to the storm that would have raged through
Darwin if the tides had been high.
<P>
Lucas agrees that the effects of a storm surge and a nuclear reactor
accident are quite different. The major difference being that
the surge is only expected to cover a coastal strip for 24 kilometres
spreading two kilometres inland and SES would expect to have up
to 24 hours notice. Whereas according to the recent ANU study
a nuclear accident at the wrong time of year spreads a cloud covering
the northern Australia in 48 hours.
<P>
Lucas admits that if the whole of the Territory were to be evacuated
SES would have a logistical nightmare on their hands.
<P>
Allowing for a warning time of between six to 12 hours in which
time the media can advise people to evacuate and the different
arms of the SES can be organised, the plan assumes the &quot;orderly
departure&quot; of the population of Darwin along the major highway.
However if the whole of the Territory were to evacuate along this
route perhaps their departure would not be so orderly.
<P>
Lucas says SES's solution would be to organise shelter for the
population of the Territory. Yet there are currently no radiation
proof shelters in existence in the Territory
<P>
The emergency plan for a surge involves the evacuation of Darwin's
population of approximately 80 000 people with the assistance
of 700 emergency workers. This includes 200 police, 100 ambulance
workers and 400 volunteers. Mr Lucas wasn't sure how many SES
workers there were in the whole of the Territory but he said there
were 775 in the police force available for assistance.
<P>
Lucas was unable to give transportation details for the 1.3 million
head of cattle in the Territory but he says this would be the
responsibility of the Department of Primary Industry. The cattle
industry the most valuable primary industry in the Northern Territory
notched up $107 million in total sales in the last year alone.
A major industry which it would be impossible to protect from
a radioactive cloud is the fishing industry (worth $95 million
in total sales last year).
<P>
A major hurdle to the smooth running of the emergency plan is
how SES would evacuate all the Aborigines scattered on remote
outstations in the Territory. The latest figures from the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in Alice Springs,
indicate that 13 000 Aborigines, living in the vicinity of Alice
Springs, are spread over an area of 830 000 square kilometres.
<P>
Dave Price from ATSIC in Alice Springs said he was &quot;concerned&quot;
about the health effects of a radioactive cloud on the Aboriginal
people particularly as he has witnessed adverse affects on Aborigines
exposed to radiation during the Maralinga nuclear tests conducted
in South Australia.
<P>
Price said the Aboriginal communities are hard to monitor because
the size of the communities is very &quot;fluid&quot;. Most are
contactable by phone or short wave radio, but the location of
some smaller communities is known only to their families.
<P>
Price points out seasonal flooding is a feature of some of the
remote areas that Aboriginal communities inhabit. &quot;In an
emergency people would have to be flown out&quot; of these regions
says Price. He says that for six months of the year &quot;nobody
moves anywhere&quot; in the Catherine region, round the Daly River
area and in parts of Arnham Land.
<P>
Price also points out that there were several small islands off
the coast of the Northern territory where the only form of transport
is by air. The SES's storm surge emergency plan for Aboriginal
communities on small islands involves them moving to higher ground
to avoid flooding but on some islands their is no provision for
their evacuation.
<P>
Is it &quot;patronising&quot; to ask about Indonesia's safety
standards?
<P>
In Australia, Senator Parer, Minister for Energy and Resources,
suggested in March this year that it is &quot;patronising&quot;
to question whether Indonesia will be able to construct a nuclear
reactor which satisfies international safety standards. While
Indonesia's pro-nuclear spokes-people are confident that an accident
is highly unlikely.
<P>
Iyos Subki, the President of BATAN (Indonesian atomic energy agency)
assured Australians on ABC's Lateline that the likelihood of an
accident occurring would be a &quot;one in a million years&quot;
event.
<P>
Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that Indonesia's construction
procedures are not as regulated as in the West. Dr Clive Hamilton,
an economic adviser to the Indonesian Government in the early
1990's, says Western engineers were critical of Indonesians construction
and regulation standards. They cited construction workers and
engineers who took a lot of shortcuts when building major works.
Dr Hamilton questions whether strict construction procedures and
the rigorous engineering required to build a reactor would be
compromised.
<P>
Hamilton also notes BATAN's nuclear proposal was &quot;completely
quarantined&quot; and &quot;only BBPT (the Science and Technology
Ministry) had access to it&quot; when he was working there. This
raises the question of how Indonesia would be able to establish
an independent regulatory body, required by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to monitor the operation of the reactor.
<P>
Dr Hamilton also questioned whether Indonesia would be able to
financially operate a nuclear power station according to the safety
levels required internationally by the International Atomic energy
Agency (IAEA).
<P>
Indonesian anti-nuclear activists have questioned the economics
behind the Canadian Atomic Energy Company's (AECL) bid for the
construction of the reactor. &quot;Canada has found nuclear plants
are not economical, because of the public's high demand for safety
standards&quot; but &quot;now they are dumping their nuclear power
plants on us&quot; said Mohammad Anung, a campaigner with leading
environmental group WAHLI, in the <I>Jakarta Post</I> in January
this year.
<P>
According to Dr Aditjondro, a leading Indonesian environmentalist,
the feasibility study commissioned by the Indonesian Government,
failed to include an assessment of the effect of a volcanic faultline
and a minor crater at Mount Muria, the proposed site. Dr Aditjondro,
in a paper on Indonesia's nuclear industry released in April this
year, points out that the limits to the feasibility study have
been criticised by the IAEA.
<P>
Senator Parer announced in March that Australia would be keen
to sell uranium to Indonesia. The sale of uranium would need to
be covered under a bilateral agreement which followed the guidelines
of IAEA's regulations on the sale of uranium. A spokesperson from
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could not say when
Australia might sign such an agreement.

<I>
Agent Orange defoliants sprayed by the US during the war destroyed
more than 100 000 hectares of mangrove forests in the south of
Vietnam. Now, ironically, development, not war, is their biggest
threat.<A HREF="../journos.htm#ttrinh">TRINH THANH THUY</A> reports.
</I>
<P>
HANOI - an ambitious land reclamation program is under way in
the northern province of Quang Ninh.
<P>
Experts predict it will provide an additional 2000 hectares of
land for agricultural and aquacultural purposes. This in turn
will boost expansion of the local economy as well as create many
jobs for soldiers and their families under Vietnam's Third Military
Zone Command, one of the main designers of the program.
<P>
But Vietnamese scientists are worrying that the project, called
the Bac Cua Luc project, may turn out to be a disaster for the
local environment. The reclaimed land, most of it originally covered
by mangrove, might soon become barren.
<P>
Under the program, a 17 kilometre dyke is to be built on tideland
along the coast of Hoanh Bo district on tideland. The dyke will
prevent salt water from entering the district so that the land
can be used for cultivation.
<P>
But according to experts, unless the land is regularly supplied
with enough fresh water, it will soon turn fallow in the dry season.
(Similar failures have occurred on some 50 000 hectares in the
south and 35 000 hectares in the north.) The rehabilitation of
mangroves on this land will then be almost impossible because
there will no longer be a tidal flow (an essential condition for
the development of the plant system). As it is, the embankments
built for many of the large shrimp ponds along the coast, estuaries
and river banks have already considerably reduced the extent of
tide distribution.
<P>
Mangrove forests play an important role in protecting the coastline,
widening the mainland, regulating the climate, and maintaining
local biodiversity.
<P>
In 1943, just before the two Indochina wars, Vietnam had about
400 000 hectares of mangrove forests along the country's coastline
and estuaries, mainly in the south. But Agent Orange defoliants
sprayed by the US during the war destroyed more than 100 000 hectares
of these mangrove forests. Not only did the trees die and the
animals lose their habitat, but the health of the local people
was also seriously affected, with subsequent generations continuing
to bear the consequences. Much of the forests have since been
rehabilitated, but the acreage is still estimated at just over
one-third of what it was then. Now, overdevelopment, not war,
is the biggest threat to the mangroves.
<P>
Apart from the conversion of mangrove forests for cultivation
purposes, mangroves are also been recklessly destroyed to make
shrimp ponds.
<P>
Lured by the profits made from the shrimp export, the Vietnamese
Government and local authorities in many coastal provinces have
encouraged shrimp farming. This move was intended to compensate
for the fact that catches have decreased. But meanwhile the Government
has done little to protect the now vulnerable local forests.
<P>
According to the Sea Products Export Company, the total area of
water shrimp ponds expanded rapidly from 50 000 hectares in 1981
to 120 000 hectares in 1987.
<P>
Other scourges of the mangrove forests have been their conversion
to fields for salt production or mining activities. Urbanisation
and the construction of dykes, dams and roads also endanger mangrove
forests.
<P>
In fact, many of these &quot;developmental&quot; activities have
backfired in no uncertain fashion.
<P>
The most serious and long term negative effect is said to be the
reduction in both quantity and variety of aquatic creatures such
as shrimps, crabs, fish and oysters. Shrimp reared in a large
number of ponds died en masse in 1994, causing a loss of over
290 billion dong (roughly US$29 million) for the aquacultural
sector. Other reptiles, birds and animals have also been deprived
of their habitats and food sources.
<P>
Experts say this was a result of changes in the soil's properties,
particularly in the formation of sulfuric acid through direct
exposure to sunlight following the destruction of mangroves.
<P>
The large size of the shrimp breeding pond and the relatively
few sluice gates meant that the water exchange between the pond
and the outside environment was inadequate. Rain water carried
acidic soil from adjacent hills and embankments into the pond,
quickly reducing the acidity levels. This, added to the rapid
change in salt levels caused by vaporisation during sunny weather,
proved fatal for the shrimps.
<P>
This acidification process is also one reason behind the degradation
of large areas of reclaimed land. Furthermore, unsustainable shrimp
farming and the destruction of forests has increased water pollution
and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in these areas due to greenhouse
emmissions (from the decomposition of the peat layer) no longer
being absorbed by mangroves.
<P>
Additional negative effects have even been felt inland, further
up the river.
<P>
The north-east monsoon brings salt water through rivers deep into
the mainland, affecting land both protected by the river dykes
and outside. This is because the salt water is absorbed through
the soil layers in the body and foot of the dyke. Due to the shortage
of fresh water and low humidity in the dry season, the salt comes
to the soil surface and damages cultivated plants, triggering
disputes between shrimp breeders and agricultural farmers. This
intrusion of salt water has also caused erosion along rivers.
<P>
Addressing the 'mangrove' problem,<B> </B>Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet recently declared Vietnam's determination to protect the
mangrove forests. To the delight of environmentalists, he ordered
the replanting of mangroves in coastal areas.
<P>
But many obstacles lie ahead.<B> </B>Most of the damage caused
in the past has its roots in rapid population growth and poor
economic and resource management, especially at the local level.
Over the past 50 years, Vietnam's population has more than doubled
to an average of 200 people per kilometre. This cannot help but
continue to increase pressure on the limited resources of land,
fuel and construction materials.
<P>
Dr Phan Nguyen Hong, director of Mangrove Ecosystem Research Centre
of Hanoi National University, has been engaged for a long time
in efforts to protect and replant the forests.
<P>
Hong complains about both the lack of expertise in several responsible
state agencies as well as the short sighted policies implemented
by local leaders. These leaders, according to Hong, are either
unaware of the value of mangrove forests, or think only of the
immediate benefits of their exploitation.
<P>
&quot;We are trying to help them to understand the importance
of mangrove forests and providing necessary expertise. But the
government should have appropriate policies in this direction,&quot;
Hong said.
<P>
Indeed, shrimp farming could still be economical if appropriate
techniques were applied to regulate tidal flow into the pond so
that mangroves can thrive.
<P>
In some localities, such as Ho Chi Minh City and Minh Hai province,
part of the destroyed forests have recently been replanted. Hong,
however, notes that these efforts will be meaningless if forest
destruction is not stopped altogether. &quot;The area planted
has only been one tenth of what was cut down at the same time,&quot;
he said.
<P>
Another problem is the lack of capital for reforestation and mangrove
forest-based sustainable economic development. Except for a program
to plant wind breaker forests along the coast of a number of provinces,
most of the other projects - mainly funded by non-governmental
organisations - are very small in size.
<P>
The biggest projects, soon to be implemented, include restoring
mangrove forests in three southern provinces with a $50 million
World Bank loan, and another combining shrimp farming with forest
conservation with Australian and Thai co-operation.
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Bac Cua Luc project, the construction of a dam
(essential to supply fresh water for the reclaimed land) has not
yet started as the VND5 billion needed has not been sourced.
<P>
&quot;We have been saying again and again that they should not
start the project until there is enough fresh water, but they
are too impatient,&quot; Hong complains, adding that he was afraid
the project may fail.
<P>
Hong says his centre has also prepared and helped publish documents
disseminating essential knowledge about mangroves. These will
be distributed to farmers, school students, and organised training
courses.

<P>By <A HREF="../journos.htm#ttrinh">Trinh Thanh Thuy</A></CENTER>
<P>
Hanoians are obsessed with the fear of having to wade to work
along streets-turned-to-rivers after long and hard rains.
<P>
It is a scene which is all too common during the wet season. But
in this case, nature is not to blame. The flooding has been caused
by years of overdevelopment.
<P>
With six metres between its highest and lowest points, water drainage
in the Red River City is very slow. Fortunately, the city was
endowed with another means of drainage: the many lakes and ponds
in and around the city. This gift of nature not only enhanced
the city's beauty, but also served as an effective traditional
water regulating system.
<P>
Yet for many years Hanoians have been sacrificing this natural
seasonal convenience for the sake of the all-year-round comfort
of their own fast growing families: they have been filling the
lakes to expand their area for housing.
<P>
<B>The New Venice of the East?</B>
<P>
Many of Hanoi's lakes, ponds and swamps have been filled since
the city was set up ten centuries ago (when boats and rafts were
the main means of transport). But rapid population growth in the
last 20 years has sped the filling of the lakes.
<P>
n the 70s, Hanoi had about 210 lakes, less than 20 of which remain
today. Today the lakes and ponds in Hanoi, into which excessive
rain water flows, have an estimated area of only seven square
kilometres, with a total capacity of approximately 15 million
cubic metres.
<P>
However, as land for housing construction becomes scarcer, people
continue to fill these lakes and ponds with waste, scrap iron,
and rubber and then build houses for both their own use and for
illegal sale.
<P>
In Nam Dong Street, Quoc Lao Lake was reduced to a narrow ditch
of only two metres wide. In Quang Ba village, several large ponds
disappeared, giving way to new villas and houses.
<P>
Whilst in some cases this was done with the consent of the local
authorities, in most circumstances the encroacher had immediately
- and, more importantly, <I>irreversibly</I> - built a house on
the illegally occupied land. Once there, they were more than willing
to pay a fine which was a fraction of what they would gain in
the soaring housing market.
<P>
Last year, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet ordered the demolition of
illegal houses and villas built on the safety corridor of the
river dyke in the Yen Phu-Nhat Tan area. Cracks in the dyke, caused
by the weight of the houses, were discovered just before the beginning
of the flood season. The police and the army were called in to
demolish the houses and ensure security during the process. A
number of officials involved in the scandal were arrested. It
was the most serious breach of the dyke protection law in Vietnam
to date.
<P>
Such strong action has not been taken on squatters in other parts
of the city however, and Hanoi's lake area continues to decrease.
<P>
Consequently, showers with rainfall of over 100mm usually result
in the city being submerged in a mixture of rain and domestic
waste water at 60 different places for several days. In some streets,
the flooded stretches may be as long as hundreds of metres, with
water occasionally up to waist height.
<P>
According to official figures, Hanoi has 230 kilometres of main
streets, thousands of kilometres of side streets and lanes, but
only 127 kilometres of sewers. More than half of the latter are
under streets built over 50 years ago for a population of 200
000 people. And yet today Hanoi's population is over one million
people in the city centre alone. Many sections of the system have
consequently collapsed or are seriously degraded. Meanwhile drainage
has not been given adequate consideration in a number of newly
constructed quarters.
<P>
Encroachment on the main canals and accumulation of solid matter
often blocks water flow at many parts. Furthermore, the maximum
capacity of the Thanh Liet sluice gate (the final outlet of the
city's drainage system) is 30 cubic metres per second, only one-third
over the discharge rate required when the rainfall reaches 100mm.
Hence flooding becomes inevitable once there is not enough space
for temporary storage in the city.
<P>
<B>Waste, Sewage and Fish</B>
<P>
The total liquid waste of the city, estimated by the Hanoi Water
Service to be 200 000 cubic metres per day, passes directly into
the common drainage system untreated.
<P>
Waste water, including chemicals, dyes, heavy metals, and hospital
waste, then flows into the city's lakes, ponds or local rivers
and is used for fish rearing and irrigation. Scientists fear that
this practice, although it helps deal with a considerable amount
of organic matter in the waste water and accounts for almost all
the vegetable and fish supply for Hanoi, will have negative effects
on people's health and the underground water table.
<P>
All of the lakes, except for the West Lake which remains relatively
clean due to its size. 4.15 square kilometres, are seriously polluted.
Most of these lakes have ditches connecting them to sewage outlets.
The content of hydrogen sulphide in waste water flowing into the
Bay Mau lake in Lenin Park can measure up to 12 milligrams a litre,
which is 1000 times the safe level for fish rearing. Despite this,
the lake continues to be used for that purpose.
<P>
The amount of solid matter flowing into the lakes is also on the
rise. This is adding to the metres of thick mud layer already
at the bottom of the lake.
<P>
Recently Hanoi's Drainage Service Company and Park Company began
dredging and have paved the banks of some lakes in a move to prevent
further encroachment into them and to improve their condition.
<P>
But it is only a small part of the work to be done.
<P>
The Municipal Environment Protection Committee has drawn up a
master plan for the drainage service sector in the period 1995-2010.
The $1.1 billion project, expected to be funded with Japanese
official development assistance, consists of several phases and
many components.
<P>
But despite the plan, flooding and waste water seems set to be
in the Hanoians' path for years to come.

<P>
<I>New South Wales police have looked to America for a new weapon
in the war against drugs. And, as <A HREF="../journos.htm#blin">BRUCE LIN</A> discovers, the results
are boosting law enforcement budgets.</I>
<P>
INSIDE a stark Kent Street building, whose walls are painted a
sterile hospital green, a select team of lawyers, accountants
and analysts congregate to fight organised crime. Enlisted by
the New South Wales Crime Commission, the team's prime task is
the confiscation of assets from suspected drug dealers.
<P>
Confiscation is a relatively new procedure in Australia; and according
to many police is already proving to be a more effective deterrent
than gaol.
<P>
The practice was pioneered in the United States where, in certain
states, the legislation even allows law enforcement bodies to
seize assets from suspected drug dealers automatically prior to
charging, even if there is no conviction. In Volutia county, Florida,
the local sheriffs have even taken to stopping cars at random
and seizing cash from any driver carrying more than $100 (the
assumption being that such a sum could <I>only </I>be acquired
through drug dealing).
<P>
Taking its cue from such American practices, the Kent Street team,
working alongside state police in the Drug Enforcement Agency,
confiscated $6.8 million worth of assets last year, ranging from
grand North coast villas to Harley Davidson motorbikes.
<P>
According to the NSW Crime Commission's senior confiscation lawyer,
Jane [surname withheld], drug traffickers are becoming increasingly
nervous about the risks of detection. Many are now employing a
legion of highly paid tax specialists and lawyers to launder their
money through offshore companies in an effort to elude authorities.
<P>
Jane's investigations have uncovered several unconventional methods
used by traffickers to disguise their assets.&quot;One fellow
never owned a car so he used to go and hire cars everywhere,&quot;
she says. &quot;Another one would order a pizza 80 kilometres
away to be delivered by taxi.&quot;
<P>
The confiscation game is about survival of the smartest. More
significantly, though, it's about money. Drug lords deal to reap
the top dollar. Cops, it can be argued, confiscate assets for
exactly the same reason.
<P>
Of the $6.8 million confiscated last year, nearly every cent was
allocated to the coffers of the NSW police ministry. Calls from
the community to use the money to set up drug rehabilitation and
education programs have repeatedly fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
One veteran detective [name withheld], who is currently working
with the Kent Street confiscation team, defends the allocation
of money by pointing out the present inadequacy of police resources.
<P>
&quot;[The money] should be ploughed back to the police that fight
the criminals. We're always three steps behind them. They have
the best phones, fastest cars, the best everything,&quot; he says.
<P>
In certain American states, funding through asset confiscation
relieves police departments of suffering at the hands of a dwindling
state budget. In Greenville county, South Carolina, a new police
training facility was financed thanks to land seized from a one-time
prosperous dealer. Similarly, assets amounting to $5 million confiscated
in Sulphur, Louisiana, have led to the introduction of immaculately
equipped sports coup&eacute; police cars on the streets of Sulphur.
<P>
The United States Drug Enforcement Agency has absolute confidence
in the all-round efficacy of its asset confiscation program. New
South Wales, in turn, has absolute confidence in the program's
universal adaptability.
<P>
Our faceless veteran detective automatically endorses the sentiment
of America's DEA boss, Robert Bonner, who awaits the day when
&quot;the drug trafficking organisations will wither and die.&quot;
<P>
Never before has waiting proved so lucrative.

<P>
<I>Wearing your oldest tracksuit, hanging out in bars and regularly
buying heroin may not sound like a promising career path. But,
as <A HREF="../journos.htm#mgirdham">MELISSA GIRDHAM</A> and <A HREF="../journos.htm#sharris">SONIA HARRIS</A> report, it's all in a day's
work for undercover cop Garth Hazell.</I>
<P>
GARTH Hazell is an undercover cop. He's been working the streets
of Cabramatta for over a year now. His assignment? <I>Operation
Hammer</I>: a crackdown on Cabramatta's rampant street heroin
trade. In the past year, Hazell has arrested more than 300 dealers
- that's an average of two arrests a day.
<P>
&quot;Undercover work is the best way to catch drug dealers,&quot;
he says. &quot;If an undercover police officer buys [the heroin],
he's got it in his hands and he can give evidence.&quot;
<P>
Hazell's work is confined exclusively to the streets. He cruises
Cabramatta wearing his oldest, grubbiest clothes and says he pretends
to be of low intelligence (&quot;you just mimic the dealers&quot;).
<P>
Wired with a microphone and camera, Hazell approaches dealers
randomly while his fellow officers observe from a distance as
back-up.
<P>
&quot;Police always watch from buildings with binoculars &#133;
and you give them signs when the deal is complete. You then walk
away from the scene and the police come in and make the arrest,&quot;
says Hazell. &quot;Undercover police don't get involved in the
arrest so they don't draw attention to themselves and can buy
again. You have so much rotation of police in Cabramatta so one
face is not there for too long doing undercover work.&quot;
<P>
Street-dealing heroin is the base of the drug pyramid. The 5-T
gang, with its band of loyal supporters, is virtually untouchable
at the top of the heroin hierarchy.
<P>
&quot;The 5-T gang don't really deal much themselves any more,&quot;
says Hazell, &quot;they get all the school kids to do it for them.
They'll give them a couple of caps of heroin or some money to
deal for them.&quot;
<P>
The recent high rate of arrest means young dealers are more switched-on
than ever. According to Hazell, they're prepared to go to any
lengths to protect themselves from being caught.
<P>
&quot;[They] often store drugs in the mouth or in balloons. They've
been known to keep it in the lobes of their ear. There's no place
sacred for them,&quot; he says.
<P>
&quot;If a police officer comes along to search them, they swallow
it and retrieve it after the digestive process has taken place.
It doesn't sound very nice but that's what they do.&quot;
<P>
Despite Constable Hazell's tireless efforts, he says he ultimately
feels rather helpless. This is partly because the nature of the
trade means that, no matter how many dealers the police arrest,
there's always just as many ready to take their place.
<P>
&quot;You only have to walk into one of those stairwells in apartment
blocks and you see some disgusting vomit sights, needles, syringes
and balloons. And you think, 'people raise families here; they
walk out of their door and see such things.'&quot;
<P>
Hazell blames the media which persists in portraying Cabramatta
as a &quot;bulletin board for heroin.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Many addicts say they didn't know Cabramatta existed until
it was publicised in the news,&quot; says Hazell. &quot;Gaols
are filling up but the media keeps publicising Cabramatta as the
drug capital of the world, and you've got people as far as Canberra,
Port Macquarie and Queensland coming down to buy heroin ... The
media just makes our job a lot harder.&quot;
<P>
Hazell will shortly return to uniformed patrol, after more than
a year's service on the streets pretending to be a smack fiend.
<P>
&quot;After a year and a half it gets hectic,&quot; he says. &quot;You
just get sick of it. Sick of drugs, sick of druggies, sick of
the whole lot.

<P>
&quot;THIS'LL show up cocaine, opiates, and THC, that's marijuana,&quot;
explains a helpful salesman holding up a small container that
looks vaguely like the type of safety cup that small children
drink from. &quot;The results are what we call presumtive positive,
which means it just flags a positive result. The employer would
have to get the results verified by a lab before they could take
action,&quot; he continues cheerfully. Two middle aged guys wearing
suits and name tags interrupt the interview, asking questions
about prices and grabbing handfuls of brochures. My inter-viewee
senses a business opportunity and gives them a casual matey sort
of greeting before getting into the details &quot;This is 33 dollars
per unit but it's three tests in one &#133; &quot; I move on.
<P>
It's the 3rd National Alcohol and Other Drugs in the Workplace
Trade Show. From stall to stall in the plush Sydney Hilton ballroom
company reps are keen to show off their equipment - breathalysers,
urine tests, even a hair analysis - that can tell the police,
an insurance company, or increasingly, your employer whether you
have recently been using drugs. This is a growing business in
Australia and the mood is upbeat. One rep told me that although
sales for his do-it-yourself drug tests were still small they
were increasing 'exponentially'.
<P>
Drug testing employees is a phenomena many people associate with
American work culture, but it's been happening in Australia for
at least five years. Although there are no exact figures on the
level of drug testing in Australia, stories are starting to emerge
that show it is becoming part of our employment landscape.
<P>
A Sydney truck driver, says he has tested positive a number of
times. &quot;I smoke a fair bit [of marijuana] and it's in your
system for 28 days. So every time I've been tested it's come up
positive. They tried to sack me a while ago but backed off when
I got myself a solicitor,&quot; he said. Though the tests haven't
yet had any impact on his work prospects or lifestyle he says
he objects to the tests because of the attitude ingrained in the
procedures. &quot;If people realised what marijuana is about they
might have a different attitude to it,&quot; he said.
<P>
A mine worker from Queensland says he has been tested at work
and turned in a positive result for marijuana use. Though he was
not using the drug at work he was suspended for a short time,
but claims after two positive tests workers are offered the option
of attending a rehabilitation course or the sack. &quot;There's
a pretty good program because it's done with the union and all
that. It's fair that you get a couple of chances but you don't
get counselling until you fail,&quot; he said.
<P>
Tony Buon, a psychologist involved in workplace drug and alcohol
counselling, says it is impossible to say how many companies are
drug testing. &quot;I have on my books companies I know are testing
because they've consulted with us to do the education part or
the counselling. There is a least 100 major companies testing
in Australia. There could be ten times that amount for all I know
though,&quot; he said.
<P>
In 1992 the New South Wales Privacy Commission published this
disturbing account of an unnamed woman's experience when taking
part in a random drug test at work. &quot;I was led into a very
small room with a toilet, sink, and a desk. I was given a container
in which to urinate by the attendant. I waited for her to turn
her back before pulling down my pants, but she told me she had
to watch everything I did. I am a 40 year old mother of three
and nothing I have ever done in my life equals or deserves the
humiliation, degradation and mortification I felt,&quot; she said.
<P>
According to the New South Wales Privacy Commission, in 1991 11.5
per cent of Australian companies had some form of drug testing
procedures in place. The report concluded that the practice was
on the increase.These figures are small when compared with America.
Research from the same period showed that in any year over two-thirds
of the American workforce is likely to undergo drug testing.
<P>
Testing in the US gained momentum during the 1980s 'War on Drugs'
when President Reagan signed an executive order requiring all
government employees to be tested. Laws were then passed to ensure
that any company applying for a government tender had random drug
testing programs in place. Reagan even offered to be tested. Though
legend has it, the idea was dropped when a doctor pointed out
to the 70 year old President that he was taking several medications
that would show up in a test.
<P>
If recent events are anything to go by Bill Clinton does not intend
to be outdone by his Republican predecessors. In December last
year he announced that criminals entering the prison system would
face compulsory drug testing to &quot;break the cycle of crime
and drugs&quot;. Announcing the new initiative he noted approvingly,
&quot;All across our country employers have accepted responsibility
to reduce the level of drug use in the workplace. Teachers and
coaches have accepted the responsibility to reduce the level of
drug use in our schools.&quot; American employers now test workers
for traces of illicit drugs as well as high doses of legal substances
like caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine and a ruling in the US Supreme
Court last year made it legal for high schools to randomly test
students involved in sporting events.
<P>
The American Council for Civil Liberties claimed in a recent paper
that drug testing flourished in the US under the deregulated and
largely non-unionised industrial relations environment of the
1980s. This year over 15 million workers in the US will be given
drug tests by their employers. Critics claim the tests most commonly
used by employers are the cheapest and least reliable. Others
claim that tests are being used to screen workers who are pregnant
or who are taking medication for legitimate medical conditions.
But the most common complaint is that drug testing is a major
breach of individual privacy.
<P>
&quot;Testing really took off in Australia following Reagan's
push in the 1980s,&quot; said Tony Buon. &quot;What happened was,
American companies operating in Australia wanted to have the same
policies.&quot; Changes in Australia such as the decline of union
membership and the movement towards individual employment contracts
has provided an environment where such practices can be adopted.
Although according to Tony Buon this hasn't always been so. &quot;I
remember in the past people used to say we'd like to do drug testing
but the unions wouldn't let us,&quot; he said.
<P>
The internet has become an important meeting place for people
who want to protest against drug testing policies and organise
resistance. Usenet newsgroups like &quot;alt.drugs&quot; are flooded
with horror stories posted by Americans telling of tests gone
wrong and the indignity of having to piss in a cup for an employer.
<P>
One post told the story of a woman who tested positive for opiates
after eating two poppy seed muffins. In another, a woman claimed
that her husband had just been sacked for failing a random test.
&quot;He had an outstanding performance record, attendance record,
and was good enough to relieve for his supervisor. But none of
that mattered when they discovered 374 ng of benzylecognine [element
indicating cocaine use]. &quot;The point is, our life is now in
shambles because of a stupid invasion of privacy,&quot; she said.
<P>
The internet is not just a place for sharing stories on the horror
of the workplace drug test. It is also becoming a place where
people seek information on how to beat the tests. The <I>Anti-Bladder
Cops Society</I> is based around a homepage on the World Wide
Web that contains a huge amount of information on the various
tests, how they work, how accurate they are, what drugs they test
for, and most importantly - how they can be beaten. 
<P>
A FAQ (frequently asked questions) archive titled <I>Fooling the
bladder cops</I> lists dozens of approaches to defeating the drug
tests. These include scientific methods like ingesting substances
that neutralise drug traces in the body, tricks like exchanging
samples, and legal avenues like demanding employers sign contracts
making them liable for any misuse of the sample or any errors.
While most of the information appears credible, even ingenious,
a few of the methods described seem a little extreme. For example,
in a section titled &quot;Injecting&quot; the document reads:

<P>
<I>&quot;There's a way to use substitution even when you're under
the strictest supervision. Athletes trying to pass tests for anabolic
steroids have been known to empty their bladders, and have the
substituted urine injected directly into their bladders via needle.
It was shown in a motion picture like &quot;Wildcats&quot; or
something. While theoretically possible, it's painful and subject
to infection. (kids - don't try this at home:).&quot;</I>
<P>
Justin Gombos, an American, who compiled <I>Fooling the bladder
cops</I> claims to have no special expertise except having always
taken an interest in beating the system. He claims that the drug
war in America is being taken to absurd levels by the authorities
and that the testing laws demonstrate &quot;how totalitarian this
country [America] has become&quot;.
<P>
Contacted via e-mail, Gombos made it clear that he believes drug
testing is a threat to individual rights. &quot;I believe drug
testing is a violation of our Constitution; it's very unjust.
Drug testing is a threat to the civil liberties of all employees,&quot;
he said. He feels so strongly about the issue that he claims people
should boycott companies that test. &quot;I would suggest that
job applicants refuse any employer willing to exploit them in
this manner,&quot; he said.
<P>
Frank Ross is another American who uses the internet to voice
his opposition to drug testing. He believes that Australians should
attempt to stamp out testing before it reaches the same proportions
as America. &quot;[Drug testing] has to be challenged in the political
arena and you have to build a popular consensus around it. In
the US, drugs have been portrayed as the source of all evil by
government and corporate propaganda, so that some people appear
to be willing to relinquish their rights for the 'cause', the
War on Drugs,&quot; he said.
<P>
According to Ross if the issue is productivity and occupational
health and safety, as many companies claim, then employees who
are using drugs, either on the job or in their own time, would
be easy to detect without testing procedures. &quot;The War on
Drugs is a moral crusade and the government or a company has no
right to dictate morality. If an (off-the-job) drug user performs
well in his job then why should he be terminated? If drug taking
is indeed such a hazardous and mentally debilitating activity
then surely the manager will detect a marked reduction in performance
on the job?,&quot; he said. 
<P>
So, as Australia rushes towards full enterprise bargaining and
union membership continues to plummet should we be worried about
going down the same path as America? Patrick Cook, who distributes
do-it-yourself drug testing kits for a European pharmaceutical
multinational, was keen to down play comparisons with the US.
&quot;I think it is unlikely Australia will head in the same direction
as America because of the cultural differences between the countries,&quot;
he said. &quot;The emphasis is on occupational safety, and testing
is only being carried out in areas like mining, transport, and
heavy industry where there are clear dangers in having workers
intoxicated, or working at a reduced level in the workplace. I
really think it can only work in Australia with a cooperative
approach.&quot;
<P>
A paper released in 1992 by the Australian Council of Trade Unions
(ACTU) claimed that drug abuse costs the nation $18.9 billion
a year in medical expenses and lost productivity. This figure
is considered a conservative estimate. There are also obvious
benefits to testing employees in high risk areas such as airlines,
and heavy industry where intoxicated workers could endanger their
own lives and the lives of others.
<P>
But according to Cathy Butcher, the ACTU's Occupational Health
and Safety Officer, drug testing is a superficial answer to the
problem of drug abuse, and it has more to do with policing than
examining the causes of the problem. &quot;Far too many employers
are seeing the problem as catching and disciplining individual
workers. For years we've been fighting against the image of the
careless worker, now we are faced with the myth of the drunk or
drugged worker who is the scapegoat for poor safety and low productivity,&quot;
she said.
<P>
&quot;So if drugs and alcohol are seen as a health and safety
issue then you address them in the same way you address other
health and safety issues. It becomes a simplistic approach when
you say that you are dealing with drugs and alcohol by testing
people, without saying 'Is there anything within the workplace
that feeds that, that contributes to a person using drugs?,'&quot;
she said.

One group in our community seems set to reap profound benefits
from being part of tha global computer network we call the Internet.
The disabled. But even here there is hype. <A HREF="../journos.htm#kdyson">KIERAN DYSON</A> reports.</I>
<P>
The Internet is a powerful tool allowing users to inform and educate
themselves, socialise, consume and perform tasks, all on a world
wide scale by simply connecting their home or office computer
to a phone line via a modem.
<P>
For many disabled users these benefits can radically transform
lifestyles. The Internet may come to represent a world where,
for the first time, they can experience sub-stantial interaction
with others with ease and on equal terms.
<P>
An organisation which took early advantage of the Internet is
the Disability Information and Resource Center of South Australia
which is dedicated to improving the lifestyles of disabled people.
As well as providing its existing information service through
its Website, the center established an electronic bulletin board
system, called Common Ground, in 1993.
<P>
The system, which has 1000 registered users, was designed as an
interactive space where people with disabilities and others could
discuss issues affecting their lives.
<P>
System Operator, David Wallace, says Common Ground has become
an instrument of empowerment. &quot;The bulletin board is a great
medium for breaking down barriers that isolate people socially,
whether this be through a physical disability which limits their
mobility, or any other disability affecting their social interaction
in some way. It brings people together in a virtual sense.
<P>
&quot;In that respect, it's opened up complete new worlds for
some people. In fact we have quite a few registered users who
previously had no other means of communication. A lot of them
use it as a communication tool especially, and not just in a social
sense, but also to communicate with relatives who they may not
have been able to communicate with successfully before.&quot;
<P>
Common Ground was also set up to enable users to interact with
organisations and government bodies about relevant issues such
as public transport access and wheelchair standards.
<P>
Like most bulletin boards and newsgroups on the net, Common Ground
has evolved from just being a practical Internet facility to having
a strong community atmosphere. Two marriages have already resulted
from Common Ground meetings and David attributes these to the
nature of the system.
<P>
&quot;People feel they can come to Common Ground as a place in
its own right. There's people there they know and they feel that
they belong rather than just being yet another number on the network.&quot;
<P>
This sense of community plus the Internet's safeguard of anonymity,
is particularly useful for disabled users. Where many people with
disabilities suffer from prejudice and social stigma in the real
world, the virtual world of the Internet becomes a place where
they can express themselves without inhibitions and gain self-confidence,
before they decide to disclose their disability - if at all.
<P>
Melinda Smith is a 33-year-old Melbourne writer and Internet user
who suffers from Cerebral Palsy. She is also a member of Melbourne's
Computer Aid User Society (CAUS) and their representative for
Telstra's consultancy committee for disabilities. &quot;Apart
from that&quot;, she tells me via e-mail, &quot;I run my own business
in disability awareness training for TAFE schools and employment
services.&quot;
<P>
Last year Melinda had the best time of her life when she &quot;took
a wild plunge and went to the USA and Britain and stayed with
a number of people I'd met on my computer.&quot; She had been
e-mailing these people on a regular basis beforehand and had used
the disabled traveller forum, and other general traveller forums
on the Internet, to plan her trip. &quot;I received much more
info and first hand advice than if I had gone to the local travel
agent,&quot; she says.
<P>
In this instance, the Internet served as a social and practical
tool for Melinda who remains excited by the liberating experience
of using the technology to communicate.
<P>
&quot;I was introduced to the Internet in 1993 and my world just
changed from being in the world to being a part of it. It's a
very exciting way for people with disabilities to experience life
without a disability - and just BE. 
<P>
&quot;The best part about it is the freedom to be yourself and
nobody has to know what you look like or whether you speak like
the average person. I make a point of not mentioning my disability
until I feel that she/he has got to know ME first and by then
it's no big deal.&quot;
<P>
As a practical tool in the work place, the Internet can also be
invaluable, especially when it's easier for someone to read and
type words than it is to hear and speak them.
<P>
Stephen Pascoe, aged 41, is Network Manager for the Department
of Defence (Defence Science and Technology Organisation) and has
suffered profound progressive hearing loss since he was 17.
<P>
Stephen accessed the Internet through his work and has been using
e-mail to communicate within the organisation for seven years.
He says the Internet has been indispensable in helping him overcome
communication problems at work and allowing him to stay in touch
with friends, although, he adds, the process can be impersonal.
<P>
Having enjoyed such benefits from the Net, Stephen has run workshops
for other hearing impaired people as a way of introducing them
to the concepts of the Internet and the services available. But
Stephen fears inevitable progressions in computer technology may
isolate users with disabilities yet again.
<P>
&quot;At the moment the Internet is limited by speed, but when
it improves, the ability to use sound and voice (which is already
done to some degree) will be increased. Therefore where deaf people
can now use e-mail and chat programs to communicate with others,
if voice is added, this wonderful liberation is again lost to
them.&quot;
<P>
Another concern for disabled users is that ease of communication
in the virtual world may inadvertently restrict proper communication
in the real world. In a 1994 paper commissioned by Telecom entitled
&quot;People With Disabilities and the Information Superhighway&quot;,
its author, Christopher Newell, questioned the social ramifications
of technological aid.
<P>
&quot;At times, technological intervention is held out to be an
enabler, yet it is also important to realise that another fundamental
issue for people with disabilities is ensuring adequate social
contact, with such a hi-tech scenario raising implications for
human contact.&quot;
<P>
As physical contact in the real world becomes less of a necessity,
contact in the virtual realm poses new psychological complications
for the disabled. Able to revel in the freedom of anonymity when
communicating on the Internet, never-theless they must eventually
confront issues of self identity and self esteem.
<P>
For the first time in history people with disabilities have the
opportunity to participate in a community without fear of being
marginalised or shunned but if the dilemma to tell or not to tell
of one's situation isn't resolved first, on what foundation are
these new relationships built?
<P>
Douglas Lathrop, writing for &quot;Main-stream Online&quot; (a
lifestyle zine for people with disabilities) cuts to the core
of this underlying issue. He writes: &quot;...maybe the Information
Age will see people with disabilities shattering a history of
isolation. But it won't until enough of us have smashed the firewalls
that we've built for ourselves first.&quot;
<P>

<TR><TD WIDTH=500 VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2><FONT SIZE=6><CENTER><B>Are Women losing out in Enterprise Bargaining?
</FONT><BR></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>IN THE year since Snoop last reported on the difficulties
faced by women driving down the road of enterprise bargaining,
the situation has not improved. Indeed, as <A HREF="../journos.htm#pbenson">PAULA BENSON</A> reports,
the potholes may be getting bigger.</I>
<P>
Paul Keating stuck the toe of the Australian workplace into the
murky waters of enterprise bargaining. The new Coalition government
is throwing it into the deep end of deregulation. For female workers
the news is not good. &quot;The evidence from overseas shows that
the more decentralised the bargaining, the worse it is for women,&quot;
says Suzanne Jamieson, spokesperson for the National Pay Equity
Coalition.
<P>
Since enterprise bargaining began, Australian women in many instances
have not been able to participate or achieve better wages and
conditions for a number of reasons. They often work in poorly
unionised workplaces and they suffer from poor representation
within union bureaucracies. Female employees are concentrated
in low paying and low skilled jobs. They do high levels of part-time
and casual work and are more likely to bear the brunt of family
responsibilities.
<P>
Enterprise bargain-ing encourages productivity-based wage increases,
but female employees are concentrated in service industries where
productivity is difficult to measure. &quot;If you're a nurse
for example how do you measure productivity? Count the turnover
in beds? Well one way of doing that is to kill the patients!&quot;
Jamieson exclaims. &quot;It's very different from say a factory
where you can measure input and output.&quot;
<P>
The objective of the new legislation is to focus on the economy.
The government wants to encourage high employment and low inflation,
reduce the deficit and increase productivity; but at what cost
to female workers?
<P>
The Coalition promises that no worker will go home with less money
in their pocket as a result of the changes. However awards will
be stripped back to 18 conditions, leaving everything else up
for grabs, to be bargained for. Rosemary Keogh, Senior Industrial
Officer with the Finance Sector Union says, &quot;There is now
no pressure through the industrial system for employers to conform
to long standing conditions, and women are going to cop most of
the downgrading&quot;.
<P>
The new individual contracts, to be known as Australian Work-place
Agreements [AWAs], will completely over-ride awards. Though according
to Keogh these awards will wither away over time anyhow. Accord-ing
to Barbara Pocock, a lecturer at the Centre for Labour Studies
at the University of Adelaide, &quot;people who remain on awards
will fall behind the community standard of pay, and women will
be disproportionately left on decaying award standards&quot;.
<P>
The Coalition says workers can choose between the award and an
AWA. But what a choice! Employees may &quot;choose&quot; to make
agreements but if they choose not to they will remain on the minimum
award and lose significant award conditions. Effectively they
have no choice but to sign the agreement.
<P>
AWA's can be negotiated collectively or individually, but are
signed individually. Once the AWA is signed by the employer and
employee, a new institution, the Office of Employment Advocate
(OEA) will stamp the agreement. Although incredibly the OEA has
no mandate to examine its provisions.
<P>
&quot;The Minister [for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith] says
that the agreement cannot be lower than the award but would the
average worker know if it was lower than the award?&quot; Jamieson
asks. &quot;To think that the average ordinary individual with
no industrial relations background would have the information
they need to negotiate an equitable agreement is absurd!&quot;
agrees Keogh. &quot;We are very concerned that people will just
be signing anything to hang on to their jobs,&quot; Jamieson adds.
<P>
The only protection provisions are that AWAs must meet the government's
no disadvantage test. What is the no dis-advantage test? The employer
signs an affidavit to say that the agreement meets the minimum
provisions. In effect this means employers are keeping an eye
on themselves; which sets off alarm bells for Jamieson and Keogh.
&quot;It's a simple system of filing the agreement with the Employment
Advocate. It's a clerical process. It is not scrutinised or monitored
in any way!&quot; protests Jamieson.
<P>
The OEA will not make agreements public, which means a whole range
of pay and conditions will no longer be publicly scrutinised.
&quot;Secrecy is the great enemy of equity. It is possible that
different pay rates will exist for different workers and that
discrimination will be hard to track down and eliminate,&quot;
says Pocock. &quot;Not having the capacity to do an across the
board look at wages based on different skills means we lose the
opportunity to overturn undervaluations of women's work,&quot;
she adds.
<P>
Opponents of the legislation dismiss the Office of Employment
Advocate as impotent. &quot;The OEA does not enforce entitlements,
it just informs you of what they are. If you have a complaint
you will have to pursue it through the courts using a private
solicitor. The legal fraternity must be thrilled,&quot; says Keogh.
<P>
The Coalition has tried to pacify critics by affirming its commitment
to equal pay for work of equal value, but to no avail. &quot;We
have had equal pay for equal work since 1969 and in fact in NSW
since 1958 so that's not exactly a huge concession,&quot; scoffs
Jamieson. &quot;Anyway in terms of giving women protection it
doesn't at all. This is not where the problem lies. It lies largely
in over award payments. Women earn on average a lot less than
men in terms of over award earnings. There is a huge disparity
in take-home pay and now this won't be inquired into by the Industrial
Relations Commission (IRC),&quot; she says.
<P>
The IRC will only have the power to arbitrate over core award
conditions. Therefore the Commission will not be able to look
at gender discrimination in over award bargaining, yet currently
women receive only 54 per cent of male over award earnings. &quot;When
we met with the Minister, he said women would be able to pursue
complaints through the Sex Discrimination Act at the Human Rights
and Equal Opportunity Commission,&quot; says Jamieson. &quot;This
is clearly inadequate. The queue at the commission is long and
the whole process is cumbersome, expensive, not user friendly
and women haven't noticeably used it in the past,&quot; she adds.
<P>
Women's average weekly ordinary time earnings are now only around
84 per cent of the male wage [according to the ABS]. Jamieson
says that in total wages that figure is much lower, at around
66 per cent. Pocock fears that this gap will widen. &quot;It has
already hap-pened in the managed system of enterprise bargaining
under Labor and it's particularly visible in Kennet's Victoria,&quot;
she says.
<P>
Pocock is extremely concerned about the diminished power of the
IRC. &quot;The IRC has had a significant brief over the past 100
years, for equity in wage fixing. Everyone has the right to a
decent living wage and equity in remuneration. The Commission
can no longer arbitrate in situations of inequity. It can't play
a role to keep the system clean,&quot; she says.
<P>
The new legislation also places constraints on unions entering
the workplace. From now on, union officials will only be able
to enter a workplace if they have a written invitation from one
or more members. The official must also be dealing with the matter
specified in the invitation, making it impossible to go into workplaces
to find out what problems exist.
<P>
&quot;While imperfect vehicles, they [unions] are the only method
of protection for a lot of women, and its going to be tougher
to organise that support for yourself. Women are often in small
workplaces and are frightened of involving the union, and with
this bill the employer gets the names of the employees who asked
for a union visit. Women will not want to expose themselves as
asking for help from the union,&quot; says Pocock.
<P>
Vulnerable workers such as women, especially women from non-English
speaking backgrounds, will not thrive under the new legislation.
&quot;A minority will do well out of the deregulated system but
unfortunately because of the segmentation of the labour market
women will come out quite badly,&quot; says Keogh. &quot;I don't
like the chances of a lot of people out there.&quot; 
<P>
In 1994 <I>Snoop </I>reported the story of the female clerical
workers at the Villawood (NSW) branch of Taubmans, the well-known
paint manufacturer. Like many other clerical staff, they were
excluded from the site enterprise agreement in 1992, despite petitions
to the Industrial Relations Commission by the Federated Clerks
Union on their behalf.
<P>
Taubmans and the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (LHMU)
maintained that the agreement applied only to the manufacture
and distribution of paint, and dismissed claims that increased
productivity would increase administration. <I>Snoop </I>noted
that at another Taubmans factory in Sunshine, Victoria, the clerks
negotiated their own agreement which included a $30 per week wage
rise.
<P>
The story continues. The clerks in Victoria negotiated their own
agreement because the LHMU failed to include them in their claim,
and because management refused to negotiate with their representatives,
the Australian Services Union. Taubmans entered into an agreement
with the LHMU, and asked the clerical workers to sign contracts
which included no rostered days-off, no overtime pay and an annual
review of wages. The company didn't offer payrises to compensate
for the loss of the entitlements.
<P>
The clerks took industrial action to force management to negotiate,
and they eventually gained a higher pay-rise than the LHMU members.
However, it was not to be a happy ending. <I>Inside Enterprise
Bargaining</I>, a newsletter which includes case studies on enterprise
agreements, reports that Taubmans later retrenched the workers,
centralising it's clerical work in Sydney.

<P><A HREF="../journos.htm#lyoung">By Lynda Young</A></CENTER>
<P>
THURSDAY is Domestic Violence day at Waverley Courthouse and Michelle
Karaman is one of 23 women seeking an Apprehended Violence Order
on their husband or boyfriend. She is pretty, petite and used
to be proud of her long black hair which is now greying and matted.
She angrily pulls at it with both hands and protests sarcastically
to anyone who'll listen, &quot;He's taken away my life, you'd
think he'd spare the hair.&quot;
<P>
The small room they wait in has been set aside by the Domestic
Violence Assistance Scheme, a joint initiative of community workers
and solicitors involved in providing emotional and legal support
to survivors of domestic violence.
<P>
The provision of the room protects victims from the anxiety of
mingling with their alleged abusers. But Michelle is still worried
at the thought of seeing her husband who waits just outside the
door.
<P>
&quot;He's out there,&quot; she says with clenched teeth to her
daughter Debra. &quot;That bastard. After all he's put me through,
can you believe he denies everything?&quot;
<P>
Michelle's marriage to Fedai was hasty. They met when she was
just 16, 12 years ago in Turkey, and married within six weeks.
Michelle thought she was marrying a prince. He was charming and
handsome, but on the night of their wedding he beat her with a
chair because the stockings she borrowed from his mother kept
falling down during the ceremony.
<P>
Two months into the marriage Michelle was pregnant and Fedai,
who was 10 years her senior, moved them to Australia, away from
her family and friends, to take up a job offer. Within the first
week of their arrival Fedai left without explanation.
<P>
&quot;I was totally alone. My family didn't support the marriage
in the first place and were glad to be rid of me. I had no money
and barely spoke the language.&quot;
<P>
For a year she struggled to make ends meet cleaning houses and
waitressing. After the birth of her daughter Debra in 1985 she
heard from Fedai.
<P>
&quot;He begged me to take him back saying that he loved me. So
I did. I had nothing and I thought awful was better than nothing.&quot;
<P>
Five years and two more babies later Michelle was completely dependent
on Fedai. He had isolated her from any friends she made, forbid
her to work and beat her almost daily.
<P>
&quot;I didn't want to go anywhere or meet anyone because I was
ashamed. I always had bruises on my face and had completely lost
my identity.&quot;
<P>
For the next four years the violence became more intense. Michelle
would no longer react to pain or plead Fedai to stop. Her indifference
enraged him, so he added tools to the ritual beatings.
<P>
&quot;He poured hot oil from a pan on the stove over my head,
broke all my fingers on my hands with the end of an empty bottle
of scotch, and two years ago hit me with the car one morning when
I was walking down the driveway.&quot;
<P>
Michelle never told anyone about the beatings or went to hospital,
but secretly planned the day she would leave.
<P>
Michelle's case is just one of thousands. The New South Wales
Bureau of Crimes Statistics and Research (BCSR) recorded nearly
4000 cases in New South Wales of domestic violence in 1994, resulting
in only 16 convictions - an overall success rate of 0.04 per cent.
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation believes that in the United
States domestic violence is the most unreported crime, and estimates
that it is ten times more unreported than rape.
<P>
Similar results were found by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
in April 1990, when survey figures reflected an estimate of 19
000 victims of domestic violence in a 12 month period, yet only
2200 were reported to police.
<P>
Maria Vucko, Coordinator of the Waverley Domestic Violence Court
Assistance Scheme, fears that the number of unreported incidences
will increase due to inadequate legislation, women not understanding
their rights, and lack of police education.
<P>
&quot;I've talked ad nauseam to police officers about the importance
of encouraging women to file criminal complaints so that we can
get some of the offenders a criminal history and put them away.
But when some of the people on the force are involved in domestic
violence cases of their own, my words fall on deaf ears.&quot;
<P>
Steve Heath, clerk of Waverley Court, agrees with Ms Vucko, and
believes there is much work to be done and that education is the
solution.
<P>
&quot;The police, historically, have not been compassionate with
women who call for assistance. They look at that kind of call
as more of an irritant and do not take it as seriously as, say,
a call involving a weapon. That's where the ignorance lies.&quot;
<P>
Mr Heath believes the legislation dealing with domestic violence
does not protect the victim. &quot;The legislation can exist without
the officers even knowing about it because of the constant amendments
to the Crime Act. That in itself is a huge gap of communication.
If the officers are not informed how can they pass on good counsel?&quot;
<P>
In response to the calls for more community education, a program
was launched in early 1996, promoting the involvement of police
in dealing with domestic violence.
<P>
Statistics from the BCSR show that 70 per cent of New South Wales
police work involves domestic violence. The Department for Women
has initiated training for service providers and professionals
working with survivors of domestic violence.
<P>
However, despite these government efforts, horror stories like
Michelle's are heard daily by counsellor Carol Maderious, from
the Botany Family and Child Care Centre, who assists on the monthly
rotation roster at the Scheme.
<P>
&quot;At least eight to ten victims pour into the Centre weekly
and they all have the same thought - that they can change their
man.&quot;
<P>
According to Ms Maderious, women involved in domestic violence
situations take on a martyr role, and accept their lifestyle as
normal because the man believes it to be true.
<P>
&quot;Most of the women have severely low self esteem and suffer
from chronic depression which is why it's a miracle if they break
the cycle and take the first step to admit the problem, get out
and get help. The recurring theme is that they all believe or
hope that the men are going to somehow get better if they can
act a certain way or fix their favourite foods.
<P>
&quot;But the reality is these men are mentally ill in some form
or another, or are repeating the vicious circle that was displayed
to them in their homes as children. I'm not saying this to excuse
the behaviour, but to emphasise my belief that these men cannot
be rehabilitated.&quot;
<P>
The relevant section of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 states
that a person may apply for an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO)
if someone intentionally:
<P>
<I> &#133; injures or threatens to injure, damages or threatens
to damage property, uses words or actions to intimidate or harass,
follows repeatedly, telephones repeatedly at home or work, behaves
indecently without consent, and/or gets someone else to injure,
harass or threaten.</I>
<P>
The law deals with domestic violence in two ways: criminal charges
of assault and/or an AVO. Criminal charges and an application
for an AVO can and should occur together, according to Bruce Mexon,
Senior Constable and Victim's Support Coordinator for the Waverley
Police.
<P>
 &quot;To get a conviction on a criminal charge related to domestic
violence is very difficult.&quot; This is shown by the statistically
low conviction rate in New South Wales in 1994. &quot;The fact
is we need documentation of all incidences which occurred, credible
witnesses for the prosecution and, unfortunately, it makes a dramatic
difference if the victim has obvious injuries, pictures or medical
reports ... when they come to court.&quot;
<P>
Judge Terry Forbes of Waverley Court agrees with Senior Constable
Mexon, and says that in most criminal cases, rulings will be made
according to the level of documented abuse. &quot;Mental abuse
weighs just as heavily as physical abuse, however, it's harder
to prove. Most cases heard are years in the making. With no physical
evidence, it comes down to the plaintiff's word against the defendant's.&quot;
<P>
This is where the legislation begins to fail. Hard evidence is
difficult to come by in most cases of domestic abuse, as women
rarely come forward and lodge a complaint against their husbands.
The woman feels trapped and usually cuts off support systems such
as her friends and family due to her feelings of self-blame.
<P>
Low income also plays a key role but is not always the norm. Ms
Vucko refers to a 'high profile' case she is currently working
on where the alleged victim, the wife of a prominent barrister
in New South Wales, has many wealthy friends and caring family
members. In cases such as this, the situation can be complicated
by status and reputation.
<P>
&quot;I use the example,&quot; she states, &quot;to simply prove
any socio-economic group is not exempt and the pattern of abuse
and control is the same regardless.&quot;
<P>
After the woman has applied for the AVO a magistrate issues a
summons for the appearance of the defendant at court or a warrant
for their arrest, depending on the severity of the complaint.
The person in need of protection need only satisfy the court 'on
the balance of probabilities' that fear exists. The magistrate
will then set an interim order or bail conditions placing restrictions
on the offender until the hearing. An interim order holds the
same weight as an AVO, but expires on the date of the hearing.
<P>
According to Domestic Violence Officer at the NSW Police Department,
Julie Stewart, the problem that results is that few criminal precedents
are set because women are encouraged to be satisfied with the
rulings from an AVO.
<P>
&quot;Most applications for AVOs result in an interim (order)
because criminal pursuits are not historically regarded as successful,&quot;
she says. &quot;Of the 4000 complaints filed in 1994, more than
80 per cent were settled with an interim. If we had that extra
80 per cent to draw on yearly, new precedents would surely be
set and women would feel more confident that the system was working
for them and not against.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Many times the men ignore the orders and the temptation
to repeat the offence becomes more important than a slip of paper,&quot;
says Ms Stewart.
<P>
Men who are not gaoled and receive a final order following an
interim order are usually given guidelines to follow for a period
of up to six months. These guidelines include distance restrictions,
no phone contact with the plaintiff, and no contact with friends
or family of the woman who has complained.
<P>
According to Carol Maderious, the women live in a state of fear
because the order relies on the perpetrator's self-control. In
many cases the final order is broken resulting in a more severe
injury or even occasionally murder.
<P>
&quot;This is simply not enough,&quot; says Carolyn Middleton,
assistant clerk of the Waverley Courthouse. &quot;I see the same
women in here over and over again, terrified because they got
a call or a letter or even saw their perpetrator. The system is
backlogged with repeat applications because we're trusting good
behaviour from criminals.&quot;
<P>
The law states that a defendant who breaches the final order can
be subject to a term of imprisonment, however, repeat offences
still happen.
<P>
Michelle is back at the Scheme room from her hearing; her hands
shake as she reads the interim order. &quot;This is what it comes
down to after 12 years and the mess he's made out of my life.&quot;
<P>
Her tone increases with each syllable. &quot;I had to take off
work, wait here four hours and that judge thinks this will keep
him out of my house?&quot;
<P>
Carol Maderious sits down next to her and tries to explain how
the system works. After five impatient minutes Michelle can take
no more. &quot;The system doesn't work for me, it works for him.
He can still do whatever he wants at the end of the day, can't
he? And at the end of the day I'm still afraid.&quot;
<P>
According to Waverley Court Clerk, Steve Heath, Fedai refused
to admit to any of Michelle's allegations but consented to the
Apprehended Violence Order.
<P>
&quot;He is promising the court that he won't assault, harass
or approach the plaintiff or the residence of the plaintiff for
two years,&quot; he said.
<P>
It will be Michelle's decision to renew the order if she wishes
to extend the period of court protection.

Picking up the pieces
<P>
Cecilia Wheeler lived with her husband in Randwick for 25 years
until recently when Ronald Wheeler was sentenced by Magistrate
Terry Forbes at Waverley Courthouse.
<P>
Three days before the sentencing Ronald went into one of his unprovoked
rages and beat Cecilia repeatedly with a hard plastic water pipe.
She has just turned 49 but looks closer to 60. Her face is black
and blue, but she is smiling as Ronald has lost his right to contact
Cecilia and their two children, Evelyn and Mark, indefinitely.
<P>
Mr Wheeler sat weeping in the witness stand while the sentence
was read to him, slowly, as Magistrate Forbes wanted him to hear
every word.
<P>
&quot;The pain you have caused Mrs Wheeler and your children is
written all over her face today. The pain you are feeling for
losing your family forever is because of what you have done. Don't
feel sorry for yourself, Mr Wheeler, feel sorry for your family.&quot;
<P>
Ronald Wheeler was given the maximum sentence. He may never contact
his family, and if he breaches the order he will be immediately
taken to jail for five years.
<P>
After the order, Cecilia received supportive calls from friends
and community workers. &quot;I hope he breaches that order,&quot;
Cecilia says angrily. &quot;Then I'll know where he is all the
time.&quot;
<P>
Cecilia stayed in the abusive situation because she felt she had
no other alternative. &quot;What else could I do. He had control
of the money and of my life.&quot;
<P>
The beatings Cecilia experienced were always unprovoked and started
two weeks after their marriage. Verbal jabs were coupled with
the violence, &quot;he would wind up and hit me in the breast
and say now no one will ever want you because you're deformed.&quot;
<P>
After many years Cecilia stopped crying and like Mark just withdrew.
&quot;I feel like I got hit by a double-decker bus everyday for
the past 25 years and now I just want some peace and quiet.&quot;

</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<I>
The Federal government tells us that privatising a third of Telstra
is vital, allowing seven billion dollars in Government debt to
be repaid, and improving the efficiency of the telecommunications
industry. But what real benefits will flow to Australia, and will
they outweigh the loss of a third of Telstra to private ownership?
<A HREF="../journos.htm#lrobertson">LOUISE ROBERTSON</A> looks beyond political rhetoric and takes a hard
look at the figures.</I>
<P>
THERE has been no clear demonstration by the Howard Federal government
that the financial benefits of partial privatisation will outweigh
the costs. Professor Bob Walker of the University of New South
Wales (UNSW), writing in the Journal of Australian Political Economy,
argues that this is not unusual. &quot;The fact is that most (if
not all) privatisation decisions have been undertaken in Australia
without any detailed disclosure of the economic rationale for
the sale,&quot; he says.
<P>
&quot;The Government has stated that by retiring $7 billion of
debt, it will reduce its annual interest bill. The benefit is
that the money that would otherwise have gone in interest payments
could then be used to fund other programs or to retire more debt.
Another benefit is that retiring foreign debt also reduces the
public sector borrowing requirement which pushes interest rates
down, leading to benefits for private borrowers, particularly
those in business.
<P>
In order to determine whether the partial sale is financially
worthwhile, we need to weigh these benefits against what the Government
will forgo through losing a third of its equity in Telstra.
<P>
Telstra is an important income source for the Commonwealth Government.
From assets of $24 billion in 1994/95, it generated $14 billion
in revenue and made an after tax profit of $1.7 billion. Telstra
is currently committed to paying the Government a dividend of
55 per cent of its annual operating profit. During 1994/95, the
Telstra dividend was worth $944 million, which when added to interest
and taxes paid by Telstra, provided a total payment to Government
of $2.4 billion. This represents nearly two per cent of the Commonwealth
Government budget.
<P>
On a crude estimation that selling off a third of Telstra will
reduce the Government's dividend by a third, the Government may
stand to lose about $315 million a year. With the current interest
rate on Government bonds at about eight per cent, the interest
saving on debt of $7 billion is $560 million a year. From this
simple equation it looks as though the Government may gain more
than it will lose through the sale.
<P>
However, Professor Walker suggests that this may be just what
the Government wants us to think. He argues that Telstra's capital
structure reduces its appearance of profitability, and that to
get a true picture of the revenue the Government receives from
Telstra, we need to look at the full cash flow from Telstra to
the Government. This means looking not only at dividends, but
interest paid on Government loans, tax payments, and other fees
and charges.
<P>
A third of Telstra's total payment to Government in 1994/95 ($2.4
billion) is $800 million, which appears much higher than $560
million the annual interest savings on debt of $7 billion.
<P>
But, of course, the Government doesn't stand to lose all of the
$800 million because a privatised Telstra will, for example, still
pay taxes (although Professor Walker points out that private sector
firms can be expected to undertake tax-minimisation strategies).
The problem is, we don't really know how partial privatisation
will affect the cash flow between the Government and Telstra.
<P>
Regardless of the debt repayment arguments, the Government also
needs to clearly demonstrate that the sale price it has set for
a third of Telstra is an accurate reflection of its worth. Is
$8 billion enough? Further, will the Government achieve this sale
price in the current financial climate?
<P>
BZW, the investment banking division of Barclays Bank, recently
indicated that the Government could do better than $8 billion
for a third of Telstra. In its report, <I>Regarding Telstra</I>,
BZW estimates the net value of Telstra at $27.9 billion, a third
of which is approximately $9 billion. Similarly, stockbrokers
J B Were &amp; Son recently put Telstra's net value higher at
between $28.5 to $42 billion, and estimated $8 to 10 billion was
a conservative price for a third of the corporation.
<P>
That the Government has chosen a conservative price of $8 billion
probably reflects its expectations about the market's ability
to absorb a share issue of this size. $8 billion dollars represents
about two per cent of the combined value of listed companies on
the Australian Stock Exchange (called market capitalisation).
According to the ASX, a good indicator of the market's ability
to absorb the Telstra issue is to consider that new capital raisings
over the past ten years have averaged about six per cent of market
capitalisation. This suggests that the ASX, with a current capitalisation
of $350 billion, should be able to support new issue of up to
$20 billion a year. However, the ASX adds that other factors need
to be taken into account including the state of the economy, how
fast the shares need to be sold, and whether shareholders perceive
the share price to be good value. It comments that there is a
tendency for large Government floats to be slightly undervalued
because a big issue can only be sold in one hit if investors perceive
the shares to be a good buy (ie undervalued).
<P>
Undervaluing may also reflect the Government's political interest
in having the issue fully sold.
<P>
Other factors that need to be considered are constraints on purchasers
and the other share issues on offer at the same time. A significant
constraint on purchasers is the Government's commitment that foreign
ownership of Telstra will be restricted to 35 per cent of the
issue. This means that 65 per cent must be absorbed domestically,
which may be difficult in the light of the sale of the final tranch
of the Commonwealth Bank, and the privatisation of Deutsche Telecom
and France Telecom, both of which are expected to be offered for
the first time in 1997.
<P>
The bottom line is that if the market cannot absorb the issue,
then the Government is likely to have to offer Telstra shares
at a discounted price. If the transaction costs of multi-tranch
issues were added, the net proceeds to Government of the partial
sale could be much less than eight billion dollars.
<P>
<B>Will Telstra be more efficient?</B>
<P>
Before considering the efficiency gains that privatisation may
achieve, we first need to consider how efficient Telstra is at
the moment. In a 1995 report, the Bureau of Industry Economics
found Telstra's performance to be reasonable by international
standards, noting that many improvements had been made in recent
years as a result of improvements in technology and the introduction
of competition.
<P>
However, Telstra failed to reach international best practice in
a number of areas and needed to make substantial improvements
to match its competitors. Telstra's labour productivity in particular,
measured in terms of revenue per employee and lines per employee,
was found to be well below international best practice. There
was also scope to reduce prices (particularly for services in
which Telstra does not face competition from Optus), improve the
reliability of the network (particularly for rural and residential
customers) and to improve the time taken to repair faults. Progress
in digitising the network (which will increase the speed and reliability
of data transmission) was considered slow.
<P>
So how will privatisation bring about these improvements? The
economic argument is that privatisation exposes a company to the
discipline of the market. The share price mechanism provides clear
signals about a company's performance, making management more
accountable for its actions and forcing it to become more streamlined
and efficient, often by reducing employees. This is assisted by
the more stringent reporting requirements for companies listed
on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the injection of a private
sector ethos through new board members.
<P>
However, Professor Bob Walker of UNSW is sceptical whether privatisation
will actually cause an increase in efficiency. &quot;One of the
most comprehensive international studies of privatisation found
that only 55 per cent of privatised firms showed an improvement
in operating performance, and that overall the mean change was
only a 0.16 per cent improvement in the reported rate of return
on equity,&quot; he writes. Even attributing these small gains
to privatisation is contentious as it assumes that any efficiency
gains could not have been secured if organisations remained in
public ownership.
<P>
Indeed, Sue Ferguson of the Communications Law Centre does not
believe that efficiency gains are the sole province of a private
sector firm. &quot;I don't see any reason why a far leaner operation
couldn't be put in place under Government ownership. As a corportatised
entity, there's no reason why you can't apply private sector practices
if thats what you're aiming for. And then you retain all the dividends
in the Government purse,&quot; she argues.
<P>
Ferguson says that the CLC has seen nothing persuasive about the
arguments for privatisation so far, and believes competition in
the telecommunications market has greater potential to bring about
efficiency gains than privatisation. &quot;Privatisation is just
a short term easy way to get a lot of money to solve short term
problems,&quot; she says.
<P>
The CLC and other consumer groups argue that the debate on privatisation
should be delayed until competitive market reforms have been implemented
and competition has become firmly established. There are serious
concerns that if privatisation occurs too early in the competitive
process, there will be less pressure on Telstra to improve its
efficiency, and those gains that it does make will be returned
to shareholders rather than consumers.
<P>
Competition was first introduced into the Australian telecommunications
market in 1991 when the Government selected Optus Communications
as Australia's second telecommunications carrier. Optus currently
provides long distance and international calls by satellite and
mobile telephone services, and has recently offered local calls
for the first time via its Pay TV network.
<P>
Competition from these carriers has already lead to price reductions.
The BIE found that between 1990 and 1994, the price of a basket
of national business services in Australia fell by 8.9 per cent,
and the price of a peak rate international call fell by 28.4 per
cent (although both these price falls were below the OECD average).
Mobile phone charges fell by 26.3 per cent over the period. 
<P>
There is greater potential for increased competition from mid-1997,
when the telecommunications market will be opened to full competition.
Telstra will be under pressure to improve its performance or lose
market share.
<P>
The Consumers Telecommunications Network (CTN), which represents
residential consumers, argues that with all these competitive
changes occurring, the debate on privatisation should be delayed
until at least the year 2000. Only then will the Government be
able to assess the benefits that competition has brought against
additional benefits of privatisation. Privatising Telstra now
confuses two quite separate processes.
<P>
Gerard Goggin of the CTN explains &quot;There's a real danger
that if you privatise too early in the competition process that
Telstra will just be placed in a position to make these wind fall
profits and there's not enough competition around to give them
a hard time and return the so called efficiencies that you want.
<P>
&quot;What could actually happen is that the benefits of that
telecommunications reform in terms of large profit are just being
captured going to shareholders, rather than going to the economy
in terms of cheaper prices and better quality of service across
the board,&quot; he adds.
<P>
Goggin also raises concerns about the type of efficiency gains
that a privatised Telstra might pursue. He suspects that quality
of service improvements and price reductions would be likely to
be directed at the high traffic business services in which competition
is the strongest, while low traffic services to rural and remote
areas would be neglected. While this might be in the best interest
of Telstra's private shareholders, Goggin questions whether we
should accept a market defined by the concept of efficiency which
places no importance on equity in services.
<P>
However, the Australian Telecommunications Users Group (ATUG),
which represents business users, has a different perspective.
Managing Director, Allan Horsley, while emphasising that ATUG
is not a proponent of privatisation, believes the introduction
of a private sector ethos into the management of Telstra and greater
accountability to shareholders will bring benefits.
<P>
Horsley has been less than impressed with some of Telstra's investment
decisions in recent years. He is concerned that Telstra was able
to commit considerable funding to its Pay TV joint venture with
The News Corporation (Foxtel) without justifying this investment
to the Government, let alone the public. In his view, funding
committed to Foxtel could have been put to better use in upgrading
the telephony infrastructure, in particular by bringing forward
the completion date for digitising the network (called Future
Mode of Operation) and by extending the digital link to premises
(called ISDN).
<P>
He is incensed that Telstra has poured billions of dollars into
Pay TV, yet neglected to set aside sufficient funds for ISDN.
While the FMO will enhance the speed of data transmission between
exchanges, premises without ISDN lose valuable speed in data transmission
because they have to convert the signal from digital back to analogue.
He likens it to an artificial bottle-neck that has major implications
for business operators. &quot;Telstra haven't gone out with a
prospectus into the market place saying we're going to spend $5
billion on Pay TV, here's the business plan, here's the investment
criteria, so come and invest some money. No bloody fear. Those
poor suckers out there, our eight million customers, we'll just
take the profits off them and plough it into pay television with
no return, and the worst thing is that the investment into the
development of the core telephone business has been delayed so
that the revenue that is being earned from the telephone business
is not being reinvested but is being hived off over here,&quot;
he says.
<P>
&quot;We've spent $4 billion on the FMO project. Absolutely tremendous
investment to make &#133; the switching and transmission components
of the network digital. A little bit better performance for voice,
but enormous improvement in speed and reliability of transfer
of data. But what they've forgotten about is that we need about
$1 billion over three years to take the capability from the exchange
to your premises (about the 15 to 20 per cent who need it). (Telstra)
Didn't bother to budget the funds.&quot;
<P>
Horsely believes that improved accountability of Telstra's management
will be an important check on this type of decision. He describes
a seemingly ironic situation in which a Government owned Telstra
has largely operated in secrecy, while the privatisation legislation
for Telstra envisages more open decision making with clearer reporting
requirements to Government.
<P>
&quot;We see that the reporting relationship between Telstra and
its (majority) shareholder the Government will be a more formal
and clear relationship than it is at the present time.... You
imagine the Board of BHP going to an annual meeting of shareholders
and saying well I'm not going to tell you anything, you're only
the shareholders. It just wouldn't happen,&quot; he says.
<P>
He emphasises that ATUG does not want the Government to become
involved in the day to day decision making of Telstra. &quot;&#133;
the last thing we want is Ministerial intervention in the operations
of Telstra &#133; The Government should set the focus, the framework,
the objectives, and they (Telstra) get on and do the business.&quot;
<P>
One area where the chance has been missed for a vast improvement
in efficiency is the double roll-out of broadband cable networks
by both Telstra and Optus in capital cities and regional centres.
While they are duplicating each other's services in densely populated
areas, neither appears to have any intention to spread their networks
to the less economical rural and remote areas, which will be stuck
with basic 1950's telephone services.
<P>
The combined cost of the networks is nearly $7 billion. If only
one network had been installed, the excess funds could have been
used to extend the network to other less economical areas, or
for future network upgrades as technology improves. Some environmental
benefits may also have arisen as the cable could perhaps have
been confined to underground. As it is, Optus's network is largely
above ground, suspended from electricity poles, while Telstra's
is largely below ground.&quot; Privatisation will be no help here.

<P>
<I>
With the 65th birthday of Australia's oldest theatre company to
be celebrated next year, <A HREF="../journos.htm#fnoakes"> Frank Noakes </A>reminisces about Newtown's
New Theatre - from its days of communist party affiliations to
its role in censorship struggles, police raids and illegal performances.</I>
<P>
BORN AS the Sydney Workers' Art Club on August 6, 1932, the New
Theatre aimed to provide culture for the working class, from plays
and lectures to music recitals and exhibitions.
<P>
The first play for the amateur company was<I>The Ragged Trousered
Philanthropists </I>in April 1933, the first of more than 400
productions to introduce thousands of people to both sides of
the footlights.
<P>
Following the emergence of the USA's New Theatre movement in the
late 1920s to counter the poverty and hardship of the Great Depression,
Sydney's New Theatre often found itself at the forefront of battles
for free speech and democracy.
<P>
Its earliest productions were rough and ready and flavoured with
activist propaganda. Short plays were often staged outside factories,
alongside dole queues and at Labor Party and Communist Party meetings.
<P>
State governments soon acted to suppress such performances.In
1936 NSW police stormed the stage to stop a performance of Clifford
Odets' anti-fascist play, <I>Till the Day I Die</I>.
<P>
Then in 1968, the theatre faced a new censorship struggle over
Jean Claude Van Itallie's play <I>America Hurrah</I>, a satirical
look at US society. After complaints about the final act in which
huge wooden dolls scrawl obscenities on a wall, the Askin Coalition
government banned the show.
<P>
Defiantly, the company organised an illegal performance in the
Teacher's Federation's Sussex Street auditorium. No advertising
was necessary; hundreds had to be turned away. According to Marie
Armstrong, one of the &quot;dolls&quot; and current vice-president
of the New Theatre, &quot;The air was electric with expectation&quot;.
<P>
Police again moved in but this time escape routes were organised
for the three &quot;dolls&quot; by burly building workers and
wharfies &quot;accidentally&quot; obstructing entry. This allowed
enough time for the actors to shed their costumes and mingle nonchalantly
with the rest of the cast. Nobody was arrested although the police
confiscated the offending set as evidence.
<P>
One of the New Theatre's most memorable moments was its 1952 performance
for underground miners of <I>The Candy Store</I> , a story of
a strike in a US department store.
<P>
Shale miners from Glen Davis, north of Lithgow, began the first
sit-in strike in a NSW colliery and the Miners Federation invited
the New Theatre to perform.
<P>
Smuggled into the mine, the actors improvised a stage with a hessian
curtain at the junction of five shafts with small, inadequate
lamps set on a rickety table. Then, as the actors stepped on stage
in the murky half-light, the miners switched on their hard-hat
lights and bathed the stage in a dusty glow.
<P>
&quot;That's a hard one to beat,&quot; said Armstrong, who also
performed that day.
<P>
Later that year the theatre performed <I>Stay Down Miner</I> by
Len Fox to another audience of striking miners inside the Hunter
Valley's Great Greta coalmine.
<P>
Throughout this period the theatre maintained a close relationship
with the trade union movement, the decline of which is regretted
by Armstrong.
<P>
The New Theatre grew to prominence by staging productions too
hot for professional theatre to touch. It was the first Australian
theatre to perform Arthur Miller's <I>The Crucible</I> in the
1960s but today, because of costs, it is harder for the New Theatre
to obtain first rights to socially relevant plays.
<P>
With 300 volunteer members, the New Theatre still adheres broadly
to humanist values and tries to do plays a little left of centre.
<P>
&quot;If something has a radical left-wing bias and it is well
written we'll want to do it,&quot; says Armstrong.
<P>
&quot;But gone are the days when the message is more important.
If a play is not well written and performed then the message suffers.&quot;
<P>
Next year the New Theatre turns 65. It has no plans to retire.

</FONT><BR></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>IN NOVEMBER 1993, two 11-year-old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon
Venables, were tried and convicted of the killing of a young child,
James Bulger, in their home town of Liverpool, England. <A HREF="../journos.htm#rkress">RACHEL
KRESS</A> examines how the British media constructed the story known
as the Bulger case.</I>
<P>
BOTH boys come from Walton, tough neighbour-hood in a tough city,
and both come from large families presided over by single families
who are dependent on public aid.&quot; (from <I>New York Times
Index: A Book of Record, 1993.</I>)<I>The New York Times Index</I>
is a chronicle which summarises complex events and issues for
the benefit or journalists researching background information.
<P>
The above quote isn't exactly wrong (grammar aside), but it isn't
exactly right either; and this is the crux of the crime journalism
tradition: a story makes it to the newsstand not because it's
an accurate reflection of reality, but because it's a story told
with recourse to common cultural conceptions.
<P>
The British media's coverage of the Bulger case began on the evening
of Friday February 12, 1993, several hours after James Bulger
was reported missing from a Liverpool shopping centre. On Sunday
the papers had run the video-still of James being &quot;led away&quot;.
By Monday every national paper ran the story that up north in
Liverpool a young child had been abducted and probably killed
by the two unidentified boys in the security video-still.
<P>
Almost two weeks later, Robert Thompson and John Venables were
brought in for questioning. The coverage then dissipated until
just prior to the November trial, climaxing with the release of
the verdict (to which papers devoted whole lift-out sections).
By early December the coverage had all but ceased, only resurfacing
with the occasional update on the convicted boys' appeals.
<P>
The version of the Bulger case that has entered the public memory
is not a transparent record of the case, but the media's representation
of events. This representation has become an obligatory reference
point for any story about juvenile crime. A 1995 episode of ABC's
<I>Lateline</I>, &quot;Violent Innocents&quot;, was dominated
by images and 'facts' about the Bulger case culled from the media
archive. In May this year a <I>Four Corners</I> episode on the
ABC made a passing reference to the Bulger case to support an
argument that a predilection for violent videos can lead to the
committing of violent crime.
<P>
The idea that a violent video may have motivated the Bulger killing
came from a press all too willing to report speculation. No evidence
was ever found by British police, nor presented during the trial,
that Robert or Jon had ever seen the video now automatically associated
with the case, <I>Child's Play 3</I>.
<P>
And yet the issue of video violence dominated Mr Justice Moorland's
summation. Indeed his (and the media's) insistence on the link
between James' death and <I>Child's Play 3</I> led to the restriction
of films available to the general public, by amendments to the
1994 Criminal Justice Act.
<P>
The British media was prepared for Justice Moorland's summation.
After all, it was the media that first asserted that violent videos,
poor home environments, John Major's weak leadership and Liverpool's
left-wing politics were the real culprits of the crime.
<P>
In a media unusually silent on that perennial post-trial favourite
- does the media influence the outcome of a trial? - the suggestion
that the Bulger case was first and foremost a media event never
stood a chance.
<P>
The media's post-verdict frenzy was mostly a re-run of the stories
it ran when the story broke, with the verdict functioning as the
legal stamp of approval. So similar were the stories that <I>The
Times</I> even recycled a paragraph from a February article in
one of its November articles.
<P>
The entire coverage was characterised by inaccuracies and assumptions.
The tabloids, who in February had been unable to wait for an arrest
(let alone a trial) before declaring the two boys &quot;GUILTY&quot;,
were also unable to wait for a sentence. <I>The Sun</I> impatiently
imposed the maximum adult term of 20 years in text so large it
filled half the front page. It then represented Justice Moorland's
recommendation of eight years as another example of misplaced
judicial leniency.
<P>
The broadsheets weren't much better. <I>The Times</I> reported
resoundingly, but inaccurately, that four &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts
were read out. (Only two &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts were read
out, the one other charge against Robert and Jon being left to
lie on file).
<P>
Throughout the coverage of the Bulger case, the media also criticised
the lack of intervention from the 38 people who witnessed the
boys' walk to the railway line. David James Smith, in his book
about the Bulger case titled <I>The Sleep of Reason</I>, suggests
the intensity of this criticism caused eyewitnesses to alter their
original statements, to either further incriminate the boys or
to protect themselves from any possibility of blame. One woman
who had seen the boys from a bus told the police ten days after
the incident that she had &quot;commented&quot; on the scene to
her daughter sitting beside her. In court she claimed to have
alerted the entire bus. Another witness denied telling the police
she had asked the boys if they knew the young child and denied
stating that they had answered her &quot;no&quot;.
<P>
That the British media had repeatedly fulfilled all four grounds
upon which a stay of proceedings can be granted on the grounds
of undue influence under British law, and in doing so may have
predetermined the trial's outcome, was never reported in the press.
And yet the defence counsel for Robert Thompson was able to produce
a sample of 243 examples of prejudicial reporting, ranging from
assertions of the boys' guilt to portraits of them as evil monsters.
<P>
One article in<I>The Independent</I> acknowledged the press' role
when it reported the unsuccessful application for a stay of proceedings
due to undue media influence. Another minor article in <I>The
Times</I> discussed the possibility of media pressure affecting
the witness' evidence. In general, however, Bulger case articles
either assumed a distance from the event or, more convincingly,
assumed the voice of the public, against allegedly unresponsive
politicians.
<P>
But the politicians were listening and, excluding the Prime Minister
John Major who eagerly encouraged the British public to &quot;understand
a little less and condemn a little more&quot;, they were just
waiting to discover what class of culprit they were dealing with.
<P>
Once Robert and Jon had been identified as working class, and
the media had articulated the public opinion, the politicians
were more than ready to speak.
<P>
Within two weeks of James' death, the Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke
announced the Government's intention to get tough on 'bail bandits'
(those who re-offend whilst on bail); and also to allow the courts
to draw inference of guilt from an accused's silence. A further
proposal to reintroduce &quot;glasshouses&quot; (military style
youth detention centres) is still being debated.
<P>
At the time the Bulger case broke, the media, the police and the
Government were claiming that juvenile crime was escalating. A
tricky task, given the statistics were not in their favour. <I>The
Sun</I> circumnavigated this problem by printing a red rising
zigzag over their double page crime spreads, thereby signifying
surging statistics without having to produce any.
<P>
In 1993, misdemeanours of &quot;working-class&quot; children between
the ages of ten and 15 were being considered for criminalisation;
childhood was represented as nurturing the earliest seeds of criminality.
Politicians and the press linked children's misde-meanours to
the lifestyle(s) which kids later allegedly developed - those
of the habitual criminal, the welfare dependent/cheat, the drug
addict, the single mother - and of the sort of places such people
lived - the estates.
<P>
Robert and Jon's age, class and family background meant they fitted
perfectly into this schema. In addition, being so young meant
they could represent all British children; alternatively, they
could represent their parents, their community or their geographic
location.
<P>
The alacrity and frequency with which newspapers published articles
asserting that &quot;Poor parenting breeds youth crime&quot;,
and that crime has a &quot;sociological&quot; and &quot;geographical
memory,&quot; always juxtaposed with Bulger reports, demonstrates
how the media utilised popular cultural conceptions concerning
crime. Facts about the boys' families were downplayed or emphasised
to fit the standard assumptions of who is a criminal.
<P>
For example, the media<I> </I>utilised Robert Thompson's unemployed
mother and his Roman Catholic Irish descent to suggest that he
and his crime were not quite British. The tabloids ran photos
of housing estates - the usual media signifier of crime - next
to articles suggesting these were breeding grounds for crime.
The same media barely mentioned that James' family lived on a
housing estate and that his parents were unmarried, unemployed
and Roman Catholic. Furthermore Robert and Jon lived in terrace
houses which traditionally signify the &quot;good&quot; working-class.
<P>
In <I>Hooligan: A History of Respectable Fears</I>, British sociologist
Geoffrey Pearson charted the constant recycling of this age-old
story: the alarming rise in juvenile crime due to an unprecedented
collective lapse of public morality. In doing so, Pearson noted
that this story has always had its sights fixed firmly on the
working classes.
<P>
The Bulger case fitted this story so well because the crime occurred
in Liverpool. Thanks to the stories about Liverpool which get
reported in the London papers, the city is associated with a strong
unrepentant working class identity, an ongoing opposition to Thatcherite
policies, the Toxteth riots, the Hillsborough and Heysel soccer
stadium disasters. The press used these stories to insinuate that
working class Liverpool courts disaster.
<P>
In the London papers, this story blended with another, indirectly
revealing a tale of two cities: two sets of values, two views
on how to discipline a child, manage a city or govern a people.
It was with this narrative concoction that the press blamed Liverpool's
left-wing civic politics, and Robert and Jon's non-nuclear families
for producing two children representative of a generation which
was not 'childish', and by implication not British.

WATERGATE? You can put that name to many things. A break-in -
a cover-up - a scandal; the fall of a president - a muckraking
melee - a myth. Some might say a journalistic wet-dream. The only
certainty? It was - and still is - a hotel.It has also entered
the lexicon. Look up <I>The Concise Macquarie Dictionary</I> and you find
there's a new word for political scandal. Watergate, as well,
is the progenitor of Irangate, Iraqgate, Camillagate, Squidgy-gate,
Whitewatergate, even Baxtergate!
<P>
Today, Watergate continues to resonate through culture and politics.
There is obvious significance for journalism and students of political
history. Murray Hogarth ofThe Sydney Morning Herald thinks that
the Watergate affair &quot;popularised the notion of investigative
journalism for a generation which has carried it ever since.&quot;
For much of the public, this was a new field of reporting. Four
Corners' Liz Jackson says that for a journalist, Watergate &quot;seems
the highpoint of efficacy of the media in bringing public figures
to account. It's a validation of what people hope at their best
they can do.&quot;
<P>
Even Hollywood can see an angle. Oliver Stone has just directed
a bio-pic of Nixon. And has published an accompanying book that
contains the script, an interview with himself (naturally), and
original Watergate documents and tape transcripts.
<P>
24 years ago, the otherwise unremarkable Washington hotel and
apartment complex called the Watergate was the venue for a botched
break-in and bugging attempt at the then headquarters of the Democratic
Party National Committee. The cast? A hodge-podge of ex-CIA/ex-FBI
functionaries and some exiled Cuban (Bay of Pigs) veterans. These
shenanigans were the culmination of a two-year campaign of illegal
domestic espionage activities by the White House and the Committee
to Re-elect the President against their perceived political and
media enemies. The burglary was a government sanctioned crime.
It was June 16, 1972.
<P>
August 9, 1974 saw the resolution of the affair - President Richard
Nixon resigned from office over his involvement in the ensuing
cover-up. More than two years of turmoil was strewn between these
inextricably linked dates. And as Nixon walked, however reluctantly,
into infamy, a great tide of public discontent and disbelief swelled
behind him. His landslide electoral win of November 7, 1972 (while
Watergate was evolving) would be the last highpoint in his tenure
as president. It went sour as Watergate was examined by the courts,
the FBI, a senate committee, a long running grand jury investigation,
a special Watergate prosecutor, and the House Judiciary Committee.
From the moment he left the White House lawn in 1974 to his death
in 1994 he would be branded an unindicted co-conspirator in these
sordid events.
<P>
That first June day, accused James McCord admitted he had recently
worked for the CIA; a Nixon re-election campaign donation cheque
appeared in another suspect's pocket; and the name and phone number
of a White House operative, Howard Hunt, leapt from the pages
of a third thief's diary. These leads were astounding but seemingly
innocuous curiosities until painstaking investigation by the Washington
Post proved them otherwise.
<P>
The role of journalism in the Watergate affair was complex and
vigorously debated. Essentially, journalists led the chase for
the story from the moment the burglars appeared in court, until
the machinery of government and the courts began to prove effective
after Nixon's re-election. The early exposes of the Post, and
later follow-up work by the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times,
and CBS produced an outstanding body of investigative journalism
and hammered on the door of a rapidly besieged White House.
<P>
The Washington Post and two of its young reporters, Bob Wood-ward
and Carl Bernstein, became internationally famous over their pursuit
of the story. Their determination and their continual ability
to scoop other press outlets were hallmarks. Effectively they
opened up the investigation to the public in its early stages
and exposed elements of the cover-up that ensued. Together, they
followed a trail of money and personnel from the sixth floor of
the Watergate to the top levels of the Nixon administration.
<P>
Woodward and Bernstein traced the path of Nixon campaign contributions
that funded the Republican dirty tricks team into the White House
itself. They began naming White House officials as controllers
of a slush fund that directed nefarious political activities.
To do so, they pursued investigative reporting as news reporters,
and not as political roundsmen. As such, they stayed away from
formal information sites like press conferences, and were unacquainted
with the normal sources in government. Improvisation ruled, and
they created a labyrinth of sources and contacts who, as an unwitting
coalition, confirmed and supported fact, supposition and theory.
In effect, they scrambled around the margins of politics on Watergate.
This brought them to dissatisfied people at all levels who were
ready to talk or to be persuaded to do so.
<P>
Their methods are depicted in their own All The President's Men
(written before the fall of Nixon, in 1974, and made into the
successful 1976 film starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman).
The two reporters talk of the trickle of information coming from
frightened, reluctant people who frequently held back more than
they told. To circumvent this and to turn the trickle to flow,
&quot;the trick was getting inside someone's apartment or house.
There, a conversation could be pursued &#133; They always identified
themselves immediately as reporters for the Washington Post but
the approach that seemed to work best was less than straightforward
&#133; &quot; They begged, borrowed and cajoled their way in -
often bluffing their way to the truth.
<P>
Frequent meetings were held with editors Barry Sussman, Howard
Simons, Harry Rosenfeld, and executive editor, Ben Bradlee, to
approve and edit stories and decide direction. The reporters usually
argued that one source was enough to support a story. But &quot;gradually
an unwritten rule was evolving: unless two sources confirmed a
charge involving activity likely to be considered criminal, the
specific allegation was not used in the paper.&quot; Some stories
needed even more.
<P>
The effectiveness of these reporting techniques is most evident
in that the stories held firm and were vindicated. Furious White
House denials of the alleg-ations and vilification of the Post
were all withstood partly because of the scrutiny to which the
evidence was subjected.
<P>
These methods suited the situation but did not always ensure accuracy.
Stories were often left unattributed. Very few sources would go
on the record, and background and deep background (in which a
source is never quoted, even anonymously) were frequently employed.
The White House often complained over published accusations that
had unidentified origins.
<P>
Woodward's executive branch contact, Deep Throat, was the most
celebrated example of the use of a confidential source on deep
background. He refused to be quoted in any story and would not
volunteer information, only confirming or denying evidence presented
to him. His information proved ultimately reliable, and his (or
her?) identity remains an enigma today. And the name of the top-secret
confidential source on TV's X-Files? In honour perhaps, Deep Throat.
<P>
Occasionally, stories were incorrect. Accusing White House Chief
of Staff H. R. Haldeman of involvement was made possible by a
web of confirmations so tenuous that it was swiftly and vehemently
rebuked, causing the Post to lose face and ground. This was despite
the story's essential truth. Accountant to the Committee to Re-Elect
the President, Hugh Sloan, had confirmed indirectly to the reporters
that Haldeman was the fifth name controlling the fund that financed
illegal activities on behalf of the Committee. Deep Throat had
informed them that they were right, and another confi-dential
source had added further weight. The story was written, however,
quoting only Sloan, and reported him naming Haldeman in his Grand
Jury Testimony. His attorney vehemently denied the allegation.
Later, Sloan indicated that Haldeman was the fifth name, but he
had not actually ever said so before the Grand Jury as no-one
had asked.
<P>
Vindication of the basic story of Watergate has quelled much valid
criticism of Woodward and Bernstein's techniques. Indeed, approbation
has pretty much always been the order of the day, although criticism
has emerged concerning the use of, and reliance on, confidential
sources. When a story is wrong, multiple back-ground sources and
chain reaction confirmation of facts are no guarantee of truth.
The use of confidential sources can be risky.
<P>
Stories by the Post earned them subpoenas from lawyers representing
the Committee to Re-elect the President (which were challenged
and dismissed), and two trips to see Judge John Sirica for approaches
to witnesses and grand jurors. Obtaining vital information often
required such tactics of questionable legality. Whether the situation
demanded skirting the edges of the law so frequently and brazenly
is still debatable.
<P>
Was the press lacking in effectiveness? Early forays by the Washington
Post had only minor initial impact. Journalists from the Sunday
Times in London thought that this was true to the extent that
&quot;by the fall of 1972 it was the press, not the administration,
that lacked credibility.&quot; In a celebrated but largely apocryphal
moment, Ben Bradlee was heard to say that at this point his newspaper
really had its dick on the table. Later, however, televised hearings
and sensational confessions of highly placed White House officials
garnered national attention and cemented the credibility of the
press.
<P>
The impact on Australian journalism? Both Murray Hogarth and Liz
Jackson speak glowingly of Watergate as a &quot;journalistic beacon&quot;
and refer to Australian journalists such as Chris Masters and
Brian Toohey, whose paths to success have partly been paved by
Woodward and Bernstein.
<P>
Toohey himself argues otherwise. To him, Watergate simply employed
available contemporary techniques and has not affected Australian
journalism to any great degree. He feels that investigative journalism
puts advertisers offside, causes trouble, doesn't pay well, and
takes months to do. Consequently, it engenders little enthusiasm
in newspaper management. Indeed, &quot;investigative journalism
has gone downhill all round the world&quot;.
<P>
Journalist Michael Schudson (and others), however, talks of an
all pervading myth of &quot;Journalism-in-Watergate&quot;. Shudson
argues persuasively against the idea that &quot;the Washington
Post brought down the President&quot;. He concludes that this
gives undue credit to the Post where properly, it should go to
those government agencies that performed admirably. The FBI, the
Federal Grand Jury investigation, and the machinations of the
justice system of the United States all made handsome contributions
to the tale of woe. Each of these governmental law enforcement
arms pursued legitimate investigation of Watergate collaborators,
and between them conducted the many government hearings that eventually
crowded and concluded the affair.
<P>
It is easy in hindsight to indicate the lack of press involvement
and influence over these hearings. But is it fair to saddle the
press with the duties of the investigative bodies? For example,
it is often understated that Nixon was halfway to impeachment
and politically pungent when he left office. Yet it was not open
to journalism to initiate or undertake this course of action.
And would we have seen the same results without theWashington
Post, et al ? Senator Sam Ervin, (in whose committee hearings
former Counsel to the President John Dean first publicly accused
the president of complicity in the cover-up), openly sought assistance
from those journalists who had reported the case.
<P>
Historian T. H. White concluded, &quot;it was three specific systems
acting by themselves and by their own dynamics - the press from
outside, the judicial system and Congressional leadership acting
from within - that moved first tentatively, then inexorably, to
bring about the downfall of Richard Nixon.&quot; The myths of
Watergate need to be tempered, but each institution - media, Judiciary
and Capitol Hill - played a part.
<P>
Did the press have a right to pursue the story? Did the White
House have a right to conceal? The First Amendment to the United
States Constitution helps to resolve this debate. Freedom of the
press is a direct stipulation that government will not interfere.
The press had a right to find out the answers, and then a duty
to endure the consequences. White says the news machine did no
more than its constitutional duty.
<P>
Watergate was, maybe, a historical aberration, an extraordinary
confluence of factors never to be repeated. Certainly, it is hard
to see the White House ever again being as careless with its activities.
Or as carefree in its relations with the media. And would a President
ever again be as foolish as to oversee, personally, such shenanigans?
In a presidential election year, republican candidate and retiring
Senator Bob Dole may give us an opportunity to find out. He does
have intimate knowledge. After all, his home in Washington is
The Watergate Hotel.

<P>
CYNICS say the Australian music industry is dead; that it hit
its peak in the '80s with the likes of Midnight Oil, Crowded House
and INXS. They say that venues are shutting down and that there's
not enough new bands emerging to displace the 'Farnsey and Barnesy'
stronghold. These cynics obviously haven't heard of Grinspoon,
Raven, Ode to a Goldfish, or Porcelien. They haven't heard of
Unearthed.
<P>
Unearthed is a nationwide competition run by the ABC's youth radio
network Triple J. Born from the station's longstanding desire
to support young Australian musicians, the competition aims to
discover and promote new bands from regional areas around the
country.
<P>
&quot;It took quite a while to get to the point where we felt
Unearthed was the best way to achieve our aims,&quot; says Bronwyn
McConvill, the competition's co-ordinator.
<P>
But when the former federal government encouraged the expansion
of Triple J into regional Australia, the Unearthed idea began
to take shape.
<P>
McConvill describes the project's aims as twofold:
<P>
&quot;We wanted to get Triple J out into the regional areas; both
programs and staff. We are a national network; we wanted to get
a feel for Australia, instead of just broadcasting from Sydney.&quot;We
also wanted to assist young musicians in regional Australia ...
and give them a chance of national exposure,&quot; she says. 
<P>
But McConvill believes the competition is ultimately about young
Australians, be they musicians or not.
<P>
&quot;Young people love hearing what other young people are up
to,&quot; she says. &quot;Because the shows are broadcast from
each regional area, the listener gets a feel for that area - a
chance to hear what is happening in other young people's lives.
Capital city listeners hear about Lismore or Rockhampton through
the words and music of the area's young residents.&quot;
<P>
By July this year, Triple J will have 'unearthed' all the regional
areas to which it presently broadcasts.
<P>
The competition has already been successful in increasing audiences
and venues for live music in regional Australia. Venues have capitalised
on the success of Unearthed and have been giving local bands regular
gigs.
<P>
In Rockhampton, for instance, a concert featuring 13 local bands
was recently staged following the town's huge response to the
Triple J competition.
<P>
&quot;With any luck,&quot; says McConvill, &quot;I think [venues
and regional acts] will gradually get over 'pub rock' and bloody
cover songs ... Bands are finding they can be original, and can
be accepted.&quot;Indeed the deluge of original new bands makes
judging the Unearthed competition extremely difficult, according
to McConvill. She says the judges are essentially &quot;looking
for a song to play on the radio; no particular genre, just a song
that sounds great.&quot;
<P>
Most of the hundreds of demo tapes sent in by aspiring bands have
been cheaply recorded in bedrooms and garages. McConvill says
that judging the competition is more often than not a matter of
&quot;hearing through a bad recording&quot;.
<P>
The winner from each region is awarded a recording session in
the Triple J studios. With professional assistance, they produce
a slick DAT demo tape which they can take to record companies.
<P>
Some of the winners have already met with success as a result
of the competition.
<P>
Lismore band Grinspoon, one of the first bands to be &quot;unearthed&quot;,
gained a spot in the 1995 Triple J Hottest 100 with their song
<I>Sick Fest</I>. The band was also included on the prestigious
Homebake festival bill.
<P>
Porcelein, the Broken Hill winners, played at the recent Livid
Festival in Brisbane; while Gold Coast winners, Communion, have
just snared a breakthrough record deal with the prestigious Mushroom
label.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant thing about Unearthed, however, is
that it shows that Australian music is alive and well. Venues
are hiring these young bands, and crowds are swelling in support.
Australian music, it seems, is on the rise.

<Font size=3>South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information in Development</Font size=3><P>
<A NAME="Development"><Font size=7>Development communications</Font size=7></A><P>
The South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information in Development (SPCenCIID) of the University of Papua New Guinea has taken on a pioneering role in development communication and research in the region.
<P>
Located at the Waigani campus of the University of Papua New Guinea, SPCenCIID  combines the resources of Library and Information Studies and Journalism Studies. 
<P>
It reflects the trend in media study schools internationally to emphasise 'communications' -- combining journalism with public relations, mass communications, television, filmmaking and intercultural studies. Development communication is also a priority. 
<P>
Among resources published by SPCenCIID is the fortnightly newspaper <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/UniT_Home.html">Uni Tavur</A>; a media and communications journal, <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/PJR/">Pacific Journalism Review</A>; a daily website and email news service, <A HREF="http://www.pactok.net.au/docs/nius/">Niuswire</A>; a quarterly communications newsletter, <B>Ita Diba</B> and a comprensive new text book on mass media in the region: <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/cafepacific/resources/david_books.html">Nius Bilong Pasifik: Mass Media in the Pacific.

<P>
No other journalism educational institution in the Pacific offers anything substantial in the field of Third World or development journalism, most following Australian or New Zealand models. 
<P>
The centre attracts journalism students or professional journalists and library/information students and professionals from around the region -- mainly Melanesia -- seeking further qualifications.
<P>
The centre enables trends within library and information sciences to be developed. A meeting of talents and minds in the centre with a developmental orientation offers an attractive change for a more positive contribution from the resources available.
<P>
Among tertiary institutions with close ties to the centre is the  <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/"> Australian Centre for Independent Journalism  </A>  ( ACIJ ) at the University of Technology, Sydney. A draft Memorandum of Understanding is being prepared between the two universities.
<P>
Associate Professor Wendy Bacon of the ACIJ assisted the centre under a UNESCO funded consultancy in developing a graduate Certificate of Investigative Journalism course.

<P>
<Font size=3>In 1989 a Department of Library and Information Studies (DLIS) was established within UPNG's Faculty of Education. This was coupled with a bachelor's degree course in library and information studies. 
<P>
Journalism began at UPNG in 1974 as an autonomous unit funded by the New Zealand Government for five years. Although it is the biggest and oldest tertiary journalism programme, its resources had been neglected while student numbers have grown and technological development and publishing had been growing at an increased pace.
<P>
The centre was created in January 1995. </Font>

<h2>About Pacific Journalism Review</h2>

<P>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>Hi, I'm <B>David Robie</B> and welcome to my home page. I'm an award-winning New Zealand author and journalist who has specialised in reporting Pacific development and political issues, and a media consultant. At the moment, I'm teaching in Papua New Guinea.<P>

For the record, I've edited or been senior editorial executive on newspapers in Australia, France, Kenya, New Zealand and South Africa. I'm also the author of seven books -- including <A HREF="david_books.html">Nius Bilong Pasifik: Mass Media in the Pacific</A> and two others used as texts at the University of Papua New Guinea.<P>

I currently lecture in print journalism at UPNG and have revamped the journalism training newspaper <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/UniT_Home.html">Uni Tavur</A> as a professional tabloid. For the past three years I have edited <A HREF="index.html">Pacific Journalism Review</A>. Also, check out our <A HREF="http://www.pactok.net/docs/nius"> Niuswire</A> news service.

David, thanks for your websites. <A HREF="http://www.pactok.net.au/docs/nius/">Niugini Nius</A> is wonderful.  I am currently working as technical editor on one of the largest computer titles over here [in the UK], and to be able to read even a couple of stories a day from PNG is fantastic for keeping in touch with what's going on, and dreaming of how of get back out there.  Keep up the good work, and if you need any PC software let me know.  I can't promise anything, and it may take some time to come through, but it may be worth a try.

<H3>KANAK WEBSITE?</H3>
<Font size=3>Aloha, I teach 20th century Pacific Islands history here at the University of Hawaii (I have used <A HREF="david_books.html">Blood on Their Banner</A> as a text), and I have been searching for a reliable, up-to-date source of news on events in Kanaky/New Caledonia. Radio Australia covers it sporadically, and Tahiti-Pacifique is predictably superficial. Could you suggest a site? 
<P>
I am especially interested in hearing whether it is true that last April, the French Premier told delegates from Kanaky that independence was no longer an option, apparently abrogating the Matignon Accords and the whole rationale for the 1998 vote. I have heard via the French version of Radio Australia news that the RDO (Sako's mainly Wallisian party) has come out in favor of "association" as a compromise step toward further sovereignty. Do you know about this? Our library normally subscribes to Les Nouvelles Caledoniennes, a mediocre source of news at best, but the university is having a budget crisis, so we have received no issues this year. 
<P>
Thanks for any assistance (or leads) you may have the time to provide me.
<P>

<H3>RURAL VANUATU PAGE</H3>
David Robie -
I've just had a look at your site, including the Pacific Links page. 
I see you have a link to Kiaman Buluk's site about Port Vila Vanuatu. 
You might want to have a look at my site (http://www.silk.net/personal/scombs/vanuatu.html - "Vanuatu - A Canadian's Perspective") about rural Vanuatu to complement Kiaman's. It's a collection of things I've written about rural Vanuatu after living and working on an outer island (Malekula) for two years and in Vila for another three years.  Even while living in Vila, my work as Vanuatu's first Regional Development Planning Adviser continued to take me throughout the islands.  If you find the site suitable, you might want to add a link to it.
<P>  
Your site is well organized, good quality, and a welcome change from the tourism-oriented Pacific sites on the web.

<H3>INFORMATIVE PAGE</H3>
<Font size=3>Liked your Home page very much. Very informative. I have printed some images so that Margaret Obi, who is speaking at UNSW today, can have some illustrative material and I can use these images in the future.
<P>
Is there any statement on Information Technology policy in PNG? For a country so large (and potentially wealthy), it seems poorly served.
How is Pactok progressing? 
<P>
In the meantime, people such as yourself continue to provide excellent
sources. I will look into your Library for any IT stories.

<H3>FANTASTIC LINK</H3>
Dear David, Thanks for the link to Cafe Pacific it looks fantastic. I wrote to your other page editor, with an idea I had about the future of Pacific Media sites and their relation to the South Pacific Information Network. What I thought might be an idea, is to put a site (with standard links to all yours and other Pacific Media outlets - with perhaps gif images of the websites for people to click onto. However, this would be just a sideline to the main purpose of the site. It would take a little bit of work on all our behalfs, but in the end would allow a fantastic resource to be developed which would bring all the news stories from around the region together in the one place, while at the same time keeping your own independence and news resources. 
<P>
However what would be great in this scenario, would be that not only would stories be archived, but people could do searches on particular areas they are interested in and get online results very quickly. What I am proposing is to develop a site similar to the SPIN calendar of events, while keeping the calendar format, it would have completely different fields. What I propose is that fields such as News Headline, Author and brief summary (perhaps keywords) be entered when a story hits your pages.

<Font size=5>CULTURE: PACIFIC WAVE MAKES A BIG SPLASH</Font size=5>
<P>
<Font size=4>Reflecting the diversity of Pacific Islands community, Pacific Wave festival will splash its way all over Sydney for two weeks in November, hosting a variety of both traditional and contemporary events at a range of venues such as the Performance Space, The Casula Powerhouse and Bondi Pavilion.</Font size=4>

<TD>"THIS WILL be a major step forward to what I believe will be a great multicultural society." With those positive words, Aboriginal director Noel Tovey helped launch the inaugural Pacific Wave Festival, a celebration of the art, music and performance of peoples from the Pacific Basin set to run in Sydney during the first two weeks of November.
<P>
Reflecting the diversity of its community, Pacific Wave will splash its way all over Sydney, hosting a variety of both traditional and contemporary events at a range of venues such as the Performance Space, The Casula Powerhouse and Bondi Pavilion.
<P>
And what better way to kick off the festivities than with a giant pool party. And at Victoria Park. That's right, the scene of those Ted Mulry Gang and Hush concerts  held all those years back (was it that long ago?)  will be transformed into a celebration of everything that is vibrant and enervating about Pacific Islands cultures

<P>
After an official welcoming ceremony by the local Aboriginal community, the pool party will be awash with drumming from the Cook Islands, the sweet sounds of of traditional  church choirs, Maori acapella groups, contemporary Aboriginal, Fijian and Maori poetry, aquatic performances and Samoan canoeing.
<P>
Things will hot up with the Samoan fire dancer and the Hip-Hop beats of local Polynesian DJs.

</TD>
<TD>
There will also be a special preview of Death Defying Theatre's latest show, "Going Home".  But don't expect to see tourist brochure images of grass skirts and palm trees -- this is a show about the lives of Pacific Islander and Maori people living in Sydney. It takes in the sounds of Apia,  Auckland and Auburn. The sounds of Pacific Islander urban youth.
<P>
Maud Page, curator of the Pacific Pool Party, says  it is important  that urban Pacific Islanders  have a space to express themselves. 

"I'm particularly interested to show the urban and the traditional, that you can combine the both. Especially for the young people -- to say look, you can go out and have a good time and be into Hip-Hop, be into other things and have your culture as well."
<P>
Page is adamant that an event like the Pacific Pool Party not only ought to show the more established groups but also give an opportunity for groups that have never had any exposure to perform.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
"That's particularly the case with the Aboriginal groups. There's an Aboriginal woman called Rayma Johnson and she's going to perform with two others in what is a very political number."
<P>
Page is not giving  away the other "surprises", however. "People will have to come and see for themselves on the night", she smiles.
<P>
But there's no secret about what Pacific Wave is set to cover over the next two weeks.
<P>
The Casula Powerhouse will be staging three major art exhibitions: Highlander Rascals from New Guinea, contemporary artwork from Melville Islands and Tuba rai Metin, an affirmation of East Timorese culture.
<P>
Maori artist Maureen Lander is in also in Sydney to team up with Aboriginal artist Judy Watson. Their installation, "Bioluminescence", will be on show at Victoria Park.
<P>
There will also be dance performed by the acclaimed New Zealand Black Grace Theatre Company. An all-male troupe, this strong and physical  work centres on the trials and tribulations of what it is to be a male dancer in the Maori and Pacific Islander communities.

<TD>
Other highlights include the performance of Going Home at the Casula Powerhouse and Tatau -- Rites of Passage, a theatrical piece featuring the world famous Samoan body-artist Sua Suluape tattooing a cast member live on stage.

For the closing ceremony Pacific Wave moves from the pool to the ocean at Bondi. Faa Pasefika ("Pacific Way") promises to be an explosion of South Pacific visual and performing arts set to the backdrop of contemporary Hip-Hop music.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
A collection of photos from the Powerhouse's archives depicting Pacific Islanders in the late 19th century together with snaps taken from both the recent Samoan Arts Festival and DJ Hip-Hop nights around the Sydney club scene will decorate the Bondi Pavilion.
<P>
Some five or six DJ's will play on the night, accompanied by a range of traditional and contemporary dance groups performing live. Up to 10 people will be tattooed with traditional arm bands.
<P>
"A lot of people from our culture relate to the Afro-American experience", explains Leo Tanoi, organiser of Faa Pasefika. "But the other side we have is Hip-Hop by Polynesians over here. Hip-Hop follows on the R&B tradition and has an ability to get a wide message over".
<P>
"Tanoi points out that while Hip Hop is still young in Australia, young people are experimenting and trying to find out what relates to them in the music. I asked him if he thought local Hip-Hop was a predominantly outer suburb thing.
<P>
"There's been a lot of debate about this. In America it's East Coast and West Coast and their styles are different. You can hear it. It's really hard to explain but in the same way there are different styles here. You have the outer-west and the Eastern suburbs. But the common thread in Hip-Hop is poverty and the need to express oneself in broken-down communities."
<P>
Faa Pasefika, like all the other Pacific Wave events, is about old and young. "We're expecting everyone to come along," says Tanoi. "There's no time for only contemporary or only traditional. Only for both."

<Font size=5>MEDIA: TAUIWI AND MAORI NEWS: AN INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVE</Font size=5>
<P>
<Font size=4>Aotearoa/New Zealand is divided between the mainstream news media and the fast-gowing Maori media with different perspectives. New Zealand journalism graduates need to be taught different media systems and news values.</Font 4>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><B>By IAN STUART in Taradale, NZ</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>IF WE look at the New Zealand news media now and beyond 2000 it is obvious that the biggest growth area is in the Maori media. For many years Maori have been saying the news media ignores their perspective on news and is not reporting Maori events properly. The news media failed to take notice of these claims and in frustration Maori  set up their own media. 
<P>
In the last 19 years -- but more so in the past five years there has been a huge growth in the Maori news media. There are now nine Iwi newspapers, 26 Iwi radio stations, a Maori radio news network and several Maori magazines, the most prominent being Mana.
</TABLE>
<TABLE COLSPEC="L20" BORDER=0 WIDTH=475 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=2>

<TD><IMG SRC="../../images/maori.gif" WIDTH=200 BORDER=2>
<BR><B>Front page of a bilingual Maori newspaper, Te Maori News.</B>
<P>
</TD>
<TD>
This means there are two major news information sources in Aotearoa/New Zealand -- the mainstream  (or Tauiwi) media and the Maori media. Both offer audiences a different perspective on events in New Zealand -- a perspective based on the culture of the reporters and journalists producing the news. 
<P>
What does this mean for the future of news in New Zealand -- and what does it mean for journalism education? I do not propose to answer these questions here but to offer some thoughts for the future direction of journalism and journalism education as Aotearoa/New Zealand  moves  towards the new century and a truly bicultural environment. 
<P>
Before going any further it would be helpful to look at the reasons behind the establishment of a separate media for Maori. This may help to see the way back to a united news media. Part of the reason why Maori complained that the news media was not voicing their stories properly is the style of reporting practised and taught in Aotearoa/New Zealand.  
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
Maori journalist and broadcaster Derek Fox sums the situation up well in Whose News when he discussed the way the Tauiwi media did not cover Maori issues. (1)
But it is obvious that reporters in Aotearoa/NewZealand do not cover many issues well. The failings are primarily in the areas of politics, the debate surrounding tino Rangatiratanga [Maori sovereignty], race relations -- all issues which affect society as a body. 
<P>
In these areas our news media has followed the American interpretive style of reporting clearly telling readers and listeners what to think about events and issues rather than simply presenting both sides of a debate. Nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than by a One Network News promo  used before the  6 pm news which tells us that at 6 o'clock Television One will have everything that has happened during the day "and what it all means". Professor James Curran, of London University, summed it up when he described the news within a market-oriented system as 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>information which is simplified, condensed, personalised, decontextualised, with a stress on action rather than process, visualisation rather than abstraction, stereotype rather than human complexity. (2)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
While I believe all these criticisms are valid and things need to change, the two  I wish to focus on here are "personalisation" and "stress on action rather than process" as these are the important areas where issues, rather than action or people, can be dealt with.  There are numerous examples of this in the Tauiwi media. A television current affairs anchorman Paul Holmes promos his program with: "Somewhere in New Zealand there is someone doing something which you should know about  -- we will have that person". Clearly a focus on personalities and action.  And when confronted with "issues" stories  chief reporters, chief subeditors and other "gatekeepers" commonly ask: "What can we hang it on?" or "Where's the news angle?".
<P>
What they are asking is what "event" or "person doing something" makes this worth putting in our newspaper?. However, this dependence on action and people to hold up as "news makers" is moving the news media away from its primary role which is usually simplified to "telling people what they need to know to function within a democracy". Action or newsmakers are easy to report but public debate and public information  is submerged under the immediacy of the "news".
<P>
<Font size=5>I</Font 5>N 1989, Jurgen Habermas traced the evolution of the news media from an avenue for public debate to a sector dominated by economic interests and expanded state powers. (3)
<P>
The media ceased to be an agency of empowerment and rationality and became a further means by which the public was sidelined. Instead of providing a conduit for rational-critical debate, the media manipulated mass opinion. It defined politics as spectacle, offered pre-digested, convenience thinking and conditioned the public into the role of passive consumers.(4)
<P>
Nowhere are these criticisms more clear in the news media in Aotearoa/New Zealand than in the reporting of the opposition Labour Party's problems in 1995. Political reporting focused on the party's "poor position"  in the opinion polls and the strategies the party was using to increase its standing. There were few articles or programs about Labour's policies or where the country might go if Labour was in government. If there were articles about the party's policies they were accompanied by an analysis of whether those policies were vote catchers -- not discussion about whether those would policies work or their effect on the country. But reporters are stuck with this because they cannot report party policies without an event to hang them on -- a poor poll showing or party conference. Or even "create" a  news story by asking whether the poor poll showing means the leader is about to lose his or her position.
<P>
This style of reporting is not giving people the information they need to function in a democracy. Instead, it turns politics into a spectator sport -- Habermas' "politics as spectacle".  It has been said elsewhere that elections are called like a horse race -- reporters use opinion polls to tell the people who is winning, who is coming second, which party is third, and so on. There is little debate and discussion about the relative merits of each party and their policies. But I would like to extend the metaphor further and say elections are no longer called like a horse race but more like a rugby league match. Parliamentary reporters call the action -- the commentator role filled by people like TV2's Graeme Hughes; then political commentators comment on the action -- the added colour role filled in league commentaries by personalities such as coach Graham Lowe.
<P>
Reporting politics in this way is not confined to Parliament. Veteran protester Sue Bradford was arrested in 1995 while protesting outside the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Auckland.  A good "play" by a political participant. She got herself on the national television networks. But what was she protesting about? The news media never told us. The same criticisms can be levelled at reports of the current debate (or lack of debate) surrounding the Tino Rangatiratanga issue. This is only brought to the fore during occupations and protests -- when there is an event to focus on.
<P>
What were people told about the occupation of Pokaitore/Moutoa Gardens in Wanganui during 1995? The news media's heavily interpretive stories conveyed the overriding impressions of Maori radicals breaking the law and defying the legitimate authority of the state -- people were not informed of the issues, accurately informed about what the occupiers wanted, what their grievances were or why they were occupying Pakaitore at that time. What the country got was simplified, personalised, news which stressed action rather than process. Maori justifiably argue that the Tauiwi media did not report this event properly. 
<P>
But this was just one example. All reporting of Maori land occupations focuses on action -- protesters' interaction with the police, the public as well as attempts to move them off. People are never given information they need to make up their own minds on the issue -- the news media manipulates public opinion by labelling people as "radicals" and carrying stories which clearly tell people such radicals are breaking the law, creating racial tensions and "doing nothing to help New Zealand".
<P>
This process is not limited to politics or Maori issues. The American style of reporting has turned all public opinion and issues stories into a spectator sport. Opinion polls are used to show who is winning and commentators discuss moves and strategies as if they were calling a sports game.
And where the news media does attempt to cover issues and present opposing points of view it fails to do so because journalists  interpret the world from their own cultural standpoint. In his essay "Mass Media and Democracy", Professor James Curran points out there are different ideas and systems of representation which groups use to advance their ideas in society.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Different ways of signifying and making sense of society, different linguistic codes and conceptual categories, different chains of association and versions of "common sense" privilege the interests of some social groups while disadvantaging others. Put another way, the medias informational role is never purely informational; it is also a way of arbitrating between the rhetorical claims of rival interests -- in a form that has an indirect outcome in terms of allocation of resources and life opportunities between different social groups.(5)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It  is not surprising that Maori expressed dissatisfaction with the Tauiwi media and then set up their own media outlets. So today we have two cultures relying on different news services. Maori and Tauiwi are being given different pictures of the world they live in and differing information on which to base their political decisions. This divisiveness cannot be healthy for the country. And the loss of a large and growing sector of the audience cannot be good for news organisations which purport to provide information to everyone and relies on a large audience for advertising revenue and therefore economic survival. 
<P>
On purely financial terms the Tauiwi news media cannot to lose such a chunk of the population. This becomes even more apparent when population projection projections are considered. The Statistics  Department projects a huge growth in the Maori population -- basically Maori birth rates are higher than Tauiwi rates. 
<P>
By the year 2016 Gisborne's citizens will be 50 per cent Maori. They already have an iwi radio station and iwi newspaper. Currently the Hawke's Bay high school population is 40 per cent Maori. They too have their own radio station and newspaper. What will it mean for our industry when those people leave school and start to use an information service -- which one will they turn to?
<P>
<Font size=5>U</Font 5>NLESS there are significant changes to the Tauiwi news media they will lose future Maori generations.  What sort of changes need to be made? How can differing views of the world be presented in one newspaper or even within one story?
<P>
What we really need to change is the model we work to -- both journalists and journalism educators. I believe we need to look to Europe, not America, for the style of news we would be teaching people to produce. The European style of reporting leans more towards presenting both sides of a story, relatively judgement-free and without telling the audience what to think about issues and events. This allows the audience to make up its own mind about an issue -- to truly exercise their power in a democracy. 
<P>
There is much written about media models which fulfil this function. I suggest Professor Curran's essay in Media and Society as a good starting point. I therefore will not go into details on these models. But I would like to quote Curran's extrapolation of a media model from Habermas' ideas where:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Access to information affecting the public good is widely available, where discussion is free of domination by the state and where all those participating in public debate to do so on an equal basis. Within this public sphere people collectively determine through the process of rational argument the way in which they want to see society develop and this shapes in turn the conduct of Government policy. The media facilitates this process by providing an arena of public debate and by reconstituting private citizens as a public body in the form of public opinion.(6) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
And
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By staging a public dialogue in which diverse interests participate, the media should also play a direct role in assisting the search for areas of common agreement or compromise. It should also provide an adequate way in which people can engage in a wider public discourse that can result in the modification of social attitudes affecting social relationships between individuals and groups.(7) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
What this model assumes, and correctly so, is that the media is not made up of observers and reporters, but is a necessary, functioning, part of any society. This involves a substantial mind-shift for journalists and educators. This raises the problem of what is objectivity and how journalists can function in society without compromising their independence. I do not wish to enter that debate here but I would argue that by holding up all sides of an argument for public scrutiny and making it clear whose opinions are being expressed journalists are moving closer to the goals of objectivity than the interpretive style of reporting allows.
<P>
Clearly it is such a model the Tauiwi media needs to adopt if it is to continue to function as the major information source in a bicultural society and meet the needs of both Maori and Tauiwi. On the larger level, adopting this role would aid the country in public debates about all aspects of our society, including the current debate surrounding Maori calls for Tino Rangatiratanga. 
<P>
At present we are told, through the Tauiwi media, that this means Maori want to take over this country and run it themselves without input from Tauiwi. This is presented as an undesirable goal. But is that what Maori want? Most people do not really know what Maori are asking for and have no true opinion about Maori aspirations because their media is not giving them the information they need to assess the relative merits of the issues.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>W</FONT 5>HAT DOES this all mean for journalism educators? I strongly believe that as educators we have the role of empowering people, not of controlling people. But the current education system is focused on controlling us and our graduates so they fit the needs of a market-oriented media. 
<P>
We have the power to change the media in Aotearoa/New Zealand by what we say and do as academics and what we teach our students. Our graduates now need the skills to be able to cater for both Maori and Tauiwi readers and listeners within the same newspapers and broadcast news bulletins, even within the same stories, if the Tauiwi media is to keep, or attract back, the Maori audience.
<P>
In 20 years some of our current graduates will be the news executives. They need the skills and knowledge to be able to make decisions about bicultural reporting in the next century. Firstly I believe that our graduates need to be taught that there are different ways of organising the media and presenting information than are currently used in Aotearoa/New Zealand. This may be happening in some courses but I believe graduates are primarily fitted into the expectations of the current news media heads and their market-oriented system.(8) 
<P>
If future change is to happen, our current graduates need to be aware of different systems because they are the people who will make the changes. As well as being taught different models and how they work, our graduates need to be taught the expectations of the current system and how to work inside that system. But they must still be able to see it for what it is -- one way of presenting news. 
<P>
Secondly, we need to teach students about different concepts of what makes news. We need to teach more than just how to produce event-oriented news. A journalist's job is to "get a story". Too often this means getting enough information, or the right information, to fit market-oriented expectations. In the reality of market-driven news if the story gets too long it gets cut, or if it does not fit the gatekeepers' expectations, it gets spiked. We have all written stories to fit this structure: in fact, we know it so well we teach it to our students. But the stories which fit this structure are the event-oriented stories and will not be suitable if we change the model. 
<P>
Even within the existing model our graduates need the skills to find the "real story" and report it accurately. Primarily this involves being able to see behind the events to the issues underlying what is happening. There is some discussion about whether students should be selected for this skill or whether it should be taught it on the courses. This area also needs further debate. 
<P>
Returning to my examples of the Maori occupations. Such protests are currently being reported as events because that is all reporters are capable of seeing. Or that is the way the current news model allows them to be reported. But the occupations are only the physical occurrences in a social exercise which has an intellectual dimension (the issues) and a physical dimension (the occupations/protests). By the intellectual dimension I mean the ideas, concepts, thoughts, culture and philosophical background of the participants.
<P>
But like all such issue stories where something physical happens reporters are good at reporting the event and asking emotional questions: "What did it feel like?"  "Are you angry?" "Are you upset?" But in terms of telling people what is happening in their world and allowing public debate it is the intellectual dimension which is more important and most frequently missed. We need to reorient our own thinking and then our students' thinking so we focus on this intellectual dimension. This is often described as "in-depth" reporting though there is little of it in Aotearoa/New Zealand. 
<P>
If reporters could see an issue story, or the physical manifestations of an issue story, in terms of its social context the news media would move closer to the model suggested by Professor Curran. This is not a difficult skill. We have all had the experience of being given a story to write which we know nothing about. Getting the story was a process of finding out everything we could about the event or issue, especially asking questions of the people involved, so we could report it accurately.  We need to teach our students to ask the questions to probe for the intellectual dimension of issue stories. 
<P>
But the primary skill they need is to be able to listen to people and report accurately what they hear -- not simplifying everything to fit into the expectations of the existing news structures. The main thing we should teach our students is to listen for the differences in ideas and systems of representation different groups use outlined by Curran and quoted earlier.
<P>
This means a reporter out in the field does not necessarily need a strong background in Maori culture. What the reporter needs are the skills to listen to what people say and a model to work to which allows issues to be reported on their open merits. Within this idea of a differing concept of news we also need to teach students how to initiate and maintain public debates. What our graduates will need to know is how to write stories about issues to further the public debate, to present several sides of an argument or issue without colouring or interpreting anything people have to say. Ideas become news -- not action.
<P>
Differing voices find it hard to be heard through our news media. Any public relations person worth a salary knows that to get a message across you have to stage a "newsworthy" event. But this should not be the case. People with something worth saying should have free access to the media to have their say without staging events, many of which turn into protest action -- and then violent protest action. But in the current climate the action overshadows the worth of ideas. Changing the focus away from action presents a different kind of "judgment call" and I admit this needs further debate and discussion.
<P>
Current headlining Maori "radical" Ken Mair, along with other members of Te Ahi Kaa -- Mike Smith, Syd Jackson and Annette Sykes -- actually have quite reasoned and reasonable arguments to present to the country. But what the media shows is their headline-grabbing action -- cutting down historic pine trees, occupying land, disrupting "legitimate" activities. The media pushes them forward as "radicals" and "activists", creating the impression, in the Tauiwi minds at least, that their ideas are not worth listening to. 
<P>
Reasoned and reasonable do not make news. As one of my former students said after interviewing Ken Mair -- and being surprised at how reasoned and reasonable he was: "The mainstream media works hard to make him look bad, don't they." It is time the media told the public what the "radical" arguments really are rather than focusing on their actions.
<P>
The third area that needs to change is language and presentation the media uses. The news media in Aotearoa/New Zealand uses words to describe people which are emotionally loaded and interpretive. Words like "Maori activist" and "Maori radical" have acquired negative connotations which the media supports and plays on. Our graduates need to be able to see the loaded content of such words and find more neutral ways to describe people.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>A</FONT 5>S IS commonly agreed, "One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter".  But both descriptions are emotionally loaded.  Recently one of my former students came up with "Maori rights campaigner" to describe Ken Mair. I suggest that such a description is a much more neutral description than "radical". 
<P>
The sorts of changes that I am suggesting need to happen are not a major change in skills. Students still need good writing ability, shorthand, typing, and all the rest. What we need to change is the models of news we teach. Sooner or later the change will happen, whether we want it or not, and we must equip our students to meet that change. But I am going further than that and suggesting journalism educators need to actively work towards a change.
<P>
It will be obvious by now that changing the media and allowing people access to information so they can make up their own minds about issues not only affects the way Maori and Maori issues are presented in the news but affects all groups and sectors of society. One example of this is political reporting as we move into an MMP environment. Journalists who learnt their craft and honed their skills in a confrontational political environment are struggling to come to grips with how to report in the new environment. 
<P>
Indeed I have seen it suggested in the news media that politics will become boring under MMP.I suggest that the change to MMP will force political reporting to change. If MMP politics is not to deteriorate to a system of backroom deals, the media will have to become a forum for public debate, allowing everyone to have a say in the new era of consensus politics.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B><BR>
The media has to stop regarding itself as mere observers of society and events and place itself firmly where it really is -- an important functioning part of any society. The public has a right to know what is really happening in Aotearoa/New Zealand -- and not only see what the media is conditioned to tell them, or what the media wants to tell them. But for people to get the sort of information it deserves the media needs to work in a non-interpretive forum. We, as the educators of the industry's future workers and bosses, need  to  equip our graduates with the skills to handle the changing environment.

<Font size=3>IN THE PHILIPPINES -- the country that boasts the "freest press in Asia" -- the idea of organising a Press Council dates back to 1962, before Australia developed its own.
<P>
A Council was actually established three years later but lapsed after martial law was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, following a series of disputes between council members over rulings. 
<P>
During the 14 years of martial law, while some papers were closed or forcibly seized and run by publishing cronies of Marcos with a heavy emphasis on self-censorship, others, such as <B>Malaya</B> (Freedom), were steered by courageous journalists seeking to report the truth, and who believed that especially in times of crisis, journalists have a social responsibility to inform the people regardless of the pressures from authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.
<P>
The Philippine Press Council was revived in 1987 with a revised national code of ethics. The council's fortune mirrored the resurgence of a free press in the Philippines which regained its reputation in the region for both freedom - and excesses. The Philippines boasts the "freest press in Asia", with at one time 26 diverse national daily newspapers (now down to about nine). 
<P>
The Philippine council differs markedly from the British, Australian and New Zealand models -- it comprises newspaper in-house readers' advocates, or "ombudsmen". This is an enterprising approach to news media accountability that is now gaining ground in several countries. Their role will be discussed later.

During late 1990 I had an assignment on the island of Negros, the heart of the sugar-producing belt and a stronghold of the New People's Army rebels. My task was to interview a Filipino journalist in Bacolod City, the capital, who was well known for his exposes of corruption and skulduggery by powerful businessmen and their local senior government official accomplices. 
<P>
The reporter, Edgar Cadagat, showed me a miniature coffin he had just received in the mail for Christmas with a bullet and his photo inside.
<P>
The front window of his office was sandbagged -- just a few weeks earlier, would-be assassins had driven past and taken pot-shots at him through the plate glass window. But he survived and became something of a celebrity abroad as a champion of a free press. 
<P>
Incidentally, his news agency was known by the acronym Cobra which was rather an apt name given the potent journalistic sting wielded by Cadagat and his staff. 
</TD>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
<P>
<Font size=5>T</Font 5>HIS IS in a country which for several years claimed the dubious distinction of having the highest death rate of journalists in the world. And it is also a country that takes great pride in its press freedom.
<P>
In an article in the Philippine journalists' magazine <B>Diarista</B>, headlined "Philippine free press under siege", I discussed the case of Jose Burgos, a crusading journalist. The introduction read: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Jose 'Joe' Burgos, celebrated publisher-editor of the progressive tabloid daily <B>We Forum</B>, is the toast of Filipino journalists fighting to defend their threatened press freedoms. When he was arrested recently over allegations of libel in one of his columnist's articles, he refused to leave his office until he completed his editorial for the next day's paper - a hastily written piece about his arrest.</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
In his next editorial, Burgos was back with a more considered article entitled "Warrant of Arrest". "We're back behind our rusty but reliable typewriter, dear readers," he wrote, "after spending 20 hours under detention at the Quezon City police headquarters, courtesy of Judge Rica Lacson.
<P>
"Our arrest was all legal and the charges are for real, not trumped up. But the way the warrant of arrest was issued (without any warning even of the charges) by the judge makes me think that our judicial system needs to be placed under a microscope by legal minds."
<P>
</TR></TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
Burgos -- founder-publisher of the crusading <B>Malaya</B> newspaper during the Marcos dictatorship, former acting governor of Ilocos Sur province and the recipient of international press awards -- delivered a taped message after his colleagues gathered for the national congress of the Philippine Movement for Press Freedom (PMPF).
<P>
He called on journalists to strengthen their ranks in the face of growing threats to press freedom. Burgos said that if a <B>We Forum</B> editor could be arrested without warning, others in the media industry could also be jailed.
<P>
On the basis of the Burgos arrest, it seemed that anybody could be arrested without an investigation if a case was filed directly by a complainant before a municipal trial court. And the judge has the prerogative, the final say, on whether to issue an arrest warrant or not - even without having heard the side of the accused.
<P>
As Burgos said at the time, "We've got the axe falling down on our necks - all neat and legal."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>R</Font 5>IC VALMONTE, a leading labour rights lawyer, prominent radio commentator and president of the Philippine Movement for Press Freedom (PMPF), also urged journalists to become more involved in the issues of media freedom, censorship and professionalism.
<P>
He campaigned for the PMPF to strengthen its community alliance as part of its responsibility to the people "to whom the right of the freedom of the press really and ultimately belongs".
<P>
Founded in 1987 with only six charter members, the PMPF has expanded nationally with 20 member organisations from the print, radio and television industries as well as other press freedom advocates. 
<P>
Among the movement's affiliates are the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), the Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Media ng Pilipinas (KAMMPI), the Philippine Union of Broadcasters (PUB), Asosasyon ng mga Komentarista at Anawnser sa Pilipinas (AKAP) and the Press Photographers of the Philippines (PPP).
<P>
In December 1989, then President Corazon Aquino invoked emergency powers following an abortive nine-day military coup attempt which left more than 100 people dead.
<P>
The first casualty of the emergency powers appeared to be the free press which had bloomed since Marcos was ousted. At the time, journalists regarded the crisis as the gravest threat to their freedom since Marcos. 
<P>
Being a journalist is a high-risk occupation -- three Filipino journalists were killed during 1989, seven died in 1990, with a post-Marcos death average of six a year until Fidel Ramos became president. Although risks have continued for Filipino journalists, the civil wars in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia and in Somalia later became far more dangerous for reporters. 
<P>
The downside of the vibrant and open Philippine news media environment has been the sensationalist and lurid preoccupation of some tabloid-style newspapers and broadcasters with trivia, sex and crime. 
<P>
As noted University of the Philippines journalism educator Dr Crispin Maslog says, along with the country's media freedom has developed excesses of irresponsibility and a loss of credibility similar to that unleashed by the extreme British tabloids.
<P>
In his book <B>Communication, Values and Society</B>, Maslog laments: "In their effort to capture their share of the market, these newspapers try to outscoop each other. In their effort to be the first with the news, they sometimes sacrifice accuracy. In their attempt to attract readers, they often become sensational. In short, they do things which affect their major asset - their credibility." 
<P>
A national survey of the major roles of the Philippine press in mid-1987, about a year after the pro-democracy revolution, indicated that the biggest majority of readers (89.8 per cent) considered the Philippine press plays an important role in informing the public about society. 
<P>
This was followed by a perception that the Philippine press plays an important role in national development (85.6 per cent) and that it also plays an important role as critic/financial scrutineer of government (83.6 per cent).
<P>
Another high-ranking concern was that the Philippine press protects the interests of the common people (70.6 pr cent). The highest ranked negative perception was that the Philippine press prints too much gossip, rumor and unverified reports (44 per cent).
<P>
The high rating in credibility and performance was probably due, the report suggested, to the "reservoir of goodwill for the alternative press which valiantly fought the Marcos dictatorship during the last years of martial law". A similar survey now would most likely find a greater degree of cynicism or scepticism among the public. 
<P>
<Font size=5>T</Font 5>HE PHILIPPINE Press Council's work has been hampered by problems such as bitter divisions about its identity. Nevertheless one of the innovative features that contrasts with its equivalent in Australia, Britain, Fiji (recently established) and New Zealand is the concept of a readers' advocate, or "ombudsman". The idea of an ombudsman, borrowed from the United States was adopted in 1988.
<P>
The first 18 ombudsmen became the core members of the Philippine Press Council and were sworn into office by the chief justice. An ombudsman's role, according to the Organisation of Newspaper Ombudsmen, is to: 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Improve the fairness, accuracy and accountability of the newspaper.
<LI>Enhance its credibility.
<LI>Strive to improve its quality.
<LI>Make the newspaper aware of the concerns of, and issues in, the communities served by it.
</OL><P>
The ombudsman serves as an in-house critic, representing the reader who has suggestions, questions or complaints. The ombudsman also alerts the editor to all complaints, investigates them, and recommends corrective action when needed.
<P>
If journalism is to be professionalised, its practitioners must adhere strictly to a code of ethics. Since journalism in the Philippines largely follows the American tradition - including the first amendment -- the ethical code followed by Filipino journalists is largely similar to the United States.
<P>
In the Philippines, censure of journalists by their colleagues has been rare. But there has been an informal process for dealing with complaints. 
<P>
Compared to the Australian, New Zealand and Papua New Guinean codes of ethics, the Filipino one is a comprehensive and impressive document. Clause 10, for example, deals with unethical behaviour by editors and publishers, saying journalists should "only accept such tasks as are compatible with the integrity and the dignity of my profession, invoking the 'conscience clause' when duties imposed on me conflict with the voice of my conscience".
<P>
But Clause 11, in my experience in Manila, is rarely observed - it forbids the "ambush interview", frequently the only way to catch a senior government official.

The Melbourne Sunday Observer -- the original paper of that name which campaigned against Australian involvement as a US surrogate in the Vietnam War -- published photographs of the My Lai massacre in December 1969. It was prosecuted for "obscenity" but the charge was later dropped. 

<P>Michael Cannon was editor and David Robie chief subeditor at the time. The photographs were published by arrangement with Life Magazine and were later shown to Federal MPs in an attempt to change government support for the war. The photographs were published during a period when newspapers in Australia rarely published pictures of bodies. This is only a small selection of the photographs published by the Observer.
<P>
The Sunday Observer was the springboard for the launching of Nation Review in 1970.

<P>
 Photographs by Ronald Haeberle</B></Font =4>
<P>
<Font size=3><A NAME="Pinkville">My Lai </A>was one of nine hamlets clustered near the village of Song My, a name sometimes used also for the hamlets. GIs called the area "Pinkville" because it was coloured rose on their military maps and becuase the area had long been known as Viet Cong territory.
<P>
The action at My Lai received only a passing  mention at the weekly Saigon briefing in March of 1968. Elements of an American division had made contact with the enemy near Quang Ngai city and had killed 128 Viet Cong. There were a few rumours of civilian deaths, but when the US Army looked into them -- a month after the incident -- it found nothing to warrant disciplinary measures.
<P>
The matter might have ended there except for a former GI, Ron Ridenhour, now Californian university student. After hearing about My Lai from former comrades, he wrote letters to congressmen warning that "something dark and bloody" had taken place.
<P>
Now an officer has been charged with murder of "an unknown number of Oriental human beings" at My Lai, and 24 other men of C Company, First Battalion, 20th Infantry, are under investigation. The world is demanding to know what happened at My Lai, who ordered it, and whether or not US troops have committed similar acts in Vietnam.
<P>
Because of the court-martial, the Army will say little. The South Vietnamese government, which has conducted its own investigation, says that My Lai was "an act of war" and that any talk of atrocities is just Viet Cong propaganda.
<P>
This is not true.
<P>
The pictures in this newspaper by Ronald Haeberle, an Army photographer who covered the massacre, and reports in the past three weeks confirm a story of indisputable horror -- the deliberate slaughter of old men, women, children and babies.
<P>
<A NAME="Eyewitnesses">Eyewitness</A> reports indicate that the American troops encountered little -- if any -- hostile fire, found virtually no enemy soldiers in the village and suffered only one casualty -- a self-inflicted wound. The people of My Lai were simply gunned down.</Font 3>

<B>Western paradigms</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Australian journalists learn industry practices and priorities within a Western professional culture which tolerates if not encourages criticism of governments, corporations and prominent personalities. They usually endorse the  first  article of the code of professional conduct for the International Federation of Journalists which states that "Respect for the truth  and for the right of the public to the truth is the first duty of the journalist".
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Within Australia, the pursuit of the "truth" can be delayed and diverted by near monopolies of media ownership, and state and federal government interventions as well as defamation, contempt of court and security legislation imposing "D" notices.  As local media organisations are absorbed into transnational media entertainment corporations, commercial considerations can also be seen to influence international news coverage. Hugh Menzies told Intersections with Asia  that a growing number of today's media empires were owned by companies whose managements were not all that interested in the truth-seeking aspect of journalism:
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<!--Begin quote table-->
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH=330>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=40><P></TD>
<TD>
"The new owners want their empires to have a piece of the Asian business action and are not about to let their news operations, which contribute little or no profits, mess things up by revealing too many naked emperors. 
The full ramifications of this development are yet to play out. But there has been at least one straw in the wind. During the opening ceremonies of the Atlantic Olympics, NBC commentator Bob Costas make a passing remark about China's less-than-scintillating human rights record. Other commentators subsequently discussed charges of drug-taking by Chinese swimmers, observing that their performances at the Games fell far below previous efforts when drug-testing was less strict. Beijing complained and NBC subsequently apologised."
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<!--End quote table-->
<br>
Menzies said that  NBC was now owned by General Electric which had a massive investment stake in China. "News coverage does not contribute much to GE's bottom line and, today, bottom lines matter more than prestige," Menzies said. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This  conservative view of news can be seen to coincide with the sort of development journalism defined by some Asian governments who see the "bottom line" of nation building as more important than truth seeking. In countries where the business affairs of the ruling elite have become intertwined with  government privilege, it can be only a short step from censoring in the national interest to adjusting news agendas to benefit profits. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Indeed, the Singapore Straits Times Training Manager, Shiva Arasu, argued that free speech may be more fiction than reality, even in western countries whose own press criticise Singapore's media controls. Ms Arasu said that freedom of the press was already moderated by government intervention and entirely contained by the self interests of media owners: 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<!--Begin quote table-->
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH=330>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=40><P></TD>
<TD>
"The degree of freedom enjoyed is determined by political and commercial considerations. Every newspaper and TV station determines for itself how much freedom it can possibly enjoy. This tradition and practice is universal, both in the east as well as the west. In recent years commercial considerations have become more prominent. Journalism is a business."
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<!--End quote table-->
<br>
Ms Arasu may be correct, in so far as that journalists everywhere are under pressure to self censor what they learn. Yet stark differences remain in practice between  countries where freedom of speech is given at least lip service and more authoritarian regimes where it is questioned or suppressed. Dissident journalists may find it difficult to find a job in an Australian mainstream media obsessed with economic rationalism, contemptuous of non parliamentary political debate and infatuated with infotainment. But in Singapore, journalists have been forced to write theatrical reviews to skirt the official censors and avoid the threat of criminal libel. In Indonesia, the Independent Journalist Union was disbanded, activists jailed and critical magazines banned. China, meanwhile may have been making a transition to a mixed economy but there were few signs that its aging clique of rulers were ready to consider mixed opinions. According to Reporters sans Frontiers, China had 26 journalists in jail in 1994.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Democratic Ideals</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Hong Kong journalists who are about to make the transition between two such systems are keenly aware of what it could mean for their work. There is already concern that Beijing may be more ready than London to enforce moribund but still repressive colonial legislation which has never been erased from the Hong Kong statute books. Hong Kong Journalists Association Chair, Mak YT, said journalists were already under pressure to conform:
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<!--Begin quote table-->
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH=330>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=40><P></TD>
<TD>
"While the clandestine nature of self-censorship means that it is difficult to  pin down actual examples, there has at the same time been little evidence  to suggest that the situation has improved. Television documentaries vilified by the Chinese government have been bought and then never broadcast, popular but critical TV programs have been axed, and critical  newspaper columns and cartoons suddenly dropped. There are many reasons for self-censorship. Proprietors might wish to maintain good relations with the Chinese government to ensure post-1997 survival and a stake in the huge China market. Front-line journalists may exercise self-censorship to maintain a harmonious relationship with their contacts. .....Given the close relations between China and Hong Kong, Beijing is unlikely to allow Hong Kong a free hand if the political situation on the mainland becomes more tense. The media tends to become the first casualty in any such situation." 
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<!--End quote table-->
<br>
The pragmatic view of journalism runs directly counter to codes of ethics supported by journalists in Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States, Thailand, the Philippines Hong Kong and even Malaysia. In theory at least, they all endorse the professional roles of journalists who seek to inform and educate their publics. The "journalism is a business" approach also directly undercuts some of the radical founding notions of development journalism; a journalism theory which sought to take reporters and editors beyond liberal rhetoric and make them agents of genuine social reform.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Kunda Dixit, Asia Pacific Director of the Interpress News service, no longer calls himself a development journalist. But he argues consistently for an interventionist role by journalists seeking social justice:

"Poverty, population growth, climate change and the loss of cultural and  biological diversity are such serious challenges to future life on the planet that reporting them calls for a new breed of journalists--journalists without mental borders who have the energy and vision to move beyond  the traditional classroom concepts of reporting and writing. Reporters who do not just report, but look behind the headlines to examine cause  and effect. They must be reporters with wider horizons who constantly explore regional or international linkages to national problems. Journalists shouldn't just hold a mirror to society, but be a part of its reflection. And most importantly, journalists must feel part of the societies and the planet that they write about and care for it."
</TD></TR>

<br>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Australian and other Western journalists must recognise that they can longer insult Asian sensibilities by intention or just plain ignorance. They should accept and seek more Asian sources to broaden the context of stories which must reflect the region's changing economic and political realities.  However, if they are to remain true to democratic ideals they must not  concede to  demands to withhold their notions of the truth so that business as usual might benefit.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It still may be that the public interest is not the same as the interests of governments or indeed corporations which seek to entertain and only incidentally inform. Journalists may have to consider the needs and welfare of their audiences. They might remember that the views of the elites and their demands for preferential reporting will not necessarily be globally beneficial.  Hard experience may suggest quite the reverse. As Teodoro Locsin pointed out during this conference, Western journalists should guard against confusing Asian sensitivities with the demands of their rulers. Journalists who abandoned their ethics and conceded to such censorship were not doing ordinary people any favours, he said:

"There are things uniquely Asian, distinctive ways of living and coping. But rather than being opposed to such values as free speech, open assembly and democratic elections, these things find purer expression  under such values. I want to know what my Indonesian brother and Malaysian sister really  think about his country, my country, the rest of the world. I do not care to know what the President's daughter-in-law, stepping out of a Paris boutique, says the people of her country believe. How would she know? "

This speech may have come too late. The notion of Asian values has already taken quite a beating lately. But the views echoed by CNN regarding James Riady's contribution to the Clinton campaign show we still need a few more nails on the coffin of Asian values.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Evidently speaking only with billionaire Chinese, CNN reported that Chinese in Hong Kong are wondering: Why all the fuss? William Overholt of Bankers Trust in Hong Kong dismissed the contributions as "pin money to these guys." But of course. The Cali cartel would think the same.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The Far Eastern Economic Review quoted an Indonesian businessman, Sofyan Wanandi: "I think we are all surprised, including the Riadys, by the [adverse] American reaction. Making such donations in Indonesia is very common." 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Common to whom, and who was surprised?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
As an Asian, I'll tell you what's common in Asia: Asian businessmen acting surprised and innocent when caught in the act of bribery and tax evasion. The ordinary Asian knows bribery is wrong, and common sense, says Jim Mann of the LA. Times, demands to know: If giving favours is an Asian custom, why is it only to people in high places? Evidently because the favour is expected to be returned.

And Ian Buruma, in the 50th anniversary issue of Time Asia asked, "If democratic values are so uncongenial to Asians, why then did Asians from Rangoon to Seoul, from Manila to Beijing, demand them?" These smart questions were long overdue.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But what really hurt so-called Asian values has been the flat rejection of them by the very peoples on whose behalf they were invoked, and whose real aspirations they seek to cancel.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In the past five years, quintessentially Asian societies  have taken the strongest stand for the most basic Western values: decency in the treatment of fellowmen, honesty in the conduct of government, accountability for official wrongs, rendering justice...
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Japan ousted prime ministers for such characteristically Asian behaviour of men in power as taking money from Lockheed and having fun with good-time girls.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
India is intent on punishing its ex-prime minister in this life according to a criminal code, and not in succeeding ones by the laws of karma.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Burma's military rulers are held in check by one woman who stands above them on a single democratic election many years ago.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
And Malaysia, despite its advocacy of Asian values, fired the trade minister who brazenly declared that kickbacks are integral to doing business in her country.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I refer you to China, which shoots corrupt government officials in the perverse tribute that a vice-riddled government pays to the Western virtue of honesty in the public service.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Korea put two presidents on trial, condemning one to death and the other to life in prison, for tyranny and corruption. Transgressions not so severely punished in the West since the execution of Charles I and the impeachment of Warren Hastings.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I speak of Pakistan, which threw out a military government in the name of democracy and is now celebrating the ouster of its democratically elected ruler for nepotism and corruption. And the new Pakistan government has imposed austere Calvinist restrictions on official privileges that, one might argue, conflict with the opulence traditionally associated with the Orient. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
What are these Asian values that time and action have exposed as hollow? You will not find a definitive list. For that is their marked characteristic: elusiveness to the understanding but readiness to come to the defence of official Asian abuses.

<B>(Reply to unrecorded question)</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
When the  in covering the Timorese problem, it's true, our reporters and editors will simply say that Indonesia's actions towards Timor is like this and that is basically to suppress the Timorese Freedom Movement. That's because we find it very hard as journalists to penetrate Indonesia and find out if in fact the people there have any opinion of the Timor problem. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
We're very well aware that since the issue is not even raised by the Indonesian government with their own people it's just the army acting on its own, and we don't have the kind of freedom of speech, we're really in a quandary. Are we to assume that silence gives consent and that all Indonesians agree with it? But to give, to make, silence give consent you should at least know what you are consenting to by your quietude. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There are also real problems: to what extent Indonesians feel very strongly about their territorial claim, and I can understand as a Filipino how territory becomes very strong emotional issue (we have our claims to Saba of course).
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 1</B><BR>
I just wanted to ask one of the issues you didn't speak of, or I don't think you referred it, was the issue of self censorship if you're a journalist operating in one of the Asian, in some of the Asian countries. That seems to be very strong. how difficult is it to cross that border of self-censorship which sometimes becomes really the only obstacle: the government doesn't have to go any further than just creating this status quo, and the journalists will already begin to self censor.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Theodore Locsin</B><BR>
I've never been a foreign journalist, I've never taken the risks they take. I understand in places like Burma you really have to exercise self-censorship to get out of the country. But there was one I don't know if it qualifies, you can tell me if it's irrelevant when the issue of Ramos Horta entering the Philippines and offending Suharto came up, as a Filipino and as a journalist with very strong liberal feelings, I was of course in favour of Ramos Horta entering. But also as a Filipino who knows that the Indonesian military, the Indonesian government in the Philippines have for some reason I cannot fathom, always had very close cooperation. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The Indonesians have never taken advantage of our weakness, they did not take part in the Moslem secessionist rebellion. In fact, they guarded our southern borders. They did not train our military to suppress dissent. I must say that some of our officers went to army school in the United States and learnt some methods of interrogation there, but oddly enough, the officers, the Filipino officers who studied in Indonesia are our most professional officers. And they only confine themselves in the field of battle. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So, when I had to do an editorial, one of my editorial writers wrote a very strong editorial against the government for banning Ramos Horta because it makes us like the Indonesians, then he was absent the next day and I had to write the next editorial. I had to be true to myself and I realised that, I gave an editorial that had everyone scratching their heads and wondering if, you know, there was schizophrenia in the office [laughter]. I really didn't know how to handle it, frankly. There was of course a cop-out by saying 'let him come after the APEC.' I cannot say that I resolved it satisfactorily.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 2. Jefferson Lee</B><BR>
On this issue, could, I don't know how thoroughly you read Australian newspapers, but one could take the somewhat schizophrenic editorial in the Australian newspaper this morning, which defends the Malaysian government's, and justifies, the Malaysian government's expulsion of people who are trying to have a peaceful conference just to discuss the East Timor issue, but then in the defence of that editorial it comes out towards the end and says however the reality of bilateral relationships within ASEAN means that such freedoms will not be tolerated and this is regrettable. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
My question is: In terms of Australia, which perceives itself as having perhaps as liberal and free and diverse media opinions as anywhere in the region except for perhaps the Philippines, do you think these attempts to defend Asian solidarity or Asian values or censorship within Asia an attempt to grovel and cajole on the one hand, or an attempt to be diplomatically nice to other countries in a sense, or do you think it's an attempt to invoke the same sort of censorship here in Australia that exists elsewhere in the region?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Theodore Locsin</B><BR>
Again, in the position I found myself in I can't be self-righteous here. But I think that in a situation like that Malaysians Filipinos were the ones actually who were thrown out 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 2. Jefferson Lee</B><BR>
The question is about Australian media values ... using Asian values to suppress ...
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Theodore Locsin</B><BR> 
The only thing I could say is that if your values are liberal and you are a journalist and you can only function under liberal values, then I would defend those values and I would judge Malaysian behaviour according to those values and say 'this is wrong'. I'm certain you are going to pick up the values of a dictatorship and import them here and say they're right. That was the position we took in the case of the Sy..., where they hanged that maid. I said well, that's fine. If the Singaporeans insist on rushing to judgment and stringing up that woman, let them do what they feel like. But what we have the power to do is to make Singaporeans extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome in our country because we are a democracy. And that we should insult them every day if we have to in our papers, which is what we did. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now they can do what they want on their end in fact they were insulting us in their papers but I have no obligation to repeat their insults or repeat their position on my side and say it's right. Because I happen to believe that there are absolute values. It's part of my profession. I have to believe there is a right and a wrong. A fact and a falsehood. That's the best I can do.

. . . liberty, freedom, democracy: they're wonderful ideals and I don't think anyone in this room here would deny that. But, coming from Singapore, all I can say is I can give you the Singapore perspective. And the title of my paper is essentially 'Journalism, time to cheer' and while I do not wish to deny anyone the right to hold on to what they see as the absolute truth, all I want to say is, what I say here is essentially what I see to be my truth. Before I go into my paper I would like to thank the Australian government for inviting my company, Singapore Press Holdings, to take part in this conference. My company published all the newspapers in Singapore and almost all the magazines. Our main paper is theStraits Times. It's my great pleasure to be here. Everyone I've met has been warm, wonderful, despite the current debate that's now raging in Australia. I won't go into the debate except to say that just before I left the Straits Times reported that Singaporeans buying holiday packages to Australia is up 10 per cent [laugh]. That's the good news. Now the not-so-good news for Australia is: will the Singapore government let the Special Broadcasting Service off the hook for implying, in its TV show 'Dateline', that Singapore had links with the druglord through its investments in Mienma. Maybe, but not likely. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The Singapore government is famous (or notorious, depending on which side you're on) for being relentless for forcing the media to correct any perception it creates which the government sees as wrong. It has taken action against several publications in the last nine years: the Asian Wall Street Journal, Far Eastern Economic Review; Time Magazine, and others. Some have been sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars, others have had their circulation restricted, cut back to only a fraction of their sales. In addition, these restricted copied can be distributed only if they do not carry any ads. You see the Singapore government believes commercial considerations rule journalism as in any other business. Is it right? The record shows that today many news organisations accept its demand for a right of reply, without any editing of its reply. But this tough and uncompromising attitude is not a recent phenomenon. It has a long history and it can be traced essentially to two momentous events in Singapore's media history. The first one happened 35 years ago. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It was a time of great turbulence in Singapore. The editor-in-chief of the Straits Times was a gentleman called Lesley Hoffman. He and Mr Li Quan Yu - I don't think I need to tell you who Li Quan Yu is - were embroiled in a very public row. Mr Li was then the leader of the People's Action Party and he was trying to get into power. He also wanted a then Federation of Malaya to take us in as a member state. The Straits Times, Mr Li felt, was not helping his cause. So on May 18, 1959, he issued a warning. He would lock up any newsman who caused a strain in the relationship between Singapore and Malaya. Four days later the editor-in-chief of the Straits Times Lesley Hoffman, wrote a stinging page one editorial against Li. In bold headlines he said 'Bird of passage, I stay', he declared. A fortnight later, Li Quan yu's People's Action Party was elected into power in Singapore. Hoffman left immediately for Kuala Lumpar. The Straits Times for the first time is in its111 year history was published outside Singapore, in Kuala Lumpar. This went on until 1965 when Singapore left Malaysia and became independent. The paper was split. The Straits Times returned to  Singapore and Malaysia had the New Straits Times. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This 1959 row was described in great detail by Mr Li in a newspaper interview he gave two years ago. He said in his interview, 'I said to Hoffman, "Look, I'm putting my life at stake. If I lose and the communists win I am in real trouble. You are sitting on the sidelines tapping away on your typewriter. What gives you this God-given right? Who gave you this right? I am seeking this right, and when I get in, I'm going to tell you how you should not run your paper. I won that right," he said.' The Straits Times paid dearly for that bad judgment. It took a long time for the hostility and suspicion which the pioneer PAP  leaders had felt towards the Straits Times and newsmen to dissipate. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now, more than 30 years later, ironically the Straits Times is often jeered for being so much of the PAP establishment. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The other event took place in the 70s. Two newspapers closed down because the PAP government said, they have allowed foreign interest to use their pages to stir up the ground because Singapore was doing too well. On May 14 1971 the Eastern Sunclosed down. It could not go on because its senior editorial team had resigned after Li Quan Yu accused it of being involved in a black operation in Singapore. He also said the paper had received $4 mill from Chinese communist agents in Hong Kong. The papers' chairman was Datin Okow who lived in Hong Kong. Now, five days later a second paper, also in English, the Singapore Herald, said it needed $4.5 mill to keep on going. Again, the backer of this paper was from Hong Kong, Ms Oshien. She said she would not be pumping any more money into the paper. She had already spent half a million dollars on it. Eight days later the Singapore Heraldclosed down. In two weeks Singapore went from having three English newspapers to one English newspaper in the morning market.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
These two events had a tremendous impact not only on journalism in Singapore but on journalists especially. Mr Li Quan Yu made good his word. He made it clear that the First Amendment, right to freedom of the press, has no place in Singapore. Singapore's constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression is subject to certain restrictions. What does it mean for journalists? What it means is, you have a role to play but you have to stay out of partisan role in active politics. At the same time you need to go beyond plain reporting. You have to shape public opinion to help build up a national consensus on important issues. So daily, in producing our papers, we walk a tightrope. Doing a constant balancing act between serving our readers, giving then what we think they want and what they should have, and serving the national interest.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><A HREF="../bios/biosindex.html#MENZIES">Hugh D. Menzies</A>, consulting international  business journalist with a special interest in the Asia Pacific region, New York.</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Good morning.  I probably should give you a little personal background so
you know where my remarks are coming from.  I'm Australian by birth and
citizenship but spent a number of my formative years in Asia, where my
Trade Commissioner father helped rebuild Australian trade with Japan after
World War II and restart her trade with China during a meeting with Premier
Chou en lai in early 1956.   In 1961, I moved to New York and have
practised business journalism for most of the time since, writing and editing
for the likes of The New York Times, Business Week, Fortune, and
International Business magazine.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Based as so much of it is on the eastern seaboard of the U.S., most notably
in New York, the American media still tends to an Atlantic bias in its
coverage.  At Business Week and International Business, in particular, I
successfully pushed for increased coverage of the Pacific Rim, including
Australia.  If you think that was a snap, should note that until every recently
most  Americans thought Australia was a small country in the middle of
Europe and, with the obvious exception of Vietnam, knew even less about
Southeast Asia.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So I'm what you might call a reasonably  informed and very interested
outsider.  It is from that perspective my remarks are made. Other speakers
will give you far more specific and informed information about operating
within the region.  But on the theory that those who are close to the forest
sometimes cannot see if for the trees, I'll have a crack at describing the
forest from a distance
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
When I began practising business journalism in the mid-1960s, it was still
very much a back of the book activity.  Politics and social issues dominated
the front pages.  Even sports got better play than business news.  The Wall
Street Journal was still very much a trade paper.  Business Week, Forbes,
and Fortune were largely trade magazines.  TV covered business not at all. 
The vital issues of the day were The Cold War abroad and Civil Rights at
home.   And this in the country where it was said "the business of America is
business."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The picture was even bleaker abroad, save for the Financial Times of
London and a couple of magazines like the Economist and the Far East
Economic Review.  Take Australia, a nation where business news gets
more coverage than most places.  In 1970, I returned home for the first time
in 12 years and was bowled over by vitality of Sydney, in particular. A mining
boom was in full swing, corporate asset stripping was all the rage, the
business scene was even more exciting than New York.  Besides Sydney
was drop-dead gorgeous.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
A man could live here, I thought, and started talking to executives in the
media about starting a business magazine along the lines of Business
Week, for whom I then labored.   No, they said, not enough interest.  The
Financial Review meets the necessary demand. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This story was much the same elsewhere.

<B>Other speaker</B><BR>
I'd just add that in mirroring that there are more sides to that story. A significant number of journalists in the west don't like drawing attention to the intellectual property breaches in China because they're part of the geopolitical school espoused by people like, say, Henry Kissinger. 'Don't play these stories up because it'll ruin the overall relationship with China,' and the overall relationship with China is more important than some fuss over intellectual property rights. And I have vested interests in this in case one day my writing or singing or performing [laughter] is stolen by Chinese state media [laughter]. I think even on that issue there's nothing like a uniform western media approach in which only the business interests of particular western companies is being promoted.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Speaker 1</B><BR>
I think just to comment on that, I think that's true but I think the media's so diverse that the story gets out regardless of who wants to control it, the Realpolitik of: one group is trying to play it down, some other group picks it up, and everything is so competitive that finally you're forced to go with it if it's a real story. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question 1 John Tebbutt</B><BR> 
From stories that don't get covered to stories that plan to be covered ad nauseam, I'd like to just to take up on your comment on the conflicts of east and west values -the way that you've out it Brian -and ask if you've had any thoughts about how the Pauline Hansen issue has developed in Australia and the role that was identified for the media within that, and the very active role that was taken in dampening down the story, as many people in a range of areas from broadcasters and politicians and also other media took up that call in some way. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
For me it's been one of the first times that kind of public diplomacy aspect has really come out in a very public way. And I'm wondering if you have any comments about how national interests develop in Australia around stories like that.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Brian Toohey </B><BR>
I should by the way somehow or other orally put the phrase 'Asian values' in a quotation marks, I'm not suggesting ... I think there's a separate section in this conference about it. I'm not saying every Asian country reflects Asian values sort of summed up from the Singapore School or Le Puan Yu's version of Confucianism in which the ruled have to obey the rulers and the rulers have seemingly no obligations to the ruled. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But in relation to the Pauline Hansen thing, there's certainly been a lot of talk -including talk from the main speaker last night at the dinner -that the media has some sort of obligation to dampen down that story because it'll harm Australias trade interests in Asia. But equally I think the media recognised that it wasn't simply Pauline Hansen speaking, she was in fact representing a significant viewpoint within Australia (if you can believe the opinion poll surveys) and that it'd be very foolish of the media to ignore the sort of attitudes that she was reflecting. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I certainly agree that there's been considerable suggestions that the media should down play this etc, but if they were to do so I think they would be ignoring a significant development in Australian politics.

Good afternoon. I have been asked to speak about the globalisation of international news services. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Well this is nothing new. It has been going on a for a long time ever since my own organisation, The Associated Press (AP) was founded in 1848 when six New York newspapers got together to share the cost of covering out of town news. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
At that time the newly invented telegraph had increased the speed and volume of news coverage in America, but foreign news remained a problem.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In those days before the transatlantic telegraph cable was laid, news from Europe was gathered from ships arriving at Halifax Nova scotia, their first land fall in America.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In 1849 Daniel Craig became APs first foreign correspondent sending news gathered from the steam ships at Halifax to Boston and New York, first by carrier pigeon and pony express and later by wire as telegraph lines extended north.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In 1851 AP opened its first bureaus in Washington and Albany, New York. When the telegraph cable was laid to London AP opened a bureau there.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In 1875 AP established the first leased wire dedicated exclusively to news transmission, linking New York and Washington and carrying up to 20,000 words a day.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Expansion then as now, followed improved communications.

Today, The Associated Press has 1,786 member newspapers in the United States, and 6,000 broadcast/tv outlets. It has 8,500 subscribers outside the U.S. It has 236 bureaus world wide, including 93 international bureaus and 3,500 employees. Our news goes out in 5 languages.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
AP remains a not for profit cooperative of the member newspapers who pay for their news and photo on a formula based on their circulations.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
AP has moved from hand written dispatches, carrier pigeons, to morse code, the first leased telegraph service, photo transmission by wire, then to satellite, digital delivery, radio, television and now the internet. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
AP coverage of The presidential elections last week went on the Internet as a multi-media package of text, graphics, photos, audio and video.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Although AP and its competitors had bureaus around the world before world war 11, coverage was restricted by the communications available, and the cost.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
International telephone calls were rare and expensive. Cables were charged by the word, which led to an abbreviated form of writing called cablese as a cost saving measure.

<B>(Last part of answer to unrecorded question)</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
. . . the younger journalists coming through have grown up with computers in journalism schools and are seriously into the technology, often ahead of AP. They buy their own gear and a lot of them have been on Internet since it began. It's just impossible to function without it. If we introduce new software or new hardware, we run training programs to make sure everybody's up to speed on it. But technology is journalism these days. It's the same as, in the past, journalists could get away with the typewriter -could still get away with two finger typing on a computer -but I know journalists who've never seen a typewriter. So the technology is here and it's been here a long time. We introduced computers in 1982. So it's no mystery, and it's an integral part of journalism and should be an integral part of journalism training.

<B>Questioner 1 Peter Hutchings</B><BR>
 My name's Peter Hutchings, I teach at the University of Western Sydney at Hawkesbury, in Humanities. I have a question which in a way picks up on some of the issues raised this morning. And I think both of your address of agency technologies talks to this. There seems to be an interesting conflict or potential conflict between the business of news and news values that you've got -I realise there's a different between agency and normal journalism in a certain way -but the emphasis on processing product for clients at higher and higher rates, together with some of the things we heard this morning about the dominant importance of journalism as an economic enterprise. I'm wondering where the content question comes into this and where content questions starts to rub up against that primary speed-of-processing/ business-oriented aspect of contemporary media goes.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Zainoa Sulaiman</B><BR> 
The exact reason why I think even for the ..., even for a writer to go into the business side to support the normal news operation. I'm not sure whether AP might agree, but without the other business we're talking about we cannot sustain. So in order to practice the normal news operations we need the support from the other news writing [Reuter???] business. Otherwise on news -as I explained earlier -if you go direct just the news, and hope to sell news just as news without, you know, repackaging as information, then I don't think we can survive. That's as simple as that.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Peter O'Loughlin</B><BR>  
I'd agree with that, but also -I'm not quite sure where you're coming from: are you suggesting that by increasing financial business coverage that we're in some way jeopardising the integrity of the news report? I mean, what's the point?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 1 Peter Hutchings</B><BR> 
I'm thinking of the way in which the emphasis on news production as a business may lead to the displacement of other kinds of values within news production . . . This morning . . . two of them spoke very much about how important business was, in the context of this region, how certain news decisions should be made with respect to larger national economic imperatives, and my question was sort of picking up in the context of a business where providing information is your business; where there's potential for conflict between other kinds of values to do with news media and the production of a product (which also happens to be news) -whether there may be conflict there. Whether that question of content, which you said you could talk about, would address those sorts of questions.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin</B><BR>  
Could you give an example? You're being a bit vague with words like 'values' and things. Could you give us an example.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 1 Peter Hutchings</B><BR> 
Well, in a way what I've got in mind is the very fact that we can speak about the importance of the business of journalism, the economic importance of journalism as it was spoken about this morning, and the economic importance of journalism is considered to be a universal value. The fact that all news production corporations are corporations is considered universal, unarguable, but questions about journalistic integrity, responsibility for telling all the news, are seen to somehow be local values. and not universal values.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin</B><BR>   
No, I . . . well, you do get local changes, some countries have different cultural histories that don't include a whole history of 400 years of print journalism, as everybody would know. But an organisation like my own, and that's the only one I can speak for, would see absolutely no difference between the way it would treat a business story or it would treat a general news story. It has to be done, it's got to be credible, and it's got to be true. And I don't see that there's any conflict at all. But in the end result news is a business, and that's why newspapers are in the business of news. And the number of newspapers is shrinking, the market for the news that providers like Bnahma and AP and Reuters and the other in the newspaper field, is shrinking. So, you have to find other sources of revenue. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So, you diversify into things like television, audio -we've got I think 600 audio stations in the States that take the audio services we provide - and this is what we call 'non-traditional AP business'. Traditional is text, non-tradition is the other. And the revenue that we're getting from that side of the business is increasing, because it's replacing the revenue we're losing on the print side. So there is a conflict in that I suppose if you see it that way, but we wouldn't sacrifice the integrity of the news report, whether it's financial or the other, simply for the buck. And I don't think too many others would either.

In the county of Fairfax outside Washington DC, the cable TV system carries 120 channels to every home. There are three weather channels, the incoming and departures at Dulles Airport nearby and even a channel that divides up the screen into four parts and shows all four national networks simultaneously. Flying at 35,000 feet above Vietnam, yiou can now watch breaking news on teletype on your personal video screen: there has just been a fire in the Channel Tunnel.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Welcome to the peek-a-boo world of modern electronic media: a virtual universe of round-the-clock music, non-stop news as it happens, day-and-night movies and hourly weather micro-forecasts. In this "empty-v" age it is becoming increasingly difficult to tell the difference between a soap opera and a courtroom drama happening that instant on the other side of the world. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
And as it shrouds the world in a fog of uniformity, television's globalness casts a dark shadow over fragile cultures that cling to the edge of time. This new global civilisation as propagated by flashy multinational broadcasting is a juggernaut tearing through diversity, squishing native wisdom into a flattened gray mass.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Information, or what editors in newsrooms in Atlanta or London decide is worthwile for the world to know, is mixed up with amusement to be beamed to all corners of the globe. This is not just the "end of history", it is the end of geography. No place is too near or too far. Distance disappears, and if the line between real and unreal gets blurred, the defect is not in your set. When you can switch from genocide in Rwanda to Natural Born Killers on HBO at the flick of a remote, where does voyeurism end and escapism begin? The bluish aura of the cathode rays have hypnotised the world into a consumerist, free market, materialistic trance.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Even if channel surfing viewers can find a news bulletin amidst all the background radiation of talk shows, mini series and sports and then stay tuned long enough to inform themselves about what is really happening in the world around them, audio visual news is becoming less and less real.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The home screen is the world's new reality check. Whatever falls beyond the penumbra of its narrow beam does not exist. If an event has not happened on television news, it has not happened--a government falling in Togo hasn't fallen if there isn't a camera there to record it. And unless it is a "slow news day" not much else besides Bosnia, Chechnya or the Olympics actually "happen". The rest of the media, radio and newspapers, take their cue from television. It used to be the other way around. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Infotainment is a commodity, and today's news coverage reflects market forces and the desire of media moghuls to rule the airwaves. The public service role of media is being usurped by businesses for whom the definition of news is very simple: news has to sell, otherwise it is not news. Media companies have therefore become answerable to shareholders, and not to the public interest.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Media globalisation has meant media "gobble-isation". It is not a coincidence that news businesses are being taken over by conglomerates that also own entertainment empires. Disney owns ABC, Time-Warner has bought CNN. News networks are owned by corporations that also own cartoon channels and vast archives of Holywood films. What it means is that fewer and fewer people control the information we get. These few people, then, are setting the agenda for the rest of us--how we should behave, what we should buy, which credit card we must use, what we should wear, what movies we can't afford to miss, what we should eat, what we must smoke. They are telling us Saddam Hussain is a crook, free trade is good, it is OK for five percent of the world's population to consume half its resources.

<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It's a great honour to have a chance to share my experience with you. I'd like to thank our host for giving us this opportunity.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Before I came here, I asked myself a couple of basic questions. Regionwise, what actually is our newspaper's selling point? What real difference has The Nation made?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I realised that these seemingly simple questions are not that easy to answer. After all, journalists elsewhere are doing the same things that we have been doing. Searching for truth, attacking bad governments, fighting for people who suffer and so on.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
I have to confess that I have not discovered the exact answers to my own questions. But possible clues may lie in our attitude and policy, which I would like to talk about at this conference.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
The Nation has been serving as a forum for people who cannot freely write, speak and express their straightforward opinions in their own countries. This role was adopted partly because of our geography. Thailand is surrounded by Burma, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. Those countries are either under totally repressive regimes or experiencing fledgling freedom. As their closest neighbours, we consider it our responsibility to bring to the world their political, economic and social developments, as well as the voices that are locally muffled.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
For example, Aung San Suu Kyi has been writing for our publication. Her contributions - which touch upon a wide range of topics - have been steady even during recent threats and occasional clampdowns by the junta. We are a channel through which this brave woman has communicated with the outside world.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Burmese in exile have also had their voices heard through The Nation. Our stand on Burma has always clashed with Asean's official policy. But our attitude on this is uncompromising. The term "neighbour" doesn't mean the neighbouring government, but the neighbouring people. And if the neighbouring people are suffering, we will do as much as we can to help them.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br> 	
We would like to do more for the people of Burma, but, unfortunately, all of our journalists have been banned from that country.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
One Asean journalist who is ostracised in his own country is serving as our correspondent. His reports and views have been constantly published by our newspaper.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Apart from Burma, our stand on East Timor has been a subject of government criticism. I admit that sometimes we get too emotional. But there is definitely no such thing as a conspiracy. As an English language newspaper which can reach out beyond the Thai border, what we do is to act as a voice of people who badly need it, who have resorted to peaceful means in their struggle.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
East Timor Nobel peace prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta and dissident Indonesian academic George Aditjondro, now exiled in Australia, have been contributors to The Nation.

<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 1. Annamaria Anton.</B> <BR>
I'd like to address a question to Kunda Dixit. My name's Annamaria Anton, freelance journalist. Yesterday after various presentations it seems apparent that the economic imperatives of newsmaking, helped along by increasing global technology, is gaining ground over the higher ideals of the craft of journalism. How confident is IPS as a news media organisation, from a business point of view, that it will still continue to have a market out there, that there will be buyers of its alternative news products?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit</B> <BR>
It's the best time to be in the business of alternative journalism, because so much of it is mainstream. If you can fill that niche and fill it well, professionally, credibly, in an original fashion, then the people will subscribe, as we have found in the Asia-Pacific in the last ten years that we've started out from zero. We're now -we used - fairly widespread. In fact, we've stopped calling ourselves alternative news. And the dividing line between alternative and not alternative is crumbling. One of our best clients is The Nation, and I think our philosophy is very similar: how do you have a point-of-view journalism without sacrificing credibility. And I think both The Nation and IPS are doing it very well. That's our best selling point.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Q.1 AA</B><BR>
Just to get a much more idea of the sort of selling potential as well by IPS news wire source: say, compared to AAP and Reuter. Can you talk a little bit about how much main media organisation in Asia -print, radio and electronic media -that use IPS? besides Thailand?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit</B><BR>
Nowadays it's not really enough to say how many media clients you have, because through the internet you know, who knows? Anyone with a phone and a PC can log in and read your stuff. You don't know. In fact it's becoming a problem in selling. But the new technology has given us much more access to, made it cheaper, to deliver our news. The reason we were outpriced by the big boys was that we could not afford to sell our service through the teleprinter networks, which are very expensive. Now the cost of delivery is almost zero. And so we just have to add the price of the product and shoot it off to your client. And also it's become much easier to automatically categorise what your client needs. If someone needs only human rights, they get only human rights; they need environment, Asia Pacific, they get only environment, Asia Pacific. So yeah, the technology has made it much more possible to sell alternative news than before. We have about 40 to 45 clients in the region. Worldwide about 1500, media clients. But non-media? who knows.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 2. Chris [?]</B> <BR>
My name's Chris [?], I'm a freelancer. My question's to the gentleman from The Nation, which is a newspaper I've had a tremendous amount of respect for ever since May 1992 when I was in Bangkok during the uprising there, and the Thai print media did such a professional courageous job it was extraordinary example of the best journalism that really puts to shame a lot of the sycophantic nonsense that goes on in a lot of the western press. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But my question -I've got a couple of questions -one of which you may not like to answer. Which is about the Thai monarchy. Hugh Menzies mentioned at the end of his speech this morning that it won't be long before the press starts dishing out the same sort of Di treatment to the Thai monarchy that the British monarchy receives. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Personally I received that view with tremendous amount of scepticism, which leads me on to the next point, about misinformation on the internet and the multimedia publishing information technology revolution that we're going through. We've had a lot about censorship; we haven't had much about misinformation, and I just wanted to know whether you wanted to make any comments about that, particularly as there's just recently been the anniversary in Thailand of the 1976 October Teim Sat  university massacre at which photographs -doctored photographs -of the royal family were used to launch a coup and gain popular support for the coup. And very reputable newspapers such as the Bangkok Post actually published those papers. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I'd like to hear your comments: 1. about the current political situation in Thailand, the current media situation, particularly what's happened since the Anand government, caretaker government, privatised and deregulated a lot of the media there. Thankyou.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Khun Tulsathit Taptin</B> <BR>
I think your first question is what we heard in the morning: how long the Thai monarchy can survive or can escape media criticism. Honestly speaking, and I hope there is no special branch from Thailand [laughter], honestly I think the monarchy itself is facing a very tough time in Thailand, but what has made its escape, what had enabled the monarchy to escape criticism is the King himself. The King has been able to maintain his role as a unifying force in Thailand. He has maintained his image as the highest institution in the country, despite all the scandal surrounding other loyal family members. The King has been able to keep a really good image with the Thai people. So as long as this King is on the throne I think the monarchy will be safe for as long as he stays. but after that I don't want to make any predictions. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Regarding your second question about misinformation, it's good that you raise that question. In 1976 during a massacre of students in university, misinformation lead to that tragedy. It's one of our darkest chapters in the nation's history. What happened was, at that time the government had absolute control over the media. It was a dictatorial government at the time. WE at The Nation tried to resist this. WE tried to report what was really going on, but sadly on that tragic day we were closed down by the government after [security?] people from the university campus and rape, beat and shot students to death. What we could do on that day -my senior journalist told me, I was still student at that time -what the Nation journalist could do on that day was just sit and watch and cry. Do nothing. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Maybe I, I missed your last . . . ?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Q. 2 [from the floor:] The last question was what changes have taken place particularly since the caretaker government . . . [indistinct] . . . And . . . privatised a lot of the media in Thailand in order to break up the military's monopoly of the media. I was just wondering what sort of a difference that had made. What you felt as a journalist: what difference has it made.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Khun Tulsathit Taptin</B><BR>
The most obvious difference is the Thai media has enjoyed more freedom. The contradiction is to let the media to compete to seek the truth, to bring out the facts that had been hidden. As I said before in my statement, there will be problems if the media enjoyed more freedom. It could undermine the government. In my country, over the past two years, in Thai newspapers, they describe the government as Thailand's, they describe the government as dogs, they could do this. But that cannot undermine a really good government, because the people will sooner or later they will know which one is a bad newspaper and which one is good.

According to many people, Hong Kong is one of the freest places in the region for the media, and is therefore regarded as the Asian information centre. A total of 59 dailies and 675 periodicals are published. Three commercial television companies, a satellite TV station and four radio broadcasters serve Hong Kong's six million people. The territory also accommodates a large number of international news agencies, newspapers with international readership and regional offices of overseas broadcasting corporations.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>To a great extent, though, press freedom has been the result of government self-restraint. Up until early 1993, a whole range of draconian colonial laws remained on the statute book. Since then, there have been changes, but some potentially crippling laws still remain. If implemented, they could return the territory to the dark ages before 1967 - the year when China's Cultural Revolution swept Hong Kong.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Slow Progress on Law Reform</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Before 1967, newspapers in Hong Kong had to submit proofs to the government before copies could be sold to the public, the authorities seized journalists' raw copy, and one pro-Beijing newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, was closed for six days.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Following the turbulence prompted by the Cultural Revolution, the colonial government realised the value of the press, whose support of government policies helped maintain peace and order in Hong Kong. Coupled with growing popular demands for democracy, the administration governed Hong Kong with a lighter and more diplomatic touch.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The touch might have been lighter, but the old colonial laws remained. The Television Ordinance, for example, allowed the vetting and prohibition of programs. And one TV programming regulation stipulated that a licensee had to broadcast news covering international and local affairs provided by sources or services approved by the government. The mind boggles...

The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) for several years fought, without success, for changes to such laws. The situation changed when the new Governor, Chris Patten, arrived in Hong Kong in 1992, and pledged to review potentially harmful laws. Many laws have been changed since then, although not always to our satisfaction. For example, the repeal of subsidiary legislation under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance has been little more than cosmetic. And in the most sensitive area - security-related legislation - vital reform has been held up by confidential Sino-British negotiations.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There is no doubt that bureaucratic conservatism has been a bar to more far-reaching change. Another reason has been China's attitude to amendments bringing colonial laws into line with section 16 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, which mirrors article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Hong Kong Bill of Rights was enacted after the suppression of the Chinese pro-democracy movement in June 1989, as a way to calm the fears of Hong Kong people.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It has been widely accepted that the Hong Kong government will not press ahead with changes which might be opposed by China, unless they are of overwhelming importance. Indeed, the administration has promised to consult the Chinese government over some law reform proposals, including those relating to security legislation. Observers also note that the Chinese government would like to maintain the existing wide-ranging powers of the Hong Kong government after the July 1997 resumption of sovereignty. This itself might well be an obstacle to further reform.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
One example where the government may have given in to pressure from China has been the case of the so-called omnibus broadcasting bill, which was proposed to rationalise and bring together three existing<BR>
laws - the Television, Telecommunication and Broadcasting Authority ordinances. The government pledged to introduce the bill to the Legislative Council in 1995, but delays set in. In May 1995, the acting Secretary for Recreation and Culture, Fred Ting, announced that the bill had been shelved to avoid any clash with China over its contents. The following day, an embarrassed acting Chief Secretary, Michael Leung, felt compelled to declare that the bill was still "very much in the pipeline".
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>At the end of the same year, Mr Patten confirmed that it remained the administration's aim to introduce the bill into the Legislative Council during the 1995/96 legislative session. One month later, in January 1996, the new Secretary for Recreation and Culture, Chau Tak-hay, announced that the bill had been shelved. He claimed, without great conviction, that the move was necessary to allow the government to focus on "high priority tasks", including the introduction of a video-on-demand service and the deregulation of pay television.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>The Democratic Party - the political party with the most seats in the Legislative Council - called the move "disgraceful" and said it showed "that even routine legislation to ensure competitiveness and to keep pace with technology is being abandoned to appease China."

<B>Question. Errol Hodge.</B><BR>
Errol Hodge, Queensland University of Technology. A question for you Jon. You mentioned how great it was to be able to get all sorts of accounts of what happened in Beijing in June 1989. I can understand the benefits of being able to quote student spokesmen [sic] on what was their attitude to the pro democracy campaign, and to quote the Beijing government on what it thought of the campaign and the subsequent events. But how do you decide when it comes to trying to analyse what was the truth, how do you decide between the extremes of what the government propaganda is saying on the one hand and what the student spokesmen was saying on the other. As you know the student spokesmen circulated rumours which resulted in the account of what had happened that was given by Bob Hawke at the memorial service. How do you chose the truth? Isn't it safer to stick with foreign correspondents who are experienced in reporting this kind of event?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Jon Casimir</B> <BR>
Of course, if you want to take that tack. I think 'truth' is a - I mean, truth is a really tough subject to start discussing when you're talking about journalism. I am a believer that the age of objectivity is behind us, that it was a waste of space in journalism and the sooner we get around to admitting that it's a subjective form the better off we'll be. I didn't see the Tianenman stuff so it's a bit tough for me, but in the case of Sarajevo on line - I mean, truth in any of those situations is not only relative, it means so many different things, which is why I enjoyed, why I would call Sarajevo 'on-line journalism' is that every day there would be people emailing from Sarajevo about their daily experiences. There were people from both sides, there were people who were pro the war, people who were against the war, people who were burying their families, people who were getting out. All kinds of experiences. And they were all first hand. And to me that is journalism. It's a context. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now, it's not the only type of journalism, and the things you're talking about, the fact that we still need good journalists to give us a good perspective and that we need to attempt to find some sort of truth is also good, but neither of them - I mean, I think both of these things are helped by each other. If I can have a great journalist giving me a good perspective on an event somewhere, and I can an get some first hand, first person sense of reality about that event as well, then I'm happy.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Unidentified questioner</B> <BR>
This is a question to David. I thought that was quite humorous in a way that a head of a major corporation would actually respond to an email message, that basically Bloomberg's handling there, because as any of us know who are on email, the early days were terrific but not you get RSI from your delete button, you get overloaded, so I guess the same will apply to Bloomberg. If there were 100 journalists firing off that message he would've just deleted them all as well.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>David Wilson </B><BR>
Absolutely, and  . . . Yeah, I understand what you're talking about and believe me I face that everyday personally. I mean, going around the world, I end up coming in in the morning and there're dozens of email messages from my colleagues in the States that I have to get rid of. But understand, the distinction between our system and, say, the Internet. In the Bloomberg - to the extent that it's used to file [?] all the money if you will - it's a vital part of people's artillery if you will, and something they're paying very close attention to, so if the email message . . . [part of answer cut off by end of tape] . . . firing information around the world. I just found out yesterday that Australia's now the second country in the world where we have an entirely digital set-up OK. You're talking 56K, 64K lines world-wide. So you can deliver the message quickly and people will pay attention to it because I think it's something that it's very much a part of their day. Which is certainly an advantage to us when it comes to getting access to decision makers.

<B>Chair . . .</B> <BR>
Introducing the final speaker at today's conference. Our speaker is Mr Paul Kelly, who is one of Australia's most eminent journalists and editors. He is the editor of the Australian. He is a very active political reporter and commentator and also a prolific author of very interesting books on political events and personalities. I recommend his books as a very good read. Paul Kelly, since he's been at the Australian, has taken an increasing interest in Asian affairs and I think that the Australian and its product has reflected this. So to deliver the final address, I have much pleasure in welcoming Paul Kelly.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Thanks very much Corrina. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I'm told that the conference over the last few days has been characterised by some interesting and vigorous papers and discussions about trends in journalism. This is very appropriate. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
One of the phenomenons of our time is globalisation. As journalists, we are often analysing trends in politics, business and technology, and so many of these trends today are driven by globalisation. And yet I tend to suspect that as an industry we are not as aware of how the phenomenon of globalisation is transforming our own activities, our own industry and our own operations. I'd like to address some of these issues today, with particular reference to the relationship between Australia and Asia.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It's an age of instantaneous news. Television, CNN, radio. It's so easy to find out what he latest news is from virtually anywhere in the world. But the interesting aspect of this is that I often wonder to what extent we are actually learning more about the world as distinct with being bombarded with information about what's going on in various parts of the world. And I think that this is a particularly important point which goes to the heart of how in fact a journalist must operate. I'm concerned at the moment that there is a tendency in this country towards a more provincial and introspective outlook. I think that we were more genuinely interested in overseas events and overseas trends a few years ago than what we are at the moment. And I think that this is an issue we should carefully assess. When I look at our media coverage of Europe or of the recent United States election or of events in India or China I'm increasingly sceptical as to how beneficial the coverage of these countries and these events is inside Australia. And I think the risk is that too often the coverage is superficial and too often our understanding of what's really going on in these countries is far too superficial. I think this is an issue we have to consider very carefully as journalists and as an industry. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
One of the problems of course is that it's difficult when journalists are attempting to go beyond simply reporting the news of the day and they are attempting to analyse what's going on beneath the news and to identify the trends. Often it's hard because it's very complicated, it's difficult to work out what's happening. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Let's look at the recent United States election. Many people said to me the coverage in the Australian papers was boring, and I think there was quite a lot in this. It was just a contest between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, and it looked pretty much from the start as though the result was a foregone conclusion. But to what extent did the coverage really address some of the underlying issues: the crisis of America democracy; the fact that the turnout was the lowest in 60 or 70 years (and in some ways the turnout was the most disappointing for 150 years); the fact that the Democratic party seems to have walked away from a lot of its roots, from a lot of the things it believes in; the fact that the election seemed to herald the complete death of Keynesian economics. To what extent were these issues really looked at and analysed during the course of the election campaign? It seems to me not very much. But the task of journalism is to get to the issues and - in this post-Cold War, post-ideological age - come to grips with the trends.

<B>Question 1. Elizabeth [muffled] from AAP.</B><BR> 
I'm just wondering how much of a responsibility newspapers such as the Australian have placed - or how much responsibility do you take - in covering the race debate that's currently going on. Taking in mind the reaction it will probably have in Asia. What sort of editorial decisions, that sort of thing.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR> 
Well, I think that we've got to cover the debate according to our judgment of its news value and it's quite clearly an important debate. We've had a bipartisan resolution passed in Federal Parliament on the issue; we've had a number of prominent Australians participate in the debate and make public comments - from the Prime Minister to the Opposition leader to the Foreign Minister to the Trade Minister to the former Prime Minister; we've had significant coverage of this issue by the overseas media. So clearly it is an important issue in its own right that the Australian media must cover. And I think in terms of our coverage we've got to cover it the way we'd cover any other story. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
We must ensure that our coverage is fair, that's balanced, that it's not unduly exaggerated. That we give different play to the various perspectives. I don't think that it would be right for the Australian media to censor itself in terms of this debate, or not report, because we would be concerned that the reporting of this issue would damage Australia abroad. We can't adopt that sort of approach. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Having said that I think that the most difficult issue to come to terms with in this debate was how to cover it at the start, when all that had really happened was one member of parliament who was an Independent had made some comments which were unrepresentative of the views of government or opposition or of the majority of the Australian people. And I think that you had to be careful, at that stage of the debate, in terms of the balance of the coverage, not to give too much emphasis to the views of one person who was an Independent Member of Parliament. What happened however was that the coverage of the views of that one person was taken up and many other people responded to that person hence the story gathered momentum and became a very significant story because many other people, from the Government and Opposition, became involved as did foreign governments. And in that sense of course the story had to be covered in the normal professional way that the media would bring to any other story. I've answered that at length because I think it's a very important issue and it's a very complicated issue.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 2 [muffled] former copyboy on the Australian back in David Armstrong's days.</B><BR> 
You talk about cultural sensitivity towards reporting the region, whatever region that might be. I'd like to find out how you, as an editor-in-chief, balance that cultural sensitiveness with - in the way, I hope it hasn't changed in the Australian , I know that every Monday night at about 9.15 everybody stops to have a look at 'Mediawatch' and you figured prominently in the Australian in last week's 'Mediawatch', and the accusation was exactly that. That in [??] the claim your foreign editor Greg Sheridan would make to cultural sensitiveness in the region, other journalists or other commentators might argue that it's not cultural sensitiveness as such. How do you balance that in your coverage, how do you judge when being sensitive to issues in the region - whether they be cultural or not - go beyond that into ineffectual and even wrong and factually wrong information? Like you know the article from Greg Sheridan previously to the UN security council vote, at the same time a newspaper in Portugal ran a very similar article saying it was very confident that Portugal was going to win. So I'd just like to find out how you balance all these cultural issues with factual journalistic fact.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR> 
Well, the first point to make is that it's very important to get one's facts right. It's very important to ensure that stories published are accurate and balanced. That's the answer in relation to 'fact'. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now, I didn't see this 'Mediawatch' program so I don't know the precise issue that you are referring to. What I'd say about Greg Sheridan is that Greg is a very experienced and very professional journalist in his covering of the Asia-Pacific and has some very good contacts throughout the region, and I think has immeasurably enhanced the Australian media's coverage of the Asia-Pacific as a result of his contributions. both his news contributions and his analysis. Now if people are complaining about his analysis they're entitled to complain, and I've got no doubt that he is perfectly capable of doing more than defending himself. I'd simply say that I think he's a very good example of an Australian journalist who's travelled to the region a lot and made very substantial efforts to develop contacts in the region, and to develop an understanding of a lot of the political and social issues in the Asia-Pacific, yet write about them in a very competent and professional manner. In that sense I think he's a very good example of the sort of skills I was talking about. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
You ask a general question about how we balance these sensitivities. Well, we're talking about qualitative differences here. It's one thing to be sensitive, it's another thing to publish an inaccurate story, to publish a wrong story. That's being unprofessional. And I think the difference at the end of the day, ultimately, is clear. And it's a quite a distinct difference. These are qualitatively different things. You've got a certain number of facts, and you can put those facts into a story in all sorts of different ways, and what I'm saying is that one brings sensitivity to the coverage of the story. And I'm saying that one does that without compromising journalistic standards at all. I certainly believe that that's possible, and I believe that this really is the task that Australian journalists must tackle in their coverage of this part of the world.

<B>Section 2. Principles</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

There is a compelling case for public service broadcasting in an Australian democracy.  The increasing concentration of media ownership, and the singular lack of diversity in newspapers and commercial news, makes the case even more important. It is crucial in this environment that the broadcasting system in Australia remain a mixed system of commercial and public service broadcasting. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

There is strong and persistent public support in Australia for the principles of public service broadcasting. Recent statistical evidence clearly shows that the ABC TV reaches 87% to 90% of Australian television viewers during any four week period, while ABC radio reaches 6,167,000 radio listeners each week.   On this basis we reject any notion that the ABC serves only an elite of the population, with 'high culture' tastes. The ABC must remain independent, especially of commercial influence, and must strive to extend its reach and the appropriateness of its content to the geographic, social and cultural diversity of the Australian population. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

We see no major problem with the present formulation of the ABC's charter, though there have clearly been difficulties for the organisation in meeting many contradictory demands. It has insufficient resources, an inappropriate management and internal funding structure, and it is hampered by a certain enduring 'high culture', BBC inheritance. We see it as imperative for the ABC to redefine itself as both more specialised and more inclusive, serving many publics, including young people.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

While the Charter requires the ABC only to 'take account of' the services provided by other broadcast sectors, the question of a 'complementary' role to commercial services has pervaded much public discussion. There has been a lot of confusion and disagreement about how the ABC can remain both 'comprehensive' and 'complementary'. We argue that these can both be achieved in the best sense if 'comprehensive' is taken to mean not ratings (as many people as possible at any one time) but 'reach' (how many people view over a longer time period). The ABC should aim to reach as many different communities of geography, taste and interest as possible. There is no longer such a thing as the 'general public', Australia being constituted by many publics, all of whom can be served, but not all at once. The ABC should aim to address these 'publics' serially rather than simultaneously. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In many areas the ABC should be complementary to the commercial services (one could mount an argument that the ABC should not be producing or transmitting commercial-style soap operas or situation comedies at the present time, for example). However we are concerned at the implications of entrenching the notion of complementarity in a revised Charter. Trying to maintain a complementary profile has resulted in many frustrations for the ABC; JJJ's existence, for example, has been dogged by claims that it is encroaching on commercial radio's terrain. As far as we are aware, this problem is not as major for public service broadcasters which maintain a larger audience share due to their history as broadcast monopolies. It is a particular problem for broadcasters in a mixed system. The primary concern for the ABC must be the fulfilment of its enduring public service responsibilities rather than not allowing it to duplicate commercial activities at a particular moment.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Similarly, if the ABC is to call on notions of 'national identity' in response to the notion of 'comprehensiveness', then it must define what is meant by that term. 'National' need not be understood as 'Federal', an understanding which has led to overcapitalisation in bricks and mortar (and management structures) in each State. Rather 'National' should be understood as a conglomerate of different publics (geographic, taste, interest, culture) at different times, as well as a single public national on occasions. The present Federal structure is inhibiting rather than contributing to the development of a fully National radio structure, understood in this more complex way.</FONT>

<B>Section 3. Programming</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

We assert that there is no program category or type that the ABC should a priori not do. However, in any program category or type the ABC should aim for innovation and quality. It must be allowed to take risks, to explore new genres and reach new audiences.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The ABC should do what the commercial broadcasters will not do because of their specific relationship with the audience and advertisers. The ABC is obliged to reach new kinds of audience, to create new audiences where they previously did not exist - to perform the "R & D" of broadcasting. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

While ABC television should not be in the business of chasing ratings, it is essential that the ABC provide relevant programming for diverse groups - especially those that are not served by the commercial channels - and it should schedule these programs with the aim of reaching the largest segment possible of the relevant audience. To that end, scheduling of ABC programs should be done with regard to competition, to allow the maximum number of people to watch an ABC program, in preference to aggressively programming 'head to head' with high rating programs on commercial channels. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In our view the Charter obligation for innovation should be interpreted as program innovation, examples of which would be Elle McFeast, Club Buggery, Andrew Denton, Hot Chips, http, Foreign Correspondent  and the like, as well as many of the documentary series which the ABC has screened. Too often however the notion of innovation has been confused with the notion of 'quality' with the ABC seen as necessarily the 'quality' broadcaster, compared with the 'crassness' the commercial 'mass' broadcasters.  We do not subscribe to this notion of quality.  The danger of connecting ABC with quality in this sense is that the concept is too easily read as unproblemmatic, and used as an excuse for the exercise of specific tastes in programming, or for the creation of hierarchies of genre (for example, hierarchies which prioritise news over children's programming, period drama over science fiction, drama over comedy etc). 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

So if the public broadcaster is to identify 'quality' as one of its goals, then it must define what it means by 'quality' within the various genres it broadcasts - quality in children's drama has different criteria than quality in news programming. We suggest also that the ABC might consider importing quality programming from countries other then Britain - eg documentaries from PBS in America, or from other public service broadcasters.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

As examples of genre specific definitions of quality, we discuss some types of programs below. This discussion is in no way indicative of a desire to limit the ABC to these, or to any particular type of program.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=4 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>News and Current Affairs</B><BR>
Quality News and Current Affairs programs are reliable, impartial and authoritative. What does 'reliable, impartial and authoritative' news and information services mean?  To be reliable means having a properly funded, professionally trained and well managed news organisation.  To be impartial is to subscribe to particular journalistic practices and to a notion of balance over time.  To be authoritative requires a sufficient range of sources and analysis, so that content can be accepted with confidence as both accurate and substantial.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Clearly then public service broadcasting is different in character and in objective from other news services.  It is expected to be independent - of the state, of uninformed prejudice and of powerful interests in society.  Since business sentiment shapes the values and practices of commercial media, public service broadcasting must be separate from both the public and private sector.  This raises important questions about funding sources, to which we return later.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Note too that size or composition of audience is secondary in a strictly formulated notion of public service news and current affairs broadcasting.  The objective is to make information available to the electorate, rather than audience for its own sake. Like Hansard, such a news service may be consulted by relatively few, but remains an essential and influential resource.  This is particularly the case in times of great moment, when people turn once again to the ABC.  

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The ABC's international network of reporters is a highly prized resource in contrast to the concentrated sources used by commercial media for world news. We would even like to see more international programs drawing on this expertise, and note that Australia Television's late night news is appreciated by many Australians for its detailed attention to the region. This is ironic in view of the channel's target audience being in Asia. We return to Aus TV below. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In sum, public service broadcasting requires a news and information service which has adequate funding, appropriate professional values, a wide mandate and legal and organisational structures which assure independence from government, business and other interests (including audience ratings) when presenting information.  The mandate is to inform a democracy, recognising that disagreement and occasional hostility to scrutiny are to be expected in the political realm.  The old injunction to public servants that they offer advice 'without fear or favour' is indeed a clich, but one which captures accurately the task in  hand.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>Drama</B><BR>
ABC drama should cater for all sections of the community - though not all at the same time. This means that it can aim programs at those sections of the community which, while they are served as part of a mass audience by the commercial networks, are not served in their cultural specificity by any. These groups can be served one after another, so that 'comprehensiveness' is achieved over a period of time, rather than in any one program.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

ABC drama has an obligation to the creative life of the community, including the nurturing of Australian creative talent, innovation and experimentation, and to fictionally render Australian history and contemporary life, even when it is unpalatable, politically unpopular and risky (though of course it does not have to do this all the time). We would expect ABC drama to be different from what is normally done by commercial networks, and to be a pioneering force. The organisation's drama record is in fact uneven, with startlingly original and successful recent programs such as Seven Deadly Sins, The Damnation of Harvey McHugh, Bordertown and Heartland, but nothing in the current season that approaches such achievement.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in its inquiry into Australian content said that quality programs 'are good in their own terms at all levels, in all aspects and over as wide a range as possible'. It went on to say that quality programs 'result in high audience involvement and have an impact beyond the moment of their screening'

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

ABC Drama should be Australian (in the ABA's sense), should fictionally render Australian and contemporary life, commenting on our own society, including its relation to the rest of the world, be of high quality, be innovative and experimental. It should cover new subject matter, employing new stylistic devices, crossing established genre boundaries, embodying fresh perspectives or modes of address; it should take chances, risking not immediately finding an audience but hoping to challenge and change audience expectations. ABC drama should be audience-driven not ratings-driven - programs should have a clear sense of their audience but this need not be a mass audience. It should be diverse in style and format - the ABC should endeavour to move beyond the fixed and formulaic television forms, the series, serial and mini-series, and experiment with other formats which might serve the material better.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Drama programs should also be diverse in subject matter so as to be of relevance to all sections of the Australian community - this relates especially to the needs of Aboriginal and multicultural audiences. It should be socially critical - the ABC should take risks in subject matter as well as style, and sometimes 'bite the hand that feeds it'. It should also foster new talent - this recognises that creative renewal in the 'art of television' cannot occur unless resources are given to training and encouraging new creative personnel; together with other agencies, including the Australian Film Commission (AFC) and the Australian Film Television and Radio School (AFTRS), the ABC has some responsibility in this area. It should contribute to cross-fertilisation between different cultural and aesthetic forms - television as the popular audiovisual medium and one ideally suited to genre-mixing can be the site of a very lively meeting of music, dance, sound, video art, visual design, performance of both the 'high art' and 'popular' varieties.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Other entertainment genres
We have stressed how essential it is for the ABC to be active across many broadcast genres, although obviously not all equally all the time. It is unmistakeable that it is in the area of comedy and satire that the ABC has been most innovative and adventurous recently. Frontline has been a triumph, exhibiting many of the characteristics listed above. Roy and HG have pioneered a new genre of sports satire which has attracted young audiences. The declining role of the ABC in sports broadcasting is a striking pattern over the last two decades, to the point where the question arises of whether the ABC has any role here at all. Again the criterion of innovation and reaching new and diverse audiences must be paramount. We note here the excellent service the ABC performed in covering the Paralympic Games, but also our dismay that the Paralympic Federation in fact had to pay the ABC to do this. The organisation must have the resources to be able to cover such significant but minority events.  

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

We also note the ABC's fine record of producing and broadcasting programs for children, many of which find appreciative audiences overseas. Children are the audience most obviously not served by commercial logic, and the ABC must maintain its record of quality and commitment here. </FONT>

<B>Section 4. Structure</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The ABC must redefine its management structure to achieve the best possible broadcasting outcomes for its audience(s). To do this it must re-evaluate its historical evolution, and determine whether past practices are appropriate in the current circumstances. It must also determine which services will most effectively meet its broadcasting objectives.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(a) Management Diversity</B><BR>
It is crucial that management in some ways reflects the diversity of the Australian population, and thus of the desired programming outcomes of the ABC. Programmers (or commissioning editors) in particular should have a diverse range of views in order to promote heterogenous programming and scheduling.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(b) Regionalism</B><BR>
The ABC, as the national broadcaster, must address issues of regionalism. It is not necessary however that organisational divisions be made on State lines in accordance with the Federal system of Government. The historical division of the broadcasting public into States is inappropriate to the task of the national broadcaster in an age of global communications. While some audience members may identify with their State, and while laws may differ from State to State, it is difficult to mount a broadcasting reason for a State-Based organisation. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

The ABC should determine its required regional outcomes and then implement an appropriate management structure. At present it seems that the reverse is true - that the State management structure determines broadcasting outcomes. A far more sensible approach for regional programming would be a geographical division between geographic communities of interest - Albury/Wodonga, and The Gold Coast, are two obvious examples where regional concerns cross state boundaries.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Regional participation in radio should be expanded by the production of more radio production in local centres. Regional participation in television may be achieved more effectively by the commissioning of independent regional program producers in television than by the current 'symbolic' presence of studios in State Capitals. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(c) International models</B><BR>
For historical reasons, Australia has inherited the British variant of a single, centralised national broadcasting organisation offering both radio and television, with a charter which combines information, education and entertainment objectives.  Since the 1980s this has been supplemented by a Special Broadcasting Service attending to foreign language material, and by limited public funding for community radio and television.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

One could imagine government achieving public service broadcasting objectives through funding many different and smaller organisations - as with PBS in the United States - or by distributing the public service broadcasting fee to many broadcasters, as in New Zealand.  In each case, however, these alternative models violate some principles of public service broadcasting.  When funding is dispersed, as in the United States, no single organisation can rely solely on public money.  In Canada, public service broadcasting has become totally reliant on advertising.  While this may not directly affect editorial independence, commercial operations introduce a commercial logic about audience size and reach.  In New Zealand, the spreading of the licence fee over many broadcasters (none of which has a public service mandate) has reduced rather than enhanced the quality of service in many areas.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In sum, an ABC is not the only way to realise public service broadcasting principles.  Yet there are important warnings in international experience in reaching too eagerly for alternatives.  Finding the best model for Australia may be a question not of principle but of the pragmatics of organisational design.  Whatever the problems, consolidation in a single national broadcaster is probably at present the most cost effective way to proceed.  Given the failure of radical change in New Zealand, and the clear and present dangers posed by advertising in the Canadian system, there is no firm basis for abandoning the Australian tradition of a single, public funded national broadcasting organisation.  Improvements should be achieved instead through better goal-setting, and consideration of the degrees to which the ABC should broadcast and/or produce its own programs.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

To this end, perhaps the Channel 4 model is the most appropriate to adapt to Australian needs. Channel 4 maintains a strong public service mandate and commissions independent production. We believe that for television it will be more cost effective to have a purchaser-provider arrangement for the production of television programs, especially drama and documentary. This would allow ABC TV to act more as a commissioning agent than it now does and to focus on programming outcomes rather than managing a complex and dispersed set of facilities and a large dispersed staff. This was appropriate in the early days when there was no independent production industry, but it makes less sense now. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

However there are dangers in this model, one being that with the loss of staff who carry the culture and history of Public Service Broadcasting in their daily practices, the value of Public Service Broadcasting may be lost. We believe that this can be counteracted by having a very robust Public Service Charter and a good system of accountability which at the same time absolutely protects the ABC's political independence. 

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(d) Australia Television and Radio Australia</B><BR>
Television is ten times as expensive as radio. So while Radio Australia can provide a free and democratic alternative in areas of the world with repressive broadcasting regimes, Australia Television must use commercial sponsors, which alters the relationship of the ABC to its audience. It is questionable whether the foreign affairs benefits which Australia Television offers the nation are commensurate with its costs both in terms of money and integrity.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

Australia Television should cease to be funded by the ABC in the present manner. If the Government judges that clause 1(b) of the Charter should apply to television as well as radio, then Australia Television must be funded in the same way as Radio Australia, and not be expected to take sponsorship, which sets a dangerous precedent and in this case has failed anyway. Radio Australia should be expanded and given more resources.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(e) Pay TV</B><BR>
It is one thing to say that the ABC should be involved in new technologies, it is quite another to say that the ABC should get into new types of services with new types of relations to audiences which is what Pay TV implies.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

It is important that mode of delivery not be confused with service. Pay TV is not a new technology, although it sometimes is delivered via (comparatively) new delivery systems such as satellite and cable. What it is rather is a new type of service which introduces a new relationship with the audience. As discussed below, the relationship between audience and broadcaster is determined largely by the way in which the broadcaster is funded. In an environment where audiences pay for a service, the relationship is more direct than where they do not. For the Public Broadcaster to enter the PayTV field, it must satisfy the greatest number of its subscribers at any time, and so must follow the commercial imperative of 'mass' or single 'niche' programming. As we are arguing that the best audience target for the ABC is in serial audiences, and because of the huge financial investment required, we believe that  Pay TV is best left to commercial operators.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

However a 'must carry' amendment should be made to broadcasting legislation to require commercial Pay TV operators to carry ABC programming.  The ABC should have the option of selling Pay TV rights of any program or group of programs to Pay TV providers who wish to retransmit (eg a package of arts documentaries for an arts channel; children's programs for a children's channel, etc). This will bring the ABC extra revenue without huge financial risk.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(f) OnLine Services /Information Services</B><BR>
At present the major roles of the ABC online services are as an adjunct to radio and television services - whether program promotion, transcripts of radio programs, or audience feedback on radio and television via e-mail. These services have been enthusiastically adopted by certain groups, and may be bringing about new relationships between the organisation and its audience, and indeed, new forms of communication among audience members. The ABC is the only Australian broadcaster to have developed a substantial online presence, and the possibilities being created further establish its distinctive role. It is likely that the online services are in fact bringing new audiences to the ABC.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

It is important that the ABC retains a presence in Online services, and continues to develop the potential of these new forms to serve public service goals. Full transcripts of programs are available on ABC websites. This is a very valuable educational and public information resource, and contrasts, for example, with the way major newspapers' online presence is oriented towards selling the publication, providing excerpts only. It is less clear whether this new service is appropriate to the goals of a public service broadcaster in forms such as the provision of separate information services or the managing of user groups.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

While access to information and information literacy is a crucial area for consideration by Government, there is no good reason at present why the ABC should become involved in this initiative. If the government has a cultural policy regarding multimedia or internet services these should be provided through other means - the most obvious being the public library network, and telecommunications carriers. erceived radio/television duplication.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(g) ABC/SBS Amalgamation</B><BR>
Inevitably in a review such as this, the possibility of an amalgamation between SBS and ABC will be discussed.
The most significant objection to such an amalgamation is that it is likely to lead to a 'backdoor' implementation of advertising or sponsorship policy at the ABC, a policy which would weaken the diversity of the broadcasting environment. The absence of advertising on ABC strengthens diversity - the audience has a choice between a station with ads and one without.

<B>Section 5. Funding</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(a) audience/broadcaster relationship</B><BR>
The provision of broadcasting services entails three different relationships between the broadcaster and the audience, according to the manner in which the broadcaster is funded.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In the first, of a commercial provider, there is no direct relationship between audience and the broadcaster. The audience is commodified by the broadcaster and sold to advertisers in a lump. The audience can have an indirect effect on the broadcaster by turning off and affecting advertising revenue. In this relationship the audience must be treated as a 'mass' and programs must attract the largest audience most of the time.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
 
In the second, of subscription, the relationship is more direct because the provider will lose business if the service is not satisfactory to the audience. Here the audience is treated as consumer, but the broadcaster doesn't have to achieve the largest possible audiences most of the time. The broadcaster can address niche markets and still capture large markets and profits.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

In the third, funding through licence fees or government appropriation, the relationship is one where the provider can give not what the audience wants, but what the provider thinks the audience needs.  This has been defined as 'the public interest'. 'Public interest' can thus entail programs that create and foster a public or publics, encourage spaces of debate, contestation, the exercise of citizenship, the playing out of the democratic process. In this relationship the broadcaster is accountable to the public in how well it fulfils what has been agreed upon as the 'public interest' . What counts as the 'public interest' can change historically. We suggest that the Charter/Contract model we set out below would give the opportunity for having an open and public debate every seven years (as in the BBC Charter process) for determining what the public interest in broadcasting is, and how the ABC would fulfil it.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>(b)	Contract with government</B><BR>
We propose the Review consider a contract mechanism similar to agreements between the BBC and the British Government, and between the Australian Film Finance Corporation and successive Australian administrations.  We suggest that every seven (or perhaps five) years, government and the ABC should reach a detailed agreement.  This contract, consistent with the Charter, should set out the specific strategies to be employed by the Corporation in pursuit of its goals.  The contract should include performance indicators, such as proposed broadcast hours of Australian drama content and, if appropriate, proportions of material to be produced outside the organisation.  In return, government would agree to guaranteed levels of funding for the term of the contract.

<B>Section 6. Recommendations</B>

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

1.	that the ABC should retain and develop its present provision of programming for diverse groups;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
2.  that the ABC should be free of advertising and sponsorship;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
3.  that the ABC provide an independent, accurate, quality News and Current Affairs services to the entire population 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
4.  that the ABC should be able to participate in any 'type' of programming which addresses particular communities in Australia;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
5.  that the ABC should aim for 'quality programming' but that notions of 'quality' should not create a hierarchy of genres or taste communities;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
6.	that all Radio networks (including Radio Australia) should be extended as fully separate services which are low cost broadcasting activities and which address the needs of specific and diverse audiences; 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
7.	that the ABC should meet its regional imperative with more regard to regional communities than to State boundaries, and that such considerations should be reflected in the reorganisation of management structures;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
8.	that, in order to provide certainty for Parliament, the Corporation, and the public, there should be a detailed 5 or 7 year agreement between the ABC and government;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
9.  that the ABC should make a distinction between production and distribution functions, and that the results of these distinctions may differ in radio and television, and/or across genres;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
10. that the ABC should adapt the purchaser/provider model of Channel 4 in the UK to the specific needs of Australian broadcasting;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
11. that ABC Television is overcapitalised, and that the symbolic presence of studios in every capital city, besides being financially unsustainable, may prevent a greater level of participation by independent regional program makers, and that, following from the above, interstate television studios should be sold, and that studio time should be bought as required from commercial studios, or by greater co-operation with radio stations;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
12. that Australia Television should be funded on the same basis as Radio Australia; this means either voting it extra funds or closing it down;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
13. that the ABC should develop its online presence as an adjunct to its radio and television services;
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
14. that SBS should remain an autonomous entity.

<B>Political correctness and balance</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The price of civilised society is eternal vigilance. Too many racist and sexist attitudes are still there and one of the frightening indications of changes in the political culture, is that some appear to be increasingly accepted. The messages being given in the political sphere are that middle Australia is basically Anglo and in traditional families. Recently, there has been a regular process of media scapegoating of groups such as the unemployed, Aboriginal services, refugees, migrants, 'middle class welfare' and those on social security and so on.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The PM, in his attacks on political correctness, has, presumably inadvertently, legitimated more virulent outpourings of the mob, the frightened but ill-informed who are looking for social scapegoats. They are likely to follow populist leaders, including those commentators who explain complex social and economic problems situations by blaming some of the victims. The searchers for simplistic solutions are prey to preachers of social snake oil.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The debate on political correctness, together with the emphasis on the supposed dominance and divisiveness of so called special interest groups, has been used to create tensions about representing minority views. There have been endless reported debates on commercial media about the presumed dominance of the air waves by the PC promoters without any examples ever being offered on local media. Similarly, the  accusations of bias against the ABC by our political masters has been based on selective quotes not on the basis of overall monitoring of the content of ABC radio or TV,  or on the spectrum of  broadcasting.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The fact that the PM and other complainants of bias were accompanied by both the Mansfield review and the budget cuts go to the core of the concept of public  broadcasting.  The conjunction gave a clear message 'don't displease the government or you will be punished!'. That process threatens free speech, and makes it harder for ABC management and staff to make proper professional judgements on what should go to air as they try to second guess their financial masters.  The ABC is owned by the public, not the government of the day, which is why there has been overwhelming support for it during this enquiry.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The existence and effectiveness of public broadcasters must be considered within a broader base of whether they, and they alone, can provide the space and resources which allow them to reflect the social mixes and diverse views which constitute the polity as well the society. There have been complaints that there are too many Aboriginal voices, for instance, but in terms of the totality of radio broadcasting, it is clear there are too few. Similarly the spaces for feminist debates or dissent are extremely limited, so the few opportunities we get on the ABC need to be balanced against the constant attacks on 'feminazis ' by Laws et al.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The rationale behind the public funding of this institution is to maintain its independence in reporting and programming.  Any interference in this would be seen to be censorship by the Government.  Any funding outside of public monies would mean a curtailment of that independence if its reliance was upon commercial interests.  We wouldn't want an ABC presenter to confuse us about whether we were listening to a current topic or an advertisement (advertorials) as are frequently the case on John Laws' program, for instance.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We would see a public broadcasting presence as essential to provide balance in the overall broadcast system, not necessarily to always be balanced within its own programming. The limits of the programming on the commercial media would be exacerbated by any reduction in public broadcasting. It has often been the ABC which has developed new programs for TV and had these taken over by Commercial TV. The standards set by ABC documentaries and current affairs act as a benchmark for producers in other areas whose proprietors may not be interested in quality programs.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Good governance depends on the legitimation of diverse groups and interests. There is no possibility of a totally impartial broadcaster as we all carry within us our own desires, prejudices, interests and awareness. We can only set up frameworks where diversity is possible and the powerful cannot silence the less powerful.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
A public broadcaster must recognise the complexity of social issues, the diversity of views and tastes, the power imbalances which inhibit access to media. The complexity of needs within all social sectors suggests that any loss of breadth or depth within the ABC may result in excluding groups of people and views which have both the right to be heard and which also need to be heard for the development of a healthy society.

<B>The agora or forum</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC rally in the Domain reminds us of the function this space had and still does provide. Like London's Hyde Park Corner, this strip of parkland provides a space where free speech was allowed to all who wanted to bring their soap boxes. Over recent times, the electronic media have replaced the public meeting and personal contact, and displaced public oratory. Therefore the functions of the agora or forum of ancient democracies need to be considered as part of any debate on the role of public broadcaster.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Greek agora was the open space which served the market, the religious and civil societies, which in small civil communities could share a space in which none was dominant. The Roman forum lay between temples and capitol to provide a space for meetings and discussions. There were many exclusions from citizenship in these city states, such as women and slaves, and their models were by no means ideal democracies in modern terms. However, the basic assumption of spaces for meeting, debating, dissenting and cementing relationships should still remain a core base of a democratic and functioning society.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The importance of media in mass post industrial societies is dealt with in many publications and no doubt, submissions. As part of popular culture, it provides images, interactions and information which shapes and reflects the way we see ourselves, both as identity and relatedness to others. We do not want to deal with the specifics of how these complex roles of media create, affirm and deny  the ways in which we see ourselves, and act, but to suggest that the importance of maintaining a public broadcaster may have increased as a result of the expanding and diversifying of telecommunications, rather than being reduced.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The concept of a national broadcaster of both radio and TV may be misinterpreted as a relic of a simpler past when there was little in the way of alternatives. Then access to government owned public broadcasting would have been part of a developmental, modernising process which also sought to bind together a sparse and scattered population. The problems of the depression years, the need for nationhood and unity during the forties and the sense of unified Australia of the fifties would have been congruent with national broadcaster. Unlike the UK, we started in competition with commercial broadcasting, so our model is not the BBC.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Therefore, there needs to be spaces in which a range of debates can take place, where performances can be offered and enjoyed, and new ideas and concepts can seek both reactions and audiences. The role of news and current affairs is seen often as the pinnacle of the public broadcasting responsibilities, its particular roles as public broadcaster, need to be more than an accurate fact producer role.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We need analysis and comment, documentaries and reports on other related activities in the community. We need a holistic approach to reflecting, creating and explaining diverse images and contexts for the daily 'news'. The ability of people to hear, see and interpret their lives and what is happening to them, to be able to act on their own behalf and recognise their connections to others, depends at least in part, on the way they see themselves and others on the media.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
At a very simplistic level, a demonstration by a group of 20 people on the news is more significant than 2000 ignored. The presence or absence of issues, of images and information from representation in the media is highly significant in the context of social, political and economic cultures. Those issues and concerns which fail to make it to the media, are often ignored in the community. Those groups whose legitimacy is affirmed by the media are much more politically and socially powerful than those who are ignored or negated.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The agora contains markets and governance as well as culture and faith. Professor Claus Offe from Humboldt University, Berlin, at a recent ANU seminar, set up a modern model of the Agora as a triangle with its angles representing the market, the state and the community. He pointed out that the question for us now was to find the balance between the three institutions so that no one dominates to the point of destroying the fragile balances which make up civil societies
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC in its entirety provides access to a broad range of views and voices and offers its audiences choices. The market sector of broadcasting is limited by the perceptions of proprietors, the biases of advertisers, the limits of managers imagination and the objective of making money. Even though they hold licenses for use of public airwaves and can sell these if they make money, there is little or no obligation for them to be good corporate citizens or to offer services which have a public good component.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Some do in minor ways, either at owner whim, or as a good marketing strategy. However, if we are to see choices as important and public broadcasting as one of the possible benchmarkers of responsible broadcasting there are arguments to retain the present broad charter of the ABC. The existence of a public broadcaster should be seen as a public good rather than a private consumption item as it offers a benefit to all, including those who do not use it, by setting standards of ethical broadcasting and promoting social cohesion by mirroring diverse elements, not otherwise included.

<B>The ABC is not cultural spakfilla</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are many areas which are unbalanced in the commercial markets. In radio, for instance, there are shock jocks whose popularity is defined by their appeal to the ill informed and opinionated. There are also music stations who offer audiences little but sounds and snippets of news. There is a minute but hardworking community radio sector and some very specialised and limited narrowcasting groups.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In market terms, one could say that the people vote with their fingers and seek out what they want. Therefore the argument might go, we should use the ABC to provide only those areas which government would like to see available. These may be news and current affairs as these should not be able to be affected by advertiser or station owners and maybe some cultural programs of limited popular appeal.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
To the cash strapped, the quick fixer or the economistic, such arguments may seem attractive. A public broadcaster which is designed only for minority programming is cheaper than one which offers a universal service. So one puts up arguments about filling the spaces left by the commercials and creating, maybe, programs for the powerful minorities who want the arts and some intellectual programming for the elites. With some news and current affairs and rural programs with some wallpaper of under-researched commentary from personalities and most people would be happy.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
This is the cultural spakfilla model. The public sector is there to provide the content which is not available on the commercials. However, these areas should not cost too much as the public sector should be targeted to the needy. Most of these groups are not needy and maybe pay radio or narrowcasting of these sectoral interests would be appropriate!
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In radio, the need for ABC networks is more complex to describe. The scope of programming on commercial radio, and its presumed targeting at  niche markets suggests that many ABC audiences could not find homes in the spectrum. A day or two of listening to the talk stations in particular indicates fairly clearly that there are serious problems in removing any of the ABC networks in toto or even in part. See attachment for more detail and descriptions of the difference we monitored between these programs.

<B>The metros</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The present spectrum of ABC stations offer a range of views which may only sometimes be echoed on the commercial media. The greatest overlap is on the metros, and probably some rural stations. However, there are differences here which need to be widened rather than reduced, by which a broader range of people are represented in both presenters and those interviewed. The issues discussed on the networks may overlap but the way they are discussed is often very different.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The culture of the ABC stations recognises that there are diverse views and that diversity is often legitimate. Therefore the approach is often to explore issues rather than use interviews to push presenters' views. The intention is to inform as well as amuse and sometimes the interviews reach a high standard of exploration of complex issues.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
From my own experience of commercial interviews, the level of questions tends to be more superficial, the intention often to showcase the interviewer and sometimes to demolish the interviewee (personality radio). The range of people interviewed tends to be more limited and much of the process is chat, rather than exploration of ideas. This is not a judgement because many of these programs provide a useful function of connecting people through the presenter as neighbourhood focus, but these are not even semi serious interviews.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are some good and careful interviewers and presenters on the commercial media. However, these are a minority and the disappearance of the ABC would also put them at threat. The schlock jock approach would be seen to have 'won'. There are few proprietors of radio stations who would experiment with niche styles and audiences as most prefer to flock lemming-like to the shows that please the opinionated and market leading models.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The metros provide an alternative to those who want responsible albeit lighter presenters than on RN. This is an important service and one which should not be lightly abandoned. With their relatively high ratings, these service a wide range of families and offer a genuine choice of voices and views, not easily found elsewhere. However, they often imitate commercial radio by looking for interesting rather than good coverage of stories. And here they differ from the RN culture in the emphases and the depth of research.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The metros are part of an overall culture of public broadcasting which is framed within a charter and an ethos about inclusivity. They also provide a widely heard platform for the news and current affairs services which provide the base for their own and many  commercial services stories in their search for talent and stories. The metros could be improved and some of my criticisms are detailed below. In some ways they are too cautious about innovation and limited even in their broader scope.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The metros have few production and research resources. This is why they are cheaper to run. Like the commercials, they rely on radio news or the morning papers for their stories. However, their role is best understood against the role of Radio National. Their approach is limited and often they do not want the talent to open up the issue past the few points they have set as directions. There are many presenters who have a strong interest in certain areas and show considerable expertise in these. There are others whose backgrounds as journalists makes them inquisitive and they do explore issues. However, their limited resources often defeat good intentions and they offer a better version of personality radio in many cases.

<B>Radio National (RN)</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
RN has to be seen as the core of the radio networks, the spine that gives not only the rest of the network shape, but also informs the rest of the media by providing the first level of stories. While this is often part of the role of the news and current affairs teams which also service the metros and other networks, the standards set by Radio National affects the way that other networks operate.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The processes legitimated as ABC standards are implicitly set by RN. These involve time taken to check stories, production standards and a broad based acknowledgment that stories presented are complex and views and opinions are varies. The talk components on Radio National, the specialist and more generalist programs assume that items are researched and varied views and voices sought. Producers, researchers and presenters are expected to put to air items and shows which are professionally and ethically defensible. They incorporate aspects of an explicit and implicit charter of responsibilities to diverse communities.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Some stories break on the ABC because there is the time, sometimes, to follow up and investigate stories. Stories are based on material from here and overseas which comes from journals and contacts, rather than what was in the morning papers. There is a focus on conferences and on experts who have something new to say and therefore the content over any time period is both wider and deeper than what is accessible on the metros or on commercial media.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The view held by some internal managers that this type of activity can be sustained  by 'buying in these types of programs in chunks through Metro strip programming fails to recognise that the loss of the network will have devastating effects. Specialist units without regular programs and time slots become atomised and vulnerable to change and elimination.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Publicly funded national radio is one of the stronger threads in our national fabric. In a diverse and scattered society, a widely available, free-to-air national broadcaster is essential. Tying together city and country, diverse cultural groups, religious, richer and poorer; all the rich tapestry of Australian life cannot be left to the vagaries of the market. The 'shock and schlock jocks' that dominate the USA airwaves indicate the potential influence of radio in creating conflicts, racism and other uncivil phenomena. We need to make sure that there are always countervailing voices on public radio as symbols of more civil societies.

<B>Social Capital and the ABC</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Last year's Boyer lectures (Eva Cox, A truly Civil Society, ABC 1995) introduced the term social capital into public policy debates. This is a concept which deals with the way social systems cohere, the processes by which we recognise both our communalities and differences. The role of media in the process of establishing not only national identity but reflecting the state of our social fabric is important in the future of the ABC.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Quality of life is about identity and social relationships as well as material wellbeing. Social capital is as important as financial ones in establishing social cohesion and acceptance of the norms and values of the institutional frameworks we share. Social capital develops in open societies and is formed in lateral, co-operative relationships built on trust, care, mutuality and civic responsibilities. Professor Robert Putnam, of the Harvard's Kennedy school writes of correlates of high social capital with both economic success as well as pleasant lifestyles.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We have lost social cohesion with more people expressing fear of crime, increased sales of home security hardware, more cynicism about Government and Industry leaders and generally less faith in our ability to be decent human beings.  Corporatisation, privatisation, user pays, competition, targeting, reducing the size of the public sector, reducing the progressivity of taxes, growing inequalities both in and out of the workforce, all do little for social cohesion, for lateral relationships, for trust and recognition that we are all part of one society. Put this with technological changes, reduced birthrates, fewer full time unpaid workers, better education and higher expectations and the prognosis is poor.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
If we continue the economic development models in current favour, we need to recognise that these need to be matched with commitments to social development. A burst of Rotary, or a corporate sponsorship program which selects its targets with an eye on photo opportunities, is not an adequate replacement for a civic culture. We need specific cultures of civic concern, of mutual responsibility and recognition of the need for resourcing social capital formation.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We tend to define problems of inequality and other ill effects of economic policies and practices as potentially harmful in two spheres: there is a concern that social cohesion will suffer through the creation of an underclass, which is not part of the society. There is also a less defined concern that we may destroy a more general social ethos, a commitment to a fair and just society which may have more general implications than the fate of an underclass.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We are in danger of running down social capital and need to look at the consequences in the UK and USA of social systems which are fragmenting. In the Australian context, we have to be particularly careful when we make major changes to the cultural perception of the public sector and services. This occurs when we reduce the legitimacy and scope of the public sector as the provision of direct government services is part of our social glue.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We have moved our language and sometimes our function of Government away from the concept of a civic culture and citizenship to the market forms of customer and customer service. This was done partly in response to obvious deficiencies in the way bureaucracies delivered services. Many of the practices of the public sector were neither functional or defensible but assuming the market is better is too simplistic a solution.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are many aspects of the ABC that could do with changing. The problems is that the present process is likely to undermine good change rather than encourage it. We are already seeing signs of anxiety, with management opposing coverage of the news of the cuts and internal counter moves. Fear of lack of balance already hobbles some program makers, and will be exacerbated.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Trust in ourselves and in others comes from recognising communality in diversity. Hearing the voices of the outsiders and those on the margins is part of creating social capital. Learning to disagree civilly, to hear other views and voices on services we all own are part of developing social trust. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Inclusiveness defines all of us as worthy of attention and hearing, but if only some of us are heard, the rest become the unknown and the frightening, alien Other. The ABC may not have been good at making enough space for diversity, but it was a damn sight better than anyone else. Yet it is just this access which is being criticised by the PM.

<B>How can they second guess the displeased piper's wanted tunes?</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The criticisms by government ministers are already showing effects so there may be no need to reduce the scope of the charter as the present managers may well turn off the much needed criticisms for fear of other cuts in future years. As an organisation and spokesperson which often puts up ideas outside the present range of accepted ones, I suggest that the coverage is already more timid and criticisms of the budget we have had as milder than necessary.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The cuts will make it harder to hear diverse views on the ABC, particularly those voices generally excluded from commercial media. People outside the 'loop' of accepted alternate views already have some difficulties in attracting adequate time to present less familiar possibilities. The ABC fails often in its will to take risks with new ideas or serious criticisms of accepted views. So the networks only partially balance the conservative and status quo biases of most other media.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In the past few weeks, we have noted that presenters are almost apologetic if they only present critiques of government views and assure the presumably listening Government censors that the other side was, would or will appear shortly. We wish the same concern was expressed every time the Government has a free kick!
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We need a gutsy national broadcaster, so we must preserve and enhance these capacities of the ABC. In particular, we need Radio National because the world in not simple. Many ideas need more than an interview in the midst of strip programming. To reflect and understand the complexities of society and present them well, program makers need time and resources.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We fear the charter may be changed so the ABC becomes exclusive and stops representing all of us. Being a limited minorities station would marginalise the polite minorities further  and exclude the impolite ones.  It will no longer be the public broadcaster. In a time of rapid change, we need connections which enhance the social levels of trust we need to manage change. As a feminist, and someone committed to a more civil society, as someone whose views are often ahead of the mainstream, I am desperately worried that we will lose the capacity we have now to use the ABC to inform debate and create our linkages.

<B>The ABC too timid with alternative views?</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC is accused of being partial to feminists and others who represent less mainstream views. This is not my perception and I am offering this personal view to indicate both the limits of one person's perception and whether of bias against the mainstream or lack of courage to support alternate views. As a frequent broadcaster offering views which may be seen as divergent, I am not satisfied that the ABC offers sufficient space to those promoting outside views. I have often seen media releases from feminist groups lose out to less significant, newsy or interesting stories because of nervous EPs.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
I am often used by EPs and researchers looking for briefings, phone numbers or other support and am willing to assist. I have many opportunities as well to present a comment in response to a question asked, but am also aware that being reasonable may mean that my comments are ignored in favour of more sensationalist approaches. While this is more common on the commercial networks, it also happens on the ABC where working within a combative news style is often more acceptable than exploring the story's dimensions.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
I am often also rejected as commentator with suggestions that I am over exposed. I acknowledge I do have reasonable access but this is mostly on the terms of the producer researcher. It is rarely that I have the capacity to frame my responses and control the issues being discussed. There are many men who are much more exposed than I am. There are regular commentators who are heard week in and out on news and public affairs as well as some of the specialist programs, but are not considered over exposed.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are rare exceptions. As the 1995 Boyer lecturer, I was offered a unique opportunity to develop and broadcast a range of ideas, not otherwise available. As a regular fortnightly broadcaster on Life Matters, I work happily with a group there to put forward ideas which are somewhat different. However, in most other cases, I have little control on whether the interview is used or how it is used.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
My views are validated by their popularity. The 1995 Boyers were the most popular ever, selling 5,000 copies despite poor supply as well as hundreds of copies on the internet while being broadcast. I am still being asked to address conferences as a result of the issues I raised. I also am reassured by the number of people, not only women, who welcome my Life Matters contributions and tell me so at conferences and even in supermarkets.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
I can only assume that there is some embarrassment at the success of the Boyers, and a lack of will to promote a public feminist spokesperson. Despite my wide legitimacy within a range of community organisations, churches etc and my almost mainstream status, there are many ABC producers both in radio and TV who find my views too divergent. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
I include this personal experience as just one example of many  others who have even less access. There are within the ABC many who are timorous, conservative and mainstream and these have considerable influence in the line up. Along with  many others who question many areas of public policy, I am concerned that few programs open up space for discussions of dissident views on any consistent basis.  Overall, these are not views which have received their due air time on the ABC and the programs which do offer time become anxious about their balance. There are some courageous producers, but there are, as in all organisations, many who prefer not to take risks. The ABC is better than the commercials in allowing diversity, but is still not good.

<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
How do you create a risk taking public broadcaster who both supports diversity and reflects the complexity of issues? The lesson from the present situation is that risk taking is not rewarded and being boringly mainstream is the only response. This has to be corrected. We need a funding system which allows the public broadcaster to be relatively free of major cuts and made more responsible for its own funding decisions.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
This is hard because the present culture is against this. The propositions tend to be to limit public spending and therefore the right to make cuts to the publicly funded is left in the public sphere. So maybe there needs to be a legislated base for funding so that at least cuts need to be supported by parliament. Maybe there should be an endowed body which provides at least some funding so that the old idea of the independence of the ABC through the licence fee can be revived in part.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>The charter</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
This should not be limited but expanded to recognise the changing role of media and multi media. The role of the ABC within this new environment needs to be defined, in part, as having a public goods function by being available to all free to air. There should be a restriction on the ABC moving in any substantial way into the provision of commercially based services in this area. Where the ABC develops products as offshoots of its main function as program maker eg Bananas, this is legitimate, but as a publicly funded body, it should not make commercial functioning its primary aim.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The prime focus should be free to air services on radio and TV and offering free services or at cost services on the Net. The corporatisation of the ABC needs to recognise that shifts to commercial operations as a priority,  make the ABC a non productive mix which has no clear brief. The distribution of resources in the new technological environment will be unequal and the ABC charter should possibly include a brief to offer free to air services to balance the system and provide for the information poor, as well as the rich.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC must retain its roles as innovator, to encourage local music production and the arts. While there is support for many of these areas in the commercial and corporate sectors, this tends to be focused on the accepted and safe, so the ABC need to be there to encourage experimentation and the new.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC must be there for all of us. Its role to balance the overall spectrum of broadcasters must be more clearly stated. So without becoming a minorities system, it must provide best practice examples of how a general broadcaster can be inclusive, not discriminatory. So its charter must be to create a national identity by ensuring all are heard so we can all feel part of the whole.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Radio National must be retained, promoted and expanded. </B><BR>
The ABC generally, and RN in particular, need to promote their services as many people are unaware of their existence. I find many of my students are unaware of what is on offer or even the frequency. Yet, for the study they do, they need to listen and when they do, they often become converts. Therefore skimping on promotion is short sighted economy.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Savings should be partly in the management areas. There are probably savings in TV and it may be possible to use limited good overseas material on the local networks to maintain a quality network. Any attempt to water down the network and combine it with the metros, Newsradio or ABCFM will dilute the core functions and lead to an overall loss.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>No strip programming on RN,</B> this is metro territory and is not suitable for the national broadcaster. Retain the idea of produced stories and researched programs at recognisable times. Many RN listeners tune in for specific programs and they are lost if these move around. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>Do not seek out stars.</B> There are possible savings are in the area of personality presenters which have been used on RN and FM. If the ABC grows presenters, that is a benefit for both. If there is a person with particular skills, not available internally, they may be an asset. However, over the past few years there has been a push for developing name presenters which is both expensive and should not be necessary for the RN strand. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Geraldine Doogue is an exceptional presenter, who has won her place on merit and whose interviewing skills make the program what it is. However, trying to match her or find her peer for other programs is not an activity which works. If there is someone like here or Philip Adams, fine, but do not try and recreate these by looking for them.  The idea that other programs need strong presenters is not born out by research or practice. Developing good broadcasters from within is both cheaper and probably more in line with the overall ethos of public broadcasting.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Programs such as Life Matters are very important because they are one of the few areas of 'every day' life which is presented on air. The program offers a model in terms of content in covering a wide and interesting menu of programs and mixing regulars with daily type stories. Geraldine Doogue's strengths are her techniques as questioner presenter which are exceptional but hard to imitate or replace.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>News and current Affairs</B><BR>
Cuts in time for news and current affairs is disastrous for breadth and diversity. 15 minute news allows stories to be covered which are not covered elsewhere and allows for depth. The ten minute format reduces this and five minutes reduces this further. The loss of half of PM and The World Today  will effect serious limits on the topics covered and the depth of cover.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
<B>The changes in RN need to be developed in the context of an overall strategy to maintain at least one network for those who want an overview, whose sense of belonging needs to be placed in a broader context, for those who want to be able to tune in and out but know it is there. A loss of RN as the national channel is a loss of identifiers and markers for us all, even those who rarely hear it. It is the ripple effects of a core commitment to a national broadcaster that benefits us all.</B>

<B>This material has been prepared by Marian Robinson as part of a project as a UTS student.  Time constraints have limited the analysis and the material is presented in summary. We would like the opportunity to offer further material to the enquiry as there is more data collected than has been included. </B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In this submission, I refer in particular to Radio National, which I believe should stay as it is, due to the high standards of its programming.  Radio National offers those who fund it the chance to debate social, cultural, political, and economic issues, and needs to continue to be funded at the present level to maintain its unique quality in a world of sensationalist radio journalism.  The journalistic standards of the ABC are of high quality and the programs are well researched, using qualified and often distinguished guest speakers.  This is what the Australian public have come to expect from their ABC.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Without the investment into research of the interesting range of programs on Radio National such as Radio Eye, Life Matters, Women Out Loud, Awaye, Background Briefing and Educational radio which many people in both rural and metropolitan areas rely upon - covering health, law, education, media and business,  the ABC could be reduced to covering sensationalised 'news stories', as do the commercial stations due to a lack of funding to research these valuable and informative programs.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>

<B>A two day listening sample</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The issues brought up  in a couple of days monitoring on commercial talkback radio by presenters John Laws, Derryn Hinch, Allen Jones are all extremely similar, most coming straight from current news stories in the papers and listeners have to put up with constant advertising.  There are few guest speakers and seemingly no background research on topics as the presenters trot out their bigoted opinions.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The following constitutes some examples of what you could expect to hear on Commercial radio, in a day.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Alan Jones:  Sydney Casino - seeking tax exemption; paralympics; Liberal/National fight over seat belonging to Wendy Machin; Perot - US Elections; Health Services in New South Wales; Hugh Mackay report on people's attitudes; Fire in United States; Ballot coming up for marijuana use for medical purposes - California; Budget; Timber Workers protest; Budget protest in Canberra; a 'bloke' suing his vet about a parrot's broken leg.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
John Laws:  Health services in New South Wales; Budget Protest in Canberra; Wendy Machin's seat - Liberal/National problems; Interview with author of "Travelling Tales"; Man in Detroit shot himself in the penis when asleep;  Women shot herself after pistol fell out of her pants; Stolen baby (Travis) story.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Derryn Hinch:  Reads newspaper headlines for discussion topic frequently. Health cuts in New South Wales - interview with relation of victim of Port Arthur; Liberal/National fight over seat belonging to Wendy Machin; Sport - football;  Celibacy in the priesthood - is it  linked to child abuse?; Change in medicare levy;  hospital closures in New South Wales;  Australian missile carrying ship.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
As you can see, the above shows would not be appropriate listening material for the people who want information.  Their hosts could generally be said to be rude and bigoted, making unnecessary commentary on news topics, which I assume is in order to stir people up enough to phone in to the show.  I found some of the comments quite offensive, especially in regard to women.  Examples of some of the rude comments made include:  Alan Jones calling Jenny George, President of the ACTU,  a Prophetess of Doom (in a very derogatory tone of voice) and stating that she wasn't up to her job.  He also made inane, derogatory comments about Aboriginal, union and student movements: "they all want something for nothing".  As Eva mentioned earlier, John Laws calls women who dare to strive for some sort of independence "Feminazis".  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The presenters are often male so I phoned the station manager at 2UE recently and asked about their EEO and Affirmative Action policies - his reply was that he didn't know exactly what Affirmative Action was, but they didn't have many secretaries there, mostly journalists. He wasn't joking.  With this type of attitude from the Station Manager, I guess one couldn't expect any more from his presenters. 
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Some of the issues raised in a day on Radio National in the same period as the above programs included topics such as changes in Superannuation tax benefits; Euthanasia;  Pyramid Building Society Court Case; United States Elections; Contracting out Public Services; Art in New South Wales Prison Centres;  Ian McFarlane's appointment to the Reserve Bank; Lambing season and cold Weather patterns; Cotton growing Productivity; Pollution in Coffs Harbour; The effects of chemicals on reproduction in humans;  Art auction for Science; Fishing Village program to save seahorses in the Philippines; Economics; Protest in Canberra;  Fitzgerald Enquiry;  Community policing.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There can be no comparison between talkback on Radio National programs such as 'Life Matters' for example, and the simplistic drivel that comes out of the mouths of commercial radio show hosts.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Ron Casey, on his return to radio announced that he was needed on talkback radio because John Laws didn't give people a chance to speak if they disagreed with him and Brian Bury has talkback but there's nothing you could get offended by. ('The Sydney Morning Herald' on 26th August, 1996)  Obviously, the point is that the more offensive you can be to listeners the better the station masters like you.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Without the investment into research of the interesting range of programs on Radio National such as Radio Eye, Life Matters, Women Out Loud, Awaye, Background Briefing and Educational/talkback radio which many people in both rural and metropolitan areas rely upon - covering health, law, education, media and business,  the ABC could be reduced to covering sensationalised 'news stories', as do the commercial stations due to a lack of funding to research these valuable and informative programs.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
It is imperative to maintain the funding of all of Radio National's programs, as this station represents those who fund it.  The public.   The rationale behind the public funding of this institution is to maintain its independence in reporting and programming.  Any interference in this would be seen to be censorship by the Government.   
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Any funding outside of public monies would mean a curtailment of that independence if its reliance was upon commercial interests.  We wouldn't want an ABC presenter to confuse us about whether we were listening to a current topic or an advertisement (advertorial) as is frequently the case on John Laws' program, for instance.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Radio National should not be marginalised into a Specialist station either, its programming policy needs to remain complementary and comprehensive. Why not leave the Charter alone?  Just because it has been in place for 15 years, doesn't mean it has to change.  The reason that there is an 'extraordinary passion for the ABC' is that people like the ABC as it is.  They like the complementary and diverse nature of the ABC's programming.  
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The different facets of the various cultures which make up this country are what makes it so special.  The ABC's Radio National is unique as it reflects this variety of interests in an informed and intelligent way.  I believe the ABC should reflect the multiple facets of our unique national identity, which includes aspects of Anglo-Saxon, Indigenous and a variety of other cultures.  The ABC should not be reduced to a victim of economic ideologies.  It stands out far above the rest and acts as a keeper of our national identity.

<B>Political correctness and balance</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The price of civilised society is eternal vigilance. Too many racist and sexist attitudes are still there and one of the frightening indications of changes in the political culture, is that some appear to be increasingly accepted. The messages being given in the political sphere are that middle Australia is basically Anglo and in traditional families. Recently, there has been a regular process of media scapegoating of groups such as the unemployed, Aboriginal services, refugees, migrants, 'middle class welfare' and those on social security and so on.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The PM, in his attacks on political correctness, has, presumably inadvertently, legitimated more virulent outpourings of the mob, the frightened but ill-informed who are looking for social scapegoats. They are likely to follow populist leaders, including those commentators who explain complex social and economic problems situations by blaming some of the victims. The searchers for simplistic solutions are prey to preachers of social snake oil.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The debate on political correctness, together with the emphasis on the supposed dominance and divisiveness of so called special interest groups, has been used to create tensions about representing minority views. There have been endless reported debates on commercial media about the presumed dominance of the air waves by the PC promoters without any examples ever being offered on local media. Similarly, the  accusations of bias against the ABC by our political masters has been based on selective quotes not on the basis of overall monitoring of the content of ABC radio or TV,  or on the spectrum of  broadcasting.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The fact that the PM and other complainants of bias were accompanied by both the Mansfield review and the budget cuts go to the core of the concept of public  broadcasting.  The conjunction gave a clear message 'don't displease the government or you will be punished!'. That process threatens free speech, and makes it harder for ABC management and staff to make proper professional judgements on what should go to air as they try to second guess their financial masters.  The ABC is owned by the public, not the government of the day, which is why there has been overwhelming support for it during this enquiry.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The existence and effectiveness of public broadcasters must be considered within a broader base of whether they, and they alone, can provide the space and resources which allow them to reflect the social mixes and diverse views which constitute the polity as well the society. There have been complaints that there are too many Aboriginal voices, for instance, but in terms of the totality of radio broadcasting, it is clear there are too few. Similarly the spaces for feminist debates or dissent are extremely limited, so the few opportunities we get on the ABC need to be balanced against the constant attacks on 'feminazis ' by Laws et al.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The rationale behind the public funding of this institution is to maintain its independence in reporting and programming.  Any interference in this would be seen to be censorship by the Government.  Any funding outside of public monies would mean a curtailment of that independence if its reliance was upon commercial interests.  We wouldn't want an ABC presenter to confuse us about whether we were listening to a current topic or an advertisement (advertorials) as are frequently the case on John Laws' program, for instance.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We would see a public broadcasting presence as essential to provide balance in the overall broadcast system, not necessarily to always be balanced within its own programming. The limits of the programming on the commercial media would be exacerbated by any reduction in public broadcasting. It has often been the ABC which has developed new programs for TV and had these taken over by Commercial TV. The standards set by ABC documentaries and current affairs act as a benchmark for producers in other areas whose proprietors may not be interested in quality programs.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Good governance depends on the legitimation of diverse groups and interests. There is no possibility of a totally impartial broadcaster as we all carry within us our own desires, prejudices, interests and awareness. We can only set up frameworks where diversity is possible and the powerful cannot silence the less powerful.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
A public broadcaster must recognise the complexity of social issues, the diversity of views and tastes, the power imbalances which inhibit access to media. The complexity of needs within all social sectors suggests that any loss of breadth or depth within the ABC may result in excluding groups of people and views which have both the right to be heard and which also need to be heard for the development of a healthy society.

<B>The agora or forum</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC rally in the Domain reminds us of the function this space had and still does provide. Like London's Hyde Park Corner, this strip of parkland provides a space where free speech was allowed to all who wanted to bring their soap boxes. Over recent times, the electronic media have replaced the public meeting and personal contact, and displaced public oratory. Therefore the functions of the agora or forum of ancient democracies need to be considered as part of any debate on the role of public broadcaster.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The Greek agora was the open space which served the market, the religious and civil societies, which in small civil communities could share a space in which none was dominant. The Roman forum lay between temples and capitol to provide a space for meetings and discussions. There were many exclusions from citizenship in these city states, such as women and slaves, and their models were by no means ideal democracies in modern terms. However, the basic assumption of spaces for meeting, debating, dissenting and cementing relationships should still remain a core base of a democratic and functioning society.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The importance of media in mass post industrial societies is dealt with in many publications and no doubt, submissions. As part of popular culture, it provides images, interactions and information which shapes and reflects the way we see ourselves, both as identity and relatedness to others. We do not want to deal with the specifics of how these complex roles of media create, affirm and deny  the ways in which we see ourselves, and act, but to suggest that the importance of maintaining a public broadcaster may have increased as a result of the expanding and diversifying of telecommunications, rather than being reduced.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The concept of a national broadcaster of both radio and TV may be misinterpreted as a relic of a simpler past when there was little in the way of alternatives. Then access to government owned public broadcasting would have been part of a developmental, modernising process which also sought to bind together a sparse and scattered population. The problems of the depression years, the need for nationhood and unity during the forties and the sense of unified Australia of the fifties would have been congruent with national broadcaster. Unlike the UK, we started in competition with commercial broadcasting, so our model is not the BBC.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Therefore, there needs to be spaces in which a range of debates can take place, where performances can be offered and enjoyed, and new ideas and concepts can seek both reactions and audiences. The role of news and current affairs is seen often as the pinnacle of the public broadcasting responsibilities, its particular roles as public broadcaster, need to be more than an accurate fact producer role.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
We need analysis and comment, documentaries and reports on other related activities in the community. We need a holistic approach to reflecting, creating and explaining diverse images and contexts for the daily 'news'. The ability of people to hear, see and interpret their lives and what is happening to them, to be able to act on their own behalf and recognise their connections to others, depends at least in part, on the way they see themselves and others on the media.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
At a very simplistic level, a demonstration by a group of 20 people on the news is more significant than 2000 ignored. The presence or absence of issues, of images and information from representation in the media is highly significant in the context of social, political and economic cultures. Those issues and concerns which fail to make it to the media, are often ignored in the community. Those groups whose legitimacy is affirmed by the media are much more politically and socially powerful than those who are ignored or negated.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The agora contains markets and governance as well as culture and faith. Professor Claus Offe from Humboldt University, Berlin, at a recent ANU seminar, set up a modern model of the Agora as a triangle with its angles representing the market, the state and the community. He pointed out that the question for us now was to find the balance between the three institutions so that no one dominates to the point of destroying the fragile balances which make up civil societies
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The ABC in its entirety provides access to a broad range of views and voices and offers its audiences choices. The market sector of broadcasting is limited by the perceptions of proprietors, the biases of advertisers, the limits of managers imagination and the objective of making money. Even though they hold licenses for use of public airwaves and can sell these if they make money, there is little or no obligation for them to be good corporate citizens or to offer services which have a public good component.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Some do in minor ways, either at owner whim, or as a good marketing strategy. However, if we are to see choices as important and public broadcasting as one of the possible benchmarkers of responsible broadcasting there are arguments to retain the present broad charter of the ABC. The existence of a public broadcaster should be seen as a public good rather than a private consumption item as it offers a benefit to all, including those who do not use it, by setting standards of ethical broadcasting and promoting social cohesion by mirroring diverse elements, not otherwise included.

<B>The ABC is not cultural spakfilla</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are many areas which are unbalanced in the commercial markets. In radio, for instance, there are shock jocks whose popularity is defined by their appeal to the ill informed and opinionated. There are also music stations who offer audiences little but sounds and snippets of news. There is a minute but hardworking community radio sector and some very specialised and limited narrowcasting groups.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In market terms, one could say that the people vote with their fingers and seek out what they want. Therefore the argument might go, we should use the ABC to provide only those areas which government would like to see available. These may be news and current affairs as these should not be able to be affected by advertiser or station owners and maybe some cultural programs of limited popular appeal.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
To the cash strapped, the quick fixer or the economistic, such arguments may seem attractive. A public broadcaster which is designed only for minority programming is cheaper than one which offers a universal service. So one puts up arguments about filling the spaces left by the commercials and creating, maybe, programs for the powerful minorities who want the arts and some intellectual programming for the elites. With some news and current affairs and rural programs with some wallpaper of under-researched commentary from personalities and most people would be happy.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
This is the cultural spakfilla model. The public sector is there to provide the content which is not available on the commercials. However, these areas should not cost too much as the public sector should be targeted to the needy. Most of these groups are not needy and maybe pay radio or narrowcasting of these sectoral interests would be appropriate!
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
In radio, the need for ABC networks is more complex to describe. The scope of programming on commercial radio, and its presumed targeting at  niche markets suggests that many ABC audiences could not find homes in the spectrum. A day or two of listening to the talk stations in particular indicates fairly clearly that there are serious problems in removing any of the ABC networks in toto or even in part. See attachment for more detail and descriptions of the difference we monitored between these programs.

<B>The metros</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The present spectrum of ABC stations offer a range of views which may only sometimes be echoed on the commercial media. The greatest overlap is on the metros, and probably some rural stations. However, there are differences here which need to be widened rather than reduced, by which a broader range of people are represented in both presenters and those interviewed. The issues discussed on the networks may overlap but the way they are discussed is often very different.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The culture of the ABC stations recognises that there are diverse views and that diversity is often legitimate. Therefore the approach is often to explore issues rather than use interviews to push presenters' views. The intention is to inform as well as amuse and sometimes the interviews reach a high standard of exploration of complex issues.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
From my own experience of commercial interviews, the level of questions tends to be more superficial, the intention often to showcase the interviewer and sometimes to demolish the interviewee (personality radio). The range of people interviewed tends to be more limited and much of the process is chat, rather than exploration of ideas. This is not a judgement because many of these programs provide a useful function of connecting people through the presenter as neighbourhood focus, but these are not even semi serious interviews.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
There are some good and careful interviewers and presenters on the commercial media. However, these are a minority and the disappearance of the ABC would also put them at threat. The schlock jock approach would be seen to have 'won'. There are few proprietors of radio stations who would experiment with niche styles and audiences as most prefer to flock lemming-like to the shows that please the opinionated and market leading models.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The metros provide an alternative to those who want responsible albeit lighter presenters than on RN. This is an important service and one which should not be lightly abandoned. With their relatively high ratings, these service a wide range of families and offer a genuine choice of voices and views, not easily found elsewhere. However, they often imitate commercial radio by looking for interesting rather than good coverage of stories. And here they differ from the RN culture in the emphases and the depth of research.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The metros are part of an overall culture of public broadcasting which is framed within a charter and an ethos about inclusivity. They also provide a widely heard platform for the news and current affairs services which provide the base for their own and many  commercial services stories in their search for talent and stories. The metros could be improved and some of my criticisms are detailed below. In some ways they are too cautious about innovation and limited even in their broader scope.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The metros have few production and research resources. This is why they are cheaper to run. Like the commercials, they rely on radio news or the morning papers for their stories. However, their role is best understood against the role of Radio National. Their approach is limited and often they do not want the talent to open up the issue past the few points they have set as directions. There are many presenters who have a strong interest in certain areas and show considerable expertise in these. There are others whose backgrounds as journalists makes them inquisitive and they do explore issues. However, their limited resources often defeat good intentions and they offer a better version of personality radio in many cases.

<Font size=5>BOOKS: SOLOMONS ISLANDS CARTOONIST PRODUCES SPECIAL COLLECTION</Font size=5>
<P>
<Font size=4>A Solomon Islands cartoonist-journalist has produced a collection of cartoons while he was at the University of Papua New Guinea. He is now publisher-editor of Solomon Grasruts.</Font size=4>
<P>
<B>By JESSIE WAIBAURU in Port Moresby</B>

<P>
<Font size=3>CAMPION OHASIO, the Solomon Islands' first full journalism degree graduate, is the proud author-cartoonist of the <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/PJR/">Pacific Journalism Review's</A> latest edition, "Ting Ting Bilong Mi".
<P>
The book was launched in mid-October by Unisearch PNG and University of Papua New Guinea Press as a special edition of the Pacific Journalism Review, a biannual publication of the South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information and Development at the University of Papua New Guinea.
<P>
David Robie,lecturer in journalism at UPNG, is the editor of PJR.

</TD>
<TD>
<A HREF="HTTP://acij.uts.edu.au/PJR/issues/current.html">"Ting Ting Bilong Mi"</A> is a cartoon-filled book done by Campion Ohasio, a 25-year
old Solomon Islander from Nariekeara village in South Malaita. He entered the University of Papua New Guinea in 1991 in pursuit of a journalism degree and completed it in 1995.
<P>
A deceptive, quiet person, however, his trenchant abilities with pen and paper soon became apparent to his then tutor senior Post-Courier journalist Leigh Martin, who was tutoring students on Uni Tavur in 1992. Campion was encouraged, and worked on local issues on campus at UPNG.
<P>
At the beginning of 1993 when David Robie, now senior lecturer in journalism and managing editor of Uni Tavur and editor of PJR joined Journalism School at UPNG, he persuaded Ohasio to tackle national issues. At the end of 1994, he was making his mark with regional issue cartoons.
<P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
During the years when <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/UniT_Home.html">Uni Tavur</A> was in a newsletter format, its keen readers would obviously remember the faithful "Tome and Spotty", a feature of Ohasio's cartoon strip "Class of 93". For him it has been one of the most rewarding things that has happened to him as an overseas student studying and living in
PNG at that time.
<P>
A third-born from a family of six, Ohasio is a self-styled cartoonist, without any art lessons. However, his artistic talents and motivation stirred him towards his dream.
<P>
I remember as a first year journalism student in 1994, he had his cartoons done by pen laid out in front of him as he sketched them again using computer graphics.
<P>
In 1992, before he joined Uni Tavur, he worked as a graphic artist and reporter for Solomon Voice, a weekly newspaper in Honiara.
<P>
Last year Ohasio worked on attachment alongside The Independent's cartoonist, Jada Wilson, for two months before moving on to EMTV on attachment.
<P>
In 1986, Ohasio won a cultural exchange opportunity to visit museums and art galleries in Brisbane and Canberra. Two years later, he made another visit to Australia for the World Expo Exhibition.
<P>
He tried getting into art school but ended up studying journalism at UPNG in 1991. However, due to unrest at UPNG over parliamentarians' controversial pay rise the campus was closed for a semester, so Ohasio had to continue in 1993.
<P>
The day before Ohasio left for Honiara, he showed David Robie his new strip character, Toka. 
<P>
Ohasio is now a proud publisher-editor of "Solomon Grasruts",
the Solomon Islands' first pidgin paper and fourth weekly newspaper.

CYBERSPACE, KAVABOWLS AND SUN STROKE NEWS</Font size=5>
<P>
<Font size=4>From virtually no news website of real substance in the South Pacific in 1995, there are now three daily newspapers with regular Web links, two monthly news magazines, two weekly newspapers, one fortnightly paper, a biannual media journal and a daily news service with websites.</Font size=4>
<P>
<B>By DAVID ROBIE in Sydney</B>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<Font size=3>CYBERSPACE is buzzing with relative hyperactivity in the South Pacific. From virtually no news website of real substance last year, there are now (or at least there were at the time of my count in mid-October 1996 before going to press) three daily newspapers with regular Web links, two monthly news magazines, two weekly newspapers, one fortnightly paper, a biannual media journal and a daily news service with websites.
<P>
This is quite incredible. While several leading Australian newspapers now have impressive -- and expensive -- websites, New Zealand has only one daily on line, the Christchurch Press.
<P>
Arguably the most interesting of the new Pacific media websites is <A HREF="http://www.tahitiweb.com/f/info/tp.html">Tahiti Pacifique</A>,  a glossy monthly news magazine . The highly professional and readable design displayed (it could show a thing or two to the three dreary Fiji-based news magazines) is mirrored in the website. And it is probably the only Pacific news site in the class of some of the media sites outside the region.
<BR></TABLE>
<TABLE COLSPEC="L20" BORDER=0 WIDTH=475 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=2>

<TD><IMG SRC="../../images/tahiti.gif" WIDTH=100 BORDER=2>
</TD>
<TD>
Earlier in the year, the online version of Tahiti Pacifique was looking rather dated with a March cover edition ushering in readers to the August website. However, the Alex duPrel-edited magazine underwent an online design revamp. The home page now welcomes readers with the bold scarlet masthead logo and a blurb describing itself as a magazine known for its "free expression, fiesty independence and critical analysis" on local political and economic life.
<P>
It also notes that it is the strongest selling French-language magazine in the French-speaking Pacific. No doubt it is, but this sort of claim always carries more weight with audited figures.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<TABLE COLSPEC="L20" BORDER=0 WIDTH=475 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=2>
<TR>
<TD>But frankly I prefer the old web design with a link straight to the front page and table of contents. You can easily pick up the housekeeping details, address, subscription rates and so on later, if you're still interested.
<P>
The latest edition on line was October with the cover story "Le Matriarcat" and a Gauguinish design of a matriach walking two children to church. (Tahiti Pacifique's covers, when they're acrylic works by Philippe Dubois, are also far better than anything in the English-speaking Pacific news media). Also featured were the Pacific Festival of Arts in Western Samoa and the standard question on the economy asked by most Pacific countries today: "Where are we going?"
</TD>
<TD>
<IMG SRC="../../images/tahitioct.gif" WIDTH=100 BORDER=2>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
In contrast to the class of Tahiti Pacifique  is the tawdry beachcombing look of Al Prince's <A HREF="http://www.fix.net/~wdavis/tahiti-beach-press.html"> Tahiti-BeachPress </A>designed for English-speaking tourists. All I could find as the opener for the past month was a scanned tatty front page cutting of a vahine with a see-through chemise and the unbelievable caption saying, "It doesn't take much to dress up the vahines of Tahiti."
<P>
The first news item headline said: SUN STROKES FROM TAHITI. Perhaps the sun affected the website too.
<P>
The most newsy of the Pacific websites is Papua New Guinea's <A HREF="http://www.wr.com.au/national/">The National</A> by a long shot . Launched in August, it is yet another tribute to the innovativeness of the Malaysian-owned company with the fastest growing circulation in the Pacific. <B>The National Online</B> quickly became popular with PNG nationals abroad starved for both the turbulent social and political news about home -- and also sport.
<P>
Offered by The National, with a delightfully simple but user-friendly design, are home news, editorial (and even letters to the editor), business, sport and a back issue archive. On the day I checked for this review, the big news was Foreign Affairs Secretary Gabriel Dusava being referred to a Leadership Tribunal for an inquiry into alleged misconduct in office, and the aftermath of the temporary gagging of the Ombudman's report on the Port Moresby water scandal.
<P>
A month later, the rival Murdoch-owned <A HREF="http://www.ni.com.au/postcourier/postcourier.htm">Post-Courier</A>  had an impressive launch of its own website which was touted as a big breakthrough for the region. However, readers eagerly looking forward to news were disappointed when first they couldn't get a connection to the advertised URL (it was a demonstration address that had been made public prematurely) and then, when they finally did link up, all they got on line was classified advertising. The Post-Courier  had been hooked up to its Australian parent company News Ltd's online classifieds.
<P>
The negative response to this was so great that the Post-Courier  has probably lost some of its regular readers studying or working abroad to The National when they return home. Both Port Moresby paper websites are not produced by journalists, but by commercial website providers in Australia.
<P>
Down the track the Post-Courier site improved with a home page giving some information about itself, including a travelogue that no journalist would write: "Welcome to Papua New Guinea, one of the most exciting and beautiful nations on earth.
<P> 
"Where are we? The island of New Guinea is the second  largest island in the world. Papua New Guinea consists of the eastern half of New Guinea and several smaller islands including Bougainville, New Britain, Manus and New Ireland. The mountainous spine ..." Yawn. And still no news or analysis. 
<P>
There was a link to the Post-Courier classifieds and a PNG trade directory citing as first entries "betelnuts and mustards", "passport and visa", "buttons", "plant hire" and "second-hand clothing". Also a message in Tok Pisin to the "online world" . People having translation difficulties were invited to contact Post-Courier editor Oseah Philemon.
<P>
Journalists need to reclaim some Pacific websites so that there is real content.
<P>
In Western Samoa, the Polynesian Cafe newsfeed from the <A HREF="http://207.158.218.142./apia.htm"> Samoa Observer</A> was very readable in a no-nonsense way but it was a month old (dated September 11). Top news item was about a reopened inquiry into a former Electric Power Corporation employee accused of sexually assaulting and harassing co-workers.
<P>
Tonga has both the weekly newspaper <A HREF="http://www.netstorage.com/kami/tonga/news/index.html"> Tonga Chronicle</A> and monthly news magazine <A HREF="http://www.netstorage.com/kami/tonga/matangi/index.html">Matangi Tonga</A> on line, thanks to the indefatigable efforts of Taholo Kami who has established a network of websites from Port Moresby to Nuku'alofa. At the time of this survey, Tonga was still smarting over indignant world reaction to the jailing of two editors and an MP/publisher 'Akilisi Pohiva, and the suspension of Parliament. 
<P>
Banner headline (if you can call it that on a website) was SHOCK WAVES AS TONGAN KING CLOSES HOUSE. But, ironically, this news item was from the New Zealand Herald via Kavabowl, another Kami creation (it is believed he is keen to publish a "netzine"). Lead news item in the Chronicle web bulletin was PUMPKIN SQUASH FIRST SHIPMENT. This was about 1800 tonnes of the vegetable being finally en route for Japan three days late.
<BR>
</TABLE>
<TABLE COLSPEC="L20" BORDER=0 WIDTH=475 CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=2>
<TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="../../images/unitcol.gif" WIDTH=100 BORDER=2>
<P>
</TD>
<TD>
Now I have a minor bone to pick with the Chronicle as it claims it is the "first Pacific newsfeed on the Internet". This depends on how this is defined. <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/UniT_Home.html">Uni Tavur</A>, the fortnightly journalism student newspaper, published its 20th anniversary of Papua New Guinea independence (16 September 1995) issue on the Web  along with colour front page graphics and photographs. Since then it has established a daily newsfeed on a website  from its <A HREF="http://www.pactok.net.au/docs/nius/">Papua Niugini Nius</A> wire, established in March 1996. Nius was chosen Best Pacific Website in October 1996. 
Uni Tavur would definitely claim to be the first Pacific "newspaper" online. And this has been done by journalists and  students without intervention by commercial providers.
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 width=475><tr>
This award-winning paper's pioneering role in cyberspace has been thanks to cooperation and support from the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism and the Pactok communications network.
<P>
A word about some of the links to news media in the Pacific. ACIJ's <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/">Online Journalist</A>  has a useful media link; so too does Michael Ogden's <A HREF="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ogden/piir/index.html">Pacific Islands Internet  Services</A>. And Suzanna Layton's <A HREF="http://www.uq.oz.au/jrn/coco.html">CocoNET Wireless</A>  at the University of Queensland is frequently helpful, and my own netzine <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/cafepacific/">Cafe Pacific</A>  has hyperlinks to news media from country profiles.
However, part of Layton's section on Papua New Guinea, in particular, looks remarkably like data compiled in my <A HREF="../david_books.html">Nius Bilong Pasifik</A> including the mirroring of now out-of-date information and typographical errors  (such as Winnie Singarok-- she is actually Weni-- who is listed by Layton as Nau FM news director in a September 1996 update when she has not been in that role for more than a year). Our information was updated last year and has since been revised several times. <I>Note: Singarok was updated to Patrick Patu on Layton's page on November 2 after this article was published).</I>
<P>
Given that just earlier this year Layton was making a jaundiced swipe at Nius Bilong Pasifik for an imagined overlap with her book, many would see this is as more than a touch of hypocrisy.
<P>
Territorial imperatives are out of place in such an insular region. For our part, we welcome the use of our data as widely as possible. Surely that's the whole point.
Layton is also curiously selective with her sources and links. It is just as well there are alternatives.
<P>  
Finally, hot news from <A HREF="http://www.ion.com.au/~banaban/newsrabi.htm">Rabi Online</A>. In mid-October the latest news update was July 20: Item: "Routine tour: On July 3 Major Malo (interim administrator) arrived on a normal round of tour. He left on July 7." End of news.

<Font size=3>Tongan pro-democracy MP and publisher 'Akilisi Pohiva and two newspaper editors have walked free after the Supreme Court ruled that they had been detained illegally.
<P>
Chief Justice Nigel Hampton ordered Pohiva, publisher of the controversial newsletter Kele'a, and Tongan Times newspaper editor Kalafi Moala and deputy editor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, to be set free on October 14. 
<P>
New Zealand civil rights lawyer Barry Wilson, acting for the Commonwealth Press Union, tonight told Asia-Pacific Network from Nuku'alofa that their release was encouraging for emerging democratic freedoms in the kingdom. 
<P>
"The court found that the three had not been covered by the normal safeguards for a trial provided under the constitution," he said. 
<P>
Wilson successfully filed a writ of habeas corpus last Friday after two earlier attempts had failed.
<P>
Amnesty International had declared the three political prisoners and international media freedom groups, and human rights movements had mounted several appeals for their release.
<P>
A petition organised by the the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism and Pacific Media Watch and signed by more than 170 academics, journalists, media commentators and students was faxed to King Taufa'ahau Tupou on Friday seeking his intervention to free the men. 
<P>
Wilson said: "I'm also not happy with the jail conditions under which the men were being held."
<P>
He implied that they were being treated differently as political prisoners. 
<P>
Pohiva had been jailed for contempt of Parliament for 30 days on September 20 after having leaked an impeachment notice against Justice Minister Tevita Tupou.
<P>
Moala and 'Akau'ola were jailed for publishing the leaked document in a front-page story in the Taimi 'o Tonga on September 4. 
<P>
The court found that constitutional provisions such as Clause 10 for trials and sentencing under law, and Clause 11 providing for indictments, defence procedures and the right to call witnesses were breached. 
<P>
It also found that the three men had not been correctly found guilty by the Legislative Assembly of the offence they were accused of Under Clause 70 of the constitution.
<P>
The Tongan government defended its the parliamentary action, saying the journalists broke the law and should be accountable. 
<P>
Earlier, Kalafi Moala had challenged the Parliament over the "historical trial", claiming the three men were given a prejudiced hearing in the Legislative Assembly. 
<P>
In an article in the Tongan Times headlined "We didn't get a fair trial", Moala defended his paper's action in publishing an untabled motion seeking the impeachment of Justice Minister Tevita Tupou for allegedly going to the Atlanta Olympics and being paid full parliamentary allowances. 
<P>
The impeachment notice was tabled in the  Assembly the following week after Pohiva, Moala and 'Akau'ola, were jailed. But the House has since been suspended until the middle of next year. 
<P>
'Akau'ola had earlier been detained in February for 26 hours because of a letter published in the Tongan Times alleged to have "angered" Police Minister Clive Edwards.
<P>
"We firmly believe we didn't do anything wrong," said Mr Moala. "What we published was factual and truthful. It is true that the people's representatives had already signed a petition calling for the impeachment of the Justice Minister because he travelled to the Olympics even though his request for leave was refused."
<P>
Moala said it was also true that the motion had been registered and placed in the deputy speaker's files so had been already in the parliamentary process.
<P>
"This newspaper only reported that the petition had been submitted, the allegations of the petition, and who were the MPs who had signed it." 
<P>
In a separate article, Pohiva said the Justice Minister, who had filed contempt charges against them, should not have been allowed to participate in the parliamentary "jury that found us guilty". 
<P>
A government statement denied speculation that Parliament had been suspended to prevent debate on the impeachment motion until next year, but admitted some MPs had expressed "surprise and disappointment" over the move.

<Font size=4>Parliament jails two journalists and an MP for contempt</Font size=4>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>Media commentators see the jailings of two journalists and an MP whistleblower in Tonga as the most serious threat to media freedom in the South Pacific since the Fiji coups in 1987.

<P>
Gags, threats, defamation cases with the threat of bankruptcy and vilification are nothing new to Samuela 'Akilisi Pohiva. The pro-democracy movement leader who has been a broadcaster and publishes a best-selling "muckraking" newsletter had faced everything he thought the establishment in the Pacific kingdom of Tonga could throw at him. 
<P>
But the imprisonment  on 19 September 1996 of commoner MP Pohiva and two journalists for 30 days for contempt of Parliament has shocked media and human rights circles in the Pacific and internationally. Pohiva, arguably the best-known whistleblower in the region, has waged a decade-long campaign for open government and he exposed the notorious passports-for-sale scandal in his newsletter Kele'a. 
<P>
Most media commentators see the jailings in Tonga as the most serious threat to media freedom in the South Pacific since the Fiji coups in 1987, and coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka, now Fiji's elected prime minister, sees the harsh move as a lesson for journalists. Other critics regard the issue as one of a need for greater professionalism. 
<P>
The latest furore erupted after outspoken weekly newspaper Taimi 'o Tonga (Tongan Times) published a Tongan-language story on September 4 under the headline "Parliament impeaches minister for justice" about an untabled impeachment notice alleging abuse of office against Justice Minister Tevita Tupou. 
<P>
Feuding between some media organisations over the support campaign for the jailed three  Pohiva, Taimi 'o Tonga editor 'Eakalafi Moala and subeditor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola -- has also added a curious twist to the affair. Although Australian news media largely ignored the jailings, in spite of a parallel with five journalists having faced jail or fines in recent contempt of court cases, several organisations treated the issue seriously -- including the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism which established a  <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/ACIJ/Tonga/tonga.html">Tongan jailings update</A> on its Online Journalism website. 
<P>
One of the jailed men, 'Akau'ola had been detained for 26 hours last February after his newspaper published a letter criticising Police Minister Clive Edwards. An Auckland-based Agence France Presse correspondent. Michael Field, who has reported Tongan affairs closely, was barred from entering the kingdom for the Pacific Islands News Association convention in August because of alleged critical writing. 
<P>
As the Tongan government has tried in the past to silence Pohiva and journalists who have tried to shed light on the activities of the administration and Parliament, it moved quickly to stifle dissent over the jailings by suspending the Legislative Assembly on October 4 until next year. 
<P>
King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV used his powers as absolute monarch to close the House after it had voted to impeach Justice Minister Tupou. Tonga's 28-member Legislative Assembly is dominated by 19 unelected representatives of the kingdom's noble families (cabinet ministers are appointed by the King) plus nine elected people's representatives. 
<P>
Shocked Tongans interpreted the closing of Parliament as a way for the monarch to "buy time" for the nobles to regroup as the House faces growing democratic demands. The decision to close the Legislative Assembly, which normally sits until mid-November, was announced in a radio broadcast but the palace would not comment further. 
<P>
According to New Zealand Herald Pacific affairs reporter John Manukia, himself a Tongan, leaders from the Tongan community "did not wish to be identified because they feared that they might be looked upon as questioning the King's authority". 
<P>
Amnesty International declared the three prisoners of conscience -- a term the organisation uses to describe people who are in any form of detention because of their political, religious or other conscientiously held beliefs -- provided that they have not used or advocated violence. 
<P>
In a letter on September 23 to the King, Amnesty International urged the Tongan head of state to exercise his powers to lift the detention orders "immediately and unconditionally". 
<P>
Amnesty said it believed the three men had been imprisoned as a result of their peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and protected by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
<P>
The organisation noted that Article 7 of the Tongan Constitution of 1875 states: "It shall be lawful for all people to speak write and print their own opinions and no law shall ever be enacted to restrict this liberty. There shall be freedom of speech and of the press for ever but nothing in this clause shall be held to outweigh the law of slander or the laws for the protection of the King and the royal family." 
<P>
But the Tongan government reacted bitterly over the flood of international criticism about the jailings, claiming that the men had set themselves up to be "martyrs" and accusing press freedom and other organisations of waging a campaign of "media terrorism" against the kingdom. 
<P>
Acting Chief Secretary 'Eseta Fusitu'a said the government had received a series of "incorrect, unjust, biased and malicious" press condemnation following the jailings and called on protesting media organisations to publish the "facts". 
<P>
In a "background" statement defending government actions faxed to several protesting media organisations on September 26, including the University of Papua New Guinea-based <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/PJR/">Pacific Journalism Review</A> and the <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/">Australian Centre for Independent Journalism</A>, Fusitu'a claimed the issue was not one of "freedom of the press, nor the right of the public to be informed about matters of public interest". 
<P>
She said the issues were "the right of the House and the Minister for Justice to be reported truthfully, and the right of the people to correct information" in a newspaper. 
<P>
"Both of these are fundamental human rights, and are the elementary demands of the principles of natural justice," Fusitu'a said. "Both rights, however, were violated by Moala, 'Akau'ola and Pohiva, and are still being violated by many overseas organisations and media services. 
<P>
"Despite this most regrettable reality, of media terrorism against Tonga, we are still hopeful that reputable media services will one day ask for the facts, and will one day publish them." 
<P>
Fusitu'a acknowledged Agence France-Presse news agency, Radio Australia and Radio New Zealand for contacting the government to seek information, but condemned a 'blacklist" of protesting media organisations. 
<P>
Fusitu'a criticised the World Press Freedom Committee (USA), Australian Centre for Independent Journalism (Sydney), Pacific Journalism Review (PNG), National Press Club (PNG), Pacific Star Pty Ltd (publishers of The National, PNG), International Press Institute (France), Word Publishing Co Ltd (PNG), NZ Journalists Training Organisation (NZ), NZ Engineering Printing and Manufacturing Union, Amnesty International (UK) and the New Zealand Herald and "many other" print and radio media. 
<P>
"The history of the media provides very meagre evidence of voluntary corrections of misinformation. To do so is bad for the actual authors of the misinformation, for the reputation of the media organisation, and of course for their sales," Fusitu'a said. However, a spokesperson for Pacific Media Watch said the Tongan government had failed to recognise the difference between the role of "news gathering" media organisations and those "protesting" over the jailing. 
<P>
Among other reactions, the International Federation of Journalists, the world's largest organisation of journalists, representing more than 400,000 journalists in 95 countries, expressed "dismay" and appealed for their release. 
<P>
"This act of punishment is a clear violation of freedom of expression and opinion," said senior vice-president Christopher Warren in a letter to the King. 
<P>
"Given the widespread anxiety of human rights organisations and journalist colleagues in the Asia-Pacific region, I hope you will intervene to release unconditionally those journalists that have been jailed. The IFJ also asks you to intervene to guarantee the rights of journalists in Tonga, who belong to our member organisation, the Pacific Journalists Association." 
<P>
Warren said the IFJ was concerned that this attempt to punish and intimidate journalists and to impose systems of media control "are an offence to democracy and undermine the capacity of people to participate openly in society". 
<P>
In other reaction, The National newspaper of Papua New Guinea and the Fiji Times published harshly critical editorials on the Tongan government. 
<P>
The National described the kingdom as an "archaic monarchy" and said it needed to change: "'Libelling the Legislative Assembly' is a weak excuse. Upsetting the King would be more to the point." 
<P>
Gagging the three men with jail terms would "keep the country in the dark ages", warned The National. "That era belonged in the 15th and 16th centuries. Today even the famous British monarchy is agonising over its role and trying to change its ancient ways to fit into modern times." 
<P>
The Fiji Times said: "It has driven home the fact that freedom of expression is very much under threat in the Pacific and could very well become a reality in Fiji. 
<P>
"The authorities say 'negative' reports show a lack of respect for them and any such criticism is immediately labelled 'culturally insensitive' -- the facade they hide behind to prevent scrutiny of their actions." The Times praised the courage of Moala, 'Akau'ola and Pohiva. 
<P>
However, Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka says his country has "no business" interfering with the Tongan government's media policy and regards it as a warning to local journalists. 
<P>
While media freedom of expression in Fiji is guaranteed by the constitution, adds coup leader Rabuka, the media has a role to protect that freedom by ensuring at all times that it reports "accurately and fairly". 
<P>
A rift between several Tongan journalists and the major regional media organisation, Pacific Islands News Association, which primarily represents the publishers and owners, and its newly created Pacific Freedom of Information Network, burst into the open. Following a deputation to the king by PINA's administrator Nina Ratulele to seek the jailed men's release, a move widely welcomed in the region, PINA executive director Tavake Fusimalohi angrily resigned. 
<P>
Fusimalohi, general manager of Radio Tonga and a longtime PINA stalwart but personally opposed to Pohiva, was quoted by Radio Australia as saying he had resigned over "personal attacks" against him and the local PINA affiliate, Tonga News Association, by PINA president, Monica Miller, of American Samoa. Fusimalohi says she had accused them of remaining silent over the jailing of their Tongan colleagues. 
<P>
But Ms Miller appealed to journalists in the region not to lose sight of the main reason why the three men were jailed -- the Taimi 'o Tonga had published information which the people of Tonga had a right to know. 
<P>
The following is a summary of events:
<P>
<B>4 September 1996: </B>The weekly newspaper Taimi 'o Tonga published a front-page report under the headline "Parliament impeaches minister for justice" about an untabled impeachment notice alleging abuse of office against Justice Minister Tevita Tupou. 
<P>
<B>19 September:</B> Parliamentary People's representative 'Akilisi Pohiva, Taimi 'o Tonga editor 'Eakalafi Moala and subeditor Filokalafi 'Akau'ola were questioned in a public session of the Legislative Assembly, charged under Article 70 of the Tongan Constitution of 1875 with "libelling the Legislative Assembly" for publishing the text of an impeachment motion against the Minister before it was tabled in Parliament. 
<P>
Pohiva had reportedly admitted to having leaked the motion to the newspaper. 
<P>
After a lengthy debate, the Legislative Assembly voted that the three men were "guilty of contempt of the House" and imposed a 30 day prison term. The three have no right of appeal. Although a majority of the people's representatives voted for the contempt ruling, all seven present voted unanimously against the prison sentence (the overall vote was 10-8 in favour). 
<P>
<B>25 September: </B>An application by the two journalists to have a writ of habeas corpus issued by the Tongan Supreme Court was refused by Acting Chief Justice John Lewis on the grounds that "Parliament is entitled to absolute privilege over its internal proceedings and in that sense it is properly entitled to determine what words or actions will amount to contempt and the action which it should (subject to the provisions of clause 70 [of the Constitution]) impose upon a person whom it finds to have committed contempt of the House." 
<P>
Article 70 of the Constitution provides for the imprisonment for 30 days of anyone found guilty of either (1) speaking or acting disrespectfully in the presence of the Legislative Assembly, or (2) publishing any libel on the Legislative Assembly, or threatening any member or his property. 
<P>
According to the Tongan Government, Judge Lewis confirmed that the prisoners "neither spoke or acted disrespectfully in the presence of the Legislative Assembly."
<P>
The Tongan Government said in its background briefing paper that Pohiva was imprisoned for providing "libellous information" to the Taimi 'o Tonga for publication. The two journalists were imprisoned because they "falsely reported that Parliament was impeaching the Minister for Justice" at a time when none of the procedures for an impeachment under Tongan law had been completed. 
<P>
<B>25 September:</B> The Legislative Assembly voted to accept the tabling of the impeachment motion which, according to the government's explanation of procedure, means that "there is a case to answer". 
<P>
The main reason for the impeachment motion was that Justice Minister Tupou allegedly attended the Atlanta Olympics and received his allowances during the visit without formal permission of the Legislative Assembly. 
<P>
The Assembly comprises the King, the nine appointed cabinet ministers, nine nobles elected by their peers, and nine Peoples' Representatives elected by the adult citizens of Tonga. 
<P>
<B>1 October:</B> Prime Minister Baron Vaea announced Parliament would rise early this year on October 3 as most ministers would be overseas from October 7. 
<P>
He also reportedly explained the decision by suggesting there was not much business before the House. This decision has been regarded as highly unusual in Tonga, and Parliament is not expected to reopen until 1997. 
<P>
<IMG WIDTH=150 BORDER=2 SRC="../../images/kelea.gif">
<P>
<B>Pohiva's newsletter Kele'a.</B>
<P>
The jailings have been the latest confrontation between Pohiva and the Tongan establishment opposed to open and accountable government. During 1993, Pohiva faced five lawsuits -- three libel cases involving damages totalling 180,000 pa'anga, and two gagging actions seeking to prevent him publishing information considered confidential in his newsletter Kele'a, and also to make him reveal his sources. 
<P>
"If these actions succeed it will silence the news media -- it will effectively shut down a free press in Tonga," said Auckland lawyer Nalesoni Tupou, who had himself become exiled from his homeland because of his legal work on behalf of Pohiva. 
<P>
Although Pohiva lost defamation cases totalling more than 60,000 pa'anga in damages, he remained defiant. But he believed the Tongan establishment was trying to destroy him by making him bankrupt.

<Font size=5>FORESTRY: ASIAN LOGGERS PUT SQUEEZE ON 
PAPUA NEW GUINEA</Font size=5>
<P>
<Font size=4>Foreign logging companies, including one with key timber and media interests in New Zealand, have stepped up their pressure on the Papua New Guinea government, demanding that a new graduated royalty system be scuttled. A top logging industry official claims the policy is the "kiss of death" for a planned timber processing industry in the country. But campaigners condemn the government policy as in chaos with landowners being deprived of up to NZ$30 million.

<P>
POWERFUL logging companies in Papua New Guinea have stepped up a defiant campaign to force the government to scuttle its current timber policy and scrap new royalties to landowners. The strategy has drawn angry accusations of "corporate blackmail" from environmentalists and bitter opposition in Parliament from former Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare and the outspoken onetime Forest Minister Tim Neville.
<P>
Top executives of the "big six" Asian-dominated logging companies which control most of the industry in July refused to pay an extra 10 kina (NZ$11.30) a cubic metre royalty on top of current taxes imposed by the government at the beginning of that month at the insistence of the World Bank. Forest Industries Association president Francis Tiong, whose Malaysian company Rimbunan Hijau dominates the industry and owns a fast-growing daily newspaper as well as growing media and timber interests in New Zealand, declared an unanimous decision had been reached not to pay the royalty.
<P>
"There is just no more money," he told his own paper, The National. "You think if there is money to be made, we are going to go to this extent to confront the government? The truth is we are losing money. We are going to close down."
<P>
The FIA executive officer, Jim Belford, warned the government might have planted the "kiss of death" on its dream of establishing a downstream timber processing industry in PNG. Belford also accused the World Bank of being arrogant towards forestry investors in the country and badly misreading the industry rates, timing and distribution. He said that in 1990 the government had collected almost NZ$16 million in export tax while in 1994 the amount had soared to almost $192 million.
<P>
"Since then markets have fallen, costs have increased and the government continues to ignore the plight of the sector," he said.
<P>
However, non-government organisations have boosted their own campaign, launched in mid-July with a fullpage advertisement in the influential weekly newspaper The Independent, declaring: "All forest landholders -- you are losing millions of kina!" The advertisement accused the government of not honouring its promise to pay landowners $26 a cubic metre on existing prices.
<P>
Placed by the landholders legal group Individual and Community Rights Advocacy Forum (ICRAF) and funded by Greenpeace, the advertisement pointed to Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta's budget speech last November 21, 1995, when he said: "I am introducing a new tax and landowner royalty system which will go into effect immediately." But, said the advertisement, while the government had already started imposing the new export tariff taxes, the graduated royalty for landholders had been delayed under pressure from the logging companies.
<P>
Under the budgets new graduated royalty system, landholders were promised up to $26 a cubic metre plus 7.5 percent royalties. But Forest Minister Andrew Baing refused to implement the new system. It is understood that the Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, wrote to him to sign the necessary papers to ensure the country abided by its conditions for the World Banks structural adjustment program. However, Baing announced at a press conference that only a partial implementation of the budget promise would take effect from July 1, 1996. And there would be no back payment.
<P>
Currently royalties paid to landowners amount to between $4.50 and $5.65 a cubic metre. Baing has increased that amount to between $6.8 and $11.30 (10 kina). The market value of logs is about $180 a cubic metre.
<P>
Environmentalists quickly attacked the new national forest policy, tabled in Parliament late in July, claiming it is really "a business brochure to tell everybody what remains to be logged". Instead, they have drawn up an "alternative NGO forest policy" which calls for the major emphasis to be shifted to small and medium scale community forest projects. It also emphasises the need for women to be involved in all aspects of forest-related development.
<P>
The policy also sparked bitter condemnation in Parliament from provincial governors Sir Michael Somare of East Sepik -- the "father" of the nation -- and Tim Neville of Milne Bay. Somare and Neville claimed the amendments, presented along with the National Forest Plan and the PNG Logging Code of Practice, would thrust Papua New Guinea back to the days before the mid-1980s inquiry by Judge Tos Barnett found widespread corruption and that the forest minister had too much power at his disposal. Somare added that the amendments were designed to enable the minister to appoint "yes minister" people to the Forest Board.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Forest (Amendment Bill) 1996 was passed in late July with an overwhelming 42-19 vote after the government gagged debate for the third reading. This restored total ministerial control after Forest Minister Baing had earlier sacked authority managing director Jean Kekedo apparently because her board had blocked too many government-backed logging concessions. Attempts by former Attorney-General Bernard Narokobi, a human rights lawyer and opposition MP, and outspoken Lae MP Bart Philemon to challenge the government before the final vote on the Bill were silenced by the government.
<P>
Over the past 18 months there has been a slowdown of log exports from Papua New Guinea because of changes in the export market, political setbacks for the loggers and a protracted wet season. An estimated 15 million hectares, worth $113 billion, of lowland rainforest remains. More than half of this is already allocated for logging.
<P>
Brian Brunton, an ICRAF lawyer and former National Court judge who is also a forest specialist for Greenpeace Pacific, says government activity remains centred around continued export logging. Politicians, officials and loggers have close alliances.
<P>
"Forest regulation is politicised, with honest and professional administrators too frightened to speak out," he said. "Information and statistics are hard to come by. The sole concern of the government is logging and planning future logging. No attention is being paid to conservation needs, biodiversity priority, and non-timber use of the forests."
<P>
Brunton had been a highly effective NGO representative on the Forests Board. But he was dumped by Forest Minister Andrew Baing in a shake-up that favoured the pro-logging lobby. Among the newcomers is Francis Tiong, head of the Rimbunan Hijau group of companies in Papua New Guinea whose Sarawak-based parent company also has media and timber interests in New Zealand.
<P>
Since the powerful head of his parent company, Datuk Tiong Hiew King, told a world forestry forum in Dublin last month that the "combined forces of anti-logging activists and organisations" had distorted the economies of developing nations, Francis Tiong's campaign has become more high profile.
<P>
"The industry, the FIA, is saying that there is no more affordability for the operators,""Tiong said, speaking for the six major operators -- Cakara Alam, Open Bay Timber, Rimbunan Hijau, Stettin Bay Lumber Company and the WTK group -- and smaller FIA members. "If the government wants to give more to the landowners, then it must come from the government's portion."
<P>
Francis Tiong warned that if loggers were forced to close down, the country would lose some $450 million to $565 million. The flow on from this loss would mean two or three times this figure and more than 10,000 jobs would be lost.
<P>
FIA executive officer Jim Belford claimed the royalty increase was the straw that would break the industry's back. He argues that the industry is being asked to pay an average of more than 50 per cent of income in tax revenue -- 36 per cent to government and 15 per cent to landowners.
<P>
After operating costs, most companies were operating at a loss, Belford claimed. He said some companies had the financial background to make a go of major timber processing plants "but the right conditions are not in place". Belford said it was uncertain when the policies would be changed as had been promised. 
<P>
"Nobody will put one kina into processing because it will be a kiss of death," Belford said. "And the government's stated policy of downstream processing will be stillborn. It will come to nothing."
<P>
Following a recent visit to Malaysia by Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, a government promise to change its policy was widely publicised. Noted PNG's biggest daily newspaper, Post-Courier, the Malaysian timber lobby had grabbed a golden opportunity to lobby Chan.
<P>
"Malaysian executives have not made any clear commitment to downstream processing of logs ... This is not acceptable to PNG. They must make a clear statement on their intentions and that statement has not been made," the paper said.
<P>
According to Brian Brunton, landowners have lost up to $30 million in unpaid royalties since the beginning of the year when the graduated system should have come into force under the budget. At the same time, the government had collected its increased graduated log tax which was introduced at the same time.
<P>
Landholders in PNG were "locked into a set of colonial contracts" which put most of the logging surplus into the hands of loggers and the government, Brunton said. He condemned the new national forest policy for using "inaccurate, confusing and misleading" maps. "The plan also fails in any way to address the needs of women," Brunton says. "And it does not comply with the Forestry Act, because the act says that the plan must be based upon a certified national forest inventory which has never been done." 
<P>
One analyst, Professor Ron Duncan, said in 1994: "The Melanesian logging contract arrangement distributes revenues from the sale of logs (which belong to customary landowners) in a manner which is economically unjust, and needs to be changed radically."
<P>
Brunton says the new initiatives will not alter this: "What the forest minister is doing is trying to confuse landholders. He will not succeed because K10 a cubic metre in the hands of landholders -- less 15 percent to the provincial gopvernment and less 5 percent withholder tax -- is not enough."
<P>
ICRAF has called for a complete overhaul of the way in which landholders sell their trees. Says Brunton: "Landholders should not have to sell their timber rights for a royalty. They should sell their trees on a coupe by coupe basis -- and be paid a market price." He believes this would encourage landholders to manage their timber assets in a businesslike manner, and help conserve resources for future generations. This would protect the environment.
<P>
But Brunton and other campaigners face an uphill battle against an all powerful logging lobby that is believed to have widely bought influence with cabinet ministers, and which has a daily newspaper to support its agenda.

<h1>No news on Bougainville</h1>
<Font size=3><B>PMW01: 7 November 1996
<P>
News about the conflict on Bougainville has often been hard to get, and it's not always due to the Papua New Guinea military blockade. In 1989, an incident at Channel Nine about a news report on Bougainville, led to a 'media chill', writes MAX WATTS.</B> 
<P>
<HR>
<P>
ON OCTOBER 4, 1989, Channel Nine axed its early morning news program declaring cost savings were necessary. At the time the Nine Network was owned by now-jailed businessperson, Alan Bond, and the dropping of the news seemed like just another move in a tightening media market.
<P>
At that time, Bryan Murray was an Associate Producer for National Nine News; he remembers the cancelling of the program.
<P>
"One morning I came to work, and learned that our daily 6 am news program was, as of today, cancelled.  When I asked the obvious question: 'Why?' I was told that a Port Moresby politician had been angered by some news item we had broadcast.
<P>
"This minister had, so I was told, spoken directly to Alan Bond, who then owned the National Nine Network, or to Managing Director, Sam Chisholm. His message was passed down to our news chief, Ian Cook.
<P>
"Cook, according to my anchorman, Eric Walters, called a meeting of senior news personnel and said: 'We have to bend over, and give them whatever they want'. And he killed our program."
<P>
Ian Cook, then News Chief at TCN Nine, and now Head of News at Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Ltd, BSB, denies there was any decision to restrict reporting on Bougainville, nor any memo instructing staff about the matter.
<P>
Sam Chisholm, then Nine's managing director and now Head of BSB, declined to make any comment to the claims.
<P>
Alan Bond, presently in jail in Perth, has not commented following questions being submitted to his solicitor.
<P>
The program's anchorman, Eric Walters, says he remembers the incident well. Now semi-retired, Walters says that there had been complaints about the National Nine Early Morning News program's coverage of news from Papua New Guinea.
<P>
"I remember, I got very very angry. Somare had complained about our coverage, and whether it was right away or later, anyway, the bulletin was cancelled.
<P>
The news program had run an item about Bougainville featuring PNG's foreign minister Sir Michael Somare, the nation's first prime minister and the 'father of the nation'. Some file footage was added to the story, but a mistake was made, and footage of Walter Lini, prime minister of Vanuatu, limping following a stroke, was shown. Somare was reputedly furious.
<P>
"Cookie, he was annoyed at my questioning this decision [to cancel that entire program]," says Walters.
<P>
"Cookie said to me that Somare had us 'dead to rights' because we had run file footage which we had not put a super on. We had messed up, failed to identify it as file footage."
<P>
Walters says he thought this cock-up relatively unimportant and no excuse for cancelling a whole news program.
<P>
"I certainly had that conversation within Ian Cook, and what he said was 'Sometimes we've just got to bend over'."
<P>
Murray remembers that the event was followed up with a memo to staff. "A few days later Mr Cook sent out a computer memo to myself and other members of the Sydney news staff. 
<P>
"The gist of this memo was unforgettable: 'No stories would be broadcast about the Bougainville uprising unless we could confirm the facts directly'."
<P>
"This was a tall order since we were relying heavily on wire service reports and no correspondents had been sent to Bougainville, although we clearly had the resources and the technology to do so. We had dispatched correspondents as far afield as far northern Alaska to glimpse a whale trapped in the ice."
<P>
Walters too remembers a memo later about the matter, but not all its details, except the general thrust that they were only to report on Bougainville when every fact could be checked. 
<P>
Another Nine News staffer at the time, who is still in the industry and doesn't want to be named, says, "There certainly was a memo about this news incident involving PNG and Bougainville. The complaint was passed to Channel Nine where it bounced downhill to the people concerned."
<P>
Murray was then 35 and, in his own words "fairly jaded", but at that point in his journalism career he had "never seen such a blatant attempt to quash media coverage, particular of something so newsworthy as a shooting war just off the Australian mainland."
<P>
Murray says that at the time neither he nor the other, younger journalists and producers with whom he worked at TCN did anything. "They kept silent and went home to their mortgaged units; I eventually went back to America. I too kept quiet."
<P>
Murray says he was prompted to come out and tell of the incident now after seeing information on Bougainville on the Internet. "I remain haunted about Bougainville, and troubled by that 'chill' on the media."
<P>
<Font size=6>E</Font 6>MTV -- owned by Channel Nine -- had started broadcasting in PNG in early 1989. Alan Bond had purchased the Nine Network from Kerry Packer in 1987 for $1,055 million. In July 1990 Packer bought it back for just $200 million; Packer commented at the time: "You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I've had mine".
<P>
Sam Chisholm, then Nine's managing director and now head of BSB, was sent questions about the incident. His office responded saying that "he doesn't think he can help".
<P>
Alan Bond is presently in jail in Perth under appeal. His solicitor, Susie Cameron from Galbally, Fraser and Rolph in Melbourne, agreed to pass some questions about the matter on to him. There has been no reply.
<P>
Ian Cook had been News Chief at TCN Nine at that time. Now he is Head of News at Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Ltd, BSB.
<P>
He responded to questions about the incident by fax from his England office. "I did not receive any instruction, complaint or advisory from him [Bond], from anyone associated with him or from any member of management regarding our coverage in Bougainville," he says. "I have absolutely no recollection of any meeting or memo even remotely similar to those you have described."
<P>
Bryan Murray was understanding. "I've been a small town TV news director, I can appreciate some of the pressures on a guy in Cook's position. 
<P>
"I have a lot of respect for him. He may have been on our side, fighting those battles in his own way," says Murray.
<P>
"We knew we had to lay off Bougainville, but they would never admit that."
Murray says he felt that it was more than the cock-ups that were the justification for killing the show and sending the memo.
<P>
"We all knew it; Channel 9 bowed to outside pressure," says Murray. "Bougainville was definitely heating up and we were definitely, specifically told to leave it alone."
Paul Fenn, then second-in-charge and now Head of News at Channel 9, is quite definite. He says that the 6 am news had been axed on October 4, 1989 "to cut costs". Three other Nine programs had also been cancelled on the same day in an industry-wide economy drive.
<P>
Fenn assured us that these decisions were purely commercial, and had nothing to do with any outside criticism or pressure concerning PNG or Bougainville. But he does remember the memo.
<P>
"Oh yes, there was a memo. There was a complaint from the PNG Government, probably, I don't remember, through Sam Chisholm, the Managing Director, -- or Ian Cook -- rather than through Alan Bond. About a couple of what they conceived as misreporting, as well as the misidentification of Michael Somare.
<P>
"And we were all told to be careful, with our facts out of Bougainville. Unless we could check things it was better not to run anything rather than be incorrect; unless it can be confirmed."
<P>
"It would have been dangerous [to go there], but more of the reason, rather than the danger, was that it was impossible to get in there.
<P>
"In practice that meant that news from Bougainville simply dried up."<P>

Starving East Timorese children in Laga, East Timor.  The famine in East Timor, while largely unnoticed by the world, has been described as "as bad as Biafra" by the International Red Cross.  Starvation became widespread in 1979 as communities, subjected to bombardment in the mountains, were unable to grow food supplies.  These photos were published on the front page of "The Sydney Morning Herald" at the time, subsequently causing a storm of criticism from Indonesia.</p>

Indonesian 'Red Beret' Special Forces arriving at Bacua airfield in November 1987 to begin a 'clean up' campaign against the resurgent Timorese resistance.  This airfield has been taken over by the Indonesian Military.  Nearby is a notorious detention and torture centre.  Indonesian troop numbers in East Timor have been estimated at about 40,000 in the period 1979 to 1981.  Current numbers are around 15,000 or more.</p>

Dawn on Mount Matebian.  In Timorese mythology the lofty Mt. Matebian (nearly 10,000 ft high) is believed to be the resting place of the souls of the dead.  Untold numbers of East Timorese died on this mountain in the early 1980's when they were forced to retreat up its side and were subjected to extensive aerial attack with bombs and napalm.  Now people participate in an annual pilgrimage to the summit in remembrance of those who died in the distant past, and the many whoses graves litter the mountain now.</p>

</CENTER>
 
<P>IN THE inner Sydney suburb of Glebe, John Hutton is going through
his files, pulling out letters and documents which he hopes will 
tell his story. Behind him on a wall is a framed sketch which 
appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald in October 1984. It depicts 
Hutton giving evidence before the Maralinga Royal Commission. 
Hutton draws out the now yellowed press clipping which features 
the drawing. There was no mention of what happened to him, he 
says, waving it in the air, &quot;not one&quot;. 
<P> 
In 1956, Hutton was a 19 year-old field engineer working for the 
army at Maralinga, the plain in South Australia where the British 
government conducted their now infamous atomic tests during the 
1950s and 1960s. In 1984 when the Hawke government set up a royal 
commission to investigate the tests, Hutton was called as a witness. 
His tale of finding an Aboriginal family living in a bomb crater 
was to be one of the more chilling anecdotes in the year- long 
hearing. 
<P> 
More than ten years since he recounted that story, Hutton's bravado 
is fading. Like more than 45 other atomic ex-servicemen and widows, 
he is waiting for his compensation case against the Commonwealth 
to be heard. Like hundreds of others, his claim lodged under the 
workers' compensation legislation has been rejected and the Federal 
Court is the only path left. But Hutton is not counting on victory. 
&quot;The government doesn't want any part of us,&quot; he says. 
&quot;They just want us to go away and die. It's as simple as 
that, and the quicker we do, the better.&quot; 
<P> 
When the recommendations of the royal commission into British 
nuclear tests in Australia were tabled in parliament in December 
1985, none of them dealt directly with compensation arrangements 
for the ex-servicemen. Although the head of the commission, the 
then Justice James McClelland, has argued it was not the commission's 
role to look into the system of compensation, veteran groups which 
were fundamental in pushing for the inquiry, felt their claims 
were effectively ignored. For Hutton, the Royal Commission was 
an &quot;utter farce&quot; and the ex-servicemen are the &quot;forgotten 
victims&quot; of Maralinga. 
<P> 
In the decade since the royal commission, few of the 12,500 servicemen 
employed by the Australian army, navy and airforce to work at 
the test sites have received compensation for their involvement, 
There has been no lump sum settlement to them as a group and, 
since the commission, only one case through the courts has been 
successful. 
<P> 
Like other government employees who allege work-related injury, 
the ex-servicement have also been able to claim under the workers' 
compensation legislation. This legislation underwent a multitude 
of changes until the Military Compensation Scheme (MCS) was introduced 
last year and the department in charge of the claims was shifted 
in late 1991 from Comcare, the agency in charge of government 
employees' compensation, to the department of Defence. 
<P> 
The many changes have added to the confusion and feelings of neglect 
amongst the ex-servicemen, although the basic requirements for 
claims have remained largely the same. tp qualify for benefits, 
the ex-servicemen must be able to prove on the balance of probabilities 
that they were exposed to radiation, their illness was caused 
by radiattionm and was a direct result of their work for the government. 
<P> 
Yet out of the 11claims investigated by the Department of Defence 
since late 1991 only one has been successful and of the 390 claims 
lodged with Comcare just over 20 were allowed. Instead of restitution,
 the ex-servicemen have found themselves at the centre of a legal 
and medical dilemma which no-one seems able to solve. 
<P> 
Glen Tye is the Assistand Diorector of Compensation and Rehabilitation 
in the department of Defence. While he argues his department is 
sympathetic towards the ex-servicemen, there is nothing it can 
do to further accomodate them. &quot;We are certainly not about 
knocking out claims,&quot; he sys, &quot;but we are talking about 
a long, long time ago when people's memories are fairly sketchy. 
<P>

</FONT></CENTER><BR>
<P>In 1987 Ric Johnston was awarded $867,000 damages for anxiety 
neurosis and agrophobia, successfully arguing his sicknesses were 
a result of working as a RAAF transport driver and mechanic at 
Maralinga in 1956. In 1994, another ex-serviceman wasn't so fortunate. 
Wesley Dingwass claimed his mental difficulties, including nightmares, 
flashbacks and a drinking problem, arose after his work in the 
army canteen 30km north of Maralinga. He lost his case. The judge 
concluded that most of Dingwall's anxieties were generated later 
when reports started surfacing in the 80s about the extent of 
radiation at Maralinga. The third case is still before the Federal 
Court. In the first cancer case of an ex-servicemanm Pedro Cubillo 
is alleging his kydney cancer was caused by exposure to alpha 
radiation while he was working as field engineer at Maralinga 
in 1957 and 1958. What safety precautions were in place at the 
time, how much risk was there, did the government do everything 
it could to prevent the risks are just some of the issues being 
addressed, as well as the inevitable question of how much radiation 
exposure Cubillo was actually exposed to and if that amount 'materially 
contributed' to his cancer.

<I>Between 2.5 and 3.5 million Filipinos work in over 140 countries.
More than 2,000 are in overseas jails, two were beheaded in Saudi
Arabia, one was hanged in Singapore, thousands suffer slavery
and abuse. What are the Philippines and the world doing about
it?<A HREF="#Lia Timson"> LIA TIMSON</A> reports.</I>
<P>
THE March execution of Filipino domestic worker Flor Contemplacion
in Singapore symbolised over two decades of exploitation and injustice
for Filipino workers worldwide.
<P>
The implications of her hanging have been felt beyond the shores
of the Philippines and Singapore, causing many to question the
role played by the Philippines and other governments in exploiting
what has been called &#147;an internationally shared resource&#148;.
<P>
Maria Elena Ang, an activist with the worldwide Filipino alliance
group Migrante and chairperson for the Centre for Filipino Concerns
(CPCA) in NSW, believes Flor Contemplacion was innocent. Mallen,
as she likes to be called, was at the University of Technology,
Sydney in May to address students on the human rights issue facing
millions of Filipinos working overseas.
<P>
&#147;Flor did not have the support of the [Filipino] consulate
officials. She was advised to confess to the crimes so her sentence
would be shortened,&#148; she said.
<P>
The Singaporean Government that hanged Contemplacion has admitted
to the use of &#147;extra firm methods&#148; to extract confessions.
Mallen talks from experience: &#147;I&#146;d say [that means]
torture. I&#146;ve been a torture victim myself.&#148; She understands
the pressure to confess to crimes one may not have committed.
<P>
The widely publicised case of Contemplacion, who was charged with
killing another maid and her ward, is just the tip of the iceberg
that is the Filipino Government&#146;s Labour Export Policy.
<P>
The Policy dates back to the late 1970s when the Government took
over from illegal recruiters and established Overseas Development
Boards to organise, legalise and benefit from the exporting of
Filipino labour.
<P>
Today, between 2.5 and 3.5 million Filipinos are categorised as
Overseas Contract Workers (OCWs) working in more than 140 countries.
<P>
Every year over 700,000 Filipinos join those already overseas
in search of a better life. &#147;They would rather take the risk
of going abroad, as long as they think there is even just a little
hope of doing better,&#148; says Boots Medina from Kangulan, a
Filipino non-government organisation focusing on migrant issues.
<P>
Around 60 per cent of all Filipino OCWs are women, many married
with children, who leave all behind because they feel extra responsibility
to care for their families.
<P>
A report entitled Filipino Migration to Canada, by the Philippine
Women Centre in Vancouver, explains the Filipino world migration
has happened over three decades in a pattern easily defined as
three waves.
<P>
The first wave in the late 1960s accounts for the nationals who
went abroad in search of jobs appropriate to their academic qualifications.
It is reported they were mostly professional nurses, midwives,
medical technicians, managers and engineers who fled to countries
such as the USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Austria, Britain, Germany
and Switzerland. Mallen said American hospitals, for example,
would collapse today if Filipino workers were to walk out; such
are their numbers. 
<P>
The second wave, in the 1970s, is linked to the declaration of martial law in the Philippines in 1972. Similarly to Maria
Elena, who believed the introduction of the law was a threat to
the freedom of the Philippines&#146; nationals, average citizens
fled the country, this time in search of freedom. They were mostly
textile, manufacturing, sales and clerical workers. This coincided
with the relaxation of immigration laws in the USA, Canada and
Asia, where cheaper labour was now needed. It also coincided with
the economic boom in Hong Kong which demanded extra labour from
neighbouring countries.
<P>
The third wave, the one most interlocked with human rights abuse,
came in the 1980s and still continues. This time, Filipinos, mostly
women, are leaving their homeland and their families because of
the worsening economic and political crisis. According to a Hong
Kong report presented at the International Consultation of Migrante
in December last year, the majority of all Filipino migrants are
professionals (teachers, accountants, engineers, architects) or
university graduates and even government employers. Most are aged
between 20 and 39.
<P>
Regardless of their background, the great majority are domestic
workers. For example, maids account for 90 per cent of the 140,000
Filipinos working in Hong Kong. The Philippine Women Centre in
Vancouver also reports that, between 1982 and 1991, more than
30,000 Filipinos were legally admitted into Canada as domestic
workers.
<P>
Australia would be forgiven for thinking Flor Contemplacion&#146;s
case is one in a million given the limited press coverage other
events have had. But research conducted by Snoop reveals the extent
of the problem created by a lack of meaningful government protection
from both the Philippines and the host countries. There have been
two reported cases of beheading of maids in Saudi Arabia. Last
year, 42 Filipinos were shipped back dead from Saudi Arabia to
their homeland. Migrante said no government enquiry followed.
<P>
In Japan, where a great number of Filipino workers are employed
in the entertainment industry, 30 Filipinos have been killed or
are reported missing but there have been no questions asked by
the Filipino authorities. World Vision of Australia reports that
one maid working in Singapore &#147;was blinded by her employer
because she forgot to hang some clothes in the wardrobe&#148;.
<P>
In late May, another Filipino domestic worker jumped off a Hong
Kong building for fear of prosecution after been found working
a part-time job. 
<P>
Over 2,000 Filipinos are remanded in overseas jails, 26 facing
death penalties. CPCA believes Filipinos are being used as scapegoats
for other peoples crimes. Being incriminated is just one of the
abuses suffered by Filipino OCWs. Other infringements of human
rights vary from simply being overworked and underpaid &#151;
some Hong Kong maids are reported to work 20-hour days &#151;
to physical and verbal abuse, racism, rape and confiscation of
passports until their &#145;debt&#146; is paid off. Some are forced
to surrender to sexual favours and prostitution to service the
debt. This is determined by some of the employers and may include expenses such
as initial airfare, accommodation and daily meals.
<P>
Poe Gretela, secretary-general for Migrante worldwide, said the
Philippines are wary of complaining about maltreatment of their
nationals by host countries in fear of jeopardising their continuous
intake of labour. Already the Foreign Maids Employment Agencies
Association in Singapore has begun importing workers from Sri Lanka instead.
<P>
Gretela, who himself was a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia is now
unemployed in the Philippines. He said the government has failed
to fix the internal unemployment and underemployment problems,
and it is not willing to enter bilateral agreements with labour
importing nations to protect workers. 
<P>
&#147;At present, the government itself is one of the problems.
They are creating laws and policies which they call protection,
but in reality they are a burden for the migrant workers,&#148;
he said.
<P>
Former Philippines Labour Secretary and International Labour Organisation&#146;s
(ILO) chairperson, Nieves Confesor was reported as saying: &#147;Filipino
overseas labour should be viewed as an internationally shared
human resource, whose work benefits both the host country and
the Philippines.&#148;
<P>
Migrante&#146;s Gretela refutes that view: &#147;That is very
degrading. How can you share your migrant workers when they are
treated as modern slaves in different countries. The expertise
of the migrant worker should be used for the development of our
own country and secondarily for the development of other countries
&#151; not to provide &#145;entertainment&#146; and cheap labour
for foreign capitalist [countries].&#148;
<P>
Migrante&#146;s long term goal is to create an attractive domestic
economy so workers will not have to go overseas to support their
families. The organisation is currently lobbying the Government
to end invitations to capitalist nations to invest in the Philippines,
as they believe this would further contribute to the worsening
of local employment. They want the Government to change its policies
on OCWs, so they don&#146;t have to sacrifice their rights to
earn a living. &#147;Maybe that&#146;s one reason why we are called
modern day heroes, because the Government really intends to sacrifice
migrant workers,&#148; Gretela said. &#147;The workers are really
in the losing end.&#148;

</B></FONT><BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
<I>One generation's tour of duty is fast becoming the next generation's
pleasure dome. Twenty years after the end of the war, Vietnam
is experiencing an invasion of another kind as young tourists
flock to see the land that  preoccupied a generation and spawned
decades of Hollywood blockbusters. <A HREF="#DAVID BROWNE">DAVID BROWNE</A> reports.</I>
<P>
IN THE city of Hue, Vietnam&#146;s ancient imperial capital, I
join a group of tourists in a cafe while they discuss the one
topic it seems impossible to avoid - The War. Arguments are being
made confidently in German, Irish, and English accents.
<P>
Comparing the attitudes of young Western travellers and a Vietnamese
of the same age, you get the impression they are talking about
totally different events that happened in a different place. 
But they are talking about the same war. The tourists are bringing
with them interpretations of the war that are at odds with both
the official Hanoi government history and the experiences of people
who lived through it. 
<P>
Most backpackers know Vietnam as the backdrop for popular movies
and TV series. For most of their lives it was the hyper real setting
for unofficial versions of the war like Rambo, Tour of Duty, and
Hamburger Hill that show the American troops as the good guys
betrayed by both their own nation and a brutal faceless enemy
that refuses to stand up and fight. There is an overbearing sense
that the victory was within the grasp of the Americans but somehow
it was thrown away. Many of the Vietnamese are surprised Westerners
have such strong opinions about an event that happen 20 years
ago. 
<P>
For America the loss was seen is an humiliating failure and for
the Vietnamese it marks the beginning of a period of international
isolation and a slide into poverty. The small, former French colony,
with its agricultural economy, was shattered by massive American
firepower in the North while huge amounts of American aid in the
South virtually crippled the local economy. 
<P>
But while Vietnam was cut off from the rest of the world, the
West  was cut off from Vietnam, and 20 years later people are
still trying to make sense of the war.
<P>
As the anniversary of Saigon&#146;s fall approached and passed
earlier this year the media was saturated with opinions from people
who planned the war, fought in the war, or fought against the
war. It raised massive contradictions, many of which still are
unresolved. It was a war fought on behalf of democracy, though
America&#146;s failure was blamed, by some, on weaknesses in the
democratic system. It was a war where the world&#146;s largest
industrial nation was defeated by a peasant army from a backward
agricultural country, and although it was called an unpopular
war, no other conflict has been as thoroughly reported, reviewed,
and recreated by the media. 
<P>
In the mid 1980&#146;s, before both the USSR and China, Vietnam
began to loosen control of its centrally planned economy. Since
then, despite some teething problems, it has been in a constant
upward spiral of economic growth.  Last year when US President,
Bill Clinton, lifted America&#146;s 17 year economic embargo outlawing
virtually all trade with Vietnam, the economy moved into a boom
cycle similar to other South-East Asian countries like Thailand,
Malaysia, and Indonesia.  
<P>
Tourism is an important element of the Vietnam government&#146;s
economic revival. It brings in the hard currency needed to pay
for repairs to the nation&#146;s war damaged infrastructure. While
the mainstream tourist industry is still underdeveloped, Vietnam
has become a popular destination for the bottom end backpacker
and young travellers prepared to rough it in the run down hotels
and relatively primitive conditions. During the last five years
the number of tourists visiting Vietnam has increased to the point
where accommodation shortages are occurring during the peak season.
 
<P>
In Saigon&#146;s backpacker cafes, groups of young tourists meet
to make travel plans and pass time. &#147;Why did the Americans
just give up?&#148; Alex, an Australian chemistry student asks
rhetorically. &#147;I mean they had the firepower. Why did they
give up?&#148;
<P>
Karl, a German engineer who claims to have been in a re-education
camp in the East, is even more convinced the US should have easily
defeated the communists. &#147;People should always fight against communism,&#148;
he says. 
<P>
&#147;The Americans should never have left Vietnam, no matter
what the cost. The people did not want to live under communism,
ask anyone,&#148; he says gesturing towards the crowded street.
 
<P>
But Nisha, an Irish student studying at London University, disagrees:
&#147;The war was good for Vietnam. It was a good thing. It allowed Vietnam
to be independent and showed the Americans that they couldn&#146;t
push the rest of the world around.&quot;
<P>
A group of Americans are vaguely disturbed when someone tells
them they could be breaking the US &#145;Trading with the Enemy&#146;
act that forbids spending more than 100 dollars in countries officially
listed as hostile. &#147;Yeah right, these guys are the enemy,&#148;
says one pointing at Vietnamese children playing nearby.  
<P>
Most seem content to talk about the war, the conversations are
inevitable &#147;Avoid white faces,&#148; says a New Zealand businessman
who lives in Vietnam. &#147;That&#146;s the only way to avoid
hearing about it.&#148; 
<P>
The Vietnamese seem much less interested in the war although anyone
over the age of 20 would surely have been affected by it in some
way.  In Saigon I ask a waitress for her opinion and she simply
says &#147;I don&#146;t like war,&#148; then changes the subject.
 
<P>
A student from an English college shows me his essay describing
&#147;the wars of liberation&#148;. The American conflict is just
one of the most recent in a series of struggles that cover more
than a thousand years of Vietnam&#146;s history. In general the
Vietnamese don&#146;t seem interested in discussing the war. For
them the subject doesn&#146;t contain the same contradictions
that plague Western views. They won the war and now the nation
is focused on the future. 
<P>
&#147;I find it difficult to talk about the war, because I am
a victim of the war,&#148; says a Vietnamese journalist who has
visited Australia. &#147;I lost my whole childhood to the war.&#148;
She says she is surprised it is still debated so passionately
in the West and shocked some people still claim it was a just
cause. &#147;After 20 years I thought people would forget.  The
Vietnamese have put the war behind them. At first people were
overwhelmed by the victory but in the decade after, life became
very difficult due to the embargo and economic policies. We became
very poor, and having a difficult life makes it more attractive
to look forward.&#148; In 1988 English critics Alf Lourve and
Jeffrey Walsh published an essay on media coverage of Vietnam.
It argued Hollywood&#146;s version of Vietnam tended to mirror
public attitudes. Throughout the &#145;70s, the war was all but
ignored except for films depicting veterans being transformed
into killers, drug addicts, and criminals by their experiences.
But during the &#145;80s, with Ronald Reagan in the White House,
a new spate of Vietnam films reflected a revised American patriotism.
 Movies of the Rambo era showed American troops as brave innocents
led by incompetent officers and undermined by weak liberal dissent
at home. The result was a powerful rewriting of the war&#146;s
history via popular culture. 
<P>
The Rambo generation has landed in Vietnam. The opinions of many
of the backpackers seem to be based on what they have seen in movies
and on television rather than historical accounts of the war.
There is a certainty that the US was somehow cheated, the communists used unfair tactics, and the American
anti-war movement put the army in a position where it was forced
to fight with one hand tied behind its back.  
<P>
This lasting interest with the war is not lost on the Vietnamese
who are now capitalising on it. An interested tourist can visit
the sites of famous battles like Khe Shan (the place that inspired
a Cold Chisel song) and Dien Bien Phu. Enterprising locals have
even enlarged one of the Viet Cong underground fortresses so that
Westerners can fit down the tunnels. Vung Tow, a beach town south
of Saigon, has a rifle range where, for a dollar a bullet, you
can fire a Russian made AK47 or an American M16 at your choice
of target - US Marine or Viet Cong fighter.  
<P>
Saigon has markets where American war surplus material like helmets,
duffel bags, and water cans are sold. Jewellery shops sell American
Zippo lighters engraved with slogans like &#145;Air Cav - If you
don&#146;t know what hell is like fuck with me and you&#146;ll
find out,&#146; and &#145;We are the unwilling, led by the unqualified,
doing the unnecessary, for the ungrateful.&#146;  
<P>
Other entrepreneurs have opened cafes like the &#145;Apocalypse
Bar&#146; where the stereo blasts out American music from the
60&#146;s - Jimi Hendrix and The Doors - and American drinks and
cigarettes are available from the bar. 
<P>
In the coastal town Da Nang, not far from where the first US Marines
landed in Vietnam, I talk to a group of school children. They
are 15 or 16, born after the war which doesn&#146;t come up in
their conversation. One girl, Linh, says she wants to be an English
teacher and invites my friends and I to visit her home to drink
tea and talk. In the garden there is a rusty American helmet that
looks as though it is used as a bucket or some similar purpose.
I prod it with my foot and she says &#147;That&#146;s old, kick
it aside&#148;, and continues talking about her plans for the
future.

</FONT></B><BR>
</CENTER>
 
<P>
<I>Lately the chances of being killed if you use heroin are much higher. Since the arrival in March of a shipment of high-grade
&#147;rock-heroin&#148;, more than 50 people have died from heroin overdoses in NSW and the ACT. <A HREF="#Jennie Christian">JENNIE CHRISTIAN </A>reports.</I>
<P>
OVERDOSING is the main health risk for heroin users - during the last decade deaths from heroin overdose have increased 170 per cent. But the
danger is not only from higher drug purity. Heroin mixed with alcohol or other drugs can be a lethal cocktail. Because it is
illegal, heroin users cannot be sure of the drug&#146;s purity, so may end up taking more than they can handle. After an overdose
has occurred, a user&#146;s friends may decide not to call an ambulance because they fear police intervention.
<P>
Judy Byrne is co-ordinator of the ACT Intravenous Needle League, which provides needle exchange, assessment and referral to drug
users. She says: &#147;The heroin seems to be getting more and more potent, which isn&#146;t a problem for users who use every
day, and are actually getting their money&#146;s worth, but it is a problem for those who are new at it or who only use occasionally,
who have no way of gauging the quality of what they&#146;re getting.&#148;
<P>
&#147;I think there&#146;s got to be an acknowledgment that people who take heroin to that extent don&#146;t need criminal sanctions,
they need medical help and supervision. You don&#146;t ruin your life ... for the hell of it. Until we have some understanding
about drug addiction, we&#146;ve got to back off and be a bit human about it. We cringe at the way we treated people with mental
problems in mental institutions in the 18th century, and in a few years from now we&#146;ll be cringing at the way we treated
people with drug dependence. It&#146;s just part of the human scope and we don&#146;t seem to be able to acknowledge it.&#148;
<P>
Several leading health professionals, lawyers and academics have repeatedly claimed prohibitive drugs policies are devastating
to Australia&#146;s economy, health and society. Current drug laws are &#147;unsustainable, ineffective and counterproductive&#148;,
according to Dr Alex Wodak, Director of Alcohol and Drug Services at St Vincent&#146;s Hospital in NSW. For 13 years Wodak has had
daily contact with drug and alcohol abusers and is a leader in the drug and alcohol field. 
<P>
&#147;Illicit drug policies magnify the harm that they are meant to prevent,&#148; he says. &#147;There is some recognition of
this now in law enforcement circles and the police recognise that they are set up to fail in the illicit drugs area, where the more
effort and energy they put in, the more they are rewarded by seeing drug prices go higher and property crime increasing.&#148;
<P>
A report by Dr Gabrielle Bammer of the Australian National University's National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health has recommended
the prescripotionof heroin to 40 addicts in the ACT, the first stage of a proposed $2.3m trial. A decision on whether to go ahead
isunlikely before the end of the year, and would entail state and federal government support and Commonwealth funding. If the
trial is approved, could this be the beginning of the end of heroin prohibition in Australia? 
<P>
Since the advent of worldwide drug prohibition, it has been believed
that illegal drugs can be purged by putting sufficient resources into the &#147;war on drugs&#148;. But this belief is under attack.
Since the 1961 UN convention on narcotic drugs, drug use has increased
throughout the world. Last year the $US400 billion drug trade surpassed petroleum to become the world&#146;s second largest
industry. Only the arms trade was more lucrative.
<P>
Advocates of drug law reform in Australia point to the huge cost of enforcing the drug laws through the police, courts and the
prison system; as well as the costs to society caused by a virulent black market, drug-related crime, corruption and a clogged legal
system. Not least is the risk of accidental poisoning and overdose from consuming adulterated drugs, and the spread of infectious
diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS.
<P>
In 1988, the cost of illicit drug use in Australia was conservatively estimated at $1.5 billion. Now it may be closer to $500 billion.
The annual turnover of the illegal drug trade in Australia was estimated at about $3 billion in 1989. Yet despite increased efforts
to enforce drug laws, less than 10 per cent of illegal drugs in circulation are seized.
<P>
Dr Jara Krivanek, author and formerly director of clinical drug dependence studies at Macquarie University, believes myths about
illegal drugs are propagated by governments and the media. The myths portray heroin is inherently evil, and the &#147;drug addict&#148;
is condemned as a hopeless captive of his drug, preyed upon by pushers. But Krivanek said the truth about many illegal drugs
is startlingly different.
<P>
Heroin, she says, is one of the most effective painkillers ever known. It relieves mental and physical pain, eases anxiety and
produces a feeling of tranquillity, elation and confidence. For medical use, it may be more effective than morphine in the treatment
of terminally ill patients were it legal.
<P>
Russell Fox and Ian Mathews in their book Drugs Policy refute other myths. They claim it is not true that one or two fixes of
heroin will turn you into an addict. Heroin can produce physical and psychological dependence, but this takes heavy use over a
prolonged period. It takes several months to a year of heavy use to become hooked on heroin or cocaine. Tobacco is judged more
addictive than heroin or any other illegal drug because of the severe dependency it develops. And unlike tobacco and alcohol,
pure heroin is not toxic, nor is it associated with any disease.
<P>
Recently in Australia there have been signs of a changing attitude to marijuana. Possession and use of the drug is not a criminal
offence in SA or the ACT. MPs in SA will soon vote on whether marijuana will be allowed on sale from licensed outlets such as
pharmacies. The Australian parliamentary group for drug law reform is pressing for national decriminalisation of marijuana and legislation
to allow the medical use of cannabis and heroin.
<P>
But many say decriminalisation of one drug does nothing to tackle the most visible evidence of the failure of prohibition
- the black market in illicit drugs where a kilogram of heroin is worth $1 million.
<P>
The Redfern Legal Centre in NSW has advocated making illegal drugs available in a controlled manner, regulated by the government,
to undermine the black market. They believe addictive drugs like heroin might be supplied to addicts or problem users. The centre
is conducting a campaign, headed by solicitor Stephen Bolt, to bring alternative drug policies to the attention of politicians
and the community.
<P>
Bolt says: &#147;I think that the general public see that it&#146;s necessary to stop people from using drugs, and that the drug laws
are the only way we can do it. I think both of those are challengeable. Not because the desirability of drug use is at question, because
I don&#146;t think that should be the debate. What is at question is the ability of the laws to prevent people using drugs. All
the evidence is that it has failed, continues to fail and will always fail.&#148;
<P>
Statistics show about 13 per cent of people in Australian prisons are there for drug offences, with an estimated 20 per cent to
70 per cent of prisoners convicted of drug-related crimes such as theft and burglary, motivated by the need to finance heavy 
drug use.
<P>
Corruption is another problem that may be disturbingly widespread,says Bolt. Ten years ago drug substitution was not uncommon at
government drug testing laboratories, according to a former drugs analyst who tested drugs seized by the Australian Federal Police.
On one occasion, what was reported to be seven kilograms of cocaine was actually found to be 100 per cent glucose.
<P>
&#147;A few times what happens is that a drug comes back for analysis and it&#146;s not what it&#146;s supposed to be. We find out that
it&#146;s just glucose. That&#146;s when the Federal police start an investigation. But nothing ever comes out of it. They just
hush it up. The police take a pretty active role for the first month or two. Afterwards they say &#145;we&#146;re looking into
it&#146; and the thing just goes out of sight. And no-one ever chases it up,&#148; he says.
<P>
In NSW, tests for drug quality as well as quantity are now operative
after an investigation into &#147;extraordinarily lax&#148; drug security arrangements found heroin could be substituted for glucose
without detection. A new strategy to deal with police corruption in NSW includes a plan to build a high-security drug testing laboratory
to remove drugs from police stations.
<P>
The current NSW Police Royal Commission is revealing how the drug trade&#146;s easy access to cash increases the likelyhood of police
corruption. Numerous other commissions and official enquiries have reported on corruption linked to the illegal drug trade.
The Royal Commission on the NSW Police Service has uncovered evidence
of high-level drug related corruption among Kings Cross police, such as large payments in exchange for protection of drug trafficking
operations. The Queensland Fitzgerald Commission recommended an immediate investigation into illegal drug policies, and said authorities
must acknowledge that prohibition had failed.
<P>
According to Bolt, drug laws set the police up for sale. &#147;There&#146;s
so much money involved in drug trafficking because the prices you get for drugs are so high, and the demand for drugs remains
the same or increases slightly, despite all attempts to prohibit their use,&#148; he says. &#147;The law creates a completely artificial
price, so naturally people are going to try to make money from them. There are millions of dollars at stake in the drug trade.
That necessarily means that there is an enormous pressure on individual
police and also the police service as an institution.&#148;
<P>
Patrick Law, national secretary of the Australian Federal Police Association, says the impact of illegal drugs on society was widespread
and corruption was a concern. &#147;The AFP is on the record as a corruption-free police force and we&#146;re very proud of that
and we work very hard to maintain it,&#148; he says.
<P>
On the possibility of police being tempted by their access to highly priced drugs, Law said: &#147;Well, the whole point of
the AFP system is that they don&#146;t have access to them. We have very, very strict accountability guidelines - I would suggest
the strictest in Australia - to prevent access to the drugs that are seized.&#148;
<P>
Current prohibitive drug policy does little to counter major public health concerns. About four per cent of injecting drug users in
Australia are HIV positive, and 15 per cent are infected with the hepatitis C virus - rates significantly higher than in the
rest of the population. Overseas the problem of HIV infection in injecting drug users has reached critical proportions. In the
US in 1992, 31 per cent of all new AIDS cases were caused by contaminated
needles.
<P>
Acting Director of the Drug and Alcohol Directorate in the NSW Health Department, Peter Hommel, admits Australia has a less than
perfect system, but says he sees no inconsistency with the prohibitionist
drug laws and the harm minimisation strategy applied to alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs.
<P>
But not everyone agrees with this position. Wodak calls Australia&#146;s drug policies confused. Action directed at specific drugs was
not proportional to their contribution to health and social problems, he says. &#147;What happens under current policy is that ineffective
laws get policed and effective laws don&#146;t.&#148;
<P>
The latest statistics on drug abuse in Australia highlight the severe consequences of the use of alcohol and tobacco. In 1992,
an estimated 26,300 Australians died from drug-related causes, about one-fifth of all deaths. Of these three per cent were due
to illicit drugs, 25 per cent to alcohol and 72 per cent to tobacco.
Clearly, the drugs which cause the most deaths are the legal ones.
<P>
Simon Overland, adviser on drugs policy to federal Justice Minister,
Duncan Kerr, is unwilling to embrace proposals for drug policy reform. He believes there are strongly held views on both sides
of the argument. &#147;Our approach now is to look at the question of harm caused by drugs. Harm extends beyond just the harm caused
to the individual user of the drugs, it extends to the harm and cost to the wider society. Our policy is one of harm minimisation.&#148;
<P>
Both Dr Bammer and ACT Chief Minister Kate Carnell stress the importance of community debate on the proposed heroin trial. &#147;Essentially
the community are the people who either have to wear the risks or forgo the benefits, so in the end, they&#146;re the ones who
are going to have to decide which way they&#146;re going to go,&#148;
says Dr Bammer.
<P>
Whether or not the trial eventuates, the report has put heroin on the political agenda after 40 years of prohibition. But despite
mounting evidence that punitive drag laws are not working, it is questionable whether either politicians or the community will
be prepared to accept substantial change. If Australia is to take the first step on the route towards a rational drug policy, we
may need to re-examine some fundamental beliefs of our society. It is difficult to maintain that using heroin and marijuana is
immoral when legal drug use is unquestioned by a large part of the population.

<P>
<I>In the Summer &#146;94 edition of Snoop, we ran a special supplement
dealing with the costs of privatisation &#151; Rolling Back the State. In this update, <A HREF="#Mary Banfield">MARY BANFIELD</A> looks at the costs associated
with the privatisation of government cleaning services in NSW.</I>
<P>
MARIA Sveronas has had a change in employers. Eighteen months ago her government job as a cleaner ceased. The work was sold off to a private contractor. She is now required to do more work,at twice the speed, in less time, and for less money. The working
conditions of the 7,500 government cleaners have been dramatically reduced since privatisation. So much so that the newly elected Labor NSW State Government has called for an inquiry into the conditions and effect on the quality of services being provided
by the contract cleaning companies.
<P>
In 1993, Voices, a University of Technology, Sydney publication, investigated the implications of the Government Cleaning Service
being privatised by the former Liberal NSW State Government. Back then, the fear of the women was they would lose their job security.
&#147;If the government doesn&#146;t offer me a job, how am I to get another,&#148; questioned Sveronas.
<P>
This was the fear of an older woman, who migrated to Australia from Greece. Seventy-seven per cent of the cleaners are women,
and 42 per cent are from non-English speaking backgrounds. Sveronas and her workmates kept their jobs with the new employer. 
<P>
The Ethnic Communities Council of NSW (ECC) recently presented a report outlining the impact of privatisation of cleraning services
on women of a non-English speaking background. This report stated that the Government expected to save $37 million on the cost of
workers. A sense of betrayal, loss and anger felt by the women, many of whom have been employed for ten years by the government,
was noted in the report.
<P>
The Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union (ALHMU) says the cleaners have been subjected to excessive workloads,
reduced hours and poor equipment. In one school, the union reports total working hours have been reduced from 160 to 78, disregarding
the extra workload created by the school taking on more students. Cleaners report that no longer is there time for breaks and their
health is being compromised.
<P>
The new inquiry, announced in June 1995, will allow principals to monitor the quality of cleaning in the schools. The union has
successfully argued that the inquiry should examine the conditions of work or exploitation of women, adequacy of raining while looking
at the health and safety records since privatisation. For Sveronas the inquiry will be welcome. &#147;Since March we&#146;ve been
under a lot of pressure because the supervisor comes in and says I&#146;m taking too long to clean that building. They say I&#146;m
too slow, I say &#145;you show me a better way&#146;.&#148;
<P>
Sveronas&#146; company has informed the workers their working hours will be cut by ten per cent, while the amount of work they
are expected to do increases out of proportion. The workers believe the company is further aiming to reduce their working hours from
28 hours per week to 21. They will still have to do the same amount of work. For Sveronas that means cleaning 23 classrooms, two corridors
and two kitchens, in five-and-a-half hours.
<P>
Ironically, according to the ECC, the Industrial Relations Commission pointed out that the decision by the previous Liberal Government
to privatise the service was made in isolation. According to the Industrial Relations Commissioner Justice Monica Schmidt, no consultation
was carried out with the union, nor employees: &#147;The decision to sell ... is clearly open to criticism.&#148;<BR>

<P>
<I>Rainforests, woodchipping, logging, endangered species, natural
habitats. These days there seems to be as many individual environmental
issues as there are environmentalists. There is one conservation
issue, however, that&#146;s been out of the public eye for the
past few years. Not because it is no longer a problem but because
it&#146;s a complex, political hot potato.</I>
<P>
IN THE lead up to the March 1995 State election, Premier Bob Carr
said in a strategy paper that his government would ensure the
protection of Crown leases. How this would be done has not yet
been formally announced. 
<P>
Crown leasehold land regularly made headline news in the late
1980s and early 1990s. When the Coalition state government changed
policies in 1989, great tracts of previously protected Crown leasehold
land was sold off to private interests. The Labor opposition screamed
&quot;fire sale&quot; and conservationists demanded a stop to
what they saw as environmentally outrageous. There was also talk
of corruption.
<P>
So loud and long was the outcry that in 1990 Premier Nick Greiner
placed a moratorium on the freehold conversion those Crown leases
with a &quot;reserve from sale&quot; note on them. The government
tried to lift the moratorium three years later but hastily reinstated
it after less than two weeks when public pressure once more proved
that Crown land was still a highly contentious issue.
<P>
A significant proportion of Crown leasehold land in NSW is natural
bushland or wilderness. When a Crown lease is converted to freehold
title, it becomes private property and little can be done to prevent
it from being cleared and subdivided.
<P>
In 1995, the moratorium still stands, informally, at least. It
is not a legislated or formally defined ban. Rather it is an unwritten
understanding between the National Parks and Wildlife Service
(NPWS) and the current Department for Water and Land Conservation,
formerly the Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM),
that now protects Crown leases. 
<P>
Although these two departments have recently made progress towards
rationalising and standardising procedures for assessing and documenting
Crown leases, there are still no concrete measures in place to
ensure a fire sale can&#146;t be held again.
<P>
Environmentally and politically Crown leasehold land remains absolutely
critical for NSW, according to John Benson, senior plant ecologist
with the Royal Botanic Gardens and a former NPWS officer.
<P>
Benson says large portions of some of NSW&#146;s major wilderness
areas are Crown leasehold land.  This is confirmed by the Colong
Foundation.  Their records show there are over 200,000 hectares
of crown leasehold land in 27 wilderness areas throughout NSW.
<P>
&#147;I&#146;d say it&#146;s probably the most important land
for nature conservation outside the reserve system,&#148; says
Benson. &#147;It is basically one million hectares of native bushland.
I call it our defacto reserve system.
<P>
&#147;Everybody jumps up and down about endangered plant and animal
species. What they are forgetting is that many crown leases are
some of the last places you&#146;ll find many such plants and
animals. Much of this land may be critical to the viability of
many ecosystems and species.&#148;
<P>
THE recent history of Crown leasehold land is a sorry one, marked
by recurring stories of poor planning, political self-interest
and greed. At the end of the 1970s, New South Wales had a Crown
leasehold estate of some 10,000 leases, totalling five million
hectares. By the beginning of the 1990s, only 4,500 leases remained,
2,000 of which had &#147;reserve from sale&#148; notices. The
rest had either been converted to freehold or had the protective
reserved from sale notices withdrawn.
<P>
Large-scale selling off of Crown leases was not just a pastime
of Coalition governments. Successive Labor governments throughout
the 1970s and 1980s sold a substantial number of Crown leases
too. 
<P>
But after the Coalition came to power in 1988 the situation began
to get out of hand.  
<P>
One NPWS officer recalls &#147;a strong push by the National Party
in the lead up to the 1988 election to freehold all leasehold
land&#148;. After they won the election the Coalition government
first ignored the NPWS and its recommendations, then in 1993 they
tried to dismantle the Service altogether by amalgamating it with
CALM. That, according to John Benson, would have fundamentally
undermined environmental conservation in New South Wales.  &#147;If
that had happened,&#148; says Benson, &#147;there would have been
no clear voice on the environmental issues connected with Crown
land.&#148;
<P>
From 1988 to 1993 was a tough time for everyone interested in
protecting Crown leases.  
<P>
In July 1989, Ian Causley, the then Minister for Natural Resources,
suddenly decided to dump CALM&#146;s 1978 Conservation Policy
on Crown leases. Under this policy, Crown leases deemed environmentally
sensitive were &#147;reserved from sale for future public requirements&#148;.
However, this policy and the reserved from sale notices were not
legislated and could easily be overruled by the Minister responsible,
as Causley proved. 
<P>
Causley said at the time the policy had to go because it created
too many &#147;disincentives&#148; to freehold conversions and
was &#147;too restrictive, inefficient and inappropriate to protect
the environment&#148;. According to the National Party any measure
to protect Crown leasehold land was a &#147;socialist land grab&#148;.
<P>
The loss of the Conservation Policy put the NPWS in a bind. The
Service either had to purchase all leases where it objected to
conversion within five years or forgo any interest in them. With
a budget of only $2.5 million a year to buy land, and the complex
negotiations and approvals for land purchases often taking over
five years, protecting all important leases was impossible. 
<P>
With the Conservation Policy removed, the Coalition government
began openly encouraging lessees to convert their Crown leases
to freehold. 
<P>
The government sent brochures promoting the new favourable conditions
to Crown leasehold lessees, and received over 2,000 applications
for freehold title.  It also caused a great hue and cry from conservationists
and the Labor opposition. 
<P>
Even the government&#146;s own departments were concerned.
<P>
The NPWS said in a report in 1990 openly criticising the government&#146;s
policies on Crown leasehold land disposal, &#147;The current operation
of Government policy on disposal/retention of leasehold Crown
lands is to the detriment of heritage conservation.&#148;
<P>
It was this report that forced Premier Greiner to act. In August
1990, he imposed a moratorium on the sale of all Crown leasehold
lands. CALM and NPWS were told to immediately assess all the leases,
identifying those that should be protected.
<P>
According to an NPWS officer there was little time to come up
with a workable method for assessing the leases. The NPWS did
not have the time or resources to inspect each lease, so most
assessments were made from topographical maps, aerial photographs
and anecdotal evidence. &#147;There were major problems with our
methods,&#148; says the NPWS officer, &#147;but it was so hotly
political at the time that we just had to do it.&#148;
<P>
Three years later, CALM and NPWS had drafted some guidelines for
protecting Crown leases but were nowhere near finding a long-term
solution to the problem. 
<P>
NPWS proposed Conservation Agreements to protect important Crown
leases.  These however offer only limited protection. 
<P>
Benson says Conservation Agreements could be applied over hundreds
of leases but they are not logical. &#147;They take a lot of negotiation
and you can&#146;t force people to sign them. In the past leases
have been converted when people have said they&#146;ll enter an
agreement and then gone ahead and subdivided anyway because the
agreements were not legally tight.&#148;
<P>
For Conservation Agreements to work, it would seem more appropriate
to enter into them before the tenure on the land was changed.
<P>
By 1993 Premier Greiner&#146;s successor John Fahey was under
continued strong pressure from the National Party to lift the
moratorium on the sale of Crown leasehold land. He gave in on
8 May 1993.  For the next ten days Crown leases were once again
in danger.
<P>
CROWN land is a story of bureaucratic wrangling and political
self interest. This is an example.  There have been others, some more widely known, some
more important.
<P>
Conservation is a dirty word for many people in Tucabia. Tucabia
lies in the electorate of Clarence. Ian Causley has been the local
member for Clarence since 1984.
<P>
Dyson Devine has lived in the area about 18 years. However, to
locals he&#146;s still an outsider. His American accent probably
doesn&#146;t help.
<P>
Many properties in the area have been in the same family for several
generations.
<P>
They are the real locals - conservative, National Party-voting
graziers - and they don&#146;t take too kindly to strangers. Especially
ones who criticise their ways. Especially outsiders like Devine.
<P>
Devine came to Australia in 1972, the only assisted-passage American
on Australia&#146;s last migrant ship. He moved to Grafton in
1977, bought his property, cleared a few acres, dug a dam, built
a two room solar-powered house, filled it with books, and settled
down into what he says is his place in the world. 
<P>
Aside from the clearing and a tangled vegetable garden, Devine&#146;s
property is all native bushland. Tall thin eucalyptus and other
native trees, their trunks blackened by a fire last year, surround
the clearing on all sides. A couple of families of black wallaby
make his land their home too, occasionally coming up to the house
to scrounge vegetable scraps and apple cores. 
<P>
Over the past two years, Devine, with the help of the National
Parks Association, has waged a campaign that&#146;s put him on
the wrong side of not only the shire council but some local landowners
and Ian Causley. 
<P>
In May 1993, just days after the moratorium on the sale of crown
leasehold land was lifted by the then Premier John Fahey, a 492.5
hectare (1,217 acre) block of Crown leasehold land, known locally
as McCrae&#146;s Knob or simply &#147;the reserve&#148;, adjoining
Devine&#146;s property was converted to freehold and sold to the
leaseholder Trevor Kratz. 
<P>
Kratz bought it for $1 an acre.  It is now worth anywhere up to
$1.2 million.
<P>
Devine and CEC have been trying to find out how and why this could
happen. 
<P>
NPWS and CALM files obtained through the Freedom of Information
Act reveal the how of the story but not the why.
<P>
McCRAE'S Knob is steep and covered in a dense old growth forest
of native trees - ironbark, turpentine, tallowwood, and brushbox.
Small creeks, their water dyed amber from tanin, wind down through
thick remnant rain forest to the Coldstream River.
<P>
Kratz&#146;s perpetual Crown lease had permitted him grazing on
the reserve.  Instead, local councils mined gravel from two of
its ridges.  
<P>
A development application was recently lodged to greatly enlarge
the gravel quarries. However the quarry has now closed after being
found to have been operating illegally by the NSW Ombudsman. The
development application recorded that in the 1960s Ian Causley
had driven a truck in the mines.
<P>
Devine didn&#146;t hear about the conversion until three months
after it was approved. But then, neither had officers with the
Grafton NPWS and they had been working on the Pine Brush Nature
Reserve proposal for several years.
<P>
It was first recommended for dedication as a nature reserve in
April 1974. An NPWS inspection revealed the land contained remnant
rainforest, rare plants unusual to the area and 130 million year
old sandstone rock outcrops. Subsequent research by a local archaeologist
also found evidence of Aboriginal artefacts, such as stone implements
and rare stone axe grinding grooves.
<P>
For 12 years, between 1974 to 1986, every request by the NPWS
to purchase the land was met with a counter application to freehold
by Kratz and outright rejection by the local Ulmarra Shire Council.
The NPWS needs the agreement of a number of natural resource departments,
and seeks the comments of other authorities and local councils,
before it can dedicate land as a nature reserve or national park.
<P>
The NPWS eventually decided to put the Pine Brush Nature Reserve
proposal on hold, at least until their Coastal Parks Plan was
approved. The plan included the Yuragir National Park which is
also in Ulmarra Shire. 
<P>
The NPWS probably thought they&#146;d better not push their luck.
<P>
In 1988 the Forestry Commission stepped into the fray with an
undertaking to dedicate the land as State Forest. The Forestry
Commision has the power to dedicate State Forests over Crown leases.
The Commission thought the land not only a good source of a timber
but an excellent 500ha fire break between the adjoining Pine Brush
State Forest and local farmlands. 
<P>
However, as soon as he heard of the Forestry Commission&#146;s
request, Kratz lodged a series of appeals against the dedication
with his local member Causley.
<P>
Coincidentally, Causley was the then Minister for Natural Resources.
 His portfolio included the Forestry Commission. On 14 February
1990, Causley rejected his department&#146;s dedication, saying
the proposed reserve was &#147;extremely poor forest&#148;. The
Commission wrote to the NPWS saying that with &#147;disappointment&#148;
they could no longer object to Kratz&#146;s applications. 
<P>
The moratorium on the conversion of Crown leasehold lands in 1990
temporarily put an end to Kratz&#146;s chances of converting the
land. It did not however stem his freehold conversion applications.
<P>
The CALM file contains a letter dated 21 August 1991 to Causley
from Gary West, then Minister for CALM, the department then responsible
for Crown land. West acknowledges Causley&#146;s &#147;personal
representations&#148; on behalf of Kratz but writes that he can
not do anything because of the moratorium, adding that they would
have to wait until the interdepartmental taskforce finished its
analysis of all crown leasehold lands.
<P>
In mid 1992, CALM advised Kratz that the taskforce had declared
the proposed reserve of &#147;heritage value&#148;. This meant
that Kratz could continue to graze his cattle on it if he wished;
he just could never convert the lease to freehold or develop the
land without approval.
<P>
Kratz nevertheless continued to apply for freehold through Causley.
<P>
In December 1992, while the moratorium was still in place, Causley
visited the land&#146;s gravel quarries. He was accompanied by
Michael Ockwell, then head of CALM, Peter Wilson, then acting
head of the National Heritage Division of the NPWS, and Kratz.

<P>
It was a quick visit that brought some big changes in heart. 
<P>
After the inspection, Ockwell, Wilson and Causley all agreed that
McCrae&#146;s Knob could be converted to freehold, on the proviso
that Kratz first finalised a Conservation Agreement to protect
the vegetation cover. 
<P>
Premier John Fahey lifted the moratorium on 8 May 1993. The sale
of the land was completed on 12 May 1993, for $1,217. The moratorium
was reinstated, albeit informally, on 18 May 1993.
<P>
Two years later the Conservation Agreement with Kratz is not yet
finalised. According to Owen Turner of Grafton NPWS, the agreement
when it is complete will cover between one half and two thirds
of McCrae&#146;s Knob.  It is still unsure whether it will cover
the remnant rainforests and Aboriginal sites.
<P>
Kratz will still be able to do what he likes with the remainder.
He could clear it, subdivide it or both.
<P>
Chances of reversing the conversion would seem slim.  It would
now be impossible for the NPWS to buy back the land at market
prices. Blocks of 100 acres around Tucabia sell for over $100,000.
 Devine however has not given up hope of the sale being reversed.
<P>
It may well be too late to save the proposed Pine Brush Nature
reserve, but it is certainly not too late to learn from its loss.
It is not the first case of questionable freehold conversion and,
unless action is taken, it may not be the last.  Instead of being
a political issue or a vote-buying tool the conversion of Crown
leases to freehold should be systematic and controlled.

<P>
<I>Women, it seems, have forever been the poor relations in the fight
against AIDS and HIV. <A HREF="#SUE JOSEPH">SUE JOSEPH</A> sheds some light on this phenomenon.</I>
<P>
Women are contracting HIV at the same rate they were ten years
ago although the rate of infection in men has dropped.
<P>
But despite this, women still feel marginalised and isolated in
their treatments, mainly because they are heterosexual, according
to a leading Sydney AIDS doctor.
<P>
Dr Virginia Furner, Head of the Medical Unit at the Albion Clinic
in Surry Hills, says: &#147;The number of women identified each
year is constant. It hasn&#146;t changed in ten years and we don&#146;t
really know what that means yet.
<P>
&#147;Many of the women may have been infected years ago; perhaps
more women are contracting the virus and simply not recognising
that they have,&quot; she said
<P>
Figures show that since the first official Australian female death
from AIDS in 1985, 860 women have contracted the virus, at a constant
annual rate of between 80 and 90 diagnoses. In contrast, more
than 15,500 men have contracted the virus, with the rate of infection
dropping by approximately one third from October 1993 to September
1994.
<P>
Dr Furner says: &#147;What we do know from retrospective studies
is that women are still marginalised and isolated in their treatments.
There are many reasons for this, the main one I think being that
most of them are heterosexual.
<P>
&#147;They don&#146;t identify as a cohesive group because there
is no commonality between many of the women except their HIV positive
status.&#148;
<P>
Women face female-specific symptoms with HIV, some of which have
only been recognised by collating bodies in the past two years.
<P>
The US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) did not recognise female-specific
HIV opportunistic infections until 1993, despite women being diagnosed
with HIV/AIDS since 1982. Because Australia, like most other developed
countries around the world, uses the CDC classification system
for identifying HIV/AIDS, both the numbers of infections and actual
deaths of women have never truly been reflected in national statistics.
<P>
Since 1993 classifications have changed and female-specific symptoms
are now included in required conditions listed with the CDC and
hence other developed countries.
<P>
Dr Furner says: &#147;It&#146;s our impression from some preliminary
studies that we&#146;ve started doing Australia wide, that less
than 50 per cent of positive women have their gynaecological needs
addressed by their health provider. Questions are never asked.
The focus is on their HIV instead of the women as a whole.&#148;
<P>
This statistic in itself presents problems as many opportunisitic
infections in HIV positive women are found to be gynaecological
to begin with.
<P>
&#147;There is a risk women will develop cervical malignancies,
plus other diseases like Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,&#148; Dr
Furner says. &#147;The problem is, once a woman is diagnosed as
HIV positive her gynaecological needs are ignored, and before
she is diagnosed HIV positive her gynaecological needs may not
be linked.&#148;
<P>
Another contentious issue disadvantaging women in their fight
against AIDS and HIV is their exclusion, until recently, in clinical
drug trials.
<P>
&#147;Basically, it was drug companies&#146; fear of litigation
which excluded women,&#148; Dr Furner explains. &#147;According
to drug company protocol, if a woman took part in a clinical test
and found she was pregnant, the risk of foetus damage from the
drug could cost the company millions. So company protocol was
to restrict women being involved in clinical trials. 
<P>
&#147;The policy is more open now because women feel they should
have as equal access as men to potentially life-saving drugs that
are undergoing research. Now all that is often required is for
doctors involved satisfying themselves that the woman involved
is not at risk of getting pregnant.&#148;

</CENTER><BR>
<P>
<I>
The Federal government tells us that privatising a third of Telstra
is vital, allowing seven billion dollars in Government debt to
be repaid, and improving the efficiency of the telecommunications
industry. But what real benefits will flow to Australia, and will
they outweigh the loss of a third of Telstra to private ownership?
<A HREF="../journos.htm#lrobertson">LOUISE ROBERTSON</A> looks beyond political rhetoric and takes a hard
look at the figures.</I>
<P>
THERE has been no clear demonstration by the Howard Federal government
that the financial benefits of partial privatisation will outweigh
the costs. Professor Bob Walker of the University of New South
Wales (UNSW), writing in the Journal of Australian Political Economy,
argues that this is not unusual. &quot;The fact is that most (if
not all) privatisation decisions have been undertaken in Australia
without any detailed disclosure of the economic rationale for
the sale,&quot; he says.
<P>
&quot;The Government has stated that by retiring $7 billion of
debt, it will reduce its annual interest bill. The benefit is
that the money that would otherwise have gone in interest payments
could then be used to fund other programs or to retire more debt.
Another benefit is that retiring foreign debt also reduces the
public sector borrowing requirement which pushes interest rates
down, leading to benefits for private borrowers, particularly
those in business.
<P>
In order to determine whether the partial sale is financially
worthwhile, we need to weigh these benefits against what the Government
will forgo through losing a third of its equity in Telstra.
<P>
Telstra is an important income source for the Commonwealth Government.
From assets of $24 billion in 1994/95, it generated $14 billion
in revenue and made an after tax profit of $1.7 billion. Telstra
is currently committed to paying the Government a dividend of
55 per cent of its annual operating profit. During 1994/95, the
Telstra dividend was worth $944 million, which when added to interest
and taxes paid by Telstra, provided a total payment to Government
of $2.4 billion. This represents nearly two per cent of the Commonwealth
Government budget.
<P>
On a crude estimation that selling off a third of Telstra will
reduce the Government's dividend by a third, the Government may
stand to lose about $315 million a year. With the current interest
rate on Government bonds at about eight per cent, the interest
saving on debt of $7 billion is $560 million a year. From this
simple equation it looks as though the Government may gain more
than it will lose through the sale.
<P>
However, Professor Walker suggests that this may be just what
the Government wants us to think. He argues that Telstra's capital
structure reduces its appearance of profitability, and that to
get a true picture of the revenue the Government receives from
Telstra, we need to look at the full cash flow from Telstra to
the Government. This means looking not only at dividends, but
interest paid on Government loans, tax payments, and other fees
and charges.
<P>
A third of Telstra's total payment to Government in 1994/95 ($2.4
billion) is $800 million, which appears much higher than $560
million the annual interest savings on debt of $7 billion.
<P>
But, of course, the Government doesn't stand to lose all of the
$800 million because a privatised Telstra will, for example, still
pay taxes (although Professor Walker points out that private sector
firms can be expected to undertake tax-minimisation strategies).
The problem is, we don't really know how partial privatisation
will affect the cash flow between the Government and Telstra.
<P>
Regardless of the debt repayment arguments, the Government also
needs to clearly demonstrate that the sale price it has set for
a third of Telstra is an accurate reflection of its worth. Is
$8 billion enough? Further, will the Government achieve this sale
price in the current financial climate?
<P>
BZW, the investment banking division of Barclays Bank, recently
indicated that the Government could do better than $8 billion
for a third of Telstra. In its report, <I>Regarding Telstra</I>,
BZW estimates the net value of Telstra at $27.9 billion, a third
of which is approximately $9 billion. Similarly, stockbrokers
J B Were &amp; Son recently put Telstra's net value higher at
between $28.5 to $42 billion, and estimated $8 to 10 billion was
a conservative price for a third of the corporation.
<P>
That the Government has chosen a conservative price of $8 billion
probably reflects its expectations about the market's ability
to absorb a share issue of this size. $8 billion dollars represents
about two per cent of the combined value of listed companies on
the Australian Stock Exchange (called market capitalisation).
According to the ASX, a good indicator of the market's ability
to absorb the Telstra issue is to consider that new capital raisings
over the past ten years have averaged about six per cent of market
capitalisation. This suggests that the ASX, with a current capitalisation
of $350 billion, should be able to support new issue of up to
$20 billion a year. However, the ASX adds that other factors need
to be taken into account including the state of the economy, how
fast the shares need to be sold, and whether shareholders perceive
the share price to be good value. It comments that there is a
tendency for large Government floats to be slightly undervalued
because a big issue can only be sold in one hit if investors perceive
the shares to be a good buy (ie undervalued).
<P>
Undervaluing may also reflect the Government's political interest
in having the issue fully sold.
<P>
Other factors that need to be considered are constraints on purchasers
and the other share issues on offer at the same time. A significant
constraint on purchasers is the Government's commitment that foreign
ownership of Telstra will be restricted to 35 per cent of the
issue. This means that 65 per cent must be absorbed domestically,
which may be difficult in the light of the sale of the final tranch
of the Commonwealth Bank, and the privatisation of Deutsche Telecom
and France Telecom, both of which are expected to be offered for
the first time in 1997.
<P>
The bottom line is that if the market cannot absorb the issue,
then the Government is likely to have to offer Telstra shares
at a discounted price. If the transaction costs of multi-tranch
issues were added, the net proceeds to Government of the partial
sale could be much less than eight billion dollars.
<P>
<B>Will Telstra be more efficient?</B>
<P>
Before considering the efficiency gains that privatisation may
achieve, we first need to consider how efficient Telstra is at
the moment. In a 1995 report, the Bureau of Industry Economics
found Telstra's performance to be reasonable by international
standards, noting that many improvements had been made in recent
years as a result of improvements in technology and the introduction
of competition.
<P>
However, Telstra failed to reach international best practice in
a number of areas and needed to make substantial improvements
to match its competitors. Telstra's labour productivity in particular,
measured in terms of revenue per employee and lines per employee,
was found to be well below international best practice. There
was also scope to reduce prices (particularly for services in
which Telstra does not face competition from Optus), improve the
reliability of the network (particularly for rural and residential
customers) and to improve the time taken to repair faults. Progress
in digitising the network (which will increase the speed and reliability
of data transmission) was considered slow.
<P>
So how will privatisation bring about these improvements? The
economic argument is that privatisation exposes a company to the
discipline of the market. The share price mechanism provides clear
signals about a company's performance, making management more
accountable for its actions and forcing it to become more streamlined
and efficient, often by reducing employees. This is assisted by
the more stringent reporting requirements for companies listed
on the Australian Stock Exchange, and the injection of a private
sector ethos through new board members.
<P>
However, Professor Bob Walker of UNSW is sceptical whether privatisation
will actually cause an increase in efficiency. &quot;One of the
most comprehensive international studies of privatisation found
that only 55 per cent of privatised firms showed an improvement
in operating performance, and that overall the mean change was
only a 0.16 per cent improvement in the reported rate of return
on equity,&quot; he writes. Even attributing these small gains
to privatisation is contentious as it assumes that any efficiency
gains could not have been secured if organisations remained in
public ownership.
<P>
Indeed, Sue Ferguson of the Communications Law Centre does not
believe that efficiency gains are the sole province of a private
sector firm. &quot;I don't see any reason why a far leaner operation
couldn't be put in place under Government ownership. As a corportatised
entity, there's no reason why you can't apply private sector practices
if thats what you're aiming for. And then you retain all the dividends
in the Government purse,&quot; she argues.
<P>
Ferguson says that the CLC has seen nothing persuasive about the
arguments for privatisation so far, and believes competition in
the telecommunications market has greater potential to bring about
efficiency gains than privatisation. &quot;Privatisation is just
a short term easy way to get a lot of money to solve short term
problems,&quot; she says.
<P>
The CLC and other consumer groups argue that the debate on privatisation
should be delayed until competitive market reforms have been implemented
and competition has become firmly established. There are serious
concerns that if privatisation occurs too early in the competitive
process, there will be less pressure on Telstra to improve its
efficiency, and those gains that it does make will be returned
to shareholders rather than consumers.
<P>
Competition was first introduced into the Australian telecommunications
market in 1991 when the Government selected Optus Communications
as Australia's second telecommunications carrier. Optus currently
provides long distance and international calls by satellite and
mobile telephone services, and has recently offered local calls
for the first time via its Pay TV network.
<P>
Competition from these carriers has already lead to price reductions.
The BIE found that between 1990 and 1994, the price of a basket
of national business services in Australia fell by 8.9 per cent,
and the price of a peak rate international call fell by 28.4 per
cent (although both these price falls were below the OECD average).
Mobile phone charges fell by 26.3 per cent over the period. 
<P>
There is greater potential for increased competition from mid-1997,
when the telecommunications market will be opened to full competition.
Telstra will be under pressure to improve its performance or lose
market share.
<P>
The Consumers Telecommunications Network (CTN), which represents
residential consumers, argues that with all these competitive
changes occurring, the debate on privatisation should be delayed
until at least the year 2000. Only then will the Government be
able to assess the benefits that competition has brought against
additional benefits of privatisation. Privatising Telstra now
confuses two quite separate processes.
<P>
Gerard Goggin of the CTN explains &quot;There's a real danger
that if you privatise too early in the competition process that
Telstra will just be placed in a position to make these wind fall
profits and there's not enough competition around to give them
a hard time and return the so called efficiencies that you want.
<P>
&quot;What could actually happen is that the benefits of that
telecommunications reform in terms of large profit are just being
captured going to shareholders, rather than going to the economy
in terms of cheaper prices and better quality of service across
the board,&quot; he adds.
<P>
Goggin also raises concerns about the type of efficiency gains
that a privatised Telstra might pursue. He suspects that quality
of service improvements and price reductions would be likely to
be directed at the high traffic business services in which competition
is the strongest, while low traffic services to rural and remote
areas would be neglected. While this might be in the best interest
of Telstra's private shareholders, Goggin questions whether we
should accept a market defined by the concept of efficiency which
places no importance on equity in services.
<P>
However, the Australian Telecommunications Users Group (ATUG),
which represents business users, has a different perspective.
Managing Director, Allan Horsley, while emphasising that ATUG
is not a proponent of privatisation, believes the introduction
of a private sector ethos into the management of Telstra and greater
accountability to shareholders will bring benefits.
<P>
Horsley has been less than impressed with some of Telstra's investment
decisions in recent years. He is concerned that Telstra was able
to commit considerable funding to its Pay TV joint venture with
The News Corporation (Foxtel) without justifying this investment
to the Government, let alone the public. In his view, funding
committed to Foxtel could have been put to better use in upgrading
the telephony infrastructure, in particular by bringing forward
the completion date for digitising the network (called Future
Mode of Operation) and by extending the digital link to premises
(called ISDN).
<P>
He is incensed that Telstra has poured billions of dollars into
Pay TV, yet neglected to set aside sufficient funds for ISDN.
While the FMO will enhance the speed of data transmission between
exchanges, premises without ISDN lose valuable speed in data transmission
because they have to convert the signal from digital back to analogue.
He likens it to an artificial bottle-neck that has major implications
for business operators. &quot;Telstra haven't gone out with a
prospectus into the market place saying we're going to spend $5
billion on Pay TV, here's the business plan, here's the investment
criteria, so come and invest some money. No bloody fear. Those
poor suckers out there, our eight million customers, we'll just
take the profits off them and plough it into pay television with
no return, and the worst thing is that the investment into the
development of the core telephone business has been delayed so
that the revenue that is being earned from the telephone business
is not being reinvested but is being hived off over here,&quot;
he says.
<P>
&quot;We've spent $4 billion on the FMO project. Absolutely tremendous
investment to make &#133; the switching and transmission components
of the network digital. A little bit better performance for voice,
but enormous improvement in speed and reliability of transfer
of data. But what they've forgotten about is that we need about
$1 billion over three years to take the capability from the exchange
to your premises (about the 15 to 20 per cent who need it). (Telstra)
Didn't bother to budget the funds.&quot;
<P>
Horsely believes that improved accountability of Telstra's management
will be an important check on this type of decision. He describes
a seemingly ironic situation in which a Government owned Telstra
has largely operated in secrecy, while the privatisation legislation
for Telstra envisages more open decision making with clearer reporting
requirements to Government.
<P>
&quot;We see that the reporting relationship between Telstra and
its (majority) shareholder the Government will be a more formal
and clear relationship than it is at the present time.... You
imagine the Board of BHP going to an annual meeting of shareholders
and saying well I'm not going to tell you anything, you're only
the shareholders. It just wouldn't happen,&quot; he says.
<P>
He emphasises that ATUG does not want the Government to become
involved in the day to day decision making of Telstra. &quot;&#133;
the last thing we want is Ministerial intervention in the operations
of Telstra &#133; The Government should set the focus, the framework,
the objectives, and they (Telstra) get on and do the business.&quot;
<P>
One area where the chance has been missed for a vast improvement
in efficiency is the double roll-out of broadband cable networks
by both Telstra and Optus in capital cities and regional centres.
While they are duplicating each other's services in densely populated
areas, neither appears to have any intention to spread their networks
to the less economical rural and remote areas, which will be stuck
with basic 1950's telephone services.
<P>
The combined cost of the networks is nearly $7 billion. If only
one network had been installed, the excess funds could have been
used to extend the network to other less economical areas, or
for future network upgrades as technology improves. Some environmental
benefits may also have arisen as the cable could perhaps have
been confined to underground. As it is, Optus's network is largely
above ground, suspended from electricity poles, while Telstra's
is largely below ground.&quot; Privatisation will be no help here.

<P>By <A HREF="../journos.htm#ttrinh">Trinh Thanh Thuy</A></CENTER>
<P>
Hanoians are obsessed with the fear of having to wade to work
along streets-turned-to-rivers after long and hard rains.
<P>
It is a scene which is all too common during the wet season. But
in this case, nature is not to blame. The flooding has been caused
by years of overdevelopment.
<P>
With six metres between its highest and lowest points, water drainage
in the Red River City is very slow. Fortunately, the city was
endowed with another means of drainage: the many lakes and ponds
in and around the city. This gift of nature not only enhanced
the city's beauty, but also served as an effective traditional
water regulating system.
<P>
Yet for many years Hanoians have been sacrificing this natural
seasonal convenience for the sake of the all-year-round comfort
of their own fast growing families: they have been filling the
lakes to expand their area for housing.
<P>
<B>The New Venice of the East?</B>
<P>
Many of Hanoi's lakes, ponds and swamps have been filled since
the city was set up ten centuries ago (when boats and rafts were
the main means of transport). But rapid population growth in the
last 20 years has sped the filling of the lakes.
<P>
n the 70s, Hanoi had about 210 lakes, less than 20 of which remain
today. Today the lakes and ponds in Hanoi, into which excessive
rain water flows, have an estimated area of only seven square
kilometres, with a total capacity of approximately 15 million
cubic metres.
<P>
However, as land for housing construction becomes scarcer, people
continue to fill these lakes and ponds with waste, scrap iron,
and rubber and then build houses for both their own use and for
illegal sale.
<P>
In Nam Dong Street, Quoc Lao Lake was reduced to a narrow ditch
of only two metres wide. In Quang Ba village, several large ponds
disappeared, giving way to new villas and houses.
<P>
Whilst in some cases this was done with the consent of the local
authorities, in most circumstances the encroacher had immediately
- and, more importantly, <I>irreversibly</I> - built a house on
the illegally occupied land. Once there, they were more than willing
to pay a fine which was a fraction of what they would gain in
the soaring housing market.
<P>
Last year, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet ordered the demolition of
illegal houses and villas built on the safety corridor of the
river dyke in the Yen Phu-Nhat Tan area. Cracks in the dyke, caused
by the weight of the houses, were discovered just before the beginning
of the flood season. The police and the army were called in to
demolish the houses and ensure security during the process. A
number of officials involved in the scandal were arrested. It
was the most serious breach of the dyke protection law in Vietnam
to date.
<P>
Such strong action has not been taken on squatters in other parts
of the city however, and Hanoi's lake area continues to decrease.
<P>
Consequently, showers with rainfall of over 100mm usually result
in the city being submerged in a mixture of rain and domestic
waste water at 60 different places for several days. In some streets,
the flooded stretches may be as long as hundreds of metres, with
water occasionally up to waist height.
<P>
According to official figures, Hanoi has 230 kilometres of main
streets, thousands of kilometres of side streets and lanes, but
only 127 kilometres of sewers. More than half of the latter are
under streets built over 50 years ago for a population of 200
000 people. And yet today Hanoi's population is over one million
people in the city centre alone. Many sections of the system have
consequently collapsed or are seriously degraded. Meanwhile drainage
has not been given adequate consideration in a number of newly
constructed quarters.
<P>
Encroachment on the main canals and accumulation of solid matter
often blocks water flow at many parts. Furthermore, the maximum
capacity of the Thanh Liet sluice gate (the final outlet of the
city's drainage system) is 30 cubic metres per second, only one-third
over the discharge rate required when the rainfall reaches 100mm.
Hence flooding becomes inevitable once there is not enough space
for temporary storage in the city.
<P>
<B>Waste, Sewage and Fish</B>
<P>
The total liquid waste of the city, estimated by the Hanoi Water
Service to be 200 000 cubic metres per day, passes directly into
the common drainage system untreated.
<P>
Waste water, including chemicals, dyes, heavy metals, and hospital
waste, then flows into the city's lakes, ponds or local rivers
and is used for fish rearing and irrigation. Scientists fear that
this practice, although it helps deal with a considerable amount
of organic matter in the waste water and accounts for almost all
the vegetable and fish supply for Hanoi, will have negative effects
on people's health and the underground water table.
<P>
All of the lakes, except for the West Lake which remains relatively
clean due to its size. 4.15 square kilometres, are seriously polluted.
Most of these lakes have ditches connecting them to sewage outlets.
The content of hydrogen sulphide in waste water flowing into the
Bay Mau lake in Lenin Park can measure up to 12 milligrams a litre,
which is 1000 times the safe level for fish rearing. Despite this,
the lake continues to be used for that purpose.
<P>
The amount of solid matter flowing into the lakes is also on the
rise. This is adding to the metres of thick mud layer already
at the bottom of the lake.
<P>
Recently Hanoi's Drainage Service Company and Park Company began
dredging and have paved the banks of some lakes in a move to prevent
further encroachment into them and to improve their condition.
<P>
But it is only a small part of the work to be done.
<P>
The Municipal Environment Protection Committee has drawn up a
master plan for the drainage service sector in the period 1995-2010.
The $1.1 billion project, expected to be funded with Japanese
official development assistance, consists of several phases and
many components.
<P>
But despite the plan, flooding and waste water seems set to be
in the Hanoians' path for years to come.

<P>
<I>
Agent Orange defoliants sprayed by the US during the war destroyed
more than 100 000 hectares of mangrove forests in the south of
Vietnam. Now, ironically, development, not war, is their biggest
threat.<A HREF="../journos.htm#ttrinh">TRINH THANH THUY</A> reports.
</I>
<P>
HANOI - an ambitious land reclamation program is under way in
the northern province of Quang Ninh.
<P>
Experts predict it will provide an additional 2000 hectares of
land for agricultural and aquacultural purposes. This in turn
will boost expansion of the local economy as well as create many
jobs for soldiers and their families under Vietnam's Third Military
Zone Command, one of the main designers of the program.
<P>
But Vietnamese scientists are worrying that the project, called
the Bac Cua Luc project, may turn out to be a disaster for the
local environment. The reclaimed land, most of it originally covered
by mangrove, might soon become barren.
<P>
Under the program, a 17 kilometre dyke is to be built on tideland
along the coast of Hoanh Bo district on tideland. The dyke will
prevent salt water from entering the district so that the land
can be used for cultivation.
<P>
But according to experts, unless the land is regularly supplied
with enough fresh water, it will soon turn fallow in the dry season.
(Similar failures have occurred on some 50 000 hectares in the
south and 35 000 hectares in the north.) The rehabilitation of
mangroves on this land will then be almost impossible because
there will no longer be a tidal flow (an essential condition for
the development of the plant system). As it is, the embankments
built for many of the large shrimp ponds along the coast, estuaries
and river banks have already considerably reduced the extent of
tide distribution.
<P>
Mangrove forests play an important role in protecting the coastline,
widening the mainland, regulating the climate, and maintaining
local biodiversity.
<P>
In 1943, just before the two Indochina wars, Vietnam had about
400 000 hectares of mangrove forests along the country's coastline
and estuaries, mainly in the south. But Agent Orange defoliants
sprayed by the US during the war destroyed more than 100 000 hectares
of these mangrove forests. Not only did the trees die and the
animals lose their habitat, but the health of the local people
was also seriously affected, with subsequent generations continuing
to bear the consequences. Much of the forests have since been
rehabilitated, but the acreage is still estimated at just over
one-third of what it was then. Now, overdevelopment, not war,
is the biggest threat to the mangroves.
<P>
Apart from the conversion of mangrove forests for cultivation
purposes, mangroves are also been recklessly destroyed to make
shrimp ponds.
<P>
Lured by the profits made from the shrimp export, the Vietnamese
Government and local authorities in many coastal provinces have
encouraged shrimp farming. This move was intended to compensate
for the fact that catches have decreased. But meanwhile the Government
has done little to protect the now vulnerable local forests.
<P>
According to the Sea Products Export Company, the total area of
water shrimp ponds expanded rapidly from 50 000 hectares in 1981
to 120 000 hectares in 1987.
<P>
Other scourges of the mangrove forests have been their conversion
to fields for salt production or mining activities. Urbanisation
and the construction of dykes, dams and roads also endanger mangrove
forests.
<P>
In fact, many of these &quot;developmental&quot; activities have
backfired in no uncertain fashion.
<P>
The most serious and long term negative effect is said to be the
reduction in both quantity and variety of aquatic creatures such
as shrimps, crabs, fish and oysters. Shrimp reared in a large
number of ponds died en masse in 1994, causing a loss of over
290 billion dong (roughly US$29 million) for the aquacultural
sector. Other reptiles, birds and animals have also been deprived
of their habitats and food sources.
<P>
Experts say this was a result of changes in the soil's properties,
particularly in the formation of sulfuric acid through direct
exposure to sunlight following the destruction of mangroves.
<P>
The large size of the shrimp breeding pond and the relatively
few sluice gates meant that the water exchange between the pond
and the outside environment was inadequate. Rain water carried
acidic soil from adjacent hills and embankments into the pond,
quickly reducing the acidity levels. This, added to the rapid
change in salt levels caused by vaporisation during sunny weather,
proved fatal for the shrimps.
<P>
This acidification process is also one reason behind the degradation
of large areas of reclaimed land. Furthermore, unsustainable shrimp
farming and the destruction of forests has increased water pollution
and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in these areas due to greenhouse
emmissions (from the decomposition of the peat layer) no longer
being absorbed by mangroves.
<P>
Additional negative effects have even been felt inland, further
up the river.
<P>
The north-east monsoon brings salt water through rivers deep into
the mainland, affecting land both protected by the river dykes
and outside. This is because the salt water is absorbed through
the soil layers in the body and foot of the dyke. Due to the shortage
of fresh water and low humidity in the dry season, the salt comes
to the soil surface and damages cultivated plants, triggering
disputes between shrimp breeders and agricultural farmers. This
intrusion of salt water has also caused erosion along rivers.
<P>
Addressing the 'mangrove' problem,<B> </B>Prime Minister Vo Van
Kiet recently declared Vietnam's determination to protect the
mangrove forests. To the delight of environmentalists, he ordered
the replanting of mangroves in coastal areas.
<P>
But many obstacles lie ahead.<B> </B>Most of the damage caused
in the past has its roots in rapid population growth and poor
economic and resource management, especially at the local level.
Over the past 50 years, Vietnam's population has more than doubled
to an average of 200 people per kilometre. This cannot help but
continue to increase pressure on the limited resources of land,
fuel and construction materials.
<P>
Dr Phan Nguyen Hong, director of Mangrove Ecosystem Research Centre
of Hanoi National University, has been engaged for a long time
in efforts to protect and replant the forests.
<P>
Hong complains about both the lack of expertise in several responsible
state agencies as well as the short sighted policies implemented
by local leaders. These leaders, according to Hong, are either
unaware of the value of mangrove forests, or think only of the
immediate benefits of their exploitation.
<P>
&quot;We are trying to help them to understand the importance
of mangrove forests and providing necessary expertise. But the
government should have appropriate policies in this direction,&quot;
Hong said.
<P>
Indeed, shrimp farming could still be economical if appropriate
techniques were applied to regulate tidal flow into the pond so
that mangroves can thrive.
<P>
In some localities, such as Ho Chi Minh City and Minh Hai province,
part of the destroyed forests have recently been replanted. Hong,
however, notes that these efforts will be meaningless if forest
destruction is not stopped altogether. &quot;The area planted
has only been one tenth of what was cut down at the same time,&quot;
he said.
<P>
Another problem is the lack of capital for reforestation and mangrove
forest-based sustainable economic development. Except for a program
to plant wind breaker forests along the coast of a number of provinces,
most of the other projects - mainly funded by non-governmental
organisations - are very small in size.
<P>
The biggest projects, soon to be implemented, include restoring
mangrove forests in three southern provinces with a $50 million
World Bank loan, and another combining shrimp farming with forest
conservation with Australian and Thai co-operation.
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Bac Cua Luc project, the construction of a dam
(essential to supply fresh water for the reclaimed land) has not
yet started as the VND5 billion needed has not been sourced.
<P>
&quot;We have been saying again and again that they should not
start the project until there is enough fresh water, but they
are too impatient,&quot; Hong complains, adding that he was afraid
the project may fail.
<P>
Hong says his centre has also prepared and helped publish documents
disseminating essential knowledge about mangroves. These will
be distributed to farmers, school students, and organised training
courses.

&quot;THIS'LL show up cocaine, opiates, and THC, that's marijuana,&quot;
explains a helpful salesman holding up a small container that
looks vaguely like the type of safety cup that small children
drink from. &quot;The results are what we call presumtive positive,
which means it just flags a positive result. The employer would
have to get the results verified by a lab before they could take
action,&quot; he continues cheerfully. Two middle aged guys wearing
suits and name tags interrupt the interview, asking questions
about prices and grabbing handfuls of brochures. My inter-viewee
senses a business opportunity and gives them a casual matey sort
of greeting before getting into the details &quot;This is 33 dollars
per unit but it's three tests in one &#133; &quot; I move on.
<P>
It's the 3rd National Alcohol and Other Drugs in the Workplace
Trade Show. From stall to stall in the plush Sydney Hilton ballroom
company reps are keen to show off their equipment - breathalysers,
urine tests, even a hair analysis - that can tell the police,
an insurance company, or increasingly, your employer whether you
have recently been using drugs. This is a growing business in
Australia and the mood is upbeat. One rep told me that although
sales for his do-it-yourself drug tests were still small they
were increasing 'exponentially'.
<P>
Drug testing employees is a phenomena many people associate with
American work culture, but it's been happening in Australia for
at least five years. Although there are no exact figures on the
level of drug testing in Australia, stories are starting to emerge
that show it is becoming part of our employment landscape.
<P>
A Sydney truck driver, says he has tested positive a number of
times. &quot;I smoke a fair bit [of marijuana] and it's in your
system for 28 days. So every time I've been tested it's come up
positive. They tried to sack me a while ago but backed off when
I got myself a solicitor,&quot; he said. Though the tests haven't
yet had any impact on his work prospects or lifestyle he says
he objects to the tests because of the attitude ingrained in the
procedures. &quot;If people realised what marijuana is about they
might have a different attitude to it,&quot; he said.
<P>
A mine worker from Queensland says he has been tested at work
and turned in a positive result for marijuana use. Though he was
not using the drug at work he was suspended for a short time,
but claims after two positive tests workers are offered the option
of attending a rehabilitation course or the sack. &quot;There's
a pretty good program because it's done with the union and all
that. It's fair that you get a couple of chances but you don't
get counselling until you fail,&quot; he said.
<P>
Tony Buon, a psychologist involved in workplace drug and alcohol
counselling, says it is impossible to say how many companies are
drug testing. &quot;I have on my books companies I know are testing
because they've consulted with us to do the education part or
the counselling. There is a least 100 major companies testing
in Australia. There could be ten times that amount for all I know
though,&quot; he said.
<P>
In 1992 the New South Wales Privacy Commission published this
disturbing account of an unnamed woman's experience when taking
part in a random drug test at work. &quot;I was led into a very
small room with a toilet, sink, and a desk. I was given a container
in which to urinate by the attendant. I waited for her to turn
her back before pulling down my pants, but she told me she had
to watch everything I did. I am a 40 year old mother of three
and nothing I have ever done in my life equals or deserves the
humiliation, degradation and mortification I felt,&quot; she said.
<P>
According to the New South Wales Privacy Commission, in 1991 11.5
per cent of Australian companies had some form of drug testing
procedures in place. The report concluded that the practice was
on the increase.These figures are small when compared with America.
Research from the same period showed that in any year over two-thirds
of the American workforce is likely to undergo drug testing.
<P>
Testing in the US gained momentum during the 1980s 'War on Drugs'
when President Reagan signed an executive order requiring all
government employees to be tested. Laws were then passed to ensure
that any company applying for a government tender had random drug
testing programs in place. Reagan even offered to be tested. Though
legend has it, the idea was dropped when a doctor pointed out
to the 70 year old President that he was taking several medications
that would show up in a test.
<P>
If recent events are anything to go by Bill Clinton does not intend
to be outdone by his Republican predecessors. In December last
year he announced that criminals entering the prison system would
face compulsory drug testing to &quot;break the cycle of crime
and drugs&quot;. Announcing the new initiative he noted approvingly,
&quot;All across our country employers have accepted responsibility
to reduce the level of drug use in the workplace. Teachers and
coaches have accepted the responsibility to reduce the level of
drug use in our schools.&quot; American employers now test workers
for traces of illicit drugs as well as high doses of legal substances
like caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine and a ruling in the US Supreme
Court last year made it legal for high schools to randomly test
students involved in sporting events.
<P>
The American Council for Civil Liberties claimed in a recent paper
that drug testing flourished in the US under the deregulated and
largely non-unionised industrial relations environment of the
1980s. This year over 15 million workers in the US will be given
drug tests by their employers. Critics claim the tests most commonly
used by employers are the cheapest and least reliable. Others
claim that tests are being used to screen workers who are pregnant
or who are taking medication for legitimate medical conditions.
But the most common complaint is that drug testing is a major
breach of individual privacy.
<P>
&quot;Testing really took off in Australia following Reagan's
push in the 1980s,&quot; said Tony Buon. &quot;What happened was,
American companies operating in Australia wanted to have the same
policies.&quot; Changes in Australia such as the decline of union
membership and the movement towards individual employment contracts
has provided an environment where such practices can be adopted.
Although according to Tony Buon this hasn't always been so. &quot;I
remember in the past people used to say we'd like to do drug testing
but the unions wouldn't let us,&quot; he said.
<P>
The internet has become an important meeting place for people
who want to protest against drug testing policies and organise
resistance. Usenet newsgroups like &quot;alt.drugs&quot; are flooded
with horror stories posted by Americans telling of tests gone
wrong and the indignity of having to piss in a cup for an employer.
<P>
One post told the story of a woman who tested positive for opiates
after eating two poppy seed muffins. In another, a woman claimed
that her husband had just been sacked for failing a random test.
&quot;He had an outstanding performance record, attendance record,
and was good enough to relieve for his supervisor. But none of
that mattered when they discovered 374 ng of benzylecognine [element
indicating cocaine use]. &quot;The point is, our life is now in
shambles because of a stupid invasion of privacy,&quot; she said.
<P>
The internet is not just a place for sharing stories on the horror
of the workplace drug test. It is also becoming a place where
people seek information on how to beat the tests. The <I>Anti-Bladder
Cops Society</I> is based around a homepage on the World Wide
Web that contains a huge amount of information on the various
tests, how they work, how accurate they are, what drugs they test
for, and most importantly - how they can be beaten. 
<P>
A FAQ (frequently asked questions) archive titled <I>Fooling the
bladder cops</I> lists dozens of approaches to defeating the drug
tests. These include scientific methods like ingesting substances
that neutralise drug traces in the body, tricks like exchanging
samples, and legal avenues like demanding employers sign contracts
making them liable for any misuse of the sample or any errors.
While most of the information appears credible, even ingenious,
a few of the methods described seem a little extreme. For example,
in a section titled &quot;Injecting&quot; the document reads:

<P>
<I>&quot;There's a way to use substitution even when you're under
the strictest supervision. Athletes trying to pass tests for anabolic
steroids have been known to empty their bladders, and have the
substituted urine injected directly into their bladders via needle.
It was shown in a motion picture like &quot;Wildcats&quot; or
something. While theoretically possible, it's painful and subject
to infection. (kids - don't try this at home:).&quot;</I>
<P>
Justin Gombos, an American, who compiled <I>Fooling the bladder
cops</I> claims to have no special expertise except having always
taken an interest in beating the system. He claims that the drug
war in America is being taken to absurd levels by the authorities
and that the testing laws demonstrate &quot;how totalitarian this
country [America] has become&quot;.
<P>
Contacted via e-mail, Gombos made it clear that he believes drug
testing is a threat to individual rights. &quot;I believe drug
testing is a violation of our Constitution; it's very unjust.
Drug testing is a threat to the civil liberties of all employees,&quot;
he said. He feels so strongly about the issue that he claims people
should boycott companies that test. &quot;I would suggest that
job applicants refuse any employer willing to exploit them in
this manner,&quot; he said.
<P>
Frank Ross is another American who uses the internet to voice
his opposition to drug testing. He believes that Australians should
attempt to stamp out testing before it reaches the same proportions
as America. &quot;[Drug testing] has to be challenged in the political
arena and you have to build a popular consensus around it. In
the US, drugs have been portrayed as the source of all evil by
government and corporate propaganda, so that some people appear
to be willing to relinquish their rights for the 'cause', the
War on Drugs,&quot; he said.
<P>
According to Ross if the issue is productivity and occupational
health and safety, as many companies claim, then employees who
are using drugs, either on the job or in their own time, would
be easy to detect without testing procedures. &quot;The War on
Drugs is a moral crusade and the government or a company has no
right to dictate morality. If an (off-the-job) drug user performs
well in his job then why should he be terminated? If drug taking
is indeed such a hazardous and mentally debilitating activity
then surely the manager will detect a marked reduction in performance
on the job?,&quot; he said. 
<P>
So, as Australia rushes towards full enterprise bargaining and
union membership continues to plummet should we be worried about
going down the same path as America? Patrick Cook, who distributes
do-it-yourself drug testing kits for a European pharmaceutical
multinational, was keen to down play comparisons with the US.
&quot;I think it is unlikely Australia will head in the same direction
as America because of the cultural differences between the countries,&quot;
he said. &quot;The emphasis is on occupational safety, and testing
is only being carried out in areas like mining, transport, and
heavy industry where there are clear dangers in having workers
intoxicated, or working at a reduced level in the workplace. I
really think it can only work in Australia with a cooperative
approach.&quot;
<P>
A paper released in 1992 by the Australian Council of Trade Unions
(ACTU) claimed that drug abuse costs the nation $18.9 billion
a year in medical expenses and lost productivity. This figure
is considered a conservative estimate. There are also obvious
benefits to testing employees in high risk areas such as airlines,
and heavy industry where intoxicated workers could endanger their
own lives and the lives of others.
<P>
But according to Cathy Butcher, the ACTU's Occupational Health
and Safety Officer, drug testing is a superficial answer to the
problem of drug abuse, and it has more to do with policing than
examining the causes of the problem. &quot;Far too many employers
are seeing the problem as catching and disciplining individual
workers. For years we've been fighting against the image of the
careless worker, now we are faced with the myth of the drunk or
drugged worker who is the scapegoat for poor safety and low productivity,&quot;
she said.
<P>
&quot;So if drugs and alcohol are seen as a health and safety
issue then you address them in the same way you address other
health and safety issues. It becomes a simplistic approach when
you say that you are dealing with drugs and alcohol by testing
people, without saying 'Is there anything within the workplace
that feeds that, that contributes to a person using drugs?,'&quot;
she said.

<P>
<I>
With the 65th birthday of Australia's oldest theatre company to
be celebrated next year, <A HREF="../journos.htm#fnoakes"> Frank Noakes </A>reminisces about Newtown's
New Theatre - from its days of communist party affiliations to
its role in censorship struggles, police raids and illegal performances.</I>
<P>
BORN AS the Sydney Workers' Art Club on August 6, 1932, the New
Theatre aimed to provide culture for the working class, from plays
and lectures to music recitals and exhibitions.
<P>
The first play for the amateur company was<I>The Ragged Trousered
Philanthropists </I>in April 1933, the first of more than 400
productions to introduce thousands of people to both sides of
the footlights.
<P>
Following the emergence of the USA's New Theatre movement in the
late 1920s to counter the poverty and hardship of the Great Depression,
Sydney's New Theatre often found itself at the forefront of battles
for free speech and democracy.
<P>
Its earliest productions were rough and ready and flavoured with
activist propaganda. Short plays were often staged outside factories,
alongside dole queues and at Labor Party and Communist Party meetings.
<P>
State governments soon acted to suppress such performances.In
1936 NSW police stormed the stage to stop a performance of Clifford
Odets' anti-fascist play, <I>Till the Day I Die</I>.
<P>
Then in 1968, the theatre faced a new censorship struggle over
Jean Claude Van Itallie's play <I>America Hurrah</I>, a satirical
look at US society. After complaints about the final act in which
huge wooden dolls scrawl obscenities on a wall, the Askin Coalition
government banned the show.
<P>
Defiantly, the company organised an illegal performance in the
Teacher's Federation's Sussex Street auditorium. No advertising
was necessary; hundreds had to be turned away. According to Marie
Armstrong, one of the &quot;dolls&quot; and current vice-president
of the New Theatre, &quot;The air was electric with expectation&quot;.
<P>
Police again moved in but this time escape routes were organised
for the three &quot;dolls&quot; by burly building workers and
wharfies &quot;accidentally&quot; obstructing entry. This allowed
enough time for the actors to shed their costumes and mingle nonchalantly
with the rest of the cast. Nobody was arrested although the police
confiscated the offending set as evidence.
<P>
One of the New Theatre's most memorable moments was its 1952 performance
for underground miners of <I>The Candy Store</I> , a story of
a strike in a US department store.
<P>
Shale miners from Glen Davis, north of Lithgow, began the first
sit-in strike in a NSW colliery and the Miners Federation invited
the New Theatre to perform.
<P>
Smuggled into the mine, the actors improvised a stage with a hessian
curtain at the junction of five shafts with small, inadequate
lamps set on a rickety table. Then, as the actors stepped on stage
in the murky half-light, the miners switched on their hard-hat
lights and bathed the stage in a dusty glow.
<P>
&quot;That's a hard one to beat,&quot; said Armstrong, who also
performed that day.
<P>
Later that year the theatre performed <I>Stay Down Miner</I> by
Len Fox to another audience of striking miners inside the Hunter
Valley's Great Greta coalmine.
<P>
Throughout this period the theatre maintained a close relationship
with the trade union movement, the decline of which is regretted
by Armstrong.
<P>
The New Theatre grew to prominence by staging productions too
hot for professional theatre to touch. It was the first Australian
theatre to perform Arthur Miller's <I>The Crucible</I> in the
1960s but today, because of costs, it is harder for the New Theatre
to obtain first rights to socially relevant plays.
<P>
With 300 volunteer members, the New Theatre still adheres broadly
to humanist values and tries to do plays a little left of centre.
<P>
&quot;If something has a radical left-wing bias and it is well
written we'll want to do it,&quot; says Armstrong.
<P>
&quot;But gone are the days when the message is more important.
If a play is not well written and performed then the message suffers.&quot;
<P>
Next year the New Theatre turns 65. It has no plans to retire.

<P>
CYNICS say the Australian music industry is dead; that it hit
its peak in the '80s with the likes of Midnight Oil, Crowded House
and INXS. They say that venues are shutting down and that there's
not enough new bands emerging to displace the 'Farnsey and Barnesy'
stronghold. These cynics obviously haven't heard of Grinspoon,
Raven, Ode to a Goldfish, or Porcelien. They haven't heard of
Unearthed.
<P>
Unearthed is a nationwide competition run by the ABC's youth radio
network Triple J. Born from the station's longstanding desire
to support young Australian musicians, the competition aims to
discover and promote new bands from regional areas around the
country.
<P>
&quot;It took quite a while to get to the point where we felt
Unearthed was the best way to achieve our aims,&quot; says Bronwyn
McConvill, the competition's co-ordinator.
<P>
But when the former federal government encouraged the expansion
of Triple J into regional Australia, the Unearthed idea began
to take shape.
<P>
McConvill describes the project's aims as twofold:
<P>
&quot;We wanted to get Triple J out into the regional areas; both
programs and staff. We are a national network; we wanted to get
a feel for Australia, instead of just broadcasting from Sydney.&quot;We
also wanted to assist young musicians in regional Australia ...
and give them a chance of national exposure,&quot; she says. 
<P>
But McConvill believes the competition is ultimately about young
Australians, be they musicians or not.
<P>
&quot;Young people love hearing what other young people are up
to,&quot; she says. &quot;Because the shows are broadcast from
each regional area, the listener gets a feel for that area - a
chance to hear what is happening in other young people's lives.
Capital city listeners hear about Lismore or Rockhampton through
the words and music of the area's young residents.&quot;
<P>
By July this year, Triple J will have 'unearthed' all the regional
areas to which it presently broadcasts.
<P>
The competition has already been successful in increasing audiences
and venues for live music in regional Australia. Venues have capitalised
on the success of Unearthed and have been giving local bands regular
gigs.
<P>
In Rockhampton, for instance, a concert featuring 13 local bands
was recently staged following the town's huge response to the
Triple J competition.
<P>
&quot;With any luck,&quot; says McConvill, &quot;I think [venues
and regional acts] will gradually get over 'pub rock' and bloody
cover songs ... Bands are finding they can be original, and can
be accepted.&quot;Indeed the deluge of original new bands makes
judging the Unearthed competition extremely difficult, according
to McConvill. She says the judges are essentially &quot;looking
for a song to play on the radio; no particular genre, just a song
that sounds great.&quot;
<P>
Most of the hundreds of demo tapes sent in by aspiring bands have
been cheaply recorded in bedrooms and garages. McConvill says
that judging the competition is more often than not a matter of
&quot;hearing through a bad recording&quot;.
<P>
The winner from each region is awarded a recording session in
the Triple J studios. With professional assistance, they produce
a slick DAT demo tape which they can take to record companies.
<P>
Some of the winners have already met with success as a result
of the competition.
<P>
Lismore band Grinspoon, one of the first bands to be &quot;unearthed&quot;,
gained a spot in the 1995 Triple J Hottest 100 with their song
<I>Sick Fest</I>. The band was also included on the prestigious
Homebake festival bill.
<P>
Porcelein, the Broken Hill winners, played at the recent Livid
Festival in Brisbane; while Gold Coast winners, Communion, have
just snared a breakthrough record deal with the prestigious Mushroom
label.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant thing about Unearthed, however, is
that it shows that Australian music is alive and well. Venues
are hiring these young bands, and crowds are swelling in support.
Australian music, it seems, is on the rise.

<P><A HREF="../journos.htm#lyoung">By Lynda Young</A></CENTER>
<P>
THURSDAY is Domestic Violence day at Waverley Courthouse and Michelle
Karaman is one of 23 women seeking an Apprehended Violence Order
on their husband or boyfriend. She is pretty, petite and used
to be proud of her long black hair which is now greying and matted.
She angrily pulls at it with both hands and protests sarcastically
to anyone who'll listen, &quot;He's taken away my life, you'd
think he'd spare the hair.&quot;
<P>
The small room they wait in has been set aside by the Domestic
Violence Assistance Scheme, a joint initiative of community workers
and solicitors involved in providing emotional and legal support
to survivors of domestic violence.
<P>
The provision of the room protects victims from the anxiety of
mingling with their alleged abusers. But Michelle is still worried
at the thought of seeing her husband who waits just outside the
door.
<P>
&quot;He's out there,&quot; she says with clenched teeth to her
daughter Debra. &quot;That bastard. After all he's put me through,
can you believe he denies everything?&quot;
<P>
Michelle's marriage to Fedai was hasty. They met when she was
just 16, 12 years ago in Turkey, and married within six weeks.
Michelle thought she was marrying a prince. He was charming and
handsome, but on the night of their wedding he beat her with a
chair because the stockings she borrowed from his mother kept
falling down during the ceremony.
<P>
Two months into the marriage Michelle was pregnant and Fedai,
who was 10 years her senior, moved them to Australia, away from
her family and friends, to take up a job offer. Within the first
week of their arrival Fedai left without explanation.
<P>
&quot;I was totally alone. My family didn't support the marriage
in the first place and were glad to be rid of me. I had no money
and barely spoke the language.&quot;
<P>
For a year she struggled to make ends meet cleaning houses and
waitressing. After the birth of her daughter Debra in 1985 she
heard from Fedai.
<P>
&quot;He begged me to take him back saying that he loved me. So
I did. I had nothing and I thought awful was better than nothing.&quot;
<P>
Five years and two more babies later Michelle was completely dependent
on Fedai. He had isolated her from any friends she made, forbid
her to work and beat her almost daily.
<P>
&quot;I didn't want to go anywhere or meet anyone because I was
ashamed. I always had bruises on my face and had completely lost
my identity.&quot;
<P>
For the next four years the violence became more intense. Michelle
would no longer react to pain or plead Fedai to stop. Her indifference
enraged him, so he added tools to the ritual beatings.
<P>
&quot;He poured hot oil from a pan on the stove over my head,
broke all my fingers on my hands with the end of an empty bottle
of scotch, and two years ago hit me with the car one morning when
I was walking down the driveway.&quot;
<P>
Michelle never told anyone about the beatings or went to hospital,
but secretly planned the day she would leave.
<P>
Michelle's case is just one of thousands. The New South Wales
Bureau of Crimes Statistics and Research (BCSR) recorded nearly
4000 cases in New South Wales of domestic violence in 1994, resulting
in only 16 convictions - an overall success rate of 0.04 per cent.
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation believes that in the United
States domestic violence is the most unreported crime, and estimates
that it is ten times more unreported than rape.
<P>
Similar results were found by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
in April 1990, when survey figures reflected an estimate of 19
000 victims of domestic violence in a 12 month period, yet only
2200 were reported to police.
<P>
Maria Vucko, Coordinator of the Waverley Domestic Violence Court
Assistance Scheme, fears that the number of unreported incidences
will increase due to inadequate legislation, women not understanding
their rights, and lack of police education.
<P>
&quot;I've talked ad nauseam to police officers about the importance
of encouraging women to file criminal complaints so that we can
get some of the offenders a criminal history and put them away.
But when some of the people on the force are involved in domestic
violence cases of their own, my words fall on deaf ears.&quot;
<P>
Steve Heath, clerk of Waverley Court, agrees with Ms Vucko, and
believes there is much work to be done and that education is the
solution.
<P>
&quot;The police, historically, have not been compassionate with
women who call for assistance. They look at that kind of call
as more of an irritant and do not take it as seriously as, say,
a call involving a weapon. That's where the ignorance lies.&quot;
<P>
Mr Heath believes the legislation dealing with domestic violence
does not protect the victim. &quot;The legislation can exist without
the officers even knowing about it because of the constant amendments
to the Crime Act. That in itself is a huge gap of communication.
If the officers are not informed how can they pass on good counsel?&quot;
<P>
In response to the calls for more community education, a program
was launched in early 1996, promoting the involvement of police
in dealing with domestic violence.
<P>
Statistics from the BCSR show that 70 per cent of New South Wales
police work involves domestic violence. The Department for Women
has initiated training for service providers and professionals
working with survivors of domestic violence.
<P>
However, despite these government efforts, horror stories like
Michelle's are heard daily by counsellor Carol Maderious, from
the Botany Family and Child Care Centre, who assists on the monthly
rotation roster at the Scheme.
<P>
&quot;At least eight to ten victims pour into the Centre weekly
and they all have the same thought - that they can change their
man.&quot;
<P>
According to Ms Maderious, women involved in domestic violence
situations take on a martyr role, and accept their lifestyle as
normal because the man believes it to be true.
<P>
&quot;Most of the women have severely low self esteem and suffer
from chronic depression which is why it's a miracle if they break
the cycle and take the first step to admit the problem, get out
and get help. The recurring theme is that they all believe or
hope that the men are going to somehow get better if they can
act a certain way or fix their favourite foods.
<P>
&quot;But the reality is these men are mentally ill in some form
or another, or are repeating the vicious circle that was displayed
to them in their homes as children. I'm not saying this to excuse
the behaviour, but to emphasise my belief that these men cannot
be rehabilitated.&quot;
<P>
The relevant section of the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 states
that a person may apply for an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO)
if someone intentionally:
<P>
<I> &#133; injures or threatens to injure, damages or threatens
to damage property, uses words or actions to intimidate or harass,
follows repeatedly, telephones repeatedly at home or work, behaves
indecently without consent, and/or gets someone else to injure,
harass or threaten.</I>
<P>
The law deals with domestic violence in two ways: criminal charges
of assault and/or an AVO. Criminal charges and an application
for an AVO can and should occur together, according to Bruce Mexon,
Senior Constable and Victim's Support Coordinator for the Waverley
Police.
<P>
 &quot;To get a conviction on a criminal charge related to domestic
violence is very difficult.&quot; This is shown by the statistically
low conviction rate in New South Wales in 1994. &quot;The fact
is we need documentation of all incidences which occurred, credible
witnesses for the prosecution and, unfortunately, it makes a dramatic
difference if the victim has obvious injuries, pictures or medical
reports ... when they come to court.&quot;
<P>
Judge Terry Forbes of Waverley Court agrees with Senior Constable
Mexon, and says that in most criminal cases, rulings will be made
according to the level of documented abuse. &quot;Mental abuse
weighs just as heavily as physical abuse, however, it's harder
to prove. Most cases heard are years in the making. With no physical
evidence, it comes down to the plaintiff's word against the defendant's.&quot;
<P>
This is where the legislation begins to fail. Hard evidence is
difficult to come by in most cases of domestic abuse, as women
rarely come forward and lodge a complaint against their husbands.
The woman feels trapped and usually cuts off support systems such
as her friends and family due to her feelings of self-blame.
<P>
Low income also plays a key role but is not always the norm. Ms
Vucko refers to a 'high profile' case she is currently working
on where the alleged victim, the wife of a prominent barrister
in New South Wales, has many wealthy friends and caring family
members. In cases such as this, the situation can be complicated
by status and reputation.
<P>
&quot;I use the example,&quot; she states, &quot;to simply prove
any socio-economic group is not exempt and the pattern of abuse
and control is the same regardless.&quot;
<P>
After the woman has applied for the AVO a magistrate issues a
summons for the appearance of the defendant at court or a warrant
for their arrest, depending on the severity of the complaint.
The person in need of protection need only satisfy the court 'on
the balance of probabilities' that fear exists. The magistrate
will then set an interim order or bail conditions placing restrictions
on the offender until the hearing. An interim order holds the
same weight as an AVO, but expires on the date of the hearing.
<P>
According to Domestic Violence Officer at the NSW Police Department,
Julie Stewart, the problem that results is that few criminal precedents
are set because women are encouraged to be satisfied with the
rulings from an AVO.
<P>
&quot;Most applications for AVOs result in an interim (order)
because criminal pursuits are not historically regarded as successful,&quot;
she says. &quot;Of the 4000 complaints filed in 1994, more than
80 per cent were settled with an interim. If we had that extra
80 per cent to draw on yearly, new precedents would surely be
set and women would feel more confident that the system was working
for them and not against.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Many times the men ignore the orders and the temptation
to repeat the offence becomes more important than a slip of paper,&quot;
says Ms Stewart.
<P>
Men who are not gaoled and receive a final order following an
interim order are usually given guidelines to follow for a period
of up to six months. These guidelines include distance restrictions,
no phone contact with the plaintiff, and no contact with friends
or family of the woman who has complained.
<P>
According to Carol Maderious, the women live in a state of fear
because the order relies on the perpetrator's self-control. In
many cases the final order is broken resulting in a more severe
injury or even occasionally murder.
<P>
&quot;This is simply not enough,&quot; says Carolyn Middleton,
assistant clerk of the Waverley Courthouse. &quot;I see the same
women in here over and over again, terrified because they got
a call or a letter or even saw their perpetrator. The system is
backlogged with repeat applications because we're trusting good
behaviour from criminals.&quot;
<P>
The law states that a defendant who breaches the final order can
be subject to a term of imprisonment, however, repeat offences
still happen.
<P>
Michelle is back at the Scheme room from her hearing; her hands
shake as she reads the interim order. &quot;This is what it comes
down to after 12 years and the mess he's made out of my life.&quot;
<P>
Her tone increases with each syllable. &quot;I had to take off
work, wait here four hours and that judge thinks this will keep
him out of my house?&quot;
<P>
Carol Maderious sits down next to her and tries to explain how
the system works. After five impatient minutes Michelle can take
no more. &quot;The system doesn't work for me, it works for him.
He can still do whatever he wants at the end of the day, can't
he? And at the end of the day I'm still afraid.&quot;
<P>
According to Waverley Court Clerk, Steve Heath, Fedai refused
to admit to any of Michelle's allegations but consented to the
Apprehended Violence Order.
<P>
&quot;He is promising the court that he won't assault, harass
or approach the plaintiff or the residence of the plaintiff for
two years,&quot; he said.
<P>
It will be Michelle's decision to renew the order if she wishes
to extend the period of court protection.

<P>
Picking up the pieces
<P>
Cecilia Wheeler lived with her husband in Randwick for 25 years
until recently when Ronald Wheeler was sentenced by Magistrate
Terry Forbes at Waverley Courthouse.
<P>
Three days before the sentencing Ronald went into one of his unprovoked
rages and beat Cecilia repeatedly with a hard plastic water pipe.
She has just turned 49 but looks closer to 60. Her face is black
and blue, but she is smiling as Ronald has lost his right to contact
Cecilia and their two children, Evelyn and Mark, indefinitely.
<P>
Mr Wheeler sat weeping in the witness stand while the sentence
was read to him, slowly, as Magistrate Forbes wanted him to hear
every word.
<P>
&quot;The pain you have caused Mrs Wheeler and your children is
written all over her face today. The pain you are feeling for
losing your family forever is because of what you have done. Don't
feel sorry for yourself, Mr Wheeler, feel sorry for your family.&quot;
<P>
Ronald Wheeler was given the maximum sentence. He may never contact
his family, and if he breaches the order he will be immediately
taken to jail for five years.
<P>
After the order, Cecilia received supportive calls from friends
and community workers. &quot;I hope he breaches that order,&quot;
Cecilia says angrily. &quot;Then I'll know where he is all the
time.&quot;
<P>
Cecilia stayed in the abusive situation because she felt she had
no other alternative. &quot;What else could I do. He had control
of the money and of my life.&quot;
<P>
The beatings Cecilia experienced were always unprovoked and started
two weeks after their marriage. Verbal jabs were coupled with
the violence, &quot;he would wind up and hit me in the breast
and say now no one will ever want you because you're deformed.&quot;
<P>
After many years Cecilia stopped crying and like Mark just withdrew.
&quot;I feel like I got hit by a double-decker bus everyday for
the past 25 years and now I just want some peace and quiet.&quot;

<P>
<I>New South Wales police have looked to America for a new weapon
in the war against drugs. And, as <A HREF="../journos.htm#blin">BRUCE LIN</A> discovers, the results
are boosting law enforcement budgets.</I>
<P>
INSIDE a stark Kent Street building, whose walls are painted a
sterile hospital green, a select team of lawyers, accountants
and analysts congregate to fight organised crime. Enlisted by
the New South Wales Crime Commission, the team's prime task is
the confiscation of assets from suspected drug dealers.
<P>
Confiscation is a relatively new procedure in Australia; and according
to many police is already proving to be a more effective deterrent
than gaol.
<P>
The practice was pioneered in the United States where, in certain
states, the legislation even allows law enforcement bodies to
seize assets from suspected drug dealers automatically prior to
charging, even if there is no conviction. In Volutia county, Florida,
the local sheriffs have even taken to stopping cars at random
and seizing cash from any driver carrying more than $100 (the
assumption being that such a sum could <I>only </I>be acquired
through drug dealing).
<P>
Taking its cue from such American practices, the Kent Street team,
working alongside state police in the Drug Enforcement Agency,
confiscated $6.8 million worth of assets last year, ranging from
grand North coast villas to Harley Davidson motorbikes.
<P>
According to the NSW Crime Commission's senior confiscation lawyer,
Jane [surname withheld], drug traffickers are becoming increasingly
nervous about the risks of detection. Many are now employing a
legion of highly paid tax specialists and lawyers to launder their
money through offshore companies in an effort to elude authorities.
<P>
Jane's investigations have uncovered several unconventional methods
used by traffickers to disguise their assets.&quot;One fellow
never owned a car so he used to go and hire cars everywhere,&quot;
she says. &quot;Another one would order a pizza 80 kilometres
away to be delivered by taxi.&quot;
<P>
The confiscation game is about survival of the smartest. More
significantly, though, it's about money. Drug lords deal to reap
the top dollar. Cops, it can be argued, confiscate assets for
exactly the same reason.
<P>
Of the $6.8 million confiscated last year, nearly every cent was
allocated to the coffers of the NSW police ministry. Calls from
the community to use the money to set up drug rehabilitation and
education programs have repeatedly fallen on deaf ears.
<P>
One veteran detective [name withheld], who is currently working
with the Kent Street confiscation team, defends the allocation
of money by pointing out the present inadequacy of police resources.
<P>
&quot;[The money] should be ploughed back to the police that fight
the criminals. We're always three steps behind them. They have
the best phones, fastest cars, the best everything,&quot; he says.
<P>
In certain American states, funding through asset confiscation
relieves police departments of suffering at the hands of a dwindling
state budget. In Greenville county, South Carolina, a new police
training facility was financed thanks to land seized from a one-time
prosperous dealer. Similarly, assets amounting to $5 million confiscated
in Sulphur, Louisiana, have led to the introduction of immaculately
equipped sports coup&eacute; police cars on the streets of Sulphur.
<P>
The United States Drug Enforcement Agency has absolute confidence
in the all-round efficacy of its asset confiscation program. New
South Wales, in turn, has absolute confidence in the program's
universal adaptability.
<P>
Our faceless veteran detective automatically endorses the sentiment
of America's DEA boss, Robert Bonner, who awaits the day when
&quot;the drug trafficking organisations will wither and die.&quot;
<P>
Never before has waiting proved so lucrative.

<P>
<I>Wearing your oldest tracksuit, hanging out in bars and regularly
buying heroin may not sound like a promising career path. But,
as <A HREF="../journos.htm#mgirdham">MELISSA GIRDHAM</A> and <A HREF="../journos.htm#sharris">SONIA HARRIS</A> report, it's all in a day's
work for undercover cop Garth Hazell.</I>
<P>
GARTH Hazell is an undercover cop. He's been working the streets
of Cabramatta for over a year now. His assignment? <I>Operation
Hammer</I>: a crackdown on Cabramatta's rampant street heroin
trade. In the past year, Hazell has arrested more than 300 dealers
- that's an average of two arrests a day.
<P>
&quot;Undercover work is the best way to catch drug dealers,&quot;
he says. &quot;If an undercover police officer buys [the heroin],
he's got it in his hands and he can give evidence.&quot;
<P>
Hazell's work is confined exclusively to the streets. He cruises
Cabramatta wearing his oldest, grubbiest clothes and says he pretends
to be of low intelligence (&quot;you just mimic the dealers&quot;).
<P>
Wired with a microphone and camera, Hazell approaches dealers
randomly while his fellow officers observe from a distance as
back-up.
<P>
&quot;Police always watch from buildings with binoculars &#133;
and you give them signs when the deal is complete. You then walk
away from the scene and the police come in and make the arrest,&quot;
says Hazell. &quot;Undercover police don't get involved in the
arrest so they don't draw attention to themselves and can buy
again. You have so much rotation of police in Cabramatta so one
face is not there for too long doing undercover work.&quot;
<P>
Street-dealing heroin is the base of the drug pyramid. The 5-T
gang, with its band of loyal supporters, is virtually untouchable
at the top of the heroin hierarchy.
<P>
&quot;The 5-T gang don't really deal much themselves any more,&quot;
says Hazell, &quot;they get all the school kids to do it for them.
They'll give them a couple of caps of heroin or some money to
deal for them.&quot;
<P>
The recent high rate of arrest means young dealers are more switched-on
than ever. According to Hazell, they're prepared to go to any
lengths to protect themselves from being caught.
<P>
&quot;[They] often store drugs in the mouth or in balloons. They've
been known to keep it in the lobes of their ear. There's no place
sacred for them,&quot; he says.
<P>
&quot;If a police officer comes along to search them, they swallow
it and retrieve it after the digestive process has taken place.
It doesn't sound very nice but that's what they do.&quot;
<P>
Despite Constable Hazell's tireless efforts, he says he ultimately
feels rather helpless. This is partly because the nature of the
trade means that, no matter how many dealers the police arrest,
there's always just as many ready to take their place.
<P>
&quot;You only have to walk into one of those stairwells in apartment
blocks and you see some disgusting vomit sights, needles, syringes
and balloons. And you think, 'people raise families here; they
walk out of their door and see such things.'&quot;
<P>
Hazell blames the media which persists in portraying Cabramatta
as a &quot;bulletin board for heroin.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Many addicts say they didn't know Cabramatta existed until
it was publicised in the news,&quot; says Hazell. &quot;Gaols
are filling up but the media keeps publicising Cabramatta as the
drug capital of the world, and you've got people as far as Canberra,
Port Macquarie and Queensland coming down to buy heroin ... The
media just makes our job a lot harder.&quot;
<P>
Hazell will shortly return to uniformed patrol, after more than
a year's service on the streets pretending to be a smack fiend.
<P>
&quot;After a year and a half it gets hectic,&quot; he says. &quot;You
just get sick of it. Sick of drugs, sick of druggies, sick of
the whole lot.

<P>
WATERGATE? You can put that name to many things. A break-in -
a cover-up - a scandal; the fall of a president - a muckraking
melee - a myth. Some might say a journalistic wet-dream. The only
certainty? It was - and still is - a hotel.It has also entered
the lexicon. Look up <I>The Concise Macquarie Dictionary</I> and you find
there's a new word for political scandal. Watergate, as well,
is the progenitor of Irangate, Iraqgate, Camillagate, Squidgy-gate,
Whitewatergate, even Baxtergate!
<P>
Today, Watergate continues to resonate through culture and politics.
There is obvious significance for journalism and students of political
history. Murray Hogarth ofThe Sydney Morning Herald thinks that
the Watergate affair &quot;popularised the notion of investigative
journalism for a generation which has carried it ever since.&quot;
For much of the public, this was a new field of reporting. Four
Corners' Liz Jackson says that for a journalist, Watergate &quot;seems
the highpoint of efficacy of the media in bringing public figures
to account. It's a validation of what people hope at their best
they can do.&quot;
<P>
Even Hollywood can see an angle. Oliver Stone has just directed
a bio-pic of Nixon. And has published an accompanying book that
contains the script, an interview with himself (naturally), and
original Watergate documents and tape transcripts.
<P>
24 years ago, the otherwise unremarkable Washington hotel and
apartment complex called the Watergate was the venue for a botched
break-in and bugging attempt at the then headquarters of the Democratic
Party National Committee. The cast? A hodge-podge of ex-CIA/ex-FBI
functionaries and some exiled Cuban (Bay of Pigs) veterans. These
shenanigans were the culmination of a two-year campaign of illegal
domestic espionage activities by the White House and the Committee
to Re-elect the President against their perceived political and
media enemies. The burglary was a government sanctioned crime.
It was June 16, 1972.
<P>
August 9, 1974 saw the resolution of the affair - President Richard
Nixon resigned from office over his involvement in the ensuing
cover-up. More than two years of turmoil was strewn between these
inextricably linked dates. And as Nixon walked, however reluctantly,
into infamy, a great tide of public discontent and disbelief swelled
behind him. His landslide electoral win of November 7, 1972 (while
Watergate was evolving) would be the last highpoint in his tenure
as president. It went sour as Watergate was examined by the courts,
the FBI, a senate committee, a long running grand jury investigation,
a special Watergate prosecutor, and the House Judiciary Committee.
From the moment he left the White House lawn in 1974 to his death
in 1994 he would be branded an unindicted co-conspirator in these
sordid events.
<P>
That first June day, accused James McCord admitted he had recently
worked for the CIA; a Nixon re-election campaign donation cheque
appeared in another suspect's pocket; and the name and phone number
of a White House operative, Howard Hunt, leapt from the pages
of a third thief's diary. These leads were astounding but seemingly
innocuous curiosities until painstaking investigation by the Washington
Post proved them otherwise.
<P>
The role of journalism in the Watergate affair was complex and
vigorously debated. Essentially, journalists led the chase for
the story from the moment the burglars appeared in court, until
the machinery of government and the courts began to prove effective
after Nixon's re-election. The early exposes of the Post, and
later follow-up work by the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times,
and CBS produced an outstanding body of investigative journalism
and hammered on the door of a rapidly besieged White House.
<P>
The Washington Post and two of its young reporters, Bob Wood-ward
and Carl Bernstein, became internationally famous over their pursuit
of the story. Their determination and their continual ability
to scoop other press outlets were hallmarks. Effectively they
opened up the investigation to the public in its early stages
and exposed elements of the cover-up that ensued. Together, they
followed a trail of money and personnel from the sixth floor of
the Watergate to the top levels of the Nixon administration.
<P>
Woodward and Bernstein traced the path of Nixon campaign contributions
that funded the Republican dirty tricks team into the White House
itself. They began naming White House officials as controllers
of a slush fund that directed nefarious political activities.
To do so, they pursued investigative reporting as news reporters,
and not as political roundsmen. As such, they stayed away from
formal information sites like press conferences, and were unacquainted
with the normal sources in government. Improvisation ruled, and
they created a labyrinth of sources and contacts who, as an unwitting
coalition, confirmed and supported fact, supposition and theory.
In effect, they scrambled around the margins of politics on Watergate.
This brought them to dissatisfied people at all levels who were
ready to talk or to be persuaded to do so.
<P>
Their methods are depicted in their own All The President's Men
(written before the fall of Nixon, in 1974, and made into the
successful 1976 film starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman).
The two reporters talk of the trickle of information coming from
frightened, reluctant people who frequently held back more than
they told. To circumvent this and to turn the trickle to flow,
&quot;the trick was getting inside someone's apartment or house.
There, a conversation could be pursued &#133; They always identified
themselves immediately as reporters for the Washington Post but
the approach that seemed to work best was less than straightforward
&#133; &quot; They begged, borrowed and cajoled their way in -
often bluffing their way to the truth.
<P>
Frequent meetings were held with editors Barry Sussman, Howard
Simons, Harry Rosenfeld, and executive editor, Ben Bradlee, to
approve and edit stories and decide direction. The reporters usually
argued that one source was enough to support a story. But &quot;gradually
an unwritten rule was evolving: unless two sources confirmed a
charge involving activity likely to be considered criminal, the
specific allegation was not used in the paper.&quot; Some stories
needed even more.
<P>
The effectiveness of these reporting techniques is most evident
in that the stories held firm and were vindicated. Furious White
House denials of the alleg-ations and vilification of the Post
were all withstood partly because of the scrutiny to which the
evidence was subjected.
<P>
These methods suited the situation but did not always ensure accuracy.
Stories were often left unattributed. Very few sources would go
on the record, and background and deep background (in which a
source is never quoted, even anonymously) were frequently employed.
The White House often complained over published accusations that
had unidentified origins.
<P>
Woodward's executive branch contact, Deep Throat, was the most
celebrated example of the use of a confidential source on deep
background. He refused to be quoted in any story and would not
volunteer information, only confirming or denying evidence presented
to him. His information proved ultimately reliable, and his (or
her?) identity remains an enigma today. And the name of the top-secret
confidential source on TV's X-Files? In honour perhaps, Deep Throat.
<P>
Occasionally, stories were incorrect. Accusing White House Chief
of Staff H. R. Haldeman of involvement was made possible by a
web of confirmations so tenuous that it was swiftly and vehemently
rebuked, causing the Post to lose face and ground. This was despite
the story's essential truth. Accountant to the Committee to Re-Elect
the President, Hugh Sloan, had confirmed indirectly to the reporters
that Haldeman was the fifth name controlling the fund that financed
illegal activities on behalf of the Committee. Deep Throat had
informed them that they were right, and another confi-dential
source had added further weight. The story was written, however,
quoting only Sloan, and reported him naming Haldeman in his Grand
Jury Testimony. His attorney vehemently denied the allegation.
Later, Sloan indicated that Haldeman was the fifth name, but he
had not actually ever said so before the Grand Jury as no-one
had asked.
<P>
Vindication of the basic story of Watergate has quelled much valid
criticism of Woodward and Bernstein's techniques. Indeed, approbation
has pretty much always been the order of the day, although criticism
has emerged concerning the use of, and reliance on, confidential
sources. When a story is wrong, multiple back-ground sources and
chain reaction confirmation of facts are no guarantee of truth.
The use of confidential sources can be risky.
<P>
Stories by the Post earned them subpoenas from lawyers representing
the Committee to Re-elect the President (which were challenged
and dismissed), and two trips to see Judge John Sirica for approaches
to witnesses and grand jurors. Obtaining vital information often
required such tactics of questionable legality. Whether the situation
demanded skirting the edges of the law so frequently and brazenly
is still debatable.
<P>
Was the press lacking in effectiveness? Early forays by the Washington
Post had only minor initial impact. Journalists from the Sunday
Times in London thought that this was true to the extent that
&quot;by the fall of 1972 it was the press, not the administration,
that lacked credibility.&quot; In a celebrated but largely apocryphal
moment, Ben Bradlee was heard to say that at this point his newspaper
really had its dick on the table. Later, however, televised hearings
and sensational confessions of highly placed White House officials
garnered national attention and cemented the credibility of the
press.
<P>
The impact on Australian journalism? Both Murray Hogarth and Liz
Jackson speak glowingly of Watergate as a &quot;journalistic beacon&quot;
and refer to Australian journalists such as Chris Masters and
Brian Toohey, whose paths to success have partly been paved by
Woodward and Bernstein.
<P>
Toohey himself argues otherwise. To him, Watergate simply employed
available contemporary techniques and has not affected Australian
journalism to any great degree. He feels that investigative journalism
puts advertisers offside, causes trouble, doesn't pay well, and
takes months to do. Consequently, it engenders little enthusiasm
in newspaper management. Indeed, &quot;investigative journalism
has gone downhill all round the world&quot;.
<P>
Journalist Michael Schudson (and others), however, talks of an
all pervading myth of &quot;Journalism-in-Watergate&quot;. Shudson
argues persuasively against the idea that &quot;the Washington
Post brought down the President&quot;. He concludes that this
gives undue credit to the Post where properly, it should go to
those government agencies that performed admirably. The FBI, the
Federal Grand Jury investigation, and the machinations of the
justice system of the United States all made handsome contributions
to the tale of woe. Each of these governmental law enforcement
arms pursued legitimate investigation of Watergate collaborators,
and between them conducted the many government hearings that eventually
crowded and concluded the affair.
<P>
It is easy in hindsight to indicate the lack of press involvement
and influence over these hearings. But is it fair to saddle the
press with the duties of the investigative bodies? For example,
it is often understated that Nixon was halfway to impeachment
and politically pungent when he left office. Yet it was not open
to journalism to initiate or undertake this course of action.
And would we have seen the same results without theWashington
Post, et al ? Senator Sam Ervin, (in whose committee hearings
former Counsel to the President John Dean first publicly accused
the president of complicity in the cover-up), openly sought assistance
from those journalists who had reported the case.
<P>
Historian T. H. White concluded, &quot;it was three specific systems
acting by themselves and by their own dynamics - the press from
outside, the judicial system and Congressional leadership acting
from within - that moved first tentatively, then inexorably, to
bring about the downfall of Richard Nixon.&quot; The myths of
Watergate need to be tempered, but each institution - media, Judiciary
and Capitol Hill - played a part.
<P>
Did the press have a right to pursue the story? Did the White
House have a right to conceal? The First Amendment to the United
States Constitution helps to resolve this debate. Freedom of the
press is a direct stipulation that government will not interfere.
The press had a right to find out the answers, and then a duty
to endure the consequences. White says the news machine did no
more than its constitutional duty.
<P>
Watergate was, maybe, a historical aberration, an extraordinary
confluence of factors never to be repeated. Certainly, it is hard
to see the White House ever again being as careless with its activities.
Or as carefree in its relations with the media. And would a President
ever again be as foolish as to oversee, personally, such shenanigans?
In a presidential election year, republican candidate and retiring
Senator Bob Dole may give us an opportunity to find out. He does
have intimate knowledge. After all, his home in Washington is
The Watergate Hotel.

</FONT><BR></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>IN THE year since Snoop last reported on the difficulties
faced by women driving down the road of enterprise bargaining,
the situation has not improved. Indeed, as <A HREF="../journos.htm#pbenson">PAULA BENSON</A> reports,
the potholes may be getting bigger.</I>
<P>
Paul Keating stuck the toe of the Australian workplace into the
murky waters of enterprise bargaining. The new Coalition government
is throwing it into the deep end of deregulation. For female workers
the news is not good. &quot;The evidence from overseas shows that
the more decentralised the bargaining, the worse it is for women,&quot;
says Suzanne Jamieson, spokesperson for the National Pay Equity
Coalition.
<P>
Since enterprise bargaining began, Australian women in many instances
have not been able to participate or achieve better wages and
conditions for a number of reasons. They often work in poorly
unionised workplaces and they suffer from poor representation
within union bureaucracies. Female employees are concentrated
in low paying and low skilled jobs. They do high levels of part-time
and casual work and are more likely to bear the brunt of family
responsibilities.
<P>
Enterprise bargain-ing encourages productivity-based wage increases,
but female employees are concentrated in service industries where
productivity is difficult to measure. &quot;If you're a nurse
for example how do you measure productivity? Count the turnover
in beds? Well one way of doing that is to kill the patients!&quot;
Jamieson exclaims. &quot;It's very different from say a factory
where you can measure input and output.&quot;
<P>
The objective of the new legislation is to focus on the economy.
The government wants to encourage high employment and low inflation,
reduce the deficit and increase productivity; but at what cost
to female workers?
<P>
The Coalition promises that no worker will go home with less money
in their pocket as a result of the changes. However awards will
be stripped back to 18 conditions, leaving everything else up
for grabs, to be bargained for. Rosemary Keogh, Senior Industrial
Officer with the Finance Sector Union says, &quot;There is now
no pressure through the industrial system for employers to conform
to long standing conditions, and women are going to cop most of
the downgrading&quot;.
<P>
The new individual contracts, to be known as Australian Work-place
Agreements [AWAs], will completely over-ride awards. Though according
to Keogh these awards will wither away over time anyhow. Accord-ing
to Barbara Pocock, a lecturer at the Centre for Labour Studies
at the University of Adelaide, &quot;people who remain on awards
will fall behind the community standard of pay, and women will
be disproportionately left on decaying award standards&quot;.
<P>
The Coalition says workers can choose between the award and an
AWA. But what a choice! Employees may &quot;choose&quot; to make
agreements but if they choose not to they will remain on the minimum
award and lose significant award conditions. Effectively they
have no choice but to sign the agreement.
<P>
AWA's can be negotiated collectively or individually, but are
signed individually. Once the AWA is signed by the employer and
employee, a new institution, the Office of Employment Advocate
(OEA) will stamp the agreement. Although incredibly the OEA has
no mandate to examine its provisions.
<P>
&quot;The Minister [for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith] says
that the agreement cannot be lower than the award but would the
average worker know if it was lower than the award?&quot; Jamieson
asks. &quot;To think that the average ordinary individual with
no industrial relations background would have the information
they need to negotiate an equitable agreement is absurd!&quot;
agrees Keogh. &quot;We are very concerned that people will just
be signing anything to hang on to their jobs,&quot; Jamieson adds.
<P>
The only protection provisions are that AWAs must meet the government's
no disadvantage test. What is the no dis-advantage test? The employer
signs an affidavit to say that the agreement meets the minimum
provisions. In effect this means employers are keeping an eye
on themselves; which sets off alarm bells for Jamieson and Keogh.
&quot;It's a simple system of filing the agreement with the Employment
Advocate. It's a clerical process. It is not scrutinised or monitored
in any way!&quot; protests Jamieson.
<P>
The OEA will not make agreements public, which means a whole range
of pay and conditions will no longer be publicly scrutinised.
&quot;Secrecy is the great enemy of equity. It is possible that
different pay rates will exist for different workers and that
discrimination will be hard to track down and eliminate,&quot;
says Pocock. &quot;Not having the capacity to do an across the
board look at wages based on different skills means we lose the
opportunity to overturn undervaluations of women's work,&quot;
she adds.
<P>
Opponents of the legislation dismiss the Office of Employment
Advocate as impotent. &quot;The OEA does not enforce entitlements,
it just informs you of what they are. If you have a complaint
you will have to pursue it through the courts using a private
solicitor. The legal fraternity must be thrilled,&quot; says Keogh.
<P>
The Coalition has tried to pacify critics by affirming its commitment
to equal pay for work of equal value, but to no avail. &quot;We
have had equal pay for equal work since 1969 and in fact in NSW
since 1958 so that's not exactly a huge concession,&quot; scoffs
Jamieson. &quot;Anyway in terms of giving women protection it
doesn't at all. This is not where the problem lies. It lies largely
in over award payments. Women earn on average a lot less than
men in terms of over award earnings. There is a huge disparity
in take-home pay and now this won't be inquired into by the Industrial
Relations Commission (IRC),&quot; she says.
<P>
The IRC will only have the power to arbitrate over core award
conditions. Therefore the Commission will not be able to look
at gender discrimination in over award bargaining, yet currently
women receive only 54 per cent of male over award earnings. &quot;When
we met with the Minister, he said women would be able to pursue
complaints through the Sex Discrimination Act at the Human Rights
and Equal Opportunity Commission,&quot; says Jamieson. &quot;This
is clearly inadequate. The queue at the commission is long and
the whole process is cumbersome, expensive, not user friendly
and women haven't noticeably used it in the past,&quot; she adds.
<P>
Women's average weekly ordinary time earnings are now only around
84 per cent of the male wage [according to the ABS]. Jamieson
says that in total wages that figure is much lower, at around
66 per cent. Pocock fears that this gap will widen. &quot;It has
already hap-pened in the managed system of enterprise bargaining
under Labor and it's particularly visible in Kennet's Victoria,&quot;
she says.
<P>
Pocock is extremely concerned about the diminished power of the
IRC. &quot;The IRC has had a significant brief over the past 100
years, for equity in wage fixing. Everyone has the right to a
decent living wage and equity in remuneration. The Commission
can no longer arbitrate in situations of inequity. It can't play
a role to keep the system clean,&quot; she says.
<P>
The new legislation also places constraints on unions entering
the workplace. From now on, union officials will only be able
to enter a workplace if they have a written invitation from one
or more members. The official must also be dealing with the matter
specified in the invitation, making it impossible to go into workplaces
to find out what problems exist.
<P>
&quot;While imperfect vehicles, they [unions] are the only method
of protection for a lot of women, and its going to be tougher
to organise that support for yourself. Women are often in small
workplaces and are frightened of involving the union, and with
this bill the employer gets the names of the employees who asked
for a union visit. Women will not want to expose themselves as
asking for help from the union,&quot; says Pocock.
<P>
Vulnerable workers such as women, especially women from non-English
speaking backgrounds, will not thrive under the new legislation.
&quot;A minority will do well out of the deregulated system but
unfortunately because of the segmentation of the labour market
women will come out quite badly,&quot; says Keogh. &quot;I don't
like the chances of a lot of people out there.&quot; 
<P>
In 1994 <I>Snoop </I>reported the story of the female clerical
workers at the Villawood (NSW) branch of Taubmans, the well-known
paint manufacturer. Like many other clerical staff, they were
excluded from the site enterprise agreement in 1992, despite petitions
to the Industrial Relations Commission by the Federated Clerks
Union on their behalf.
<P>
Taubmans and the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (LHMU)
maintained that the agreement applied only to the manufacture
and distribution of paint, and dismissed claims that increased
productivity would increase administration. <I>Snoop </I>noted
that at another Taubmans factory in Sunshine, Victoria, the clerks
negotiated their own agreement which included a $30 per week wage
rise.
<P>
The story continues. The clerks in Victoria negotiated their own
agreement because the LHMU failed to include them in their claim,
and because management refused to negotiate with their representatives,
the Australian Services Union. Taubmans entered into an agreement
with the LHMU, and asked the clerical workers to sign contracts
which included no rostered days-off, no overtime pay and an annual
review of wages. The company didn't offer payrises to compensate
for the loss of the entitlements.
<P>
The clerks took industrial action to force management to negotiate,
and they eventually gained a higher pay-rise than the LHMU members.
However, it was not to be a happy ending. <I>Inside Enterprise
Bargaining</I>, a newsletter which includes case studies on enterprise
agreements, reports that Taubmans later retrenched the workers,
centralising it's clerical work in Sydney.

</FONT><BR></B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>IN NOVEMBER 1993, two 11-year-old boys, Robert Thompson and Jon
Venables, were tried and convicted of the killing of a young child,
James Bulger, in their home town of Liverpool, England. <A HREF="../journos.htm#rkress">RACHEL
KRESS</A> examines how the British media constructed the story known
as the Bulger case.</I>
<P>
BOTH boys come from Walton, tough neighbour-hood in a tough city,
and both come from large families presided over by single families
who are dependent on public aid.&quot; (from <I>New York Times
Index: A Book of Record, 1993.</I>)<I>The New York Times Index</I>
is a chronicle which summarises complex events and issues for
the benefit or journalists researching background information.
<P>
The above quote isn't exactly wrong (grammar aside), but it isn't
exactly right either; and this is the crux of the crime journalism
tradition: a story makes it to the newsstand not because it's
an accurate reflection of reality, but because it's a story told
with recourse to common cultural conceptions.
<P>
The British media's coverage of the Bulger case began on the evening
of Friday February 12, 1993, several hours after James Bulger
was reported missing from a Liverpool shopping centre. On Sunday
the papers had run the video-still of James being &quot;led away&quot;.
By Monday every national paper ran the story that up north in
Liverpool a young child had been abducted and probably killed
by the two unidentified boys in the security video-still.
<P>
Almost two weeks later, Robert Thompson and John Venables were
brought in for questioning. The coverage then dissipated until
just prior to the November trial, climaxing with the release of
the verdict (to which papers devoted whole lift-out sections).
By early December the coverage had all but ceased, only resurfacing
with the occasional update on the convicted boys' appeals.
<P>
The version of the Bulger case that has entered the public memory
is not a transparent record of the case, but the media's representation
of events. This representation has become an obligatory reference
point for any story about juvenile crime. A 1995 episode of ABC's
<I>Lateline</I>, &quot;Violent Innocents&quot;, was dominated
by images and 'facts' about the Bulger case culled from the media
archive. In May this year a <I>Four Corners</I> episode on the
ABC made a passing reference to the Bulger case to support an
argument that a predilection for violent videos can lead to the
committing of violent crime.
<P>
The idea that a violent video may have motivated the Bulger killing
came from a press all too willing to report speculation. No evidence
was ever found by British police, nor presented during the trial,
that Robert or Jon had ever seen the video now automatically associated
with the case, <I>Child's Play 3</I>.
<P>
And yet the issue of video violence dominated Mr Justice Moorland's
summation. Indeed his (and the media's) insistence on the link
between James' death and <I>Child's Play 3</I> led to the restriction
of films available to the general public, by amendments to the
1994 Criminal Justice Act.
<P>
The British media was prepared for Justice Moorland's summation.
After all, it was the media that first asserted that violent videos,
poor home environments, John Major's weak leadership and Liverpool's
left-wing politics were the real culprits of the crime.
<P>
In a media unusually silent on that perennial post-trial favourite
- does the media influence the outcome of a trial? - the suggestion
that the Bulger case was first and foremost a media event never
stood a chance.
<P>
The media's post-verdict frenzy was mostly a re-run of the stories
it ran when the story broke, with the verdict functioning as the
legal stamp of approval. So similar were the stories that <I>The
Times</I> even recycled a paragraph from a February article in
one of its November articles.
<P>
The entire coverage was characterised by inaccuracies and assumptions.
The tabloids, who in February had been unable to wait for an arrest
(let alone a trial) before declaring the two boys &quot;GUILTY&quot;,
were also unable to wait for a sentence. <I>The Sun</I> impatiently
imposed the maximum adult term of 20 years in text so large it
filled half the front page. It then represented Justice Moorland's
recommendation of eight years as another example of misplaced
judicial leniency.
<P>
The broadsheets weren't much better. <I>The Times</I> reported
resoundingly, but inaccurately, that four &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts
were read out. (Only two &quot;guilty&quot; verdicts were read
out, the one other charge against Robert and Jon being left to
lie on file).
<P>
Throughout the coverage of the Bulger case, the media also criticised
the lack of intervention from the 38 people who witnessed the
boys' walk to the railway line. David James Smith, in his book
about the Bulger case titled <I>The Sleep of Reason</I>, suggests
the intensity of this criticism caused eyewitnesses to alter their
original statements, to either further incriminate the boys or
to protect themselves from any possibility of blame. One woman
who had seen the boys from a bus told the police ten days after
the incident that she had &quot;commented&quot; on the scene to
her daughter sitting beside her. In court she claimed to have
alerted the entire bus. Another witness denied telling the police
she had asked the boys if they knew the young child and denied
stating that they had answered her &quot;no&quot;.
<P>
That the British media had repeatedly fulfilled all four grounds
upon which a stay of proceedings can be granted on the grounds
of undue influence under British law, and in doing so may have
predetermined the trial's outcome, was never reported in the press.
And yet the defence counsel for Robert Thompson was able to produce
a sample of 243 examples of prejudicial reporting, ranging from
assertions of the boys' guilt to portraits of them as evil monsters.
<P>
One article in<I>The Independent</I> acknowledged the press' role
when it reported the unsuccessful application for a stay of proceedings
due to undue media influence. Another minor article in <I>The
Times</I> discussed the possibility of media pressure affecting
the witness' evidence. In general, however, Bulger case articles
either assumed a distance from the event or, more convincingly,
assumed the voice of the public, against allegedly unresponsive
politicians.
<P>
But the politicians were listening and, excluding the Prime Minister
John Major who eagerly encouraged the British public to &quot;understand
a little less and condemn a little more&quot;, they were just
waiting to discover what class of culprit they were dealing with.
<P>
Once Robert and Jon had been identified as working class, and
the media had articulated the public opinion, the politicians
were more than ready to speak.
<P>
Within two weeks of James' death, the Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke
announced the Government's intention to get tough on 'bail bandits'
(those who re-offend whilst on bail); and also to allow the courts
to draw inference of guilt from an accused's silence. A further
proposal to reintroduce &quot;glasshouses&quot; (military style
youth detention centres) is still being debated.
<P>
At the time the Bulger case broke, the media, the police and the
Government were claiming that juvenile crime was escalating. A
tricky task, given the statistics were not in their favour. <I>The
Sun</I> circumnavigated this problem by printing a red rising
zigzag over their double page crime spreads, thereby signifying
surging statistics without having to produce any.
<P>
In 1993, misdemeanours of &quot;working-class&quot; children between
the ages of ten and 15 were being considered for criminalisation;
childhood was represented as nurturing the earliest seeds of criminality.
Politicians and the press linked children's misde-meanours to
the lifestyle(s) which kids later allegedly developed - those
of the habitual criminal, the welfare dependent/cheat, the drug
addict, the single mother - and of the sort of places such people
lived - the estates.
<P>
Robert and Jon's age, class and family background meant they fitted
perfectly into this schema. In addition, being so young meant
they could represent all British children; alternatively, they
could represent their parents, their community or their geographic
location.
<P>
The alacrity and frequency with which newspapers published articles
asserting that &quot;Poor parenting breeds youth crime&quot;,
and that crime has a &quot;sociological&quot; and &quot;geographical
memory,&quot; always juxtaposed with Bulger reports, demonstrates
how the media utilised popular cultural conceptions concerning
crime. Facts about the boys' families were downplayed or emphasised
to fit the standard assumptions of who is a criminal.
<P>
For example, the media<I> </I>utilised Robert Thompson's unemployed
mother and his Roman Catholic Irish descent to suggest that he
and his crime were not quite British. The tabloids ran photos
of housing estates - the usual media signifier of crime - next
to articles suggesting these were breeding grounds for crime.
The same media barely mentioned that James' family lived on a
housing estate and that his parents were unmarried, unemployed
and Roman Catholic. Furthermore Robert and Jon lived in terrace
houses which traditionally signify the &quot;good&quot; working-class.
<P>
In <I>Hooligan: A History of Respectable Fears</I>, British sociologist
Geoffrey Pearson charted the constant recycling of this age-old
story: the alarming rise in juvenile crime due to an unprecedented
collective lapse of public morality. In doing so, Pearson noted
that this story has always had its sights fixed firmly on the
working classes.
<P>
The Bulger case fitted this story so well because the crime occurred
in Liverpool. Thanks to the stories about Liverpool which get
reported in the London papers, the city is associated with a strong
unrepentant working class identity, an ongoing opposition to Thatcherite
policies, the Toxteth riots, the Hillsborough and Heysel soccer
stadium disasters. The press used these stories to insinuate that
working class Liverpool courts disaster.
<P>
In the London papers, this story blended with another, indirectly
revealing a tale of two cities: two sets of values, two views
on how to discipline a child, manage a city or govern a people.
It was with this narrative concoction that the press blamed Liverpool's
left-wing civic politics, and Robert and Jon's non-nuclear families
for producing two children representative of a generation which
was not 'childish', and by implication not British.

<P>
<I>
The Federal Government has Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
organisations in its sights, threatening major funding cuts and
showing little sympathy for self determination. But when <A HREF="../journos.htm#htarare">HECTOR
TARARE </A>spoke to long time Aboriginal activist Kevin Williams he
found hope rather than despair.</I>
<P>
The mood in Aboriginal organisations over the months since the
election of the new Howard Federal government has been one of
pessimism and a feeling that gains so slowly won may be reversed.
But one activist Kevin Williams, University of Technology, Sydney
law student and leader in the Tharawal community in Sydney's west
thinks that solidarity in fighting cutbacks may bring positive
results to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Instead
of destroying the movement for indigenous rights the Coalition
attacks may bring back its lost unity of purpose.
<P>
Williams has been part of the ups and down of the Aboriginal civil
rights movement for the past 30 years. He was one of a stolen
generation of Aboriginal children who spent their childhood in
institutions. From his days as a student activist in high school
to the heady time of the tent embassy outside Parliament House
in Canberra in 1972, Williams has been part of many major events
of Aboriginal history.
<P>
Looking back on the past 50 years of the Aboriginal civil rights
movement, Williams acknowledges the contribution of his mother's
generation to the struggle for equality.
<P>
&quot;My mother is 66 years old and before her time we just had
to accept what was given to us. From her generation onwards, we
started to realise we didn't have to accept this any more. We
don't have to take what is given to us, we don't have to do what
they tell us to do,&quot; Williams said.
<P>
He stresses the importance of generations passing on the baton
of experience. &quot;I have the greatest respect for the people
of my mother's generation who started the movement and who gave
us a platform to follow on with. I see it as really important
for my generation to pass the enthusiasm on to my children, to
say 'okay the fight's not won, you've got to keep fighting.
<P>
&quot;We have to do something for the next generation and make
sure that we constantly put before society that they can't do
what they have done to us in the past and get away with it.&quot;
<P>
Williams believes the progress which Aboriginal people have made
through their collective action has led to complacency in younger
Aboriginal people who no longer appreciate the struggle of previous
generations.
<P>
&quot;I think the younger generation coming through behind us
have lost the knowledge of what it is to fight for something that
you haven't got. These days it seems more easy for us to understand
that we've got something because we get access to things. The
fight has lost a bit of the early edge to it.&quot;
<P>
The Coalition government's threats of financial cuts to education
and social programs may present a rallying point to re-activate
Aboriginal civil rights programs. Many communities report that
factional disputes threaten to undo much of the work of the civil
rights movement. Part of the explanation for such disputes relates
to previous government policies in the nineteenth and twentieth
century when Aboriginal people were moved to establish new &quot;communities&quot;
regardless of differing social backgrounds.
<P>
Rallies which were held in Canberra and the major cities in May
indicate that young Aboriginal people are taking up the challenge
of resistance once again.
<P>
Kevin Williams thinks the development of a closer alliance between
Aboriginal people from city and rural areas is a high priority
in achieving self determination. The Mabo decision in the High
Court and the subsequent native title legislation has emphasised
land demands in rural areas. Aboriginal communities in cities
see the divisions between rural and urban Aborigines as a remnant
of the colonial period.
<P>
Williams is concerned that divisions in the Aboriginal movement
will reinforce attitudes which whites perpetrated in the past,
especially the view that city Aborigines are not authentic.
<P>
&quot;What we see happening in a number of cases is that we are
taking on those kinds of tools that were used to oppress us in
the past. Even in our communities some people are defining ourselves
in terms of skin colour in exactly the same way that white governments
of the part used to do with us,&quot; Williams said.
<P>
One issue which may bring Aboriginal people together could be
the failure of governments to implement the recommendations of
the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Royal
Commission presented a devastating picture of social conditions
in Aboriginal communities. Health standards, housing and unemployment
were shown to be at Third World levels yet governments have still
done little to address the problems.
<P>
Williams is critical of this failure. He is part of UTS's Aboriginal
research unit, Jumbunna's project on government responses to the
Royal Commission. The research findings are disturbing. &quot;The
recommendations of the Royal Commission have mostly not been implemented
or not implemented to the level that they should have,&quot; Williams
said.
<P>
&quot;The level to which Aboriginal people are oppressed daily
by the conditions around them leads to them being oppressed by
legal systems. We have to look no further than the gaols and the
courts.&quot;
<P>
Williams' advice to younger Aboriginal leaders is simple. &quot;What
I say is to be as informed as you possibly can. If you're informed
and know what your rights are, and know how to stand up and speak
up on issues, then that's the best way to deal with racism&quot;.

<P>
AN UNIMPOSING grey building in Elizabeth Street in Sydney has
been, at various time a social club, cinema and headquarters of
the Knights of the Southern Cross, a secret organisation within
the Catholic Church. The owners of the unremarkable looking building,
the trustees of the Cyprus - Hellene Club want to sell the building
to developers and move the club to outer suburbs.
<P>
But members of the Aboriginal community and their supporters regard
the building as a site of national significance. On January 1938
as white Australia celebrated 150 as a British colony and nation,
100 Aboriginal men and women gathered in the then Australian Hall
to mourn the loss of their land and demand basic human rights.
<P>
The meeting was the first nation wide civil rights protest. It
was called a &quot;Day of Mourning and Protest&quot; and those
who took part risked severe penalties for taking part in the protest.
Some of the protest leaders were removed from missions and reserves
by white managers when they tried to address local protest meetings.
<P>
The Aboriginal History Committee, which is leading the fight to
preserve the building has sought a Permanent Conservation Order
on the building.
<P>
The Aboriginal History Committee was formed at the University
of Technology, Sydney (UTS) in 1994 to pursue issues related to
Aboriginal history and heritage in response to the threat posed
to the Day of Mourning Site. Students and staff who formed the
committee decided to focus on the issue of preserving the site,
while also pursuing other issues related to Aboriginal history
and heritage.
<P>
The Committee, which is now a permanent body will soon hold a
forum to establish a national history body.
<P>
Ronald Briggs, Chairperson of the committee recognises the 1938
meeting in the Elizabeth Street building as the beginning of the
Aboriginal civil rights movement. 
<P>
&quot;We all need to value the contributions made by those who
have struggled to ensure that we have basic rights,&quot; Briggs
said.
<P>
When plans for the sale and demolition of the building were announced
in 1994, the Committee fought for a Commission of Inquiry. Esme
Beaupark, the Secretary of the Committee, an Aboriginal student
at UTS, who commenced tertiary study in her late fifties played
a key role in the successful fight for the Commission of Inquiry.
She died after a short illness in January this year.
<P>
At a Commission of Inquiry in 1995 Beaupark and other Aboriginal
activists, supported by the Australian Heritage Commission, National
Trust and Sydney City Council argued for a Permanent Conservation
order on the building.
<P>
More than one year after the inquiry, the NSW Minister for Urban
Affairs, Craig Knowles, has neither publicly released the findings
of the Committee, nor announced the decision on the conservation
order.
<P>
Briggs recently outlined the reasons for seeking a permanent order.
<P>
&quot;Since the onset of European occupation, most traditional
sites of significance have been obliterated. The errors of the
past must not be repeated. The building at 150-152 Elizabeth Street
Sydney is a site of contemporary Aboriginal heritage&quot;, Briggs
said.
<P>
The 1938 rally was attended by activists who are now recognised
as leaders in the struggle for Aboriginal civil rights. Among
those present were Jack Patten, William Ferguson, Pearl Gibbs,
Pastor Doug Nicholls, Margaret Tucker, William Cooper and Jack
Kinchella.
<P>
Those who attended the Day of Mourning put forward a ten point
recommendation which many see as the basis of Federal Government
intervention in Aboriginal Affairs.
<P>
&quot;My involvement with trying to save the Day of Mourning Site
has shown that a lot of people out there are still pretty ignorant.
I suppose legally our rights have been enhanced with civil rights,
land rights and Mabo but socially and politically we have much
more to achieve&quot;, Briggs said.
<P>
Once a Permanent Conservation Order has been granted, the Aboriginal
History Committee has proposed that the building be developed
as an Aboriginal History Centre. The Centre would include a museum
to Aboriginal heroes, resource and information centre, a base
for Aboriginal Heritage Tours and a theatre for films plays, public
lectures and special events.
<P>
According to a statement published by the Aboriginal History Committee,
&quot;the building provides a physical and atmospheric link to
the 1930's era. It evokes sensations of the 1938 event which could
not be re-created in a modern setting&quot;.
<P>
At a rally outside the building in March this year, supporters
of the campaign were joined by descendents of the civil rights
leaders to demand that the site be preserved for future generations.
<P>
The protesters heard a passionate call from the son of Jack Kinchela
to preserve the building. Pauline Gordon, the daughter of Jack
Patten attended with her grandson, Joe. Another link with the
1938 protest was June Barker, the grand-daughter of William Ferguson.
Ms Barker spoke to protesters about the significance of the Day
of Mourning Site for all Aboriginal Australians.
<P>
Ronald Briggs described the emotion at the March 9 rally this
year as older descendants told the young in attendance about the
courage of their great grandparents who attended the Day of Mourning
and Protest fifty eight years ago. &quot;Many people cried openly
as they entered the building,&quot; Briggs said.
<P>
There have been 629 Permanent Protection Orders granted to preserve
sites of white heritage in New South Wales.
<P>
The campaign to save the Cyprus-Hellene Club building is the first
bid for a Permanent Conservation Order under the NSW Heritage
Act for a site of Aboriginal Historical Significance.
<P>
The campaign to save the Day of Mourning site is not merely about
preserving a building. It is also about changing the belief, held
by many Australians that Aboriginal history ended with colonisation,
and that Aboriginal heritage is limited to cave paintings and
similar remnants of pre-1788 life.
<P>
Until now Aboriginal heritage claims have been dealt with through
National Parks and Wildlife legislation. Members of the Aboriginal
History Committee argue that Aboriginal heritage claims should
be pursued like non-Aboriginal claims, through national and state
heritage acts.
<P>
 The Aboriginal History Committee is seeking public support for
the preservation campaign. Aboriginal and non Aboriginal people
are encouraged to write to Mr Bob Carr, Premier of New South Wales
and Mr Craig Knowles, Minister for Planning, expressing concern
that the findings of the 1995 Inquiry have not been released.

<P>
Indonesia's decision to proceed with the construction of the country's
first nuclear reactor in Java, raises serious safety concerns
in the aftermath of a nuclear accident, recent studies by the
Australian National University (ANU) show. The studies of nuclear
fallout predict that most of northern Australia would be covered
in radioactive cloud. Yet emergency plans for this part of Australia
are far from ready to deal with this disturbing scenario.
<P>
The Assistant Director of Emergency Management Australia (EMA),
Robin Herron admits that EMA has no nationally coordinated emergency
plan for the spread of radioactive cloud from a reactor accident.
Herron said that Australia did not have an emergency plan in the
case of this type of accident in Java or in South-East Asia because
this is an &quot;unrealistic scenario.&quot; Yet leading Indonesian
activists and academics have concerns that this scenario is very
realistic (see box).
<P>
Herron rejects the findings of the recent fallout studies done
by ANU because he says Indonesia is too far away. Although conceding
he has not read the ANU study, Herron says that the levels of
radiation would be very low and a radioactive cloud would disperse
before reaching Australia. He argues that the water cooled reactors,
built since Chernobyl, would contain the radioactive leakage if
an accident occurred.
<P>
According to Mr Mick Lucas, Director of the Northern Territory
State Emergency Service (NTSES), the Northern Territory has no
plans for a nuclear reactor accident. According to Lucas the only
emergency plan SES can fall back on for a reactor accident is
a &quot;storm surge plan&quot;. (A storm surge happens when the
cyclone whips up the tides to create a flood).
<P>
A key problem with this approach to emergency services is that
although nuclear fallout doesn't recognise state boundaries, the
response to the accident is determined by these boundaries. The
response to a radioactive cloud spreading over northern Australia
would require coordination of a number of different plans from
different states. While cooperation between states, such as between
the Northern Territory and Queensland, allows for cross border
operations, it is not an actual plan for mobilising emergency
resources.
<P>
Herron says that EMA has a comprehensive contingency plan to deal
with radiation leakage from a nuclear powered ship. However this
plan is based on organising the evacuation of a major city, for
example clearing the population of an area of three to four kilometres,
not a whole state. EMA also has an emergency plan if radioactive
debris were to fall to Australia.
<P>
The recently released nuclear fallout studies by Dr John Taylor
at the Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies, ANU, predict
that an accident would be most detrimental for northern Australia
during summer when fallout would cover the region within 48 hours.
Dr Taylor says that although his model had allowed for a reduction
in the radioactive concentration of the cloud as it travelled
from central Java, radioactivity would still be 75 percent of
the levels at the site of the accident.
<P>
The study was not based on a Chernobyl style accident but could
be applied to map fallout for any type of reactor accident.Dr
Taylor said in the months from December to February the cloud
could travel south quite quickly and it would be &quot;a good
idea&quot; to have a radiation detector somewhere off the coast
of Darwin, such as at Christmas Island. He said that if there
were rainfall just after the accident, this would probably increase
the amount of radioactive particles that reached Australian soil.
Dr Taylor said rainfall after the Chernobyl accident in 1986,
increased the dosage of fallout England received.
<P>
This study confirms the conclusions of an earlier study done by
the Strategic Centre at ANU, 1991.
<P>
If one of Java's reactors leaked radiation, Indonesia would be
obliged by international regulations to notify its neighbours,
including Australia, and the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) as soon as possible. However when the Chernobyl reactor
overheated it was several days before the Soviets notified any
of their neighbours. It was only after the high levels of radiation
in the atmosphere were detected by monitoring equipment in central
Europe that the Soviet Government admitted that there had been
an accident.
<P>
Alternatively if Indonesia failed to notify Australia of an accident,
the release of radioactive cloud into the atmosphere could be
picked up by the air radiation monitors located in either Darwin
or Perth. Filter papers which collect the sample particles are
sent to the Australian Radiation Laboratory (ARL) in Melbourne
for analysis. Currently, however radiation monitoring occurs on
a weekly basis, too slow for the early detection of high radiation
levels.
<P>
According to Malcolm Cooper from ARL this radiation testing process
could be sped up. He said if the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
currently being internationally negotiated, was implemented, Australia
as part of an international network of monitoring stations would
make daily checks on air radiation levels.
<P>
If daily checks were made Cooper said that within four hours of
receiving the test samples ARL scientists would be alerted to
abnormally high radiation levels. So if radioactive fallout was
collected on samples taken in Darwin in a 24 hour period, the
samples flown to Melbourne and tested within four hours, it would
take approximately 30 hours before State Emergency Services (SES)
were notified. This leaves the respective SES's 18 hours in which
to organise the evacuation of their state, or else organise alternative
safety shelters.
<P>
Cooper said that AL was &quot;looking at incorporating&quot; an
automatic radiation detector into its system within two years.
He said this system was &quot;the best sort of early warning device
for accidents&quot; used around the world. This device automatically
processes samples every 24 hours, bypassing the need for a laboratory
examination. With this system in place the notification time of
an accident would be shortened.
<P>
Assuming SES's storm surge plan was activated there may easily
be some teething problems because the storm surge plan has never
been tested. Cyclone Tracey was the closest that Darwin came to
a storm surge. Lucas from the Northern Territory's SES said Cyclone
Tracy was mild compared to the storm that would have raged through
Darwin if the tides had been high.
<P>
Lucas agrees that the effects of a storm surge and a nuclear reactor
accident are quite different. The major difference being that
the surge is only expected to cover a coastal strip for 24 kilometres
spreading two kilometres inland and SES would expect to have up
to 24 hours notice. Whereas according to the recent ANU study
a nuclear accident at the wrong time of year spreads a cloud covering
the northern Australia in 48 hours.
<P>
Lucas admits that if the whole of the Territory were to be evacuated
SES would have a logistical nightmare on their hands.
<P>
Allowing for a warning time of between six to 12 hours in which
time the media can advise people to evacuate and the different
arms of the SES can be organised, the plan assumes the &quot;orderly
departure&quot; of the population of Darwin along the major highway.
However if the whole of the Territory were to evacuate along this
route perhaps their departure would not be so orderly.
<P>
Lucas says SES's solution would be to organise shelter for the
population of the Territory. Yet there are currently no radiation
proof shelters in existence in the Territory
<P>
The emergency plan for a surge involves the evacuation of Darwin's
population of approximately 80 000 people with the assistance
of 700 emergency workers. This includes 200 police, 100 ambulance
workers and 400 volunteers. Mr Lucas wasn't sure how many SES
workers there were in the whole of the Territory but he said there
were 775 in the police force available for assistance.
<P>
Lucas was unable to give transportation details for the 1.3 million
head of cattle in the Territory but he says this would be the
responsibility of the Department of Primary Industry. The cattle
industry the most valuable primary industry in the Northern Territory
notched up $107 million in total sales in the last year alone.
A major industry which it would be impossible to protect from
a radioactive cloud is the fishing industry (worth $95 million
in total sales last year).
<P>
A major hurdle to the smooth running of the emergency plan is
how SES would evacuate all the Aborigines scattered on remote
outstations in the Territory. The latest figures from the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in Alice Springs,
indicate that 13 000 Aborigines, living in the vicinity of Alice
Springs, are spread over an area of 830 000 square kilometres.
<P>
Dave Price from ATSIC in Alice Springs said he was &quot;concerned&quot;
about the health effects of a radioactive cloud on the Aboriginal
people particularly as he has witnessed adverse affects on Aborigines
exposed to radiation during the Maralinga nuclear tests conducted
in South Australia.
<P>
Price said the Aboriginal communities are hard to monitor because
the size of the communities is very &quot;fluid&quot;. Most are
contactable by phone or short wave radio, but the location of
some smaller communities is known only to their families.
<P>
Price points out seasonal flooding is a feature of some of the
remote areas that Aboriginal communities inhabit. &quot;In an
emergency people would have to be flown out&quot; of these regions
says Price. He says that for six months of the year &quot;nobody
moves anywhere&quot; in the Catherine region, round the Daly River
area and in parts of Arnham Land.
<P>
Price also points out that there were several small islands off
the coast of the Northern territory where the only form of transport
is by air. The SES's storm surge emergency plan for Aboriginal
communities on small islands involves them moving to higher ground
to avoid flooding but on some islands their is no provision for
their evacuation.
<P>
Is it &quot;patronising&quot; to ask about Indonesia's safety
standards?
<P>
In Australia, Senator Parer, Minister for Energy and Resources,
suggested in March this year that it is &quot;patronising&quot;
to question whether Indonesia will be able to construct a nuclear
reactor which satisfies international safety standards. While
Indonesia's pro-nuclear spokes-people are confident that an accident
is highly unlikely.
<P>
Iyos Subki, the President of BATAN (Indonesian atomic energy agency)
assured Australians on ABC's Lateline that the likelihood of an
accident occurring would be a &quot;one in a million years&quot;
event.
<P>
Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that Indonesia's construction
procedures are not as regulated as in the West. Dr Clive Hamilton,
an economic adviser to the Indonesian Government in the early
1990's, says Western engineers were critical of Indonesians construction
and regulation standards. They cited construction workers and
engineers who took a lot of shortcuts when building major works.
Dr Hamilton questions whether strict construction procedures and
the rigorous engineering required to build a reactor would be
compromised.
<P>
Hamilton also notes BATAN's nuclear proposal was &quot;completely
quarantined&quot; and &quot;only BBPT (the Science and Technology
Ministry) had access to it&quot; when he was working there. This
raises the question of how Indonesia would be able to establish
an independent regulatory body, required by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to monitor the operation of the reactor.
<P>
Dr Hamilton also questioned whether Indonesia would be able to
financially operate a nuclear power station according to the safety
levels required internationally by the International Atomic energy
Agency (IAEA).
<P>
Indonesian anti-nuclear activists have questioned the economics
behind the Canadian Atomic Energy Company's (AECL) bid for the
construction of the reactor. &quot;Canada has found nuclear plants
are not economical, because of the public's high demand for safety
standards&quot; but &quot;now they are dumping their nuclear power
plants on us&quot; said Mohammad Anung, a campaigner with leading
environmental group WAHLI, in the <I>Jakarta Post</I> in January
this year.
<P>
According to Dr Aditjondro, a leading Indonesian environmentalist,
the feasibility study commissioned by the Indonesian Government,
failed to include an assessment of the effect of a volcanic faultline
and a minor crater at Mount Muria, the proposed site. Dr Aditjondro,
in a paper on Indonesia's nuclear industry released in April this
year, points out that the limits to the feasibility study have
been criticised by the IAEA.
<P>
Senator Parer announced in March that Australia would be keen
to sell uranium to Indonesia. The sale of uranium would need to
be covered under a bilateral agreement which followed the guidelines
of IAEA's regulations on the sale of uranium. A spokesperson from
the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade could not say when
Australia might sign such an agreement.

<P>
<I>
One group in our community seems set to reap profound benefits
from being part of tha global computer network we call the Internet.
The disabled. But even here there is hype. <A HREF="../journos.htm#kdyson">KIERAN DYSON</A> reports.</I>
<P>
The Internet is a powerful tool allowing users to inform and educate
themselves, socialise, consume and perform tasks, all on a world
wide scale by simply connecting their home or office computer
to a phone line via a modem.
<P>
For many disabled users these benefits can radically transform
lifestyles. The Internet may come to represent a world where,
for the first time, they can experience sub-stantial interaction
with others with ease and on equal terms.
<P>
An organisation which took early advantage of the Internet is
the Disability Information and Resource Center of South Australia
which is dedicated to improving the lifestyles of disabled people.
As well as providing its existing information service through
its Website, the center established an electronic bulletin board
system, called Common Ground, in 1993.
<P>
The system, which has 1000 registered users, was designed as an
interactive space where people with disabilities and others could
discuss issues affecting their lives.
<P>
System Operator, David Wallace, says Common Ground has become
an instrument of empowerment. &quot;The bulletin board is a great
medium for breaking down barriers that isolate people socially,
whether this be through a physical disability which limits their
mobility, or any other disability affecting their social interaction
in some way. It brings people together in a virtual sense.
<P>
&quot;In that respect, it's opened up complete new worlds for
some people. In fact we have quite a few registered users who
previously had no other means of communication. A lot of them
use it as a communication tool especially, and not just in a social
sense, but also to communicate with relatives who they may not
have been able to communicate with successfully before.&quot;
<P>
Common Ground was also set up to enable users to interact with
organisations and government bodies about relevant issues such
as public transport access and wheelchair standards.
<P>
Like most bulletin boards and newsgroups on the net, Common Ground
has evolved from just being a practical Internet facility to having
a strong community atmosphere. Two marriages have already resulted
from Common Ground meetings and David attributes these to the
nature of the system.
<P>
&quot;People feel they can come to Common Ground as a place in
its own right. There's people there they know and they feel that
they belong rather than just being yet another number on the network.&quot;
<P>
This sense of community plus the Internet's safeguard of anonymity,
is particularly useful for disabled users. Where many people with
disabilities suffer from prejudice and social stigma in the real
world, the virtual world of the Internet becomes a place where
they can express themselves without inhibitions and gain self-confidence,
before they decide to disclose their disability - if at all.
<P>
Melinda Smith is a 33-year-old Melbourne writer and Internet user
who suffers from Cerebral Palsy. She is also a member of Melbourne's
Computer Aid User Society (CAUS) and their representative for
Telstra's consultancy committee for disabilities. &quot;Apart
from that&quot;, she tells me via e-mail, &quot;I run my own business
in disability awareness training for TAFE schools and employment
services.&quot;
<P>
Last year Melinda had the best time of her life when she &quot;took
a wild plunge and went to the USA and Britain and stayed with
a number of people I'd met on my computer.&quot; She had been
e-mailing these people on a regular basis beforehand and had used
the disabled traveller forum, and other general traveller forums
on the Internet, to plan her trip. &quot;I received much more
info and first hand advice than if I had gone to the local travel
agent,&quot; she says.
<P>
In this instance, the Internet served as a social and practical
tool for Melinda who remains excited by the liberating experience
of using the technology to communicate.
<P>
&quot;I was introduced to the Internet in 1993 and my world just
changed from being in the world to being a part of it. It's a
very exciting way for people with disabilities to experience life
without a disability - and just BE. 
<P>
&quot;The best part about it is the freedom to be yourself and
nobody has to know what you look like or whether you speak like
the average person. I make a point of not mentioning my disability
until I feel that she/he has got to know ME first and by then
it's no big deal.&quot;
<P>
As a practical tool in the work place, the Internet can also be
invaluable, especially when it's easier for someone to read and
type words than it is to hear and speak them.
<P>
Stephen Pascoe, aged 41, is Network Manager for the Department
of Defence (Defence Science and Technology Organisation) and has
suffered profound progressive hearing loss since he was 17.
<P>
Stephen accessed the Internet through his work and has been using
e-mail to communicate within the organisation for seven years.
He says the Internet has been indispensable in helping him overcome
communication problems at work and allowing him to stay in touch
with friends, although, he adds, the process can be impersonal.
<P>
Having enjoyed such benefits from the Net, Stephen has run workshops
for other hearing impaired people as a way of introducing them
to the concepts of the Internet and the services available. But
Stephen fears inevitable progressions in computer technology may
isolate users with disabilities yet again.
<P>
&quot;At the moment the Internet is limited by speed, but when
it improves, the ability to use sound and voice (which is already
done to some degree) will be increased. Therefore where deaf people
can now use e-mail and chat programs to communicate with others,
if voice is added, this wonderful liberation is again lost to
them.&quot;
<P>
Another concern for disabled users is that ease of communication
in the virtual world may inadvertently restrict proper communication
in the real world. In a 1994 paper commissioned by Telecom entitled
&quot;People With Disabilities and the Information Superhighway&quot;,
its author, Christopher Newell, questioned the social ramifications
of technological aid.
<P>
&quot;At times, technological intervention is held out to be an
enabler, yet it is also important to realise that another fundamental
issue for people with disabilities is ensuring adequate social
contact, with such a hi-tech scenario raising implications for
human contact.&quot;
<P>
As physical contact in the real world becomes less of a necessity,
contact in the virtual realm poses new psychological complications
for the disabled. Able to revel in the freedom of anonymity when
communicating on the Internet, never-theless they must eventually
confront issues of self identity and self esteem.
<P>
For the first time in history people with disabilities have the
opportunity to participate in a community without fear of being
marginalised or shunned but if the dilemma to tell or not to tell
of one's situation isn't resolved first, on what foundation are
these new relationships built?
<P>
Douglas Lathrop, writing for &quot;Main-stream Online&quot; (a
lifestyle zine for people with disabilities) cuts to the core
of this underlying issue. He writes: &quot;...maybe the Information
Age will see people with disabilities shattering a history of
isolation. But it won't until enough of us have smashed the firewalls
that we've built for ourselves first.&quot;

<P>
&quot;THE biggest one was the break in at the school&quot;, said
Peena Geia. &quot;The Justice Group really got a hold of them
and we brought them all back down to the school and stood over
them. They were not allowed to have any lunch. We punished them
in that way, 'Nothing, until you clean up this mess!'&quot;
<P>
The &quot;mess&quot; she refers to was the work of a dozen teenagers
who broke into the Home Economics room of the local school, defecated
in cooking pots and rubbish bins, threw frozen meat around and
turned the freezers off.
<P>
&quot;They had to clean up and make up for it. And nobody was
to leave. They were under supervision from morning until afternoon.
We just showed them and since then they've never broken in,&quot;
she said proudly.
<P>
Peena Geia is the Aboriginal spokesperson for the Palm Island
Justice Group. The youngest member of the group, Peena is a formidable
woman, a devout Christian with unstoppable energy.
<P>
The Palm Island Justice Group is run by a group of 25 highly respected,
local, Aboriginal elders. They believe the mainstream juvenile
justice system has failed their community. Prior to the group's
formation in 1993, most juvenile offenders from Palm Island ended
up in Queensland detention centres.
<P>
In Queensland, Indigenous kids make up 45 per cent of the youth
in detention yet only comprise four per cent of the total juvenile
population. Despite the extensive findings of the 1991 Royal Commission
into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander youth, nationwide, between the ages of ten and 17, are
still 19 times more likely to be held in detention than other
kids.
<P>
But these alarming statistics no longer apply to Palm Island (nor
do they apply to the several other Aboriginal-Torres Strait Islander
communities which have also adopted a local justice system). In
fact, a staggering 70 per cent of young offenders brought before
the Palm Island Group do not re-offend - a remarkable achievement
in stopping young people becoming victims of the criminal justice
system.
<P>
Kowanyama, an Aboriginal community near Magnificent Creek on the
Mitchell River delta in far North Queensland, has also formed
an elders' group. The Kowanyama Justice Council is made up of
18 elected representatives from the Kokobera, Kokomnjena and Kunjen
or &quot;top end mob&quot; clans.
<P>
In 1993, the Kowanyama Justice Council's first year, the rate
of juvenile offending dropped from 540 cases to two. One year
later, local police statistics showed a significant reduction
in local crime. Break and enter fell by 82 per cent from 207 charges
in 1993 to 37 charges in 1994. Charges for theft fell by 91 per
cent, and assault by 68 per cent.
<P>
The elders of the Kowanyama Justice Council are understandably
proud. For many, it is the first time in their lives that they
have been able to have an impact in their community. In Kowanyama,
some of the older women from the Justice Council also volunteer
to be the &quot;barefoot&quot; night patrol. Three nights a week,
armed with a stick, they walk the streets. Breaking up fights,
sending children back home, they keep a watchful eye on community
members.
<P>
In 1995 the Palm Island, Kowanyama and Pompuraaw (another remote
Aboriginal community in Cape York) Justice Groups received the
Australian Prevention of Violence Award by Government Heads of
State. The success of the Justice groups is heartening for their
old people. The Justice groups had received no more than $5000
per year in one-off grants from the Queensland Corrective Services
Commission.
<P>
Operating as informal courts, the Palm Island Justice Group and
Kowanyama Justice Council call people to appear before them. On
Palm Island, the Group's elders command such respect that, despite
having no formal enforcement power, nobody has yet refused to
appear in the tiny local court where meetings are held. Both Groups
provide peaceful settlements to local conflicts with an emphasis
on making offenders responsible for their actions. The &quot;clean-up&quot;
punishment was successfully invoked for another group of Palm
Island teenagers who vandalised the school. For two weeks they
were made to clean up the school, the pre-school, kindergarten
and school grounds. &quot;The teacher was amazed, because they
cleaned up so well,&quot; said Peena. &quot;They even dug out
all the sand and they found that there were two extra steps which
the teachers never knew they had! Now that really stopped them.
Then their attendance was really good after that!&quot;
<P>
In Kowanyama the Justice Council elders drove a group of boys
who had stolen a car, several kilometres out of the community.
They were then left to walk all the way back home.
<P>
The humiliation was very real. Crucial to the success of these
justice groups is the role of &quot;shame&quot;, explains Peena,
&quot;It sure has an impact because they know that it's a shame
thing with our people. Many of our people know that they can misuse
the white man's law, but they know they can't do it amongst their
own. They know the Murri law is stronger, it always was and it
always will be. Our laws are very real, and if they, (Europeans),
did not interfere in the first place we wouldn't have all the
trouble we have today.&quot;
<P>
The roots of the juvenile justice problems in these communities
lie with the legacy of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal
Affairs which governed them until 1986. The Department, for example,
established a reserve on Palm Island in 1918. Until the late 1960s,
the threat of being sent from the mainland missions to Palm Island
was the heaviest sanction a Department manager could invoke. In
1996 the State government finally ceded control to the local Aboriginal
Council.
<P>
Nowadays the term &quot;community&quot; describes a large settlement
of dispossessed survivors. Unemployment in many Aboriginal communities
soars at 90 per cent. Elders in Palm Island and Kowanyama deplore
the lack of opportunities available to their young and acknowledge
that a lot of youth crime occurs because of sheer boredom.
<P>
In Kowanyama, the Justice Council is actively working with the
local police, local Aboriginal Council and state school to try
to increase opportunities for the unemployed and school age kids.
A new disco, BMX track, swimming pool, and indoor cricket hall
are part of this initiative. An annual excursion for young people
to other Aboriginal communities in the Cape York region, and regular
trips with their elders out bush, are now regularly organised.
<P>
Banjo Patterson, &quot;ol Runkie Banjo&quot; as he is affectionately
known, is a Kowanyama elder. 68 years old, he is from the Kokomnjena
clan and worked for most of his life on the cattle properties
in far North Queensland. Kowanyama was also once a mission. As
he says, &quot;I was brought up the hard way&quot;. Banjo is highly
respected, feared and admired by many young people. As a Justice
Council elder, he tells the parents of kids in trouble. &quot;Make
sure you look after them, take good care of them. That's what
you're there for, to take good care of them children, rear them
up proper way, not just running them loose. When they get out
of hand, they're gone forever. You might not ever catch up on
them again.&quot; A lot of parents don't seem to understand. They
say, &quot;You can't boss somebody else's children around, you
can't!' We say, 'Well, if you don't do it, someone else has to
do it, someone else has to straighten it up elsewhere'. So we're
trying our best to straighten things up to make things good for
the parents ... someone got to do it.&quot;
<P>
Despite the Kowanyama Justice Council's success in reducing juvenile
crime, Banjo is aware of the Group's limitations. &quot;They listen
there while we give them talking up, they'll listen to us there.
But soon as they walk through the door, they do the same thing
again,&quot; he laughs. 'Yeah, you've got to keep at 'em you know.
And then, they might learn, sooner or later. That's why we're
trying our hardest, we're still trying. Most of them are getting
a bit better, not much, but they still got a lead on us, you know,
and we're going to try and get that back to make things go normal
you know, make it good.&quot;
<P>
Both groups know the importance of sitting down and talking to
their troubled youth. Many meetings involve hours of counselling.
The kid's relations are also asked to attend. The Palm Island
elders are always delighted when teenagers regarded as &quot;hard
cases&quot; come back, stepping shyly into the courtroom to give
their quiet thanks for having received advice when it was most
needed.
<P>
&quot;We've had a couple of young ones come in and be bold in
their way. 'We don't have to listen to you!', they say and they
try and storm out. Then we jump up and hit the table and stop
them in their tracks. Then you'd have old Bill speak very steady
and they'd sit down. 'You walk out that door and you'll get the
biggest shock of your life. You'll be going out and put out by
police escort; put off this place so quick and smart you won't
know what hit you!'&quot; said Peena. She nods affirmatively,
as if to say, &quot;Of course this is the way it should be.&quot;
<P>
In Kowanyama, elders have punished some juvenile offenders by
banishing them from the community or by giving them a public belting.
Elders believe that for many of the &quot;harder cases&quot; the
possibility of ending up in prison is no longer a deterrent. After
a few young men broke into the Aboriginal Council and damaged
the building, it was decided by their families, community elders
and Council staff to publicly belt them. While acknowledging that
not everyone agreed to the punishment, a staff member said, &quot;I
must say that the public belting was in no means sinister ...
It was done in public where everybody could see. The beltings
were given by an uncle of two of the men and the third person
was given a belting by his grandfather.&quot;
<P>
Public beltings are regarded by some as a controversial solution
to juvenile offending. When visiting Kowanyama I asked people
about their opinion of the &quot;floggings&quot;. Without qualification,
local educators, police and administrators supported the idea.
I also went to the local school and spoke to two boys about the
Justice Council. Both believed the elders are doing their best
for their community and that the other kids who had been publicly
punished deserved it. I later spoke to two other boys who had
been before the Kowanyama Justice Council elders on numerous occasions.
They admitted that their old people scared them, but they defended
the right of the elders to punish them. &quot;They don't care
about anybody!&quot;, one defiant boy said. But when I asked him
what he would do if he was an old man and his kids were the ones
in trouble, he quickly answered, &quot;Flog 'em!&quot;.
<P>
The use of punishments such as public beltings has without a doubt
been a controversial issue in recent debates about the use of
Aboriginal law and custom. On the one hand, various people in
some communities believe it is their right to apply the law in
that way. On the other, punishments such as beltings and spearing
breach international human rights treaties such as the Convention
on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture.
<P>
Whether a community uses customary law, and to what degree it
uses it, also raises issues about Aboriginal self-determination
and peoples' rights. In Kowanyama, elders believe that applying
Aboriginal law is in the interest of their community and its people.
It is their right - their collective right - to live in peace
without an unacceptable level of violence and crime. And if belting
juveniles is the way to achieve that, they see it as their right
to use it as a punishment. For Kowanyama elders, their solution
is an exercise in self-determination.
<P>
But how an Aboriginal community deals with community strife will
depend on what each community considers acceptable. What's done
in relation to juvenile offenders in Kowanyama may not be an acceptable
solution for a similar problem in other Queensland communities.
The use of public beltings or other such punishments will, in
some areas, be seen as violating the offender's human rights.
Obviously, the tension between &quot;self-determination&quot;
and human right standards is still an issue which needs to be
worked out.
<P>
The elders know their justice groups are not simply about crime
prevention. Their commitment is to restoring Aboriginal structures
of authority. Australian and international experts often discuss
the need for effective alternatives to jailing the young. It is
inspiring to see a group of old people have such a positive impact.
In Palm Island and Kowanyama, grass roots justice is working.
The elders are proud. As one elder said, &quot;It is keeping our
people out of prison and seeing that justice is done within the
community.&quot;

FOCUS : Radio Wars: NauFM's tough struggle to get to the top.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Raphael Semel </strong><p>


<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>




NAUFM, the digital broadcaster that has had a meteoric rise in Papua New
Guinea, is dominating the commercial radio industry and may soon be the only
entertainer.<P>

Why? The rival entertainer, KalangFM, is in a financial crisis and may go off
air. <P>

Glancing at his computer with smiles, NauFM general manager Mark Rogers says
his station has struggled through a rough journey. But it has now established
its market and audience. <P>

"It has established the programs and activities which suit its market and
listenership," Mr Rogers says. <P>

A listenership survey conducted last year by First Market Search on behalf of
NauFM showed the group ranging from 15 to 40 year olds want the new station.
The finding has delighted NauFM as the majority of the country's population is
in that age group.<P>

Before NauFM was established, Mr Rogers conducted research for six months in
1994 and found a great potential market for commercial radio. The research
encouraged the start of NauFM. <P>
A developing country like PNG needs an electronic medium wave means of
communication, especially the radio, because: <P>
<ul><LI>Newspapers cannot reach remote areas;
<LI>Electricity is unavailable in villages for television;
<LI>News and other  programs broadcasts are informative to the people.</UL> 
The new computerised station reaches an audience throughout PNG and South
Pacific.<P>

Although NauFM is 80 per cent PNG-owned, the minority 20 per cent is held by
Fiji broadcaster Communications Fiji  Ltd which has the management contract.<P>
<strong>
Training: </strong>
Mr Rogers says NauFM staff are trained to use the advanced facilities
in the studio. They have a training program to allow them to go to US,
Australia, Fiji or Japan for a course or a workshop. Deputy news director Robin
Sela recently toured the US to observe different media organisations, their
facilities and how they operate.  <P>

"NauFM staff try to get a balanced  news to relay to the people. The
broadcaster plays  about 25 to 30 per cent local music every day," Mr Rogers
says. <P>

Ms Sela says NauFM is a music station that tries to meet the expectations of
the young people of today. The station has a lot of gaps for other programs and
staff have made recommendations to general manager for new programs like
current affairs, health, talk back shows and others. However, the general
manager is satisfied with the present ones so none may be introduced.   <P>

The staff have widened the sales and advertising avenues, attracting  many
clients to promote their products on NauFM. <P>

"I am glad to see good competition among Kalang, Karai, Kundu services and
NauFM. This will force the staff to be on their toes to produce the best news
and programs," says Ms Sela.<P>

NauFM is one of the few radio stations in the South Pacific. Now Fiji has
fallen in line with NauFM, also using the digital system for broadcasting.<P>

News director Patrick Patu does not have a professional journalism
qualification, and he is criticised for this by some Port Moresby media
commentators. But as an experienced broadcaster, he has a specialised talent in
sport so he produces good sports news. <P>

Other news is collected from other provinces by stringers. <P>

"A plan is in the pipeline to establish offices in various main centers so they
would enable NauFM to receive and disseminate more information to the local
people," Ms Sela says. <P>
<strong>
Dream work: </strong>
A former news director, Weni Singarok, who now works for the  ABC,
says: "The  facilities in the new station still ring in my mind, bringing back
my dream to work in such a station."<P>

However, she finds it "unfortunate" for NauFM that it does not have an
experienced journalist "checking the news content" of reporters. <P>

Mrs Singarok, wife of the military commander, Brigadier-General Jerry Singarok,
believes it would be better for NauFM to have a news director with a journalism
background to deal with journalism issues, such as defamation, balance, ethics
and professionalism. <P>

Broadcast journalism lecturer of the University of PNG's South Pacific Centre
for Communication and Information in Development, Sorariba Nash, believes NauFM
is meeting its capacity and standard of producing news, advertisement and
music. <P>

He says NauFM has achieved its goal as a commercial station. 
The well-equipped newsroom has the latest technology. Computers make programs,
slot them into segments and time them accurately so the system flows smoothly.
The newsroom also monitors world news from television and radio stations. <P>

<strong>
Shallow: </strong>
"Radio stations should have the kind of equipment like NauFM, so they
can reach different locations in spite of the terrain, mountains or sea," says
Mr Nash.<P>
 
Journalism graduates of UPNG now working at NauFM have a great opportunity to
edit and produce news due to the new facilities. <P>

But Mr Nash says: "The news content is so shallow and some news is being
extracted from news papers or other radio stations and television." <P>

Though based in the nation's capital, NauFM still lacks coverage of some
significant events happening here in the city.<P>

Ian Boden, a commentator and broadcaster now with The National, says NauFM
does not have special programs such as current affairs, health and others
because it has different objectives. <P>

"It is a commercial station fulfilling its duty accurately by producing 'home
grown' advertisements," Mr Boden says. <P>
The PNG Media Council chairperson, Anna Solomon,was reluctant to comment about
the progress of NauFM because the council was still at an 'interim stage'. <P>

"I only work on print media and also do not listen to NauFM so I would not
make any comment about the operation and progress of the station," Ms Solomon
says.<P>

Listeners interviewed gave more criticism than positive comments about NauFM.
Their views were based on a comparison of programs among the radio stations and
an expectation that the new radio should be similar to existing stations.<P>
 
One listener, who did not want to be named, said: "NauFM is so fancy in its
broadcasting and its music is more for the whitemen".<P>

 <strong>
Too fast:</strong>
The audience could hardly hear or comprehend what was said in the
advertisements because staff working at NauFM are young and mixed-race who
speak too fast, the listener added.<P>

An 18-year-old man said NauFM played only rock music. 
"How about playing more local  music clips?" he asked. "Why can't NauFM produce
a variety of programs which could attract and interest the listeners?"<P>

Meanwhile, an alleged debt of K1.1 million has left the rival FM station, Radio
Kalang, the commercial arm of NBC, in a precarious position over its future. At
present, Kalang FM is still on air but debts could rise.<P>
 
Kalang fans' confusion rankles as NauFM forges further ahead.<P>

INSIGHT REPORT : Award goes to "compelling story of corruption" in bank<br>
<font size =4><strong>Pacific Investigative Journalism Award 1996: Judges' verdict.</strong>
<font size= 3><p>




<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD   align =left>


INVESTIGATIVE journalism is alive and well in the Pacific news media. The
quality and breadth of reporting taking place in the South Pacific region is
reflected in the high standard of stories entered in the first Pacific
Investigative Journalism Award. <P>

Pressures for economic reform, development and democratisation are creating
societies in change, providing a feast of potential issues needing in-depth
reporting to the public.<P>

Stories that reinforce the public's right to be informed; stories that
investigate hard-to-get facts and give the public a new perspective on events
and issues; stories that carry a wealth of detail about how the society works
are the stories that uphold the finest traditions of investigative journalism.<P>

The judges found that all the eligible stories entered in the award, displayed
the Pacific media's awareness of the importance of the watchdog role that the
media has over society.<P>
In refining the criteria - "an investigative report that has made a
significant contribution to Pacific regional public awareness, or changed the
public agenda in an individual Pacific nation over an important issue" - for
judging the award, the judges examined the stories using three categories:<P>
<UL><LI>The importance of the issue covered and significance to the society in which
it is published.
<LI>The use of investigative techniques and skills in establishing the facts of
the story.
<LI>The story-telling ability of the journalist in making the issue accessible to
the reading public.</ul>
While all of the stories judged were impressive, three stories stood out in the
minds of the judges as being excellent investigative journalism, and one in
particular.

<strong>Winner:</strong>
The winner of the award for 1996 is Yashwant Gaunder's expose,
published in The Review news magazine of July 1995, on the failings of the
National Bank of Fiji that revealed the bank's doubtful loans of F$120 million.<P>

The article pieced together the maze of relevant facts, unearthed new
information, and interviewed major players in the matter, to provide the reader
with a compelling account of corruption and incompetence within a country's
major financial institution.<P>

The journalist used a range of investigative techniques from relentless pursuit
of a wide range of sources, to researching companies and individuals associated
with the bank. The story added to the public understanding of a major political
and business crisis in Fiji society.<P>

The judges have also commended two other articles in the award.<P></TD>

<strong>
Commended:</strong>
Dominic Kakas, in Papua New Guinea's The Independent on 22 July
1995, revealed substantial evidence that a Malaysian logging company operating
in PNG had purchased a K335,000 house for the use of the then Forests Minister.<P>

The story showed that Forests Minister Andrew Posai was occupying a house
provided by a company associated with the controversial Malaysian logging
company Rimbunan Hijau.<P>

The story displayed a courageous and tenacious attitude to pursue information
about a matter of vital public interest. The journalist has displayed a fine
understanding of how basic investigative techniques can expose important
matters to the public gaze.<P>

The article exposed a tale of corruption that opens a view into the heart of
PNG's politics and business.<P>

<strong>Commended:</strong>

The second story commended by the judges is Ilaitia Turagabeci and
Asaeli Lave's report in The Fiji Times on 16 March 1996, of a village using
income from marijuana to finance needed community projects.<P>

The story impressed the judges as it dealt with the issue of illegal cropping
of marijuana not in the usual framework of 'crime'. <P>

The newspaper also withstood the pressure brought to bear on it from government
and the police force. It upheld a crucial principle of journalism: the
upholding of the professional secrecy of the source of information obtained in
confidence.<P>

The journalists involved in this story put in the hard slog to investigate the
story on the ground, and reported with a refreshing understanding of the
reasons for the villagers breaking the law.<P>

The judges noted the absence of any entries from the non-print media and
suggest that journalists in radio and TV be encouraged to enter the next award.<P>

Also the judges recommend that all reports should be submitted in good quality
photocopy or tear-out form rather than fax, and radio and TV entries should be
accompanied by transcripts of the items.<P>

Each item should also detail full attributions for information in stories,
where this is not provided in the published/broadcast stories themselves.<P>

The entries in the inaugural Pacific Investigative Journalism Award are in the
best traditions of investigative journalism, and uphold the highest principles
of quality journalism in informing the public.  <P>

<strong> The deadline for the 1997 award is March 31</strong><P>

<h2>The Judges </H2>
<strong>PETER CRONAU :</strong> Director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney, and an investigative journalist with an interest in Pacific region affairs.<P>
<strong>WENDY BACON : </strong>An investigative journalist and lawyer, Associate Professor Bacon is the head of the department of social communication and journalism at UTS.<P>
<strong>DAVID MCKNIGHT :</strong> The award-winning author of 'Australia's Spies and their Secrets', McKnight lectures in investigative journalism at UTS.<P>

<Font size=7>Development media courses</A></Font size=7>
<P>
More than 150 journalism students have graduated from the University of Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, many of them now working in several other Pacific countries. Some are now in the news media in the Philippines and several African countries. Journalism students follow either a two-year programme of study leading to a <A HREF="#DIPLOMA">Diploma in Media Studies</A>, or a four-year program of study leading to a <A HREF="#DEGREE">Bachelor of Journalism degree</A>. 
<P>
A graduate <A HREF="#CERT">Certificate in
Investigative Journalism</A> began in 1995 for mid-career professional journalists. The following information is drawn from the <B>1996 Development Communications Handbook</B> published by SPCenCIID.
<P>
<HR>
<A HREF="#Development"><IMG WIDTH=30 ALIGN=BOTTOM  SRC="images/Samlogo.gif"></A> <Font size=4><B><A NAME="DIPLOMA"> Diploma in Media Studies:</A></Font></B><BR>
The diploma offers a thorough grounding in the skills of journalism, reporting and editing on a
fortnightly newspaper, <A HREF="../UniT_Home.html">Uni Tavur</A>, a 16-week period of supervised practical experience in newsroom of the national media, advanced skills in either broadcast or print journalism, skills in writing either <A HREF="#TOK PISIN">Tok Pisin</A> or <A HREF="#HIRI MOTU">Hiri Motu </A>(for Papua New Guinea students), and a selection of courses in other subjects
offered by University.
<HR>
<A HREF="#DEVELOPMENT"><IMG WIDTH=30 ALIGN=BOTTOM  SRC="images/Samlogo.gif"></A> <Font size=4><B><A NAME="DEGREE"> Bachelor of Journalism:</A></Font></B><BR>
The degree offers all the practical journalism training offered to diploma students and includes courses
in either <A HREF="#TOK PISIN">Tok Pisin Writing</A>  or <A HREF="#HIRI MOTU">Hiri Motu Writing</A>. In addition, the students must first successfully complete the  University Arts or Science Foundation Year, and follow a sequence of Part 1 and Part 2 courses in the academic discipline of their choice. Students must also study <A HREF="#MASS COMMS">Mass Communications
(25.209)</A>, the history and sociology of the mass media.
<P>
It is also possible for students who have successfully completed the two-year diploma programme to
continue doing the degree programme. They do not apply for the diploma, but do another two years'
study, concentrating on their "minor" discipline and doing Journalism courses not taken -- such as
electives <A HREF="#ELECTRONIC">Electronic Media II (25.220)</A>, <A HREF="#PRINT">Print Media Production II (25.221)</A> and Public Relations
(25.222). Students who have already completed the diploma programme are not required to do
Foundation Year.

A course in <A HREF="#INVEST">Investigative Journalism (25.300)</A> for professional and graduate journalists began in the Second Semester 1995. This is a full-time 12 point course designed for mid-career journalists and
qualifies towards a higher degree or carries a certificate (CertInvestJourn).
