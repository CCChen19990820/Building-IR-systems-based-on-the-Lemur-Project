<BR>
<BR>Carl,
<BR>
<DD>I just wanted to write you a letter and let you know how it's going with me.&nbsp;  As I'm sure you've heard, I was busted on February 13 by U.S. Customs & DEA SWAT teams at my house in Minneapolis.&nbsp;  I was originally charged with conspiracy for over 1,000 kilos of pot, money laundering and 5 counts of possession with intent to distribute.&nbsp;  Everyone on my indictment became informers except me.&nbsp;  Even when told I faced 20 years of federal time, I refused to even meet with narcs, or say anything at all about my activities.&nbsp;  In June I pled guilty to one count of possession of 500 pounds in February 1992.&nbsp;  In August I was sentenced to 63 months in the Bureau of Prisons.
<DD>The state of Texas is currently revoking my probation on an 80 pound possession charge, also from 1992, that may or may not result in more time.&nbsp;  I am presently on my way (hopefully) to a federal corrections institute in Minnesota.&nbsp;  Some people have insinuated that my arrest, like similar arrests of people like Arlin Troutt and Dennis Peron, have discredited the Grassroots Party and the Hemp Movement.&nbsp;  This is absurd.
<DD>The only "crime" I have ever been convicted of is possession of marijuana - the breaking of an unjust and unreasonable law.&nbsp;  The same goes for Arlin and Dennis.&nbsp;  Any you.&nbsp;  I am angry and disgusted by certain elements who are trying to defame people like us who have put their lives on the line to further a righteous cause.&nbsp;  I am not saying that everyone should break the marijuana laws, but I am sickened by self-righteous hypocrites who condemn those of us who have been arrested and given up years of our lives for nothing more than possession of a plant that is a gift from God.&nbsp;  There are three equally important aspects of the cannabis legalization issue: industrial, medical and HUMAN RIGHTS.&nbsp;  Human rights encompasses personal and religious use.&nbsp;  I have always said that the Hemp Movement will only be successful when all three aspects are accorded equal importance.
<DD>There are between 100,000 and a quarter million Americans in prison today for marijuana alone.&nbsp;  Their cause is EVERY BIT as legitimate and vital as that of medical users or "industrial use" advocates.
<DD>For one group of Hemp Activists to look down their noses at another is ridiculous and counter-productive.&nbsp;  It should be remembered that the purpose and intent of the laws against marijuana is the total eradication and extinction of the cannabis plant.&nbsp;  Were it not for "outlaws" who have kept the cannabis species alive over the last 60 years, the industrial and medical use advocates may well not have had a plant to be talking about.
<DD>Ghandi said, "We have a moral obligation to disobey unrighteous laws."&nbsp;  Thoreau said, "In a land where any are imprisoned unjustly, the only place for a truly just man is in prison."&nbsp;  I agree with them both.&nbsp;  I did not become an activist after my arrest - I've been at it for over seven years, and I've worked as hard and given as much as anyone in this movement has.&nbsp;  Now I am giving 5 years of my life in federal prison.
<DD>Marijuana prisoners ask for no special accolades or recognition - we know ourselves the worth of our sacrifice and dedication, for we are the ones who must pay its price.&nbsp;  But we do not deserve the condemnation and recrimination of anyone who claims to fight for Truth and Justice.&nbsp;  The Hemp Movement is stuggling to change a law that will change the world.&nbsp;  We need all the help we can get, and we must work together.&nbsp;  You keep doing your job, and we'll keep doin' ours.
<DD>Until We Win,
<DD>Russell "Bongo" Bentley
<BR>
<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I don't know how much time you have for reading, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LIVING IN TRUTH by VACLAC HAVEL.&nbsp;  Read it, you'll be glad you did.

<p><font size="4"><tt>Dear Mark: </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>A few weeks ago you requested permission to
provide a letter I'd written to Iowa Senator Grassley to various newspapers
&amp; other federal legislators.&nbsp; I'd provided it to Carl

Internet, dispersing it at my request. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>You are encouraged to make that letter
available to anyone who needs to be educated about Cannabis in an
honest manner as opposed to the pervasive govt misinformation. </tt></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><tt>* * * * * * * * </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>I've noted a recent federal push to control &quot;pseudoephedrine&quot;
anti-histamines &amp; cold pills in an effort to further enforce
prohibition of &quot;meth&quot;amphetamine clandestine
production. It should be pointed out to these &quot;pop-law&quot;
lawmakers that use of these remedies are a simple expedient to
the outlaw lab production techniques, and that &quot;meth&quot;
will still be made using bituminous (soft) coal, bleach, battery
(sulfuric) acid, and salt, the latter two combining to make
hydrochloric gas.&nbsp; In the early 1900s this was a widely
known process to make &quot;chicken crank&quot; so the hen would
lay more eggs, grow faster, etc., along with helping the farmers
of the era do more work!&nbsp; &quot;Chicken crank&quot; was used
in a variety of snake-oil concoctions &quot;energizers&quot; and
was an ingredient in some soft drinks, namely 7-Up &amp; Coca
Cola.&nbsp; It can also be produced from coal oil. If Congress
moves to control cold remedies, underground labs in this country
will use commonly available materials to continue
operation.&nbsp; It seems the politicians are unaware that the
'Invisible Hand' of market demand is what fuels the market and no hysterical
&quot;pop-law&quot; will slow it down, much less stop production. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>It should be understood I do not advocate
&quot;meth.&quot;&nbsp; Nor do I advocate any war on Americans by
Americans.&nbsp; It is my belief that the (Lifestyle Police's)
&quot;DRUG WAR&quot; is no more than VERY SICK POLITICS.&nbsp;
It's only product is misery imposed on the underprivileged and
contempt for govt &amp; authority as opposed to respect.&nbsp; No
govt has ever gained it's citizens' respect by means of
prohibition and oppression. </tt></font></p>

<P>July 30, 1996

<P>Dear Carl,

<DD>Thanks for the Summer 1996 NORML newsletter.&nbsp;  As your article on page 11 points out, the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue, which I was counting on, is now dead.&nbsp;  Never, in one term, has any U.S. Supreme Court so damaged the Constitution.
<DD>Besides the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue, they ruled that forfeitures from innocent owners is okay; that police can use pretext stops to search for drugs; limited federal judges' ability to make sure prisons provide legal access to inmates; and approved limiting habeas corpus in death penalty cases.&nbsp;  Now President Clinton is using the Olympic bombing to slip in roaming phone taps!&nbsp;  Who says 1984 isn't around?
<DD>On my appeal, we now expect the Iowa Supreme Court to rule on the legality of mushrooms.&nbsp;  On one level, there is no mention in the statute of any mushroom.&nbsp;  A look at the whole of Iowa's Controlled Substances Act would lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that mushrooms are legal.&nbsp;  They define "drug," in part, as "substances, other than food, intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body..."&nbsp;  Most people would consider a mushroom "food."&nbsp;  The definition of "manufacture" says, in part, "by extraction from substances of natural origin" and all I had was the "substance of natural origin" - mushrooms.&nbsp;  I was in no way "extracting" the psilocybin.
<DD>What the Iowa Supreme Court has to look at, though, is not whether it is fair to put me in prison for 20 years for having mushrooms not even listed as illegal.&nbsp;  What they really better consider is the precedent they will set in my case.&nbsp;  If they say a plant that naturally contains a listed substance is to be treated exactly like the extracted, or chemically synthesized, form, where does that leave the state of law?&nbsp;  Nicotine is illegal (Iowa Code ¤ 205.5) to possess or sell.&nbsp;  Every person with a pack of cigarettes would be in danger of prosecution.&nbsp;  Coffee, beans or brew, that contain caffeine would be subject to "drug" controls.&nbsp;  Home owners would be "manufacturing lysergic acid" if they grow morning glories.&nbsp;  Garden shops that sell San Pedro cactus, a common item, would be open to "sale of mescaline" charges.&nbsp;  The list goes on and on.
<DD>While the Iowa Supreme Court may not care to be fair in my case because it's legally correct to rule I broke no laws, they may think twice if they realize how they rule will affect tobacco and coffee.&nbsp;  NORML should take heed that an adverse ruling in my case opens the door for prosecutorial slight-of-hand and using my case to change a misdemeanor marijuana charge into a felony THC charge.
<DD>If the Iowa Supreme Court holds that mushrooms that naturally contain psilocybin are illegal, even if not specifically prohibited, because they happen to contain, naturally, psilocybin - where does that leave the Declaration of Independence and Constitution?&nbsp;  After all, they are documents that happen to "contain" an illegal substance since they are printed on paper containing hemp.&nbsp;  But then with the way the U.S. Supreme Court and our government is using the trumped up excuse of the "War on Drugs" to undermine these documents, they have already done much towards declaring them as "prohibited substances"!
<DD>We expect a ruling in my case in December or January.&nbsp;  As I said, now that the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue is dead, they will, now, have to rule on the mushroom legality issue.&nbsp;  Will the Iowa Supreme Court declare that much of life on this planet is illegal - which ruling against me will, in essence, do - because 1000s of living organisms naturally contain a controlled substance?&nbsp;  Or will they leave us safe to enjoy our poppy seed rolls, morning glory flowers and other items not specifically outlawed?&nbsp;  Tune in this winter...

<P><DD>Namaste,
<DD>Skip

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Dear Carl:
<BR>
<BR>Well, I went ahead and wrote my Religious Freedom/Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993/1st, 5th, 8th, 9th and 14th Amendments brief.&nbsp; (Whew!!)&nbsp;  Anyway, I doubt if I'd go through it again if I had all the stuff from your marijuana attack ...  and, I'm sure it was more than you would want to send anyway.&nbsp;  So, unless it was real easy for you, you can forget that request.
<BR>
<BR>But I have another one.&nbsp;  Since I am planning for the new trial,
which I hope will not be necessary, but "just in case" I want to be ready ... and have a couple of requests.
<BR>
<BR>One, the FIJA people wrote me and said you were the one to contact in Iowa.&nbsp;  They mention in the newletter on information they have in their "Activists' Supply Shop" that tells how to inform the jury at the trial.&nbsp;  Do you have that literature?&nbsp;  I couldn't tell from the list which it was, and couldn't afford it if I could have.&nbsp;  If you have this could you send me a copy?&nbsp;  (THE INFO FOR ATTORNEYS ON HOW TO SLIP IT IN IN OPENING/CLOSING ARGUMENT)
<BR>
<BR>Two, If my case does go to trial next year (Feb, March or April) would you be able, perhaps, to get a couple of persons to hand out the "True or False" FIJA leaflets?&nbsp;  I think that would help a lot as I will be making a good case to the jury on mushrooms safety, religious use, and the silliness of the law that prosecutes someone for something not even listed as illegal and sends them to prison for 20 years.&nbsp;  (THE TRIAL WOULD PROBABLY BE IN SCOTT COUNTY - FOR LEAFLETING)
<BR>
<BR>Three, Do you know any doctors, professors, biologists or psychiatric doctors that would write an Affidavit, and possibly testify at trial, on the safety and ????? of psilocybin and of mushrooms?&nbsp;  If so, could you send me their addresses so I could contact them and get affidavits for my motion and inquire if they would also be willing to testify if a new trial becomes necessary?
<BR>
<BR>Thank you for your support so far.&nbsp;  I hope you can help me out on the above three requests.
<BR>
<BR>Best regards,
<BR>Skip
<BR>
<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I will be representing myself at any new trial.&nbsp;  No sell-out court-appointed lawyers <U>again</U>!&nbsp;  I <U>am</U> a paralegal and am studying on how to prepare & present my case at trial.

<DIV ALIGN=left><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Dear Carl,
<BR>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I've changed my mind, again.&nbsp;  Sorry.&nbsp;  I <U>would</U> like a copy of your original <U>DEA Petition</U> for an exemption and the appeal stuff.&nbsp;  The reason is that, regardless of the outcome of my case, I think my Sacred Mushroom Church has a real chance for an exemption - since Psilocybe mushrooms are situated much more similarly to peyote than marijuana.&nbsp;  Besides, I <U>have</U> used them as a religious sacrament for 22 years and it's about time I was able to do so legally.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>We plan to incorporate our church also.&nbsp;  Having your original Petition, etc., would guide me in the process I need to follow.&nbsp;  I think my argument has a much better chance than marijuana, as, from the Spanish Inquisition on, peyote <U>and</U> mushrooms have been used and persecuted/prosecuted together.&nbsp;  I think the religious use history, medical safety (Psilocybin is <U>THE</U> SAFEST HALLUCINOGEN, 10 TIMES SAFER THAN MESCALINE; AND MUCH LESS TOXIC, EVEN, THAN THC), and "pervasiveness" of <U>actual</U> use in the U.S. is so close to that of peyote that we'd really be in good shape under the RFRA of 1993.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>so, if it isn't too much of a problem, I would like the copies you said you'd make.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>This doesn't cancel the other items my last letter raised on the FIJA stuff.&nbsp;  If a new trial is necessary, I will want to raise, not only the religious freedom issue, but want the jury to be "fully informed."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I have Jonathan Ott (<U>PHARMACOTHEON</U>, <U>AGE OF ENTHEOGENS</U>, <U>HALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICA</U>, and other books) lined up to come from Mexico as on Expert Witness.&nbsp;  Also, Dr. John Beresford, retired Psychiatrist who did psilocybin experiments in the '60s, and now heads The Committee on Unjust Sentencing and The Albert Hoffmann Museum will be an Expert Witness.&nbsp;  I'm hoping for others, perhaps even Dr. Hoffmann, although his age, 93, might preclude his being able to come.&nbsp;  (He's close to both Dr. Beresford & Jonathan Ott)
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I'm proceeding as if the new trial will be necessary.&nbsp;  Better to be prepared.&nbsp;  And I am getting ready to do a first class trial - and represent myself.&nbsp;  The motions are done, with supporting briefs, and I'm studying on trial presentation, objections, cross examinations, etc.&nbsp;  I'm preparing a trial notebook a'la F. Lee Bailey.&nbsp;  And with the cops & prosecutors destroying all 4,860 Mason jars of cultures, (knowing & <U>ADMITTING</U> I said I was growing many types of mushrooms), 2 weeks after I got in their jail, but before I could ask for preservation and independent testing - then lying on the stand about a "court order" to destroy the jars when it was the prosecutor who told the cops to destroy them - well, Mark Furman will look like a saint when I get through with the Quad City MEG officers who lied and the prosecutor who let them!
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>No Iowa choo-choo train trial this time, my friend.&nbsp;  Oh, I'd take a stand-by counsel to help - but I am going pro se.&nbsp;  Jury voir dire will be extensive this time.&nbsp;  Discovery motions, jury questionnaire motion & 75 sample questionnaire, etc., etc., are all typed and ready to go.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>They probably will decide not to even retry me at first glance of all the motions.&nbsp;  And each one is proper - not "frivolous" or like most "jail-house" lawyers do.&nbsp;  But then I am a trained paralegal.&nbsp;  I should have represented myself the first time - but, in county jail, there was no way to prepare.&nbsp;  Here in Anamosa ... I've got afternoons and all day Thursdays and Fridays and have been using the time in the law library and on the typewriters.&nbsp;  It has been my only activity.&nbsp;  Then, in my cell, I study for trial presentation - the one area of law I wasn't trained in at paralegal school.&nbsp;  Lists of questions for "cross," for me "Experts," exhibits, order of proof, etc., will all be in the trial notebook - ready to go.&nbsp;  And, I've got the luxury of the first trial's transcripts to prepare with.&nbsp;  All they have to present I've got time to prepare to counter.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>Well, I rattled on for more than you probably wanted to read.&nbsp;  Thanks for all the help.&nbsp;  Let me know about the FIJA stuff when you send the "EXEMPTION" stuff.&nbsp;  I can't tell you how big a help you've been.&nbsp;  Hope we get to meet someday - I'm sure we will ....

                      OPENING A DISCUSSION ABOUT
                    EFFECTIVE ANTI-DRUG STRATEGIES


                             May 15, 1995
                          by Eric E. Sterling
           President, The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation


  There is a movement, gathered here in Atlanta, Georgia, that 
argues that the means to fight the drug problem cannot be discussed.  
This movement is based on a false fundamentalism:  society's fight 
against drugs can be carried out either by means of prohibition 
(namely the status quo) or it must surrender to what it calls 
legalization.  The arguments of those who advocate legalization are 
too dangerous even to be heard.  Thus the Atlanta Resolution's first 
point is to reject all proposals to legalize illicit drugs.  This is 
simplistic thinking at its worst.

  Ninety-five percent of The Atlanta Resolution is plain common 
sense, but that is not what the Atlanta conference has gathered to 
discuss. 

  The conference agenda describes the catastrophe that would result 
from legalization, but no person who advocates any version of 
legalization has been invited to present their view or to answer 
questions.  The conference characterizations of drug legalization 
are as fair and as realistic as using Star Wars movies to describe 
the outcome of the NASA manned space flight program.  Implicit in 
the conference agenda is that our current strategy is simply dandy.

  But the American people don t think our current strategy is dandy 
at all.  A nationwide survey in February 1995 by Peter Hart Research 
Associates for Drug Strategies, Inc. found that 50% of the American 
people gave the Federal government a grade of F or D for dealing 
with the problems of drug use and addiction, and 59% gave those 
grades for the problem of drug-related crime.  Only 10% would give 
the Federal government a grade of A or B for dealing with drug use, 
and only 11% for drug-related crime.  Only 6% of Americans thought 
that drug abuse was less of a problem today than 5 years ago.

  A strategy must set forth goals and means.  The 1995 National Drug 
Control Strategy (the Strategy) promulgated by President Clinton 
sets forth clear and worthwhile goals that are a distinct 
improvement from previous strategies (Table 1-1).  The means 
proposed, however, are largely the same ones -- prohibition, and its 
enforcement -- which have failed.

  The National Drug Control Strategy is, in a sense, schizophrenic 
-- it reads as though it were drafted by a committee of Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde.  It reflects an internal conflict between realistic 
goals and priorities, and the exaggeration characteristic of 
politicized discussions of the drug problem.  The Strategy writes 
about various drug problems oblivious to the causes of the problems 
and reasonable methods to correct those problems.

  Prohibition has failed to reduce crime or addiction.  There is no 
prohibition-based strategy that will substantially address those 
problems.  A drug-free society is unrealistic.  Our strategy of 
punishing drug addicts is akin to expelling from school students 
with learning disabilities.  To claim to be taking the profits out 
of $50 billion of a year's drug trafficking through the yearly 
forfeiture of $1 billion in property is absurd.  Even sales taxes 
would be more effective in taking the profits out.  Certainly much 
more extensive taxation is required but it is only possible when 
prohibition is repealed.

  We must change our strategy, but we must do so cautiously.  A 
regulatory, management approach to the myriad drug problems is 
called for.  It should be tailored to specific issues and adopted 
incrementally.  There will be addicts and crime no matter what we do.  
An example of regulatory complexity is the regulation of alcohol, 
one legal drug.  There are probably 10,000 different alcohol laws 
reflecting multiple goals from revenue collection to reducing 
consumption.  For this one drug, the regulation of the sale, 
advertising, taxation, and places of distribution and consumption 
vary in every jurisdiction depending whether it is beer, wine or 
whiskey.  Alcohol regulation has evolved since 1933.  In some ways 
it has improved, and in others it has gotten worse.  Developing a 
comprehensive regulatory scheme for dozens of classes of drugs can t 
be accomplished overnight.  There is much necessary market and 
regulatory research.


       National Drug Control Strategy -- A Strategy Founded on
                        Deceptions and Failures

  A strategy for action should identify the most important problems 
and recognize the limits of what the strategy can effect -- it must 
be honest.  The first problem identified in the White House's 
National Drug Control Strategy -- February 1995:  The crime-drug 
cycle continues.  Second, More teenagers are smoking pot.  The third 
problem is described as:  Less of them [America's teenagers] think 
cocaine use is dangerous.

  What does the Strategy say about the crime-drug cycle?  It simply 
sets forth the number and percentage of drug-related murders for the 
past eight years which ranged between 751 (3.9%) in 1986 and 1403 
 (7.4%) in 1989, down to 1287 (5.2%) in 1993, and states that there 
has been a marked increase youth homicide reported by Dr. Alfred 
Blumstein.  The Strategy provides no analysis of the problem.  It 
fails to explain the crime- drug cycle and how to break it.

  Mostly, the crime-drug cycle exists because drugs are prohibited.  
Prohibition inevitably requires violence.  All businesses are 
subject to conflict among market- participants.  Such conflict is 
resolved nonviolently for legal businesses by means of the courts or 
other nonviolent dispute resolution programs.  Prohibited businesses 
are forced to resolve conflict illegally -- either through violence 
or through adjudication by organized crime figures who rely upon 
violence for enforcement.

  Prohibition markets are especially attractive robbery targets 
because of the inevitably high volumes of cash and over-priced 
contraband.  Unlike legitimate businesses that can take checks or 
credit cards, illegal drug markets take only cash.  Legitimate 
business can hire licensed security guards.  Prohibition businesses 
only hire for protection those who demonstrate they are prepared to 
kill.  Legalizers share the nation's goal of ending the crime-drug 
cycle.

  Second, certainly teenage marijuana use is a problem.  But more 
teenagers start a lifetime of addiction to cigarettes every year 
than use marijuana one time, and the smoking prevalence is 
increasing.  More teenagers got drunk in the past two weeks than 
used marijuana once in the past year, and the alcohol consumption 
prevalence is up.  The Strategy presents strong evidence that 
teenage use of liquor is a more serious problem in violence and 
suicide than teenage marijuana use. Teen drunkenness is also a major 
factor in teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, school 
failure, and crime.  Dr. Lloyd Johnston pointed out over a decade 
ago that teen tobacco use is one of the best predictors of teen hard 
drug use, but aside from a couple of paragraphs in the 150-page 
Strategy, alcohol and tobacco are ignored.

  Teen smoking and drunkenness are not political hot-buttons.  There 
is no multi- billion Federal, State and local tax-funded 
establishment to address those problems.  The sponsors of the 
Partnership for a Drug Free America earn millions of dollars 
annually from the promotion of tobacco and alcohol.  And the tobacco 
and alcohol industries are among the biggest of corporate 
contributors to political campaign committees of both political 
parties.  They fight every effort to increase the taxes on alcohol 
and tobacco and to limit the advertising of these drugs.  Public 
health and safety is not on their agenda.  Our political leadership 
is craven in failing to challenge these industries.  Most legalizers 
share the nation's goal of reducing teenage drug, alcohol and 
tobacco use.

  Typically, the Strategy is given to exaggeration.  Saying fewer 
teenagers think cocaine is dangerous, the Strategy implies that 
children are largely misled about the dangers of drugs.  In fact, 
89.3% of last year's high school seniors believed that they would be 
at great risk if they took cocaine regularly.  Or the Strategy says, 
&quot;Drug using adults from every social strata are clogging court 
dockets, crowding emergency rooms...&quot;  Clogged court dockets, a top 
national emergency...or some trial lawyers nightmare?  The serious 
problems are often nowhere near as widespread as implied by the 
Strategy.  In 1991, there were 93.5 million emergency room visits 
according to the 1993 Statistical Abstract, and less than 500,000 of 
them were drug-related, hardly crowding emergency rooms.  Emergency 
room episodes involving drugs have tripled since 1985 -- when the 
war on drugs was kicked into high gear under President Reagan.  This 
data is actually more evidence that our prohibition-based strategy 
is failing to protect the public.

  Outside the realm of exaggeration, hype and political posturing, 
in the real world of 1995, the three most pressing problems from 
drugs in America are the violence in the drug trade, the spread of 
AIDS, and the immense and growing power of the criminal underworld.  
This has been the case for at least a decade:

  *  Drug trade violence was identified as the cause of 40% of the 
homicides in New York City in the late-1980s.  More importantly, the 
drug trade is responsible for the proliferation of guns among 
American youth.  Since 1985 the white juvenile homicide rate grew by 
80%, and the black juvenile homicide rate more than doubled, growing 
120%.  According to Dr. Alfred Blumstein, this is directly linked to 
the prohibition-created crack cocaine trade.

  *  In 1993, AIDS became the biggest killer of Americans between 
the ages of 25 and 44.  In 1992, there were 24,000 new AIDS cases 
where the infection involved the injection of drugs.  By 1992, 
roughly 40% of all new AIDS cases involved injection of drugs.  On 
average, each AIDS case costs the taxpayers $100,000.  Unless 
checked, dirty needle - related AIDS will soon cost $24 billion per 
year.

  *  Large, international criminal organizations -- funded with drug 
profits -- are steadily growing more powerful.  They are subverting 
democratic governments on every continent around the world.  In the 
1990 election, the drug cartels assassinated four candidates for 
President in Colombia.  Last year, the leading candidate for 
President of Mexico was assassinated in a crime linked to political 
protection of the drug traffickers.  These criminal organizations 
have acquired enormous economic power rivaling that of the largest 
corporations on the Fortune 500.  Only one drug trafficking cartel, 
based in Medellin, Colombia, has been put of out business, but 
dozens of others around the world are growing, and increasingly 
collaborating.  The Strategy claims success because the number of 
casual users of cocaine has gone down.  However, the consumption of 
cocaine in the U.S. has actually remained stable since 1985. The 
profits from supplying that cocaine (as well as heroin and 
marijuana) is the greatest transfer of wealth to criminals in the 
history of the world.

  Americans have been given a Strategy that denies the reality of 
prohibition economics, that ignores the law of supply and demand, 
and that is blind to the relation between cause and effect.  What is 
needed is a more effective national drug strategy that is no longer 
bound by the counterproductive paradigm of prohibition.

  This paper outlines a strategy to fight violence and reduce AIDS 
that could be more effective.  It is based not on polls, but on what 
is humane and realistic.  It is based on what can be accomplished, 
not on political slogans such as attaining a drug-free America.


    1.  Remember that drug laws and drug policy should help people, 
                              not hurt them

  People who have drug problems should not be demonized, they need 
help.  People with drug problems are usually in some kind of 
physical or psychological pain.  Addicts should not be treated like 
lepers in the Old Testament who were stoned by their neighbors or 
banished.  People who don t have drug problems, and who aren't 
hurting anyone, should be left alone.

  Everyone who wants to quit using drugs should be able to get 
appropriate treatment.  Addicted single parents need residential 
treatment that won t break up families.  Pregnant addicts need 
treatment, not imprisonment -- but most treatment programs won t 
accept pregnant addicts.  HIV positive addicts should be the top 
priority for treatment, yet many programs won t take HIV positive 
people.  All drug addicted prisoners should get treatment, but no 
one should be prosecuted or imprisoned simply to get treatment.

  Relief of physical pain is one of the oldest medical traditions 
and a basic human value.  Our policy should be compassionate toward 
those who are in pain from disease or from its treatment.  Marijuana 
has well documented medical uses.  Even the Chief Administrative Law 
Judge at the Drug Enforcement Administration, Francis L. Young, 
after hearing evidence gathered from around the nation over a four-
month period, agreed that marijuana has medical uses.  Those 
Americans who can benefit from using marijuana medically should get 
it legally from their doctors.  This is a perfectly respectable 
position, and it was endorsed by the National Association of 
Attorneys General on June 25, 1983.

  Heroin relieves pain for some people who obtain no relief from 
other drugs -- those people should get heroin legally.  In the late 
1980s, without weakening the severe penalties for the unauthorized 
use of heroin, the conservative Canadian government joined the 
United Kingdom in legalizing heroin for medical use only.

  The medical uses of marijuana and heroin do not mean these drugs 
are good.  Nor does it mean these drugs are better than other drugs.  
Simply, these drugs are useful for some people.  The people who can 
benefit from these drugs should not be denied them.

  Some persons, justifiably concerned about the abuse of these drugs 
by drug addicts and by children, oppose even the very carefully 
controlled medical use of these drugs because medical use of 
marijuana or medical use of heroin supposedly sends the wrong 
message.  First, drug abusers aren't listening for this message.  
Cocaine, Valium , Dilaudid , and most controlled substances have 
uses in medicine, but many addicts who abuse those drugs don t care, 
even if they are actually aware of such uses.  Drug abusers don t 
rationalize their drug use as medical.

  Secondly, there isn't a single positive value we want our children 
to learn that is not being undermined by a host of wrong messages.  
For every virtue -- honesty, thrift, industry, studiousness, 
cleanliness, chastity, charity, responsibility, civic-mindedness, 
moderation, non-violence, or sobriety and abstinence from drugs -- 
movies, television, advertising and popular music are sending 
messages that directly conflict with positive values.  Every 
teenager everyday has to deal with, and we hope disregard, seductive 
messages that conflict with virtue.

  Exaggerating the dangers to children of the wrong message when it 
comes to subtleties of medical practice is unwarranted and 
irrational.  It is the job of drug abuse prevention programs to 
teach children the important differences between drugs prescribed by 
doctors and street drugs.  People who are dying or going blind 
should not be forced to endure more suffering because drug abuse 
prevention programs might sometimes be ineffective in helping 
children draw the necessary distinctions between the legitimate and 
the inappropriate uses of drugs.

  The Controlled Substances Act makes cocaine, THC, methadone and 
other synthetic opiates perfectly legal -- when their use is 
prescribed for by a physician in the proper circumstances.  Debating 
how systems of control can be improved does not undermine the drug 
abuse prevention effort.  To say that the American public should not 
openly debate other forms of drug legalization because children 
might get the wrong message, is like saying the public should not 
debate gun control, militia groups or the Second Amendment because 
children might get the wrong message.  It is fundamental to the 
health of democratic governments that public policies be debated.


   2.  Adopt a public health approach toward all drugs and drug users

  This requires a comprehensive approach toward all drugs, not 
simply  now illegal drugs.  What we should be concerned about is the 
drug abuse problem -- not just the illegal drug problem.  Illegal 
drug use does not exist in legal or &gt;social isolation.  Treatment 
professionals recognize cross-addiction and polydrug abuse.  
Prevention professionals recognize a gateway relationship between 
legal drugs and use of illegal drugs.  Tighten the regulations 
surrounding alcohol and tobacco -- for adults and for children -- 
and this will help reduce the use and abuse of other drugs as well.  
In order to delay the onset of teen alcohol and tobacco use, which 
delays the onset of other drug use, we must reduce the promotion and 
availability of tobacco and alcohol to children.

  To respond to our drug problem we must expand honest anti-drug 
education.  Honest comprehensive prevention programs work.  
Cigarettes kill more than 400,000 Americans in a year and are as 
addictive as heroin or cocaine, according to the U.S. Surgeon 
General.  Yet forty-four million addicted cigarette smokers have 
quit in the past thirty years.  This is the result of a tremendous, 
successful public health campaign.  This campaign succeeded without 
jailing or urine-testing cigarette smokers, without prosecuting 
tobacco sellers, without prohibition, and in spite of the annual 
expenditure of billions of dollars to promote tobacco-use.  Most 
policy makers reject the idea of prohibiting cigarettes because it 
would be a disaster of corruption and crime, and wholly inconsistent 
with American values.

  Cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana can be gateways toward use of 
harder drugs.  Therefore prevention programs need to focus on all 
drugs.

  We must continue to evaluate drug abuse prevention programs.  
Mathea Falco in The Making of a Drug-Free America (1992) pointed out 
that most programs have not been evaluated.  Research Triangle 
Institute reviewed 18 studies in September 1994 and found D.A.R.E., 
America's most common drug abuse prevention program, was 
substantially less effective in reducing drug use among the children 
who took the program than certain other approaches.  If we are 
serious about prevention, we must be willing to abandon programs 
that don t work well, even if they are politically popular.

  Quality medical care and drug abuse treatment must be easily 
available for those who need it.  Heroin addicts, crack addicts, the 
mentally ill, the homeless, the uninsured, and everyone at risk of 
catching or spreading contagious disease are the highest treatment 
priority.  This will help halt the transmission of disease, and 
reduce the use of illegal drugs as pain killers for untreated 
disease.

  To stop the spread of blood borne disease among injecting drug 
addicts, clean needles should be exchanged for used ones.  This is 
the recommendation of the National Commission on HIV and AIDS, and 
top government scientists who have studied the issue.  Distribution 
of hypodermic syringes is a crime in eleven states which should be 
repealed.  Until 1965 (Griswold v. Connecticut), distribution of 
condoms to any person was a crime in some states.  Thirty-years ago 
sale of condoms in supermarkets and convenience stores was 
unthinkable.  Now, for the widely accepted public health purpose of 
fighting sexually transmitted disease, condoms are widely 
distributed to the sexually active as one component of a public 
health program.  When we think about drugs and disease in less 
judgmental terms, public health distribution of hypodermic syringes 
to drug injectors will no longer be shocking.

  Under appropriate controls and supervision, drugs must be made 
available to addicts to reduce harms.  Smoking tobacco is the most 
dangerous means for ingesting nicotine.  If Nicorette gum were 
cheaper and more freely available many more smokers and snuff 
dippers would be likely to quit.  Cigarettes, after all, are only 
crude, disposable nicotine ingestion devices -- of the most 
dangerous kind.  Nicotine is addicting but is not as dangerous as 
the tars, particulates and gases in cigarette smoke.  Heroin is 
addicting but is not as dangerous as HIV, hepatitis, and the 
adulterants added by criminals who distribute street drugs.

  Heroin addicts who can t or won t quit should not be banished to 
the underworld, nor put at risk of death from criminally 
contaminated drug supplies.  They ought to be able to get clean, 
affordable opiates under medical and pharmaceutical supervision if 
it will prevent them from spreading disease or committing crimes.  
Incidentally, Dr. Alfred Blumstein, former president of the American 
Society of Criminology, whose work on the crime-drug cycle is cited 
in the Strategy, endorses this approach to certifiable addicts.  
(Of course, the use of heroin by addicts must not violate the 
principle of user accountability discussed below.)

  In considering why some people use and abuse drugs, we must 
address the causes and contributing factors.  One major cause is 
family violence and sexual abuse.  Another co-factor with drug abuse 
is teenage pregnancy.  Public health and family-strengthening 
programs to address those problems are key parts of an anti-drug 
strategy.  To further prevent addiction and overdoses, patients and 
doctors need to know more about prescription drugs and their risks 
and interactions.


   3.  Insist Upon Drug and Alcohol User Accountability and 
                        Responsibility

  People who hurt or endanger others must be held responsible for 
their actions.  Drug or alcohol use is not an excuse for criminal or 
negligent conduct.

  Protection of public safety (e.g. safety on the streets, of 
travelers, medical patients, etc.):  In critical safety situations 
we should require performance tests to detect actual impairment by 
drugs (legal and illegal), alcohol, exhaustion, etc.  Following any 
kind of accident, it is perfectly appropriate to immediately test 
the blood of pilots, engineers, drivers, surgeons, etc. for evidence 
of use of alcohol and drugs -- legal and illegal.  This would be 
appropriate not only for airplane, rail, maritime or motor vehicle 
accidents, but also for medical accidents such as administering 
medications improperly or making mistakes in surgery.  Past use of 
intoxicants identified by urine or hair tests is irrelevant to 
public safety and drug user accountability.

  We must encourage increased professional responsibility and peer 
supervision of professions like medicine, airline piloting, etc. to 
police against on-the-job recklessness such as alcohol or drug use.  
Suspected misconduct that threatens public safety must be 
investigated and prosecuted where criminal recklessness has occurred.

  Criminal conduct:  Drug or alcohol use is not an excuse for 
criminal conduct such as robbery, theft, forgery, etc.  All drug 
addicted offenders and prisoners should get treatment.  But in the 
absence of actual harm or substantial risk of endangering others, 
Americans should not be prosecuted or imprisoned as a means to get 
treatment.

  Convicted predatory criminals such as robbers, rapists, 
assaulters, and burglars should be drug and alcohol-abstinent while 
on probation and parole.  This requires frequent and extensive 
surprise drug and alcohol testing, and a system of consistent 
sanctions for violations.

  Drug and alcohol user licenses:  Drug and alcohol use are 
privileges, and should be subject to licenses which can be revoked 
for misuse.  Some states adopted alcohol use licenses after national 
prohibition was repealed.  Persons who use drugs or alcohol might be 
required to get special liability insurance coverage.  It should not 
be presumed that persons over 21 are responsible alcohol or drug 
users.


  4.  Insist upon vendor accountability and responsibility

  Just like users, vendors of drugs and alcohol need to be held 
responsible for their actions.

  Violence, corruption, product adulteration, tax evasion, and 
antitrust violations by drug, alcohol and tobacco sellers are crimes 
and should be investigated and punished.  Adulteration and 
mislabeling of drugs and alcohol should also be subject to product 
liability civil law remedies.  Vendors must comply with reasonable 
regulations and inspections, pay taxes, and resolve marketplace 
conflicts through the law, not violence.  These provisions are much 
more easily investigated and enforced in a regulated environment 
than under prohibition.

  Convicted criminals can t be licensed to legally sell alcohol now 
-- they shouldn't be allowed to sell other drugs after the repeal of 
prohibition.

  The prohibition against sales to minors of tobacco, alcohol and 
other drugs must be enforced.

  Sales to those who have been denied or deprived of their privilege 
to use alcohol or drugs should be prohibited.  Like alcohol dram-
shop laws, over-the-counter sales of drugs to those who are already 
intoxicated should not be permitted.

  Promotion of alcohol, tobacco and drug use should be severely 
limited.  Advertising that either targets kids or is placed in media 
in which kids have legitimate interest in (e.g. professional and 
amateur athletics, popular music, motion pictures, etc.) should be 
disallowed.


  5.  Maximize the reach of law and respect for the law

  Drug and alcohol buyers should be discouraged from patronizing 
criminals.  For example, growing one's own marijuana is today a 
felony, and growers risk the forfeiture of their homes or land.  
Every marijuana user today (between 9 and 20 million persons) either 
becomes a felon or has to patronize criminals.  Shouldn't home 
cultivation for personal use be encouraged, even under prohibition?  
We should be reducing the commercial opportunities of criminals, not 
expanding them.  Even under prohibition, decriminalizing home 
marijuana cultivation would sharply reduce the tens of billions of 
dollars in annual profits now funding organized crime.

  Almost no police officers or revenue agents are killed or injured 
enforcing the liquor laws.  Marijuana, the most widely consumed 
illegal drug, should be taxed and sold to adults with warning 
messages -- but with prohibition of the promotion we suffer from 
with tobacco and alcohol.  Very few law enforcement officers will be 
killed or injured enforcing a managed, regulated drug trade.

<pre>  6.  Set appropriate priorities and achievable social goals

   Remember that there are no magic solutions to the problems of crime,
violence and drug abuse.  The principal immediate goal should be to
reduce the harms from drug and alcohol use and commerce to a minimum.
We must realistically acknowledge that we are not aiming for the
elimination of these problems, but a dramatic reduction in their
severity.

Reduce the spread of HIV and AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases.

  Make clean needle/used needle exchange programs available to all
populations of injecting drug users.  Use such programs to introduce
injecting drug users to health care, drug abuse treatment, and safer sex
practices.  Public health workers with clean needles need to go into
shooting galleries.  Glass crack pipes that break and cut the lips are
spreading HIV as well.  They need to be replaced in crack houses.
Condoms need to be distributed in crack houses and to prostitutes who
are working the streets and crack houses.  Treatment for STDs that cause
sores such as syphilis, herpes and gonorrhea needs to be made available
to further reduce the risk of HIV transmission.  Perhaps prostitutes
should be licensed and subject to daily and weekly examinations by
public health doctors.

Refocus Domestic Law Enforcement.

  All crimes of violence need to be investigated and prosecuted.
Prosecute crime by traffickers and users, with the highest priority
being violent crime (including domestic violence) and burglary.  Street
crime is generally the responsibility of state and local law enforcement
agencies.  Special squads need to be established and given plentiful
resources to investigate crimes of violence such as street robbery, car
jacking, and house invasion with the same intensity of focus that is now
given to homicide or rape.  We can afford such anti-violence measures
when we stop spending so disproportionately to support the prohibition
strategy.

  Crime Prevention:  Community-oriented policing is an effective way to
make streets safer and prevent crime by involving the community in the
policing effort.  An example is when a local patrol officer gives to
neighbors his or her beeper number to call when a crime is being
committed, not simply an anonymous 911 operator.  Police should
encourage community groups to expand neighborhood watch and citizen
patrol efforts.

  James Q. Wilson in Broken Windows pointed out how the rules of the
street can affect the crime rate.  For example, drunks can sit on a
stoop, but to prevent the climate of disorder that exists when drunks
sprawl on the sidewalk, the police enforce an informal rule that drunks
cannot lie down.  In a similar manner, state and local law enforcement
and prosecutors should concentrate on directing drug trafficking
indoors, off the street and out of residential neighborhoods, commercial
districts during business hours, playgrounds, parks and schools.
Drug-free school zones can be accomplished by sustained enforcement in
and around the schools and by heightened sentencing for sales that take
place at schools as a matter of prosecutorial policy. However, mandatory
minimum sentences are ineffective and unjust.  Enforcement operations
that lure traffickers to school-zones to create longer sentences have
been properly characterized by judges as
 sentencing entrapment  and are unjust and dishonest.

  Corrections:  Corrections policy needs to be reformed.  Repeat,
serious violent offenders need to be incarcerated.  Record keeping must
be accurate to assure that repeat offenders are identified and not
released by mistake.  Records and fingerprint files need to be fully
automated.  Prisons should not be used for simple drug possessors and
users, or for non-violent drug offenders.  Unfortunately, over 20% of
the Federal prison population is now non-violent, first-time drug
offenders.  These offenders should have their sentences commuted to
community supervision.

  Market-place violence:  When drug buyers don t pay the sellers&127;
promptly and in full for the drugs they purchase, there is no legal
recourse.  When drug sellers sell drugs of less than represented purity,
there is no legal recourse.  When one drug seller leaves his employer to
go into business for himself, taking the boss s customers with him,
there is no legal recourse.  Today these examples of normal commercial
problems result in violence because of the prohibition strategy.  Drug
market-related violence will be ended only by legal regulation.

  Drug user violence:  Drug use cannot be an excuse for acts of violence
(see the user accountability principle above).  Those who commit acts of
violence forfeit the privilege of using drugs legally.  Those who commit
crimes under the influence of drugs or to buy drugs must be placed in
drug treatment in connection with the appropriate punishment.

  Some drug user violence is committed in the course of obtaining money
to buy drugs.  Drug addicts often have a great need for money because
they have developed a tolerance and because the drugs are expensive as a
result of prohibition.  (Indeed, before the wholesale failure of our
drug strategy in the 1980s DEA measured its success by the increased
price of illegal drugs.) Some of this crime will be eliminated when
addicts have a legal source of drugs.  (Of course many robbers who use
drugs are simply robbers and must be targeted and treated as robbers).

  Except for alcohol and PCP very little drug user violence is a result
of the mental effects from the ingestion of the drugs.

  A great many drug users are not committing robbery, burglary or other
crimes.  Some want drug treatment, but many drug users do not.  As we
have witnessed in public health campaigns addressing tobacco, alcohol,
and physical fitness, well-designed education and social controls are
very effective over time in changing the self-destructive behaviors of
many persons.

  Anti-crime efforts generally:  Leaving behind the prohibition-based
stereotypes of young men as dope dealers and bad guys will improve
police-community relations in a critical segment of the population.
Replacement of open-air drug markets with carefully- regulated clinics
and other access systems will help make streets safer and allow
residents to feel safe walking in their communities, leading to more
retail businesses that provide more jobs.  Capital will not go to drug
dealers, but will stay in the community.

Strengthen International Law Enforcement.

  The U.S. Justice and Treasury Departments should concentrate on the
highest-level and international traffickers, arms dealers and money
launderers whose violence and corruption is undermining governments and
the global financial system.  These are complex cases requiring the
reassignment of law enforcement agents and prosecutors away from minor
level offenders.  Right now, the majority of the productivity of U.S.
law enforcement is the imprisonment of street-level dealers, bodyguards,
mules and couriers (55.2%), and only a very small fraction are
high-level dealers (11.2%) or international scope traffickers (23.7%).

  The current prohibition strategy has boosted revenues of organized
crime all over the world, increasing their ability to buy weapons, bribe
government officials, take over news media outlets, and corrupt
legitimate business.  The criminals will profit from the opportunities
created by the prohibition-based Strategy much faster than the Strategy
will bring them to justice or confiscate their revenues.

Raise revenue from important economic sectors; reduce the financial
power of criminals and drug, alcohol and tobacco organizations.

  Another goal is to obtain revenue from the commerce in drugs and
alcohol to cover the social costs as much as possible.  Federal alcohol
taxation now raises some $11 billion per year.  Alcohol and tobacco
taxes should be substantially higher, but at rates that do not
substantially increase the problem of cigarette bootlegging.  Excise
taxes, occupational taxes, and user fees on marijuana alone could raise
$10-20 billion yearly for state and Federal governments.  Such taxes
should initially be set at low levels to draw buyers from the criminal
markets, which will help eliminate such markets, but enforcement will
certainly be required.  After the black market infrastructure has
decayed, taxes should be steadily raised to discourage use. 

Expand prevention programs and efforts targeted at youth.

  Experimentation with drugs, alcohol, tobacco and inhalants has
increased in recent years.  Families, communities and schools need to
identify and concentrate prevention efforts on the kids who are at high
risk for becoming seriously involved in drug use.  What is needed is not
simply an anti-drug program, but a comprehensive effort that: (1)
provides counseling around the problems from which drugs are often an
escape;  (2) provides stimulating curricula in schools;  (3) provides
peer group activities that are constructive and safe;  (4) provides
opportunities for athletics, recreation, and socializing across the wide
variety of interests that kids have;  (5) effectively intervenes in
cases of domestic violence;  (6) effectively promotes and supports teen
pregnancy prevention; and (7) promotes non-violent dispute resolution. 

Offer economic alternatives and build effective schools.

  The opportunities of drug trafficking offer enormously tempting routes
to reach the American dream of prosperity.  Ending prohibition will
close off much of the huge underground economy.  Training in the
legitimate tools of entrepreneurship must be offered to our children,
and economic opportunities need to be created to provide real
alternatives to crime for the young.  In addition to an education that
prepares our youth for the workplace of the 21st century, youth must
learn that for them opportunity truly exists. 

  Ending drug prohibition is the key to sharply reducing the violence
and crime that make business investment in inner cities such an
infrequent reality.  The elimination of prohibition-related crime will
draw manufacturing, research and development, retail, and housing into
communities with readily available labor that are already equipped with
the infrastructure of rental buildings, public utilities, and
transportation. 


  7.  Be honest and self-critical

  In September 1994, the Research Triangle Institute (a highly-respected
research institution hired by the National Institute of Justice to study
high school drug abuse prevention programs) reported that D.A.R.E.  --
the largest drug abuse prevention program in the country -- was
ineffective in reducing drug use among teenagers.  The Justice
Department chose not to publish the study, and D.A.R.E.  America
attempted to intimidate the American Journal of Public Health when its
editors decided to publish these important conclusions.  If policymakers
were really concerned that a large percentage of teenagers were truly
becoming much less fearful of cocaine use, they would to take action to
protect children from the inadequacies of drug prevention programs that
receive over $400 million in Federal funds annually. 


  8.  Respect other peoples, other nations and other cultures

  It is pathetic for America to blame other countries for our drug
problems.  Government corruption is a global epidemic that is spread by
drug prohibition, and tragically such corruption exists in many places
in the United States.  America s failed domestic drug policies aggravate
the corruption problems in many other societies. 

  Careful economic research has shown that there is no crop eradication
strategy and no military operation overseas that can substantially
reduce the availability of drugs in the U.S.  The notion that it is more
efficient or more economical to stop drugs at the source has been
conclusively shown to be false.  To deploy military or paramilitary
forces against peasants who grow coca or opium not only wastes money, it
politically strengthens anti- Western, anti-government political
insurgencies.  To incarcerate mules who are at the bottom of the
distribution organizations is a waste of very expensive prison space. 

  Indians in Peru and Bolivia chew coca leaf, and professionals drink
coca tea -- these are harmless practices.  Those practices are the
business of those societies, not ours.  It is silly that coca users in
Peru and Bolivia are international outlaws in violation of the Single
Convention on Narcotics.  Under regulation and genuine control, coca
growing will be less profitable than it is now. 

  U.S. anti-narcotics policy now includes a variety of economic
development schemes for the Andes.  Andean economic development must be
sustainable; it will never succeed dependent on gimmicks, subsidies, or
price supports.  As long as prohibition remains in place, legitimate
economic development can never be an effective anti- narcotics strategy
because the legitimate economy can never be more profitable than
prohibition-induced drug trafficking or cultivation. 

  In our own country, peyote (which contains the entheogenic alkaloid
mescaline) is the sacrament of the Native American Church.  The use of
peyote by members of the church has been protected under Federal law
(but not state law) since 1965.  There is no evidence of a peyote abuse
problem, but Indians and non-Indians are prosecuted for their possession
of peyote.  With the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom
Act Amendments of 1994, Native Americans will no longer be subject to
criminal prosecution and religious persecution by various states for
possession or use of peyote for bona fide traditional ceremonial
purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian
religion.  Spiritual peyote use is no more drug use than sacramental
wine consumed at Communion is drug use, and thus religious peyote use
must be protected.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms
that all people are free to be religious seekers.  Peyote use by
non-Indians is not a social or public health problem.  All Americans
should be free to use peyote in a religious manner, without regard to
their race or parentage. 


  9.  Recognize that drugs are a major commodity in international trade

  Drugs have been a part of international trade since coffee, tea and
spices were introduced to Europe centuries ago.  This trade has never
been stopped by banning it, and it can t be.  Take control of this
enormous trade away from criminals and corrupt customs officials by
regulating it and taxing it. 

  What the world community needs from the U.S. is a substantially
intensified fight against the enormous power of prohibition-based drug
trafficking cartels.  The legitimate elements in Colombia and Mexico,
for example, are continually being subverted by prohibition-financed
corruption.  The U.S. should deploy its largely incorrupt Justice and
Treasury Departments against the highest level drug traffickers, and
after prohibition is ended, continue the fight against other criminal
subversion of legitimate governments and the global economy. 

  Simultaneously, the U.S. should renounce increasing cigarette exports
as a principal objective of U.S. trade policy.  It is not criminal,
simply despicable, to push an addictive and dangerous drug on others. 
Americans, pushing tobacco in Asia, are as contemptible as the British
when they forced China to accept Indian opium in the 19th century. 


  10.  Be creative and flexible to meet our goals

  Through regulation, encourage means of drug administration that are
less harmful and easier to control -- physically, socially, culturally,
and legally.  Be restrictive of more harmful means, or means that are
harder to control.  For example, try to limit smoking of drugs --
nicotine, cocaine, heroin, marijuana -- which gives intense rushes but
which is much more harmful and harder to control than other forms of
ingestion.  Smoking can be discouraged.  Oral ingestion is less intense,
less habit-forming, and less harmful, and perhaps can be encouraged as
an alternative when appropriate. 


  11.  Turn down the volume on drug messages  

  Drugs should neither be promoted, nor hysterically attacked.  Prevent
drug advertising from being aimed at youth, for example, via Spuds
MacKenzie (the dog promoting Budweiser) or Camel cigarette s Joe
Camel/Smooth Character, or in youth- oriented media. 

  Keep anti-drug messages in front of children but keep them reasonable
and truthful.  The This is your brain, This is your brain on drugs, Any
questions?  TV spot featuring a skillet and frying eggs is an example of
a ludicrous anti-drug message.  Its dishonesty and exaggeration invited
contempt.  Some young people asked friends to get stoned by saying,
 Want to fry an egg?  To bombard children with the message that the most
important thing in world is that you shouldn t do drugs inevitably is an
enticement. 

  TV PSAs that show realistic scenarios affirming kids who decline drugs
offered by friends are important.  Anti-drug messages should be
interspersed with appropriate messages regarding safer-sex and pregnancy
prevention practices, staying in school, non- violence, etc.  TV PSAs
should be part of community-wide, integrated anti-drug programs such as
Project STAR, developed with NIDA assistance. 


                               Conclusion

  Whatever we do about drugs, sadly there will continue to be drug use
and drug abuse.  By thinking about drug use as a moral crusade, and
maintaining prohibition and
 zero tolerance, we exempt the drug trade from any regulation and
control.  Prohibition maximizes the violence and disease associated with
drugs.  Prohibition keeps drugs inordinately profitable and continuously
tempts people -- all over the world -- to sell them for easy money. 
This proposed anti-prohibition strategy is not for legalizing drugs for
 legalization s sake -- ending prohibition is simply the recognition
that legal markets are more easily controlled, regulated, and
effectively policed, more humane toward those who are ensnared in the
miseries of drugs, and ultimately cost-effective. 

  Those who propose that the fight against drug abuse can only take
place if there is an enforced consensus and no debate or discussion of
the issues are ignorant of history.  The existence of facts is not
determined by a vote.  Those who believe that only prohibition can
reduce drug use ignore the 44 million Americans who have quit smoking
cigarettes. 

  Those who favor prohibition who refuse to talk with those who
criticize prohibition demonstrate to the world that they lack confidence
in their position.  If those who promote the current strategy were
confident that it was effective, they would welcome debate, not fear the
criticism implicit in the advocacy of legalization. 

  James Burke, the Chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
is concerned that allowing discussion of legalization demotivates the
anti-drug warriors.  That is probably true, but that is not the fault of
the legalizers, it is the fault of the drug war strategy, for the
Strategy is failing and the few successes are insignificant.  If those
in the trenches fighting the drug war believed they were successful,
they would not be
 demotivated by anything said by the relative handful of legalizers.  If
they are demoralized probably it is because, in their hearts, they know
they are not succeeding.  If the chairmen of Ford, Chrysler or General
Motors said that Toyota and BMW should not be allowed to advertise, or
Saabs and Hondas should not be reviewed in Car and Driver because it
demotivated their workers, it would appear they were afraid of the
marketplace and we would consider them unfit to lead their corporations. 

  The American people give the Federal government failing grades in the
fight against drugs and they know that our current strategy is not
working.  But they are tired of being afraid of being robbed or burgled
or shot at, and seeing kids on drugs, and they want changes and positive
results. 

  When Americans are asked if they favor legalization, they dissent
strongly.  What models of legalization have they had the opportunity to
consider? They don t want crack sold in the Safeway or heroin sold like
popcorn.  For good reason they don t want drugs (and alcohol and
tobacco) sold to their kids. 

  But is the only drug policy choice one between the current, failed
approach of prohibition or the pure, unregulated free-market that
actually exists almost nowhere in the American economy?  Is the world of
drug policy somehow uniquely only black or white? The reality is that
there is a middle ground of regulation and control, consistent with
traditional American values and capitalism, that offers us hope of
helping more people, reducing crime and violence, preventing disease,
and protecting individual privacy. 

  The Atlanta Resolution says that legalization is a simplistic
solution, and thus should be rejected.  In reality, legalization is much
less simplistic than prohibition, zero tolerance or just say no.  To
reject all proposals, even the sophisticated ones, without reading them
and critiquing them, is evidence of fear, not confidence in the
correctness of the Strategy of prohibition. 

  To remotivate America to fight drugs requires an effective,
sophisticated, non- prohibition strategy that is free of the hypocrisy,
exaggeration, viciousness, divisiveness and partisanship that has
characterized the war on drugs. 

  What America could use is a good dose of fair and honest discussion
about drug policy.  If we won t talk calmly with each other about one of
our nation s most serious problems, then truly, our democracy is likely
to fail and fade away.

              THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY FOUNDATION
                                  
     A criminal justice system that is honest, fair and effective is
  one of America s most important institutions.  The character of our
  national life depends upon our safety and our liberty which depend 
  upon the integrity and effectiveness of our justice system.  It was
  an awareness of the grave threats to the American criminal justice
  system that inspired Boston-businessman and philanthropist Robert C.
  Linnell to establish The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in 1988.
  The foundation is a non-profit educational tax-exempt charity under
  section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
  
     The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation promotes innovative
  solutions to problems facing the criminal justice system. The 
  foundation assists policy makers, criminal justice professionals,
  and the public to prevent crime and improve the quality of justice
  by disseminating information through education programs,
  publications, and the news media.  The foundation also provides
  advice regarding legal organization, outreach, research, media
  relations, legislation, and coalition building.  The foundation
  provides speakers to all types of organizations. 
  
     The foundation is collaborating with other foundations, the
  National Council on Crime and Delinquency, and the Office of Juvenile
  Justice and Delinquency Prevention, U.S. Department on Justice, in
  sponsoring a National Forum on Youth Violence, May 31 - June 2, 1995. 
  
     The foundation supports the educational work of the National Drug
  Strategy Network (NDSN).  The Network distributes a comprehensive
  monthly newsletter, NewsBriefs and meets periodically in Washington,
  D.C.

<CENTER>DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
* Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times ran a piece noting that the lead story in the next issue of the National Review is going to call for the legalization of drugs. The rationale for this argument is that the war on drugs has failed and that the only solution is to declare defeat and turn the asylum over to the inmates.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I am not sure just what information the folks at the National Review are using, but the facts are flawed and the argument is dumb and irresponsible.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Mr. Buckley, the author of the piece, is safe in making such arguments because he personally does not plan to use drugs. No one of his immediate acquintance is likely to start using dangerous drugs. So the consequences of his advocacy will not be felt personally. Instead, the burden of his ideas will be borne by countless families whose kids -- the most at-risk population -- will fall victim to the consequences of drug abuse. The costs will also be borne by the public purse, as we have to treat the walking wounded.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Although there is no public support for the idea of legalization, and none in the Congress, some of our culture elite -- left and right -- keep raising the idea as if it had some intellectual merit. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I am therefore submitting for the R<SMALL>ECORD</SMALL> a longer statement on the common mistakes made in the legalization argument that I hope will help in closing this latest chapter in foolishness.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>The statement follows:</B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE="1"><B>
<CENTER>STATEMENT BY CHARLES E. GRASSLEY: DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I have been increasingly concerned about the tendency in some quarters to
promote the legalization of drugs in this country. If there is any idea that
is essentially without merit and without public support, it is that this
country should entertain seriously the notion that dangerous drugs should be
legalized and made widely available. Drug legalization is truly an
invitation to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, many in the media and in our cultural elite, who have a
disproportionate access to public communication and opinion outlets, have
once again started to advocate some form of legalization. While this
advocacy is not likely to lead to a major change in public policy, it can
and does have an adverse influence on thinking about the dangers of drug. It
sends a mixed message about the dangers of use that is particularly harmful
when it touches our young people.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
As Bill Bennett and Joe Califano noted recently, drugs are illegal because
they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.
Legalization advocates, however, deploy a variety of arguments on behalf of
their position that ignore this essential fact. They all too often resort to
scare tactics, misrepresent reality, or skip over inconvenient facts. I
think that it is important to set the record straight.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
There are a number of misconceptions about our efforts to deal with the drug
problem. It is important to understand these and the common arguments used
to promote them in order to arrive at a reasoned and reasonable
understanding of what the drug problem is about. One of the first points to
note is that our last drug epidemic--during the 1960s, 1970s, and early
1980s--was the result of arguments made by some that drugs were really not a
problem and that everyone would feel better, live better, and prosper from
the self-administration of dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The claim, made with considerable fervor, was that drugs were liberating and
that only a repressive society would prevent people from achieving their
true potential. By the late 1980s, we finally came to realize just what a
cruel hoax, a big lie, these claims were. We are still trying to cope with
an addict population from that ear, a period that has left us with a legacy
of lives blasted by drug use, a cost that is borne by families and the
public purse. We cannot afford to ignore this lesson, to repeat a disaster
based on the enthusiasms of a few.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10><I>Mistake #1: Prohibition doesn't, can't work. Efforts to keep people from using drugs, like alcohol prohibition, only encourages the idea of forbidden fruit, increases crime, and will always fail.</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The argument that prohibition doesn't work relies on a collective amnesia
about this country's experience with alcohol prohibition between 1920 and
1934. In the first place, Prohibition did not make the use of alcohol
illegal, only its manufacture and sale over a certain strength. It was, in
effect, a control regime legalizing personal use. This effort came at the
end of a very long history
in this country of trying to reduce the consumption of alcohol from
dangerous heights. The modern parallel is with the efforts to reduce tobacco
use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, Prohibition did not lead to a major increase in violent crime, as is
often claimed. The major increase, particularly in violent crime in this
country, came between 1900 and 1910, well before the prohibition movement.
Violent crime remained fairly stable or declined during Prohibition. While
it is true that crime rates decreased after Prohibition this was not the
result of ending Prohibition. Nor did Prohibition create organized crime.
Major organized crime groups existed well before alcohol prohibition and
they prospered after it ended.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, major health problems, such as cirrhosis of the liver and
alcohol-related psychoses, declined sharply during Prohibition. Alcohol
consumption, even though it was not illegal, also declined sharply. It
increased in the years following the repeal of Prohibition, as did the
associated health problems.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Fourth, it is important to remember also that alcohol, unlike dangerous
drugs, had wide social acceptance and a long history of use. Alcohol can
also be used by most people without creating impairment, either temporary or
long term. Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin have no such long history of
popular public use or acceptance, and their use is solely for the purpose of
intoxication. In fact, the public has opposed these substances once they
learned how dangerous and destructive they were. This is also true
historically in this country and internationally. No society today has a
legalization regime for dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In addition, it is clear that control efforts, when reinforced by serious
law enforcement, prevention, and education programs do deter use, especially
among young people. Our own recent experience illustrates how effective we
can be. After decades of increasing use in this country, we reversed the
trend of drug use when, beginning in the mid-1980s, we decided to just say
no and to get serious about doing something. Overall drug use, apart from
addicts, declined by more than 50 percent; cocaine use by 70 percent.
Unfortunately, more recently, as we have moved away from these serious
programs we have seen a return to use in the most at-risk
population--teenagers.<BR>
<BR><CENTER>[Page: S328]</CENTER>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #2: Legalization will mean less crime because the profit motive is removed and we will lock fewer people up when we make our drug laws more
humane</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
First, most prisoners in state and Federal prisons are not there for drug
offenses as their first or major offense. Most offenders are in jail for
violent or repeat offenses. Of these, despite the wildy exaggerated numbers
often cited, only 10 percent of Federal prisoners and 17 percent of state
inmates committed their crimes to obtain drugs. Indeed, research shows that
most career criminals came to drug use after starting their criminal
activities, not before. Legalization will not greatly reduce the crime rate,
especially for violent crimes. Indeed, in so far as the pharmacological
effects of drugs, particularly cocaine and other stimulants, exacerbate
violent tendencies, legalization will produce far greater violent crime
rates as the number of 'legal' addicts soars.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, the vast majority of prisoners serving time from drug offenses are
not there for use but for
trafficking--individuals whose actions destroy lives and menace
neighborhoods.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, legalization will not end black markets for drugs, unless we are
prepared to legalize drug use for all ages down to the age of 6 or 7. Only
the most radical legalization advocates want to see kids using drugs. But to
leave any population out of a legalization regime means leaving a black
market. Crime will not simply disappear nor will the organizations that are
currently trafficking in illegal drugs.

<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #3: Legalization will mean a healthier climate in which controlled
drug use will provide quality control and monitored use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
This argument misses or misrepresents the issue. The issue is not whether we
make drugs, which are inherently dangerous to use, more pure, but whether we
permit their use at all. Britain led the way in trying to treat dangerous
drug use as a therapeutic problem, regulating addicts through doctors' care.
This was not an open drug policy for anyone to use drugs but a policy just
for addicts. The result was a disaster. It did not prevent the spread of
drug abuse. It only made doctors complicit in the act of promoting an
addiction for which they had no cure. In effect, it reversed the normal
doctor-patient relationship, putting doctors in the position of making their
patients worse off. As a result, in Britain, addiction soared, addicts got
worse not better, and the black market flourished. Similar experiences have
visited similar efforts in other countries. Now, it seems that Switzerland
is experimenting with a variation of this approach. The results are likely
to be a similar disaster, making the government and the medical community
complicit in spreading addiction.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
It is also important to keep in mind, that dangerous drugs are not
synonymous with other controlled pharmaceuticals. The latter are controlled
but they also have a therapeutic purpose. Dangerous drugs have no medical
purpose. They are addictive and destructive. To argue that these drugs
should be self-administered with the only control being over their quality
is to argue for a massive increase in the addict population, adding an even
greater burden to an over-taxed health-care system. In effect, the
legalization argument requires society to endorse a self-destructive
behavior and then requires society to provide perpetual care to the victims
at public expense.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #4: Deterrence does not work</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
When you talk to former addicts or those who have given up use, one of the
most important reasons they give for their decision to quit or seek
treatment was the threat of criminal prosecution, the difficulty of
acquiring drugs, and the cost. When drugs are perceived as expensive,
dangerous and wrongful to use, difficult to get, and involve a risk of
criminal prosecution, potential users forego use, and many current users
quit. This remains true even though most enforcement efforts focus not on
users but on violent offenders and drug traffickers.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
No program to prohibit drug use can be universally effective. Although we
have long-standing laws against child abuse or murder or theft, these have
not prevented any of these acts completely. No one doubts their importance,
however, or the role they play in discouraging yet more of these actions
than if they were not prohibited.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #5: Legalizing drugs will remove the `Forbidden Fruit' appeal of
drugs, which leads most new users, especially the young, into use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
If this is a valid argument, then anything that society prohibits for the
general good would succumb to the same argument. Forbidding child abuse
encourages child abuse. Prohibiting murder encourages it. This is the logic
of the argument. In fact, the reverse in the case. We educate people's
understanding of what is rightful or wrongful to do by the laws that we
declare and enforce. Even during Prohibition, when use was legal, the simple
message sent by society that use was bad caused significant drops in use.
Whenever we have enforced our drug laws and backed these up with education
and prevention programs endorsed by our civic and cultural leaders, we have
seen use decline and young people forego use. When we ignore this simple
reality we see kids returning to drug use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unless one contemplates making cocaine and heroin routinely available to
12-18 year olds, something even few legalizers argue, then legalization will
not remove the so-called `Forbidden Fruit' appeal. It will only add the idea
that society condones use while continuing to prohibit access to the most
at-risk population. Just the absence of a clear message on drug use in the
last few years has seen teens returning to use in disturbing numbers. A
legalization message would have devastating results.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #6: Drug use is a purely personal choice. It is a victimless crime. The state has no right to keep people from using drugs</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The idea that an individual who uses drugs does so in some vacuum that
affects no one else is another one of those fictions that obscures the
facts. In the first place, drug users don't stay home. They go to work and
play with the rest of us. They use the highways, they drive the school buses
and trains, they fly the planes. They also encourage others to use, thus
spreading the problem.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
People under the influence of dangerous drugs are more prone to workplace
accidents, are more likely to have highway accidents, are more prone to use
violence in public and family disputes, and are at greater risk for health
care than are non-users. Addicts are far more likely to lose control over
their own lives, and are more in need of public intervention. A considerable
percentage, perhaps as many as 60 percent, of the homeless are drug and
alcohol addicts.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Some 2 percent of live births in this country--over 100,000 babies--are born
addicted with life-long disabilities because their mothers used.
Conservative estimates of the yearly social costs of drug addiction at
current levels run around $70 billion. These costs are borne by families and
the public purse. The number of users and consequently the number of addicts
would soar under a legalization regime, compounding all the problems we
currently have. There is no such thing as a purely private use of drugs
without consequences. There is no known cure for addiction. A choice for
legalization would be a self-inflicted disaster.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #7: Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, and cause far more harm
than dangerous drugs, we should make heroin, cocaine, etc., legal to be
consistent. Doing so would not increase the number of users significantly</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Here is the legalization argument at its most outrageous. What people are
asked to accept is the idea that because we have substances generally
available that already cause major harm--tobacco and alcohol--we should add
dangerous drugs to the occasions for woe for the sake of consistency. What
the argument says is that since we have one major problem we should make it
worse by adding another. Who are we kidding?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In order to rescue this logic from being completely ludicrous, people are
asked to believe a further assertion: that under a legal regime there won't
be an increase in users. Really? Let's look at what we are being asked to
believe. We are going to make drugs cheaper and freely available. We are
going to see them aggressively marketed by the producers. We are going to
have society condone the use of addictive substances. But, we are not going
to see a significant increase in use. Such is our understanding of human
nature?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
We saw what happened with drug use in this country in the 1960s and 1970s
when we allowed the de facto legalization of drugs, condoning personal use
and not enforcing our laws. That partial legal environment caused a dramatic
increase in use. Can anyone doubt the effects if we condoned use outright?
We cannot afford this kind of logic.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
These are by no means the only myths. Others hold that drug laws are
racist--which is another big lie, but even if true it is hardly an argument
for making drugs legal; that the health consequences of personal use are
exaggerated; or that drug laws lead to locking up lot of innocent people. 
None of these arguments can sustain serious attention or thought. Nor is
there any major public support for drug legalization. The argument is
pressed by only a few, some liberal, some conservative. To make the argument
requires, however, suspension of judgment, a willingness to accept
assertions over facts, and a professional absence of mind that ignores
experience.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, while the argument for legalization has little public
support, it is a major agenda item of many of our cultural elites. They have
a disproportionate influence on our public discourse, on our radios and
television, in the movies, in music and the arts. This means they have a
disproportionate influence on the most at-risk population for drug
users--our young people. By helping to obscure the message of the dangers of
drug use, by encouraging it as part of a `liberated' life style, they
contribute directly to use. When our political leaders remain silent they
aid and abet this. The result in the 1960s made the point. Our recent
experience confirms it: When you replace `Just Say No' with `Just Say
Nothing' or `I didn't inhale,' you are opening the door to trouble.

<H2>April 1996
<P>
Dear candidate:</H2>
<P>
<CENTER><H1>Historical Background<BR>
Medical Necessity</H1></CENTER>

<H2>	Over the past 20 years, thirty-seven states have passed legislation
recognizing marijuana's therapeutic value.  Iowa enacted a law allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana in 1979.  See Iowa Code ¤¤ <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(4)(m),
<A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(7) and <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>(7)(a).  To understand the history of this legislation
and the need to amend current state law, a brief review of some national
court decisions is enlightening.
<P>	In 1976, a glaucoma patient by the name of Bob Randall was brought to trial
for growing marijuana plants on the balcony of his apartment in Washington,
D.C.  The court dismissed the charges, ruling that Randall's use of
marijuana was a "medical necessity."  Federal agencies began providing him
with marijuana, and Randall became the first American to receive marijuana
for the treatment of a medical disorder.
<P>	In 1981, a multiple sclerosis patient by the name of Sam Diana was
convicted for possessing marijuana in the state of Washington.  The
Washington Court of Appeals overturned the verdict and returned the case to
the lower court for retrial.  The Appeals Court ruled that "medical
necessity" was a valid defense.  On retrial, the Washington court concluded
that Diana was "not guilty by reason of medical necessity."
<P>	In 1989, a glaucoma patient by the name of Elvy Musikka was brought to
trial for cultivation of marijuana plants.  The court found Musikka not
guilty, ruling that her use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."
<P>	In 1991, a hemophilic patient by the name of Kenneth Jenks was brought to
trial for growing marijuana plants.  Kenneth received AIDS at a hospital
through a blood transfusion and transmitted the disease to his wife before
he knew that he had the disease.  Both Kenneth and Barbara were found guilty
at trial, but the Florida Court of Appeals reversed their convictions,
ruling that their use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."  The Florida
Supreme Court affirmed the reversal of their criminal convictions.
<P>	The federal government is the only legal supplier of medical marijuana in
the United States, and currently supplies marijuana to only 8 medical
patients, two of whom, George McMahon and Barbara Douglass, are Iowans.  In
1991, the federal government decided to stop accepting any new applications,
effectively nullifying all state laws allowing medical use of marijuana.
Without a federal license, no one can use medical marijuana by prescription
in the United States.
<P>	In 1994, Judge Irwin, an Iowa district court judge for Pottawattamie
County,  ruled that "medical necessity" is a recognized defense to
prosecution for possession of marijuana in the state of Iowa.  A copy of
that order is enclosed with this letter.
<P>	Iowa law says that possession of marijuana is legal when used for medicinal
purposes pursuant to rules of the board of pharmacy examiners.  We have
contacted the board of pharmacy examiners and discovered that the only rules
are those contained in the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration
and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
<P>	In 1991, an Iowan with multiple sclerosis by the name of Ladd Huffman was
approval by both the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement
Administration to receive medical marijuana.  However, his prescription was
never filled, because the federal government decided to stop accepting new
applications.  Ladd's application was one of 28 which was approved but was
never honored.
<P>	It is our position that seriously ill people who use marijuana for medicine
should not be arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial.  Seriously ill patients using marijuana as medicine should
be able to have a hearing with the board of pharmacy examiners, or other
qualified board.  If they have a legitimate medical necessity, they should
be certified and exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa.
The Iowa Legislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified
medical marijuana users from prosecution by the state.</H2>

<BR>Dear Sirs,
<DD>As a person running for an office that is responsible for creating legislation that sets the standards and laws for the State of Iowa, I would not feel comfortable trying to second guess any legal decisions handed down by a Supreme Court, be it State or Federal.
<DD>As for my either supporting the enacting of medical necessity legislation pertaining to the medicinal use of marijuana to protect from criminal prosecution, I would have to see the proposed House File before taking a stand one way or another on the matter.
<DD>I, too, like two of the people you cite in your historical background, have Multiple Sclerosis.&nbsp;  To date, I've no need of THC to stem any medical problems that are related to the M.S.&nbsp;  With the advent of genetic engineering, new drugs to fight M.S. are being brought out 
for testing and approval by the FDA on, seemingly, a regular basis.
<DD>I do feel that THC in it's natural form is not needed as a therapeutic substance at this time.&nbsp;  Unless I am proven wrong about my thoughts on this and concerns for the potential for abuse of the substance, I would tend to be disinclined to support any legislation in this regard.
<DD>Thank you.

<BR>Dear Mr. McMahon & Mr. Olsen
<DD>Cancer has not been very kind to my family.&nbsp;  In 1978, my brother died from Hodgkins Disease.&nbsp;  1988 my sister was treated and cured of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and in 1992, my nephew was cured of advanced Hodgkins.&nbsp;  I need to look into the issue of marijuana for medical use because I have seen personally how it could possibly have made chemotherapy
more tolerable to my family.
<DD>I will look at this issue with an open mind and at this time am supportive of your position.

<BR>Dear Carl:
<DD>Thank you for sending me the letter regarding the medical marijuana bill (Senate File 361), as well as a copy the resolution adopted in California last month.
<DD>Whether the current problem is at the federal level (and it appears to be federal), I do have a few concerns about any statutes or resolutions dealing with the medical or therapeutic uses of marijuana.&nbsp;  The chief one is that there continue to be adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to the drug.
<DD>However, in the event that Rep. Miller introduces the resolution, I will discuss the matter with the appropriate committee chair and House leadership.

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Well, good Monday morning to you.&nbsp;
Three minutes after 8 o'clock.&nbsp; Welcome to the show.&nbsp;
Local talk radio on the air here in Waterloo and Cedar Falls and
around eastern Iowa.&nbsp; I hope you had a great weekend and
enjoyed the big win by the UNI men's football team Saturday night.&nbsp;
That was a squeaker.&nbsp; And another squeaker Sunday.&nbsp; The
UNI women's basketball team won by just one point over Iowa
State.&nbsp; So a big upset there for the women.&nbsp;
Congratulations to both teams.&nbsp; Well, this morning on our
local talk show, remember you can always get in on the show by
calling 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479, the topic this morning - the
legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; All
right, we heard about it, it's been in the news because of a recent
decision in California that has allowed that, or paved the way to allow
it.&nbsp; And we're going to talk about that, and also talk about
any movement here in the State of Iowa to do the same type of
thing - legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; And
joining me now on the program first is Ron Corbett.&nbsp; Mr.
Corbett is a Republican from Cedar Rapids, House Speaker.&nbsp;
And Mr. Corbett, welcome to the program this morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Thank you, and good morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Now, you have come out,
even before the session, nothing's really been said.&nbsp; The
session starts what in January?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; January 13, yes. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; So you're about ready to go back to work
then? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, we are. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; That job, anyway. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yep. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Ron, now you've come out before this
session and talked against the legalization of marijuana for
medicinal purposes.&nbsp; Tell me why you've come out and made
that public announcement. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well there's several
reasons.&nbsp; First of all, not just voters in California, but the
voters in Arizona, have passed a referendum on the ballot this
last November, and so we've had this renewed debate as far as marijuana
goes.&nbsp; Now in both those states they were referendums.&nbsp;
There's going to be an attempt in other states that allow
referendums in future elections.&nbsp; Iowa is not a state that
allows for referendums, so the decisions would have to be made by
the state legislature, the Iowa House and the Iowa Senate.&nbsp;
A week ago, Republicans got together and put together their list
of items that we wanted to accomplish next year and we also made
a list of things that we weren't going to take up and this was an
issue that we decided that we did not want to take up.&nbsp;
There is a small lobbying group, an organization for this in the
state of Iowa, but at least from what I understand with the
Arizona and the California that it's such a broad definition
&quot;medical use&quot; that we'd have a real hard time.&nbsp;
Where do you draw the line?&nbsp; I mean, today stress is a medical
term, and so someone feels they're a little stressed out at
work.&nbsp; You know, do they go home?&nbsp; Do they pick up a
bag of marijuana and tell their doctor or primary care giver that
they're stressed out and they need to have this?&nbsp; So, it
isn't something that...&nbsp; You know, people say, well that
would never happen.&nbsp; I mean, it's a pretty broad term and
definition, and so we decided we do not want to tackle this next
year. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Um hum.&nbsp; In your mind, in your
feelings, if the definition could be narrowed down to not
included all people or all medical reasons, is it something at
that point you'd be in favor of? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I still don't think so.&nbsp; I
know, the fact that this notion that marijuana has demonstrated
medical utility has been rejected by the American Medical
Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the American
Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and the
American Cancer Society.&nbsp; So, they've debated this in their
organizations and they felt that there isn't a reason.&nbsp;
There, as far as some of these things with chemotherapy, the nausea,
etc., there are other drugs that have been shown to be more
successful first line therapy drugs for nausea and vomiting
versus marijuana or synthetic THC, which is actually the
ingredient within marijuana that the advocates say is helpful. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Um hum.&nbsp; Apparently, several groups
have okayed the use, or said that it does provide for some
medical usage.&nbsp; There have been the American Bar
Association, and even the Iowa Democratic Party, has come out and
said that it does show that there are some uses for it, even
though some of the groups that you mention don't approve it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; As you know, that's going to be the
case.&nbsp; I mean, people are going to line up on both sides of
the issue.&nbsp; Each side is going to throw out a study.&nbsp;
We can, I can quote different studies from different doctors and colleges
around the country that say there's no evidence for marijuana
usage in areas and I suppose the other side can show us some
studies, too, but it, when you have President Clinton's national
drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, coming out, this is his quote, just when
the nation is trying it's hardest to educate teenagers not to use
drugs, now they're being told that marijuana and other drugs are good.&nbsp;
You know, that they're medicine.&nbsp; That it's okay, and so the
national drug czar, Iowa's drug czar, is against it, and this
whole coalition of, drug-free coalition, D.A.R.E. programs, all
the different programs that we have out there that have recognized
that drugs are bad, and the war on drugs that we've been having,
certainly marijuana's considered a gateway drug to other drugs. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Now, when you mention that the topic won't
come up this year, and that the Republican leaders have met on
this, now, let's explain, that's because the Republican Party
does control the House and Senate in Iowa, and you guys pretty
much set the agenda.&nbsp; Is that not right? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; The Republicans control the
House, we've done that now for three elections cycles, but this
year the Republicans were successful, Republican candidates in
the Senate were successful in getting the majority, so now we
have a Republican majority in both the House and the
Senate.&nbsp; And, of course, Governor Branstad is a Republican,
so this is the first time in fourteen years where the Republicans
have had control of the Legislature.&nbsp; But, even as far as this,
that the medical use, I mean, we still have, in the California
initiative, it allowed for cultivation for growers, it allowed
for possession, even if you're not sick.&nbsp; I mean, you're
going to develop a whole, if you're going to try and create an
additional supply, or additional demand for marijuana, you're
going to have suppliers that are out there.&nbsp; So you're going
to have people now growing and possessing.&nbsp; And just imagine
the field day attorneys can have in court when it comes to our
laws.&nbsp; You know, you can say, well I was just delivering this
bag to a friend of mine who has AIDS and they need to use, they
need to use this to help them out, and so I think, in the court
of law, having these broad definitions, as it relates to the
referendums in Arizona and California, it's going to be a nightmare
in the court system. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Well, how about the people that would use
the drug for medicinal purposes and actually would have a need
for it and who believe that it does help them?&nbsp; What would
you say to them? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I have to give some type of
credibility to some studies that have shown, you know, like, I
don't have AIDS and haven't had cancer, so I haven't had the,
that option before me, but apparently with some of the people
they do feel that it's been helpful to them.&nbsp; But, it isn't
a treatment for the disease.&nbsp; I mean, that's one thing that
has to be clear.&nbsp; It isn't a treatment for the disease, it's
supposedly to relieve some of the pain and suffering, but there
are other drugs.&nbsp; I think you've got two different, you've
got people that actually can benefit from it that are kind of
used, being used as props.&nbsp; I'm not so sure that the people
that have been backing these referendums, this movement around
the country, have a larger goal in mind, the outright
legalization of all drugs.&nbsp; And if you follow the money
trail, in politics there's money, the pro-legalization folks
spent over two million dollars on this referendum, and the anti
folks barely had forty, fifty thousand bucks.&nbsp; And so,
there's a lot of money behind this, the marketing, and so I
certainly feel sorry for any of those people who find themselves
in that position, but I'm not so sure they're not being used as props
for a larger cause. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Well, Mr. Corbett, we're going to hear from
one of those people here in just a bit.&nbsp; And, we're going to
have you stay on the phone.&nbsp; Okay? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Sure. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Rob Corbett of Cedar
Rapids, a Republican and House Speaker of the Iowa House, on his
feelings as to why marijuana shouldn't be legalized in the state
of Iowa for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; And up next, we'll talk to one
of those patients who says it does him good.&nbsp; Stay
tuned.&nbsp; Local talk radio on KCNZ. </p>

<h4 align="center">PART 2</h4>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Welcome back to the program.&nbsp; Jim
Coloff this morning, filling in for Greg Allen.&nbsp; He is ill
today.&nbsp; He'll be back tomorrow morning, but we've got a
great topic this morning, and some good discussion that will be
going on here I imagine.&nbsp; The topic today, the legalization
of marijuana for medical usage.&nbsp; We heard from Mr. Ron
Corbett of Cedar Rapids who is against the issue and he's House
Speaker.&nbsp; They'll probably not be talking about it in the
state Legislature, it sounds like.&nbsp; But, an individual here
in the studio from Waterloo who would probably like to see it
talked about and actually see it passed, Allen Helmers of
Waterloo.&nbsp; Good morning Allen. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Good morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Thanks for coming in this morning.&nbsp;
Now, you are an advocate of medical use of marijuana because you
are a participant in that. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I've been arrested and am
awaiting further court action.&nbsp; I suffer from chronic pain
syndrome and fibromyalgia.&nbsp; The two diseases are not going
to go away.&nbsp; They can only be treated, there's no
cure.&nbsp; Nothing is going to make it go away.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So your doctors have told you that
they've done everything they can and to diminish this pain that
they say they're helpless?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; They keep continuing to use me and other
patients in my position as a chemical experiment, in my view of
it.&nbsp; I just came off of another one last week.&nbsp; I had
to spend a week at home from Thanksgiving 'till last Wednesday,
before I could even leave the house from being so sick from
chemical medication that I was given.&nbsp; That certainly is not
being able to function in this world. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Now how long have you
suffered from this disease? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I've known and been diagnosed with
fibromyalgia since the 1976. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And at what point...? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; 1986. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, 1986.&nbsp; So about ten
years.&nbsp; And at what point did you really start having the greatest
symptoms and the most pain? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; It came on quite a few years before
that, but I had a multiple broken back in 1981 in a semi roll
over accident and it never went away.&nbsp; They couldn't ever
take the pain and I believe that was the onset of it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, the doctors think that's what kind of
brought it on? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; The trauma of that accident. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, it's nothing that you've done
yourself in your life to spur this disease?&nbsp; Some people
would say, well maybe AIDS, people live that lifestyle, but with
you it was an accident, a semi accident. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Right, it was a semi accident.&nbsp; And
then, two and a half years ago, I was ran over by a drunk driver
and broke my leg in twelve or thirteen places, and my bottom
three vertebrae in my back. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, that didn't help at all either? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; And now I've got a leg an inch shorter
than the other and it just turned into a nightmare.&nbsp; I mean
a physical nightmare.&nbsp; I thought was bad before, and it
continues to worsen.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Now, explain to me the pain that you
suffer.&nbsp; You know, I've never had a debilitating disease, so
it might be hard for me to understand the pain, but tell me about
this pain. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Fibromyalgia is a rheumatoid disease of
the muscles and soft tissues, ligaments, tendons.&nbsp; It
travels around the body.&nbsp; It has very many other effects
that, symptoms and things that are with it.&nbsp; A loss of,
dropping things, a loss of concentration, word mix ups, there's a
lot of psychological things.&nbsp; A lot of other physical
problems.&nbsp; You can't stand to be touched.&nbsp; Different clothing
you can't wear.&nbsp; The symptoms go on and on of what is caused
from fibromyalgia.&nbsp; They haven't found a cure, they haven't
found a cause.&nbsp; All they can do is try and make you as comfortable
and lead the most productive life you can, and the only way to do
that is some sort of drugs to ease the pain.&nbsp; There's a
great deal of sleep disturbance with it, which increases the
pain.&nbsp; Any time you overdo physically, you pay for it really
bad the next morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, tell me how marijuana has helped
you, or that it could help you, in being treated or for this
pain, at least to cope with the pain. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; It does help me, it very much takes the
muscle spasms away, which is probably the most debilitating part
of the disease.&nbsp; And then the anxiety, because you're never
sure if your body is going to be there for you or not.&nbsp; So,
people are very anxious that have this disease.&nbsp; They're not
sure if they're going to get through the day, or what.&nbsp; Now,
marijuana, and any other drug, can and are abused.&nbsp; I'm not
talking about drug abuse here, I'm talking about drug use, the use,
what it takes, and you're able to function.&nbsp; Going out and
doing what little I can is certainly better than sitting home and
wasting away.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Allen Helmers, our guest from
Waterloo.&nbsp; An advocate of the medicinal use of
marijuana.&nbsp; And, Rob Corbett also on the line.&nbsp; We're
going to bring him back in this next segment and talk to both
gentlemen, and find out more from Allen Helmers about the,
marijuana actually does work according to some studies.&nbsp; So
stay tuned for that.&nbsp; Local talk radio on KCNZ.&nbsp; We'll
take a break for a CNBC business report. </p>

<h4 align="center">PART 3</h4>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Local talk radio on
the air on KCNZ, your information station.&nbsp; You're going to
have a chance to get in on the discussion, if you'd like
to.&nbsp; We're going to open up the phone lines here in just a
bit.&nbsp; 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479.&nbsp; We're talking about
the medicinal use of marijuana, not for a drug, but maybe for
medicinal usage.&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; We're talking with
Allen Helmers.&nbsp; He suffers from a disease that causes great
pain, and he says marijuana will help him.&nbsp; Is it possible
to have marijuana available to only patients like yourself?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There are currently still eight patients
alive in America on the, there's a compassionate users program,
and that was begun in the '70s.&nbsp; I think there was 15 when
George Bush stopped it in 1992, right before he was voted out of
office, two of which live in Iowa, George McMahon which has, he
has nail patella syndrome, and Barbara Douglass who suffers from multiple
sclerosis.&nbsp; So, we do have two of those patients left in
Iowa.&nbsp; That program is no longer in effect, but the people
still do get marijuana from the federal government and claim to
get excellent results from it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; Now, you mentioned that
there are, for your disease and your condition, you said there
are 300 other people in northeast Iowa? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There is approximately 300 that come to
the support group at Covenant Medical Center from time to time
who are members of it.&nbsp; I'm not saying they all come every month.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, if marijuana was legalized, would all
300 of these people, would it be available to them? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I very much doubt that it would work for
all of them.&nbsp; The problem is, what works for Jane doesn't
work for Allen.&nbsp; What works for Allen doesn't work for
Jane.&nbsp; We found that out through our group discussion that,
there's no way I could say that it would work for everyone.&nbsp;
It does work for me, and I do know several other people who have
claimed results that they have not gotten from chemical drugs or
any other therapy that they hadn't felt in over ten years.&nbsp;
I guess I'm responsible, because they read my article in the
paper and tried it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; Now, how would we know that
someone was being honest?&nbsp; If they said, well the drug is
working, rather than just saying that so they could have more
marijuana legally to smoke? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; That's a problem.&nbsp; Drugs are
abused.&nbsp; Morphine is probably snitched from a grandpa who
has cancer, by the kid, or teenager, or whatever.&nbsp; Any drug
can be abused.&nbsp; The point I'd like to make came out of an
editorial shortly after the election on the 11th of November in the
Des Moines Register.&nbsp; Just one line out of that, outlawing
use of certain drugs for any purpose simply because they are
favorites on the illegal market means we are letting street
criminals dictate our drug policy, while forcing some who suffer
from desperate illnesses to pay the price.&nbsp; I believe that
says most of it right there. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; Mr. Corbett has been
gracious enough to stay on the line with us and allow Mr. Helmers
to have his say.&nbsp; Ron, we're going to bring you back up
now.&nbsp; Mr. Corbett is a Republican from Cedar Rapids.&nbsp;
He's the House Speaker.&nbsp; And a group of Republicans who say they
don't want to see this come up or be enacted in Iowa.&nbsp; Ron,
is it true that we're allowing drug dealers to dictate our
legislation? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, if you want to take that one step
further, if you want to take that editorial one step further,
then just advocate legalizing all drugs then, if that's the case,
because that's what's being done right now on the street.&nbsp;
The problem here is that both sides can argue that there are studies
proving one way or the other.&nbsp; So, rather than saying who's
right and who's wrong on this, let's look at how broad this thing
is.&nbsp; And, it may work for Mr. Helmers.&nbsp; I mean, he just
admitted that it doesn't work for everyone.&nbsp; Well, that's
what the law says.&nbsp; The law says we can't specifically say
only Mr. Helmers can use it, but Mr. Doe can't, because it
doesn't work for him.&nbsp; The laws have to be crafted in a way
they apply to everyone and anyone.&nbsp; So, I mean, these things are
so broad... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; But, there is not a chemical drug that
works for everyone. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I'm just saying that when you
legalize marijuana this first step, you're heading down the
slippery slope.&nbsp; And you're so broad.&nbsp; Where do you
draw the line?&nbsp; Where do you say, well, only for these
people that are... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; We have to draw the line with the
truth.&nbsp; It's time for the truth to be out. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; So, you would want it, you have... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I don't want marijuana on the
street.&nbsp; I want it legalized under medical supervision.&nbsp;
And, I'm not saying that somebody coming in with a sneeze and get
marijuana.&nbsp; That's not right.&nbsp; I'm saying that under a
qualified medical doctor. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, that's how broad these referendums
in California... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, those laws need some tuning.&nbsp;
And the people that wrote them have even admitted that.&nbsp; I
read that in the paper last week also. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And, today, if you look at what
caregiver means, what, you know, people think doctor, they think
of M.D., but that isn't the case.&nbsp; I mean we have a lot of
health care providers and professionals that are recognized as
being that.&nbsp; Whether it's a nurses aid, a chiropractor, a massage
therapist, an M.D.&nbsp; The list is broad, so anyone can be
really classified as a primary caregiver without having the M.D.
behind their name, so that aspect of it, as far as being prescribed.&nbsp;
I just think that between, whether it be prescribed by some
health care professional, or who uses it, it's so broad, the
definition is so, I think you have too much case for abuse.&nbsp;
And, hey, one of the great things about having fifty states is
that some states can try some stuff to see how it works.&nbsp; In
two or three years from now we'll see.&nbsp; We'll have an
ongoing study from Arizona and from California.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There's been many studies already that
for some reason the politicians would wish to discredit or ignore
completely, and Holland has been legal for quite a while and I
guess it's the most pleasant place to be.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; I've never been there.&nbsp; Have you? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; No, but I know many people who go there,
to enjoy absolute freedom.&nbsp; They do treat people with
marijuana over there.&nbsp; The information is there.&nbsp; When
the DEA can block the AMA from scientific studies, because they
will not allow the different grades of marijuana to be imported
into this country, we're letting our police practice the medicine
in this country, and that's not right. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Now, Allen, Mr. Corbett makes the point
that if we legalize it for a few, how can we not allow it to go
to all people, or have people just come in, like you said, with a
little pain and they say they need this marijuana?&nbsp; Now to
be, honestly, have you had anyone come up to you, who they know
that you're in this and that you're fighting for this, have you
had anyone come up to you and say, hey, this is great because if
this is passed maybe I can get some marijuana, too?&nbsp; I don't
need it but, boy, this would kind of open the door.&nbsp; Have
you had anyone pressure you at all? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I've had lost of people say, oh yeah, it
great man, everyone's going to have it then, and that's not what
we're after.&nbsp; We're after doctor's supervision.&nbsp; I wish
that I would have brought my bucket of empty pill bottles.&nbsp;
It's not that they have not tried everything on the shelf pretty
near.&nbsp; That's not the problem.&nbsp; The problem is the
marijuana works where the chemicals are not, and I can't deny
that fact.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, what you're after, Mr. Helmers, is
fine, but the unintended consequences of people coming up and
using it for whatever reason, being picked up for carrying a
commercial quantity of marijuana going into court saying, well,
this is just for medicinal purposes, I'm a supplier, whatever.&nbsp;
I mean, you might as well throw all of our drug enforcement laws
out the window if you're going to start, if you're going to go
down this road.&nbsp; I just don't see how you can do it with the
safeguards.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; How do we continue to use cocaine and
morphine then, through our medical community?&nbsp; I don't
really see the difference, myself. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Tell me how you... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; They're both very abused on the street. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Tell me how you keep this from being
abused by your local reefer head. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Helmers? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; It always has been.&nbsp; Now, how are
you going to stop it? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well,... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I'm telling you that you shouldn't be
locking people up simply because they are chronically and
critically ill. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And those that aren't? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; The reefer head, has he tried all the
different pills, has he went through all these different doctors
and medical treatment?&nbsp; We're talking about oranges and
apples.&nbsp; We're not talking about street people.&nbsp; We're
talking about sick people.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Oh, I know. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Is it legal for street people to carry
morphine around in their pocket right now? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Listen, I know that I will lose the
debate if the people who are in favor of medical use parade
around the chronically ill, the cancer victims, the terminally
ill, the AIDS victims.&nbsp; Everyone has compassion.&nbsp; I
don't want to see anyone suffer, any more than anyone else does.&nbsp;
And so, then if that's the case, and if that's all the debate is
about, is providing some compassion for these people, and the way
to do that is for allowing marijuana, I lose the debate.&nbsp; I'm
fully aware of that.&nbsp; But there are some other extremely
important consequences that come from this.&nbsp; And so, people
are thinking that we're just going to help out these folks that
are chronically ill, and that to help them relieve some of the
pain, I'll lose.&nbsp; But there's more to that.&nbsp; There is
more to it than just that.&nbsp; And, when you start sending
messages that marijuana is a legal drug, is for medicine, then
the next step is what?&nbsp; And the step after that?&nbsp; And,
I just see the slippery slope on this issue.</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Corbett, I'm going to let Allen
answer that, and we've got a caller on the line on hold, so after
this comment from Mr. Helmers we'll take that call. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; The point is, I first tried marijuana in
the Vietnam era and realized what it could do.&nbsp; So when I
was hurt, I understood.&nbsp; And number one, at my age, when I
was first exposed to it, Art Linkletter was on TV telling us how
bad it was and we we're going to jump out windows and this and
that.&nbsp; Number one, we have to stop lying to our
children.&nbsp; Marijuana is not totally bad.&nbsp; It should
not, children should not be using any substances, tobacco,
alcohol or any drugs.&nbsp; And, until we're honest about what
the drugs are, they're going to get into, well, gee, marijuana
isn't anything, maybe crack ain't anything, or maybe this heroin
isn't anything.&nbsp; We've got to be honest right on down the
line. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, if you have a comment, 277-1918 or
1-800-913-9479.&nbsp; M.B is on line one, and M.B. you're on the
air.&nbsp; Welcome to the program. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; Ah yes.&nbsp; I have a question for both
gentlemen, I believe.&nbsp; Both of you seem to be assuming, and
saying even, that this drug, this marijuana, will be given by,
quote, a bunch of different caregivers.&nbsp; Why not handle it
as other dangerous drugs are, by strictly a physician's prescription,
with that physician's number?&nbsp; And, not all physicians can
even write prescriptions for certain scheduled drugs.&nbsp;
Wouldn't that take care of a lot of the problems you two are
talking about? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; That's what we are advocating. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett?&nbsp; Did you hear the
comment? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, and that's what people in
California and Arizona thought they were voting for, and that
wasn't the case.&nbsp; I mean... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; Well, why not, you're a better legislator
than that bunch in California.&nbsp; Surely, you folks in Des
Moines can come up with a straight forward.&nbsp; Why not handle
it like codeine?&nbsp; You can't go down and buy codeine.&nbsp;
You need a prescription.&nbsp; Even for Tylenol and codeine
combined.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; And, they do plan on changing that law
in California.&nbsp; Even the people who wrote that referendum
understand that that was written too broadly. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; You people wouldn't make that mistake in
Des Moines. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, I'd hope not, because Jim... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; Why not give it a shot, and simple say, a
physician, on his medical judgment, signed, sealed and delivered
in a prescription?&nbsp; That takes care of codeine.&nbsp; There
aren't too many cases of opium or codeine running around, for the
reason that you can only get it by prescription from a physician
who can write prescriptions for scheduled drugs.&nbsp; I'll hang
up and listen to you guys. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I'd ask, why has the American
Medical Association, the American Glaucoma Society, the American
Academy of Ophthalmology, and the American Cancer Society passed
resolutions saying that they don't, there's no demonstrated
medical use for marijuana?&nbsp; I mean, here we're arguing
whether we should have it for medicinal purposes or not, but
there are people prior to that debate that say there are no
medicinal purposes. <b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Corbett.&nbsp;
We're going to take a break here, we've got to break.&nbsp; And,
we'll be back.&nbsp; And, when we come back, another caller
called in didn't want to go on the air.&nbsp; But, wanted to ask
Mr. Helmers, and I'll let him think about this during our break,
that if he would support, or, would you support legislation for
crack cocaine, or for heroin?&nbsp; And, he wanted to know where
the line would be drawn.&nbsp; So I'll let you think about that
during the break.&nbsp; And, we'll be back with more on local talk
radio after this.&nbsp; If you'd like to get in on the show,
277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Welcome back to the program.&nbsp; Local
talk radio on KCNZ.&nbsp; Talking about the medicinal uses of
marijuana.&nbsp; Should it be legalized in Iowa?&nbsp; It has
been in Arizona and California.&nbsp; Is this sweeping the
nation?&nbsp; Is it going to be everywhere soon?&nbsp; Well, not
in Iowa probably.&nbsp; It sounds like it won't come up this
year.&nbsp; We've got a caller on the phone.&nbsp; Allen in on
line two, but first off we want to give the other Allen, Allen
Helmers, our guest here in the studio, a chance to answer the
question.&nbsp; A caller called in and wanted to know if he would
support legalization of crack cocaine if it helped make someone
feel better.&nbsp; Or, how about heroin?&nbsp; What if that
helped someone feel better? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Cocaine is already available through
your doctor.&nbsp; Crack cocaine, there's really no medical use
for it, according to any literature that I've ever read.&nbsp;
Yes, I would support heroin, which I do believe is available
through doctors in some states, it was on the Arizona referendum, for
chronically ill people, under a doctor's supervision.&nbsp; I
don't think heroin belongs on the street, as well as any other
drug.&nbsp; It's too easily abused.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; And, Ron, any comment on
that?&nbsp; What if we passed this, and then we have the next
group that want to legalize something else?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, that's the point I've been trying
to make, that all the safeguards that the legislature, whoever,
other legislators around the country can put in, this issue it
just seems to me, at least the way I understand it, and what I've
been able to read about it, that it's way open to abuse and
misuse through the process, with today anything being classified
as a medical use.&nbsp; I mean, so for you to start saying that,
well, only people that have chemotherapy are allowed to use it.&nbsp;
Well, what happens if someone develops carpal tunnel and they
have some extreme pain in their wrist?&nbsp; And then some person
that has it says, well, these drugs aren't working for me, so I
want to use marijuana.&nbsp; And so, I mean, where do you draw
the line on an issue like this?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And, I don't know where you draw the
line.&nbsp; So, rather than trying to guess where to draw the
line, we've elected not to authorize this in Iowa.&nbsp; Let some
of the other states, through their referendum process, it seems to
be the only way they can get it passed, let them try it.&nbsp;
And, in three years from now, we'll have an understanding.&nbsp;
And, in three years from now we'll have some results.&nbsp; Was
it abused, wasn't it abused?&nbsp; All these questions that I've
been asking and we've been bouncing back and forth, maybe we'll
have some more information.&nbsp; So let's hold off for three or
four years and see how it works in some other states. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Do you think that doctors are
over-prescribing morphine and other pain killers for people with
carpal tunnel now? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; I don't know. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, there's the point.&nbsp; I mean,
if the doctor is prescribing the marijuana, that's the whole
point.&nbsp; You must have missed 60 Minutes last night.&nbsp; It
started out with a great article about how America is killing its
sick people because they're afraid to prescribe pain
medication.&nbsp; It was a terrific piece there.&nbsp; I wish you
would have seen it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, I did miss it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, we've got another call on the line
here, and if you want to get in on the discussion, 277-1918 or
1-800-913-9479. And, Allen from Waterloo, thank you for holding Allen.&nbsp;
What's your comment here on the air? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Well, I just wanted to comment on the idea
of when will our legislators understand that prohibition does not
work, it never has worked, and never will work?&nbsp; These
people are going against historical and natural law, and until
they come around to this understanding, that it is honest education
that works to help people out, prohibition will not work.&nbsp;
Since they put a profit into it, drugs will always be out
there.&nbsp; The only way to really get a handle on it is to go
ahead and let the people do what they want to do, but honestly
education them about it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett, do you think this is
prohibition, or just... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, what you're advocating is, what
the caller is advocating is legalization of all drugs then.&nbsp;
Correct? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Caller, are you there? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; I think they should legalize
marijuana.&nbsp; I do believe that they should go ahead and decriminalize
everything else.&nbsp; Yes, honest education is the only way to
do it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Because it doesn't make sense locking a
person with three ounces of marijuana up for five years, and
locking a person who raped a five year old kid up for two.&nbsp;
I don't see what's going on.&nbsp; You guys got to start thinking
about the laws you're writing. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, we do.&nbsp; And... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, that's what's going on. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And you know there's a lot of problems
out there with substance abuse.&nbsp; Allen, you've already
pointed that out.&nbsp; You got hit by a drunk driver. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; And you gave her seven days in jail. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; People will abuse alcohol.&nbsp; They
will abuse other substances.&nbsp; And, they will abuse the right
to use marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; So, I think we've
proven it.&nbsp; They'll be abuses in it.&nbsp; Now, how do you
handle the abuses? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, people abuse food.&nbsp; People
abuse anything there is that can be abused.&nbsp; How do we stop
all the abuse? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Allen, are you still on the phone Allen? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Yes. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, do you think that, you mentioned
legalizing marijuana for all purposes, is that correct?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Yes. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Do you think that if it was legalized for
medicinal purposes you'd have a greater case to make to have it
legalized for all? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; I think it would probably help out,
yes.&nbsp; I mean, obviously, this drug war that we've got now
doesn't work, hasn't, and it won't.&nbsp; So, let's start thinking
of some more positive approaches, instead of this negative idea
of prohibition. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, this could be the first step in your
goal to have it legalized for everyone? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; I mean, well, you also have to look at the
history of things.&nbsp; Like, marijuana basically didn't exist
until in the 1930s.&nbsp; The historical name is hemp.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; And, there's two forms of hemp.&nbsp;
There's an industrial hemp, and there's a medicinal hemp. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Cannabis. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; And when they changed the name in the
Congress, they changed the name to marijuana and made it all
illegal. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Sure. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; What they've done is held back the farmers
from growing the industrial form of hemp also.&nbsp; The Iowa
Farm Bureau has just passed a resolution calling for studies and
research into it for growing it here in Iowa.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Allen, thanks for the call.&nbsp;
Appreciate it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Helmers.&nbsp; We heard from
the caller that this could be the first step to legalizing
marijuana for everyone, and it sounds like he was talking about
letting farmers grow hemp for whatever purpose.&nbsp; Now one of Mr.
Corbett's concerns was that this was kind of the first step to an
explosion here, and drug paraphernalia, drug use.&nbsp; Do you
agree with that? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Ah, no I don't.&nbsp; I think that the
drug use will end up going down over it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; It will go down? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; I really believe so.&nbsp;
And, that's been the way it has gone in the Netherlands and other
European countries who are legalizing.&nbsp; There's a couple
more, Belgium legalized just a while back.&nbsp; It doesn't pay
to put non-violent, peaceful people in prison.&nbsp; Most enlightened
societies are aware of that.&nbsp; And I'd like to get back on
one point that Mr. Corbett made earlier.&nbsp; The people who
backed these resolutions in California and Arizona, the political people,
a few of them were Reagan's ex-secretary of state George Schultz,
former U.S. Senators Barry Goldwater, Allen Cranston, and Dennis DeConcini,
and Nobel economist Milton Friedman, and conservative William Buckley.&nbsp;
The people who bank rolled it, like George Soros, one of America's richest
men, contributed $550,000.&nbsp; Peter Lewis, Cleveland Insurance
tycoon, gave a half a million.&nbsp; John Sperling, president of
Phoenix, chipped in, as did Lawrence Rockefeller, Nelson's
brother.&nbsp; Don't tell me that's a line up of busy minded
pot-head hippies.&nbsp; I mean, the problem is you're trying to
turn it into a Cheech and Chong show. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; No, that's not... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There's a medical need, and people are
being punished in this country.&nbsp; Is the next step for me to
call Dr. Kevorkian?&nbsp; Or, are we going to do like the Nazis
did and load sick people in the back of trucks and run the exhaust
up into them, so when you get them to the hospital you don't got
nothin' to do but bury 'em?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Helmers... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, first of all, I never said
anything about Cheech and Chong or how I've tried to frame this
issue.&nbsp; Now, don't think that I'm trying to make this into a
Cheech and Chong show.&nbsp; I haven't said anything about
that.&nbsp; I've been pretty open with saying there's been
studies on both sides that have showed, yes, there is some
medicinal value, and other studies that have said no.&nbsp; I haven't
tried to make this a partisan issue.&nbsp; I haven't been in any
way... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I didn't say you did.&nbsp; That's the
tones I've been getting out of the media.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Out of the what?&nbsp; Out of the
media?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Yeah. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well,... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; From other politicians. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, you pointed out, that there's, I
didn't say that this was a partisan issue.&nbsp; I know there's
Republicans that want to use it, want to legalize this.&nbsp; And
there's Democrats that do, and there's some on the other side
that don't.&nbsp; President Clinton doesn't think it should be
done.&nbsp; His chief drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, doesn't think
it should be done.&nbsp; Yes, former Senator DeConcini, he
thought it should be.&nbsp; Yeah, there's honest people can have honest
disagreements.&nbsp; And, I haven't criticized anyone for wanting
to push this at all.&nbsp; What I've said is, where do you draw
the line on this slippery slope?&nbsp; How do you prevent the
fraud? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Let's make it... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; In the system? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Put it, reschedule it on the same level
with cocaine, morphine, or any of your other Schedule II drugs. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, we're going to take a call
here.&nbsp; We've had Andy waiting on line one for quite a while
now.&nbsp; 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479.&nbsp; Andy from Waterloo,
you're on the air.&nbsp; How do you feel about this issue? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Well, I agree with that first caller.&nbsp;
I can't understand why this man keeps talking about prohibiting
it.&nbsp; If you're going to, if these people really need marijuana,
and physicians say they do, then they should be able to have
it.&nbsp; But, hey, let's quit fooling around, that's not prohibiting
it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; But, Andy, what about if you were laying
in bed and you said that you needed it, and how can I prove that
you don't?&nbsp; What would happen if that happened? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Well, I have a doctor.&nbsp; And, if he
says I need it, then fine.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; But, don't you think people lie to their
doctors once in a while? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, how do we prevent that? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; You don't prevent liars.&nbsp; I mean, look
at the politicians we got here today. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; (laughter) Well, that's a cheap shot,
Andy. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; What have I lied on? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; You haven't lied to me, sir. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett, go ahead. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; You said, look at the politicians.&nbsp;
What have I lied to you this morning? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; You haven't lied, sir, but Senator Harkin
did a lot of it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, we're getting a little off the
topic now. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; But my feeling is this, that if
you, this is the first caller said, that if the doctors say you
need it, you need it.&nbsp; And just because people lie to the
doctors, that doesn't mean that my statement is wrong.&nbsp; If
the doctors say you need it, and if I need marijuana, fine, if
the doctor says so.&nbsp; That's the only thing.&nbsp; And,
talking about profit, my goodness, look at what the dopers are making
today.&nbsp; The prostitutes, the pushers, out on the
streets.&nbsp; They're making big profits.&nbsp; They're robbing
out homes in order to get that dope money.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Andy, I appreciate your call.&nbsp;
Thanks for chiming in. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Andy from Waterloo.&nbsp; And we
are going to be back, we've got to take a break here for another
CNBC business report, and have more from Ron Corbett, Republican
from Cedar Rapids is the House Speaker, and from Allen Helmers
who's an advocate for the medicinal use of marijuana.&nbsp; More
of the program on local talk radio coming up here on KCNZ.&nbsp;
It's now ten minutes before the hour of ten o'clock.</p>

<p align="center">(part of the tape is missing) </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>RANDY:</b>&nbsp; The chemotherapy and finally died of
cancer.&nbsp; During the last several years, he wanted to address
the nausea problems of chemotherapy with the use of
marijuana.&nbsp; And there were people who offered him marijuana,
but he would not take it, because he only wanted to do it with
the support of a physician.&nbsp; He went to different
physicians, and almost every one of them said that it would help,
and in many cases would help better than the drugs he was being
given.&nbsp; But, they said, I can't help you.&nbsp; You realize
what would happen to me if I did.&nbsp; Through absolute fear of
our lawmakers the physicians were not doing their job with their
patient, even though they knew it was the best road.&nbsp; And,
that's what we're doing by making this thing a criminal
situation.&nbsp; It should be taken out of the class I category
that it's in, and put in just like any other prescribed medication.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Randy, thanks for the call. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>RANDY:</b>&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett?&nbsp; Any response? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I think the gentleman has a good
point.&nbsp; And, if you could just narrow it down to that aspect
of it, there'd be, you'd think it was easy to do.&nbsp; But, just
as there's people that will abuse drugs, you can have physicians.&nbsp;
I mean, it isn't going to be any matter of time where everybody's going
to know the physician that's going to approve it for whatever
reason, and to get the signature.&nbsp; I mean, that word will be
on the street in no time.&nbsp; An, so, it's extremely hard to police,
and it's hard to prevent the abuses from it.&nbsp; So, we have it
in two states.&nbsp; Let's find out how it works in those two
states.&nbsp; Now, they've legalized it.&nbsp; So, we're going to
have some data and information over the next three or four years
on this subject.&nbsp; This certainly isn't going to be the last time
that this issue is going to be debated.&nbsp; It's going to be
debated hotly around the country more and more as more and more
referendums get on ballots, and, so, let's see, let's let other
states, let the other states experiment with it at this point in
time. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; And if it works there, would you be
willing to go along with it in the future? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, the more information you have, I
mean, I've never been a person that's believed that someone
should be locked in stone for whatever reason on their
opinion.&nbsp; If you have more and more information and data
that can provide you, that's provided to you, it helps you in your
decision making process.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I would be foolish
to ever say that, I mean, if my questions and concerns are
answered, and we don't find out in Arizona and in California that marijuana
use goes up among fourteen and fifteen year olds, and there aren't
some of the problems that I say possibly could arise.&nbsp; It's
not just me, but the national drug czar and other people, President
Clinton, say can develop from this.&nbsp; We'll know in a couple
of years.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, and we're going to go back to the
phones, 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479, and, Thomas, you're on
KCNZ.&nbsp; Your comments. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>THOMAS:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; My question is for the
Speaker.&nbsp; Why won't he put it to a vote? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett?&nbsp; I guess, it came
up.&nbsp; Why not? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, there's several things.&nbsp; I'll
just let you know the legislative process.&nbsp; We're only there
for a few months.&nbsp; And, there's two thousand different bills
that are introduced, and there's no way you could bring every
bill on up into committee and up on the floor.&nbsp; You'd be
there all year long.&nbsp; And so we're part time, so... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>THOMAS:</b>&nbsp; Well, it seems pretty simple to me. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; So you pick and choose the issues that
you're going to bring forward.&nbsp; I don't think there's enough
votes for it.&nbsp; So, why go through three, four, five, six
days of debate on an issue like this and then have it be
defeated? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, there's a lot of us voters who
would like to know where you stand on it, for next election. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, you know, (laughter), you know
where I stand. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Would you like some reliable
information?&nbsp; There's a couple pages of full of studies that
have been done which are very easily obtained.&nbsp; I will make
sure you get a list of those studies that were done by scientific people.&nbsp;
The information, the literature is out there. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; I think most of the people that run for
public office will let you know where they stand on this.&nbsp;
You just said locally, a local senator there supports it.&nbsp;
There's a questionnaire that we get on every group and organization
on all their different issues.&nbsp; I remember getting one on
this specific issue.&nbsp; I checked the no box and sent that
back, so I'm certainly not hiding my position, so... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Elaine Szymoniak introduced a bill for
this last year. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Pardon? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Elaine Szymoniak had a bill that she
introduced on this issue. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I understand.&nbsp; And she's a
senator again, and maybe she'll introduce that legislation again. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; I'm not saying that all one hundred
representatives and fifty senators don't oppose this or support
it.&nbsp; There's a difference of opinion.&nbsp; That's the
democracy and the process, but there aren't the votes right now
to pass it in the house. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Ron, last year when that bill came up,
did it come up for discussion last year, or not?&nbsp; Do you
remember what happened to that bill that she introduced? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; It got assigned to committee.&nbsp; It
didn't even come out of committee.&nbsp; There wasn't any public
hearings on it, or anything.&nbsp; It just, whoever was the floor
manager of the bill didn't do anything with it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; We're running out of time
here, and, Mr. Corbett, I need a last comment from you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I think we've had some good
discussions, and this we're going to continue to have, not just
on talk shows, but on editorial pages and continue discussion and
education about these issues.&nbsp; And, I'm not going to act
like I know all the answers.&nbsp; I'll continue to read the
stuff that Mr. Helmers and other people send me, and I hope that
they would also consider the other side.&nbsp; And this is going
to be something that we'll be discussing for quite some time. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Mr. Helmers, about thirty
seconds to wrap it up. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, I think we have to
stop locking up chronically ill people in the name of the drug
war.&nbsp; The cost of this war that the politicians have going
on has risen $15.1 billion in Clinton's 1997 budget.&nbsp; It's
gone too far.&nbsp; It's time that America took a little
difference stance here.&nbsp; When compassion and common sense
are in conflict with the law, then the law is wrong. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Well, we thank you both
for being part of the program and for getting involved. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><strong>COLOFF:</strong>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett, thank you for
being part of the program. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><strong>COLOFF:</strong>&nbsp; That does it for our local show
for today.&nbsp; Thanks for your input.&nbsp; It's about ten o'clock

Re:&nbsp; State of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen Douglass PIN #483567994
Case No. FECR047575 <br>
<br>
To Whom It May Concern <br>
<br>
I am writing to plead for mercy in the case of <a
href="helmers1.html">Allen Helmers</a> listed above. <br>
<br>
How can any of you morally justify your actions when considering
the facts in this case?&nbsp; To send a disabled man to prison
for smoking marijuana for pain (his <a href="verduyn.html">doctor</a>
advises him that it is the best and safest way for him to manage
his pain), and at the same time allowing an uninsured drunk
motorist to go free (7 days in jail and 18 months probation)! <br>
<br>
Seriously ill people who use marijuana as medicine should not be
arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial. Seriously ill patients should have their claims
heard by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners or some other
qualified board.&nbsp; If a seriously ill patient has a legitimate
medical necessity, that patient should be certified and be
exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa. <br>
<br>
Iowa recognizes the defense of &quot;medical necessity&quot; to
prosecution for the possession of marijuana in the state of
Iowa.&nbsp; <a href="../iowa/pleas.html">State of Iowa v. Jan
Pleas</a>, No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16,
1994).&nbsp; Iowa law recognizes the therapeutic value of
marijuana.&nbsp; Iowa Code 124.206(7)(a). <br>
<br>
Please refer to the enclosed documents. <br>
<br>
Thank you. <br>

<CENTER>_________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
    On the 23rd day of May 1994, the State's Motion to Strike

Affirmative Defense came before the Court.  The Court, having

reviewed the pleadings, heard the oral arguents of the parties,

and examined the case law provided, makes the following

findings:

    Defendant claims, in her Notice of Affirmative Defense of

Medical Necessity, that the marijuana found in her residence

during a police search was medically necessary to stabilize the

interocular pressure in her left eye, which has glaucoma.

Defendant further claims that there was a specific threat of

immediate harm, that Defendant did not bring about the

circumstances necessitating the illegal act, that no alternative

drug was effective in minimizing the effects of glaucoma, and

that the harm avoided was greater than the harm caused.

Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of medical

necessity is not a recognized criminal defense in the State of

Iowa, and so should be stricken.

    The Court finds that the necessity defense, by which the

defendant much choose the lesser of two evils, is a recognized

defense in the state of Iowa.  In <U>State v. Walton</U>, the Iowa

Supreme Court stated that the necessity defense is available

only in emergency situations where the threatened harm is

immediate and the threatened disaster imminent.  311 N.W.2d 113,

115 (Iowa 1981).  Additionally, no alternative option must exist

by which the defendant could avoid both evils.  <U>Id</U>.

    Defendant is entitled to attempt to establish the defense of

necessity.  If the trial judge finds that Defendant has

established the required elements of the necessity defense in

the State of Iowa, the judge may then instruct the defense of

necessity.  The Court declines to rule that the defense of

medical necessity does not exist in the State of Iowa.

    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Plaintiff's Motion

to Strike Affirmative Defense is hereby denied.

    DATED this 16th day of June, 1994.

<p>People's Representative, U.S. <a
href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/harkin01.html"> Senator Harkin</a>, I am
a Federal Prisoner at the U.S. Pentitentiary at Lewisburg,
PA.&nbsp; I am serving a 35-year sentence for Conspiracy to
Import and Conspiracy to Possess Marijuana.&nbsp; In 1972 I
visited one of your predecessors to the United States Senate, the
Honorable <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html"> Harold Hughes</a>.&nbsp;
The subject of our discussion at that time was the religious use
and the sacramentality of the herb commonly known as
marijuana.&nbsp; After a brief discussion of approximately one
half hour, the former <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html">
Senator Hughes</a> cancelled his schedule for the following
afternoon and spent that entire afternoon discussing all manner
of subject matter as diverse as the possible spiritual properties
of marijuana and ranging to his possible dark horse candidacy for
the Presidency of the United States.&nbsp; I was accompanied by
two colleagues, Thomas Reilly, who later became known nationally
as <a href="../tropic.html"> Brother Louv</a> - the spokesman for
the <a href="../coptic.html"> Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church</a>,
and Jacob Shnurman who is presently living in Des Moines and
employed in some capacity by the State of Iowa.&nbsp; I mention
this previous encounter simply to indicate to you that I have a
long and storied experience with this controversial herb and I do
possess the credentials of an herb man. However, the purpose of
this letter is not for myself nor is it an attempt to enlighten
you concerning the spiritual properties of this &quot;plant of
renown.&quot;&nbsp; I am writing you at the behest of my good
friend of many years, Carl Olsen, in behalf of a man I do not
know at all, <a href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Allen
D. Helmers</a>. I am sure that you are aware of the plight of <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Mr. Helmers</a>.&nbsp;
He is attempting to petition for relief from the very real pain
which he suffers daily from the physical debility that he
acquired from breaking his back, initially, and, subsequently,
from a traffic accident caused by an alcohol-impaired driver. Is
there no one within the government at any level in these United
States who possesses the human compassion to hear the cry of
these helpless and hopeless folks who are suffering each
day?&nbsp; Isn't there anyone to speak in these legislative halls
of mischief for the souls who claim that their pain is either
relieved or more tolerable when they puff some smoke from a plant
which has been a part of creation long before pharmaceutical
manufacturers or drug enforcement operatives worked their
diabolical sciences and created the propaganda that has maligned
the most beneficial plant on this planet?&nbsp; Is there anyone
who is not brainwashed by this vicious lie about marijuana or who
is not afraid of the ominous repercussions of a federal
bureaucracy that thoroughly intimidates those it purports to
serve? I do not see anyone whose motives have not been
compromised by the political process.&nbsp; Human suffering is
the least of concerns by this juggernaut that has no
feelings.&nbsp; How is it that these people who claim to
represent the people can ignore the sincere cries of medical
relief that arise from thousands of suffering souls who have
risked the fearsome tactics of law enforcement agencies to
medicate themselves and then risk retribution when they are
honest? Lord, how long will thou look on?&nbsp; Let your
conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Everyone is accountable for their
actions. With minimal hope, I remain your brother, <a

The collection of <i>Cannabis </i>hemp germplasm at the Vavilov
Research Institute (VIR) consists of 397 accessions from 3
different eco-geographical groups: Northern, Central and
Southern. Eighty-five collection accessions were sown in
isolation at 4 locations in Russia in 1993 for the purpose of
maintaining the gene pools and replenishing the reserves of seed
for distribution. Sixty accessions yielded from 10 to 2,000 grams
of seed each. The remaining 25 accessions yielded no seeds.<br>

<p> <font size="3"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> The most important project of the International Hemp
Association is a grant of humanitarian aid to the N. I. Vavilov
Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) in St. Petersburg, Russia. The
VIR was founded in 1924 by plant collector and geneticist N.I.
Vavilov (Fig. 1), one of the first scientists to recognize the
importance of plant genetic resources conservation. The institute
is the longest existing seedbank in the world and houses a
priceless collection of over 400,000 seed accessions.</p>

<p>The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR maintains the
largest <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection in the world. Most
of these accessions are either wild landraces or fiber hemp
varieties, and many of them are found in no other gene banks.
Under normal storage conditions, hemp seeds can be kept for about
5 years before losing viability. Maintaining a <i>Cannabis</i>
collection therefore involves reproducing the accessions at least
once every 5 years. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
the funding of the VIR has dramatically decreased, threatening
the maintenance of its collections. If the <i>Cannabis</i>
accessions of the VIR are not reproduced they will surely become
extinct before their true value is ever realized and utilized.
Especially in light of the renewed interest in <i>Cannabis</i>,
it would be very short-sighted to let this collection die.</p>

<p> In 1993 the VIR, with the sole support of the IHA, began a 4
year program to preserve and evaluate its <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm. The collection consists of 397 accessions of <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds from three basic eco-geographical groups: Northern, Middle,
and Southern, collected from 16 nations (Table 1). The collection
represents wild and traditional cultivated varieties as well as
products of plant improvement programs. The vast majority of the
accessions are classified as low-THC chemotypes of <i>Cannabis
sativa</i> L. All of the accessions will be reproduced during the
first three years, and in 1996 the entire collection will be
grown in replicate gardens and each accession will be
characterized.</p>

<pre>Two key requirements must be fulfilled before an accession can
be considered adequately reproduced. The primary goal of a germplasm
preservation project is the conservation of the entire gene pool.
It is very important that the population size is large enough
to ensure that nearly all of the genes within the gene pool are
reproduced in the resultant seed. We have set a minimum limit
of 1,000 plants in each population. This should ensure 99% preservation
of the gene pool. The second goal is to reproduce the accession
in sufficient amounts to distribute seed to researchers worldwide.
We have set a minimum limit of 200 grams of seed for storage and
later reproductions. Two hundred grams is approximately 10,000
seeds and will allow 5,000 seeds to be stored in an active collection
for reproduction and 5,000 seeds to be kept in long-term storage.
Seeds can only be released to the research community if more than
200 grams of seed from each accession are held by the VIR.

This paper reports the results obtained in 1993.

<font size="3"><b>Materials and methods</b></font></pre>

<p> Eighty-five accessions of hemp contained in the germplasm
collection of the Department of Industrial Crops at the VIR were
sown with the purpose of germplasm maintenance, replenishment of
seed stocks for distribution, and installation in long-term
storage. The accessions were planted at 4 VIR Experiment Stations
in Russia (Fig. 2): Pavlovsk (59¡N) near St. Petersburg,
Ekaterinino (53¡N) in Tambov Province, Kuban (44¡N) near
Krasnodar, and Volgograd (48¡N).</p>

<pre>At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station 15 collection accessions belonging
to the Northern and Central groups were sown in isolated plots.
Each plot contained one hemp accession, the distance between the
plots being 3-4 kilometers.  The accessions were sown according
to their ripening period, with early-ripening varieties planted
nearer to late-ripening varieties to avoid stray pollination.

Agrometeorological conditions during 1993 were unfavorable for
the growth and development of hemp. The spring was late and cold.
Air and soil temperatures in May and early June were lower than
average by 4-5 ¡C. Because of this the spring sowing was
delayed by 15 days compared to the average sowing date. The plots
were planted on June 10-13. The seed was sown in densely planted
rows spaced 20 cm apart. The size of the plot varied from 8-12
m<sup>2</sup> depending on the number of seeds available.

The absence of rainfall in late May and strong winds dried out
the soil. The first seedlings appeared 10-12 days after sowing
and continued to appear for several days. During the course of
the whole vegetative period the air temperature was well below
average, while the rainfall was above average. Therefore, the
development of the plants was delayed.

Sowing of the seed and maintenance of the plants in the isolation
plots were performed according to the methods developed by the
Department of Industrial Crops. Maintenance of the plots consisted
of hoeing the soil when needed, thinning the rows where seedling
density was too high, weeding, applying fertilizer, removing male
plants after they finished flowering, covering the female plants
with gauze nets at the time of ripening to protect the seeds from
birds, and harvesting of the seed plants.

The remaining 70 collection accessions of the Central and Southern
eco-geographical groups were sown at the Ekaterinino, Kuban and
Volgograd Experiment Stations. At the former two stations accessions
were sown in isolated plots. At the Volgograd Station isolation
was achieved by using wooden and gauze isolation chambers. In
1993 the agrometeorological conditions there were as described
for the Pavlovsk Station, especially the dry and cold spring.
This caused a delay in sowing, sporadic germination of the seeds,
and poor condition of the seedlings. During the course of the
vegetative period the rainfall was 2-3 times the average for many
years. This also impeded the development of the plants.

<font size="3"><b>Results</b></font></pre>

<p> At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station, complete flowering was
observed in early August. Seed formation occurred in late August
and early September. Frosts arrived in the end of September and
the temperature fell to minus 5 ¡C. These frosts killed the
plants that had not matured and been harvested. Thus out of the
15 collection accessions planted at the Pavlovsk Station, 10
accessions yielded from 10-1,000 grams of mature seed, two
accessions did not ripen, two accessions were stolen, and one
yielded only immature seeds (Table 2).</p>

<pre>Discussion and conclusions</b></font></pre>

<p> In the introduction to this paper we defined two key
requirements which must be fulfilled before an accession can be
considered adequately reproduced: at least 1,000 plants have to
produce a total quantity of at least 200 g of seed.</p>

<pre>Due to poor weather conditions, poor germination, limited space
and theft, only 14 of the 60 accessions reproduced were of sufficient
population size (more than 1,000 plants). Of these 14 accessions
only 10 were reproduced in sufficient quantity to allow distribution
(more than 200 g seed). This means that although 60 of the 85
accessions were reproduced, only 10 were reproduced with sufficient
population size and in sufficient quantity to satisfy our criteria.

Eighty-five <i>Cannabis</i> seed accessions were sown, 60 <i>Cannabis</i>
seed accessions were reproduced, and 10 seed accessions were reproduced
in sufficient quantity for distribution. Although the 1993 <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm reproductions yielded minimal tangible results, we must
remember that this is the first time any <i>Cannabis</i> reproductions
have been attempted during the confusing period since the dissolution
of the Soviet Union. The extensive VIR system for germplasm preservation
has been partly reactivated and the future is now much brighter.
Our limited success is encouraging, considering that this is only
the first year of the VIR/IHA <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm preservation
project. We feel that the project should certainly be continued.
However, persistence and considerable additional financing will
be required to complete the reproduction and evaluation of the
entire <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection of the VIR within
the remaining three years of the project. Only one thing is certain,
we will never succeed if we do not focus our most concerted efforts
on <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm conservation.

<p> In 1994 the VIR and IHA continue their <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm preservation programme. A third partner, the Italian
ENEA Institute is involved as well. A total of more than 100
accessions has been sown on five locations: Pavlovsk, Ekaterinino
and Kuban in Russia, Ustimovka in Ukraine and Bari in Italy.</p>

<pre>In Russia and Ukraine plant emergence and early growth have been slow due to cold spring wheather, but with the advent of higher summer temperatures crop growth has accelerated.

A detailed report on the results obtained in 1994 will be presented in the next issue of this journal.

Due to inflation in Russia, the costs of the project have doubled in 1994 relative to 1993. Donations to help continue this project are very welcome. Persons or organisations donating US $100 or more to the project will receive a VIR memorial medallion and/or pin and/or a copy of the VIR <i>Cannabis sativa</i> descriptor list, a 34 page booklet in English and Russian.</pre>

of fibre hemp (<i>Cannabis sativa</i> L.) on selected soil-borne
pathogens</b>. Journal of the International Hemp Association 1:
6-9.</p>

<p> The effect of the cultivation of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa
L.), cv Kompolti Hibrid TC, on the population dynamics of the
soil-borne pathogens <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (Fungi), <i>Meloidogyne
chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus penetrans</i> (Nematoda) was
studied in greenhouse and field experiments. Fibre hemp
suppressed the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> strongly. A
reduction in population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was also noted.
Removal of stubble of hemp from soil after harvest was found to
inhibit formation of survival structures (microsclerotia) of <i>V.
dahliae</i>.</font> </p>

<hr size="1" width="580" align="Center" noshade>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> Dutch agriculture faces an increasing problem with soil-borne
pathogens (including nematodes) due to intensive growing of a
limited number of crops in short rotations. Government plans to
reduce the use of soil disinfectants by 50 % by the next century
may well aggravate the situation. A possible solution to the
problem is the introduction of new crops in the rotation.</p>

<p> It is generally assumed that long rotations are less
susceptible to soil-borne diseases than short rotations. However,
this assumption may not apply to soil-borne pathogens with a wide
host range (polyphagous pathogens). Several fungi (e.g. <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>) and nematodes (e.g. <i>Pratylenchus</i>
spp. and <i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) have a very large number of
host plants. Introduction of new crops of unknown host status
into a rotation may cause or aggravate problems with these
pathogens. Therefore, the population dynamics of important
polyphagous pathogens on new crops must be assessed before a safe
introduction can be made.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp is one of the potential new crops under
investigation in the Netherlands. Even though hemp is an ancient
crop, there are few reports on soil-borne diseases in this crop
and the general impression is that cultivation of hemp poses few
problems with plant diseases (Termorshuizen 1991). Soil-borne
diseases however often remain undetected due to the inconspicuous
symptoms. Furthermore, the absence of damage in a host plant does
not mean that the pathogen cannot multiply on the host.
Therefore, the population dynamics of some important soil-borne
pathogens on hemp were investigated.</p>

<p> The pathogens selected in this study were the fungus <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and the nematodes <i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus
penetrans</i>. These pathogens are potentially very harmful to
potato, which is the major crop in arable farming in the
Netherlands. <i>V. dahliae</i> is a major factor in the early
dying syndrome in potato, which can lead to severe yield
reduction. This pathogen has extremely persistent survival
structures (microsclerotia), that can endure in soil for over 12
years. Control of this pathogen is therefore very difficult
(Heale 1988).</p>

<p> The Columbian root-knot nematode <i>M. chitwoodi</i> has a
wide host range including many representatives of the <i>Gramineae</i>,
which are commonly used in rotational programmes with potatoes
(Santo et al. 1980). Low population levels of <i>M. chitwoodi</i>
already cause major crop losses of potato because of reduced
tuber quality and heavy infestations can substantially decrease
yields. Tuber infestation by <i>M. chitwoodi</i> causes necrotic
areas and other blemishes, rendering the tuber unsaleable
(Viglierchio 1987).</p>

<p> <i>P. penetrans</i>, the root-lesion nematode, has an
extremely wide host range. This species can cause severe growth
reduction and yield loss in potato production (Mai et al. 1977,
Santo 1989). Furthermore, <i>P. penetrans</i> increases the
effect of <i>V. dahliae</i> in the early dying syndrome of potato
(Kotcon et al. 1985, Rowe et al. 1985).</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Materials and Methods</b></font></p>

<p> The investigations described in this paper were carried out
using the Hungarian fibre hemp cultivar Kompolti Hibrid TC. This
cultivar was chosen for its good agricultural properties and
prior use as a standard in a cluster of research projects on
fibre hemp as an arable crop for paper production in the
Netherlands (&quot;National Hemp Programme&quot;).</p>

<p> The effect of cultivation of fibre hemp on the selected
pathogens was assessed by comparing the population before sowing
and after harvest of the crop. <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and <i>V.
dahliae</i> were studied in field and greenhouse experiments. The
reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on hemp was studied in the
greenhouse only. The effect of fibre hemp on changes in
population of the pathogens was compared with the effect of crops
with known host status.</p>

<p> The greenhouse experiment with <i>V. dahliae</i> was carried
out using a organic sandy soil to which microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i> were added (2,500/ml soil). In 400 ml pots, hemp,
wheat and pea were grown (5 pots per treatment). A control
treatment contained no plants (fallow). Wheat and pea are
resistant and susceptible, respectively, to <i>V. dahliae</i>.
Afterwards, above-ground parts of the plants were removed and the
population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was estimated.</p>

<p> The population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was assessed with a
bioassay, using the potato as test plant. Rooted potato cuttings
were planted in 400 ml pots containing the soil to be tested. The
pots were placed on a greenhouse bench at 19 ¡C and watered
sparingly. At two to three days intervals, the number of leaves
showing wilt symptoms was determined. The disease progress was
monitored until the first potato plants died (60 days after
planting). The cumulative disease score was calculated per plant
and taken as the measure of the soil population of <i>V. dahliae</i>.</p>

<p> Formation of microsclerotia on crop residues of fibre hemp
such as plant tops and stubble was studied in some detail. Since
microsclerotia were very rarely observed on plant parts that were
vital (green) at harvest, the effect of pulling stubble directly
after harvest on the formation of microsclerotia was determined.
In a field infested with <i>V. dahliae</i>, plant tops were
collected and green stubble was removed from the soil after
harvest. Three weeks later, when the stubble had died, another
batch of stubble was collected in the field. On both occasions,
the plant material was left to dry on top of moist soil in a
greenhouse, to simulate drying in the field. Once they were
air-dried, the number of stubbles containing microsclerotia was
assessed.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> on hemp was studied
in a greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse experiment
reproduction of the nematode was determined after 1 generation.
Three week old hemp seedlings were inoculated with 200, 400, 800,
1,600 or 3,200 nematodes (hatched second-stage juveniles) in 400
ml pots in 5 replications. After 1 generation cycle of the
nematodes (7 weeks at 20 ¡C), the number of newly formed eggs on
the roots was determined by the method of Vrain (1977). The
susceptibility of hemp was also tested in the field. On a sandy
soil heavily infested with <i>M. chitwoodi</i> (mean population
1500 eggs+larvae per 100 ml soil) fibre hemp was compared to five
other crops. All crops were grown in 6 x 6 m plots. Before sowing
and after harvest of the plants, the centre of the plot (1 x 1.5
m) was sampled with an auger (100 random samples, in total ± 3
litre soil per plot). The population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> was
determined with an Oostenbrink elutriator ('s Jacob and van
Bezooijen 1984). The experiment was set up as a randomized block
design with 4 replications.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on fibre hemp and,
for comparison, sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) or
fiddleneck (<i>Phacelia tanacetifolia</i> Benth.) was determined
in a greenhouse experiment. <i>P. tanacetifolia</i> and sugar
beet are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to <i>P.
penetrans</i>. The test plants were grown in 400 ml pots
containing potting mixture and coarse river sand (1:2, on volume
base). The plants were inoculated with a nematode suspension or
with nematode-infested oat root pieces. <i>P. penetrans</i>
originated from a greenhouse culture maintained on oats (courtesy
of Mr. van Bezooijen, Agricultural University Wageningen).
Nematodes for inoculum preparation were extracted from oat roots
in a mist chamber ('s Jacob and van Bezooijen 1984). Nematodes
were inoculated in suspension (470 per plant) or in infected
roots (210 per plant). The experiment was stopped at senescence
of the hemp plants, 2 months after inoculation. Nematodes were
extracted from the root system in a mist chamber and from the
soil with an Oostenbrink elutriator. The experiment was carried
out in a completely randomized design on a greenhouse bench at 20
¡C. Per inoculum type, 5 replicates per plant species were
taken.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Results</b></font></p>

<p> -<i>Verticillium dahliae</i><br>
The effect of the plants tested on the resulting disease index of
the potato test plants is shown in Table 1. Fibre hemp gave a
disease index in the bioassay that was not significantly
different from the resistant host plant wheat and the fallow
treatment. The susceptible host plant pea caused a significantly
higher disease index. This experiment was repeated with similar
results.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp sustained a large population of <i>P. penetrans</i>,
not statistically different from that of the susceptible host <i>P.
tanacetifolia</i>. The resistant host sugar beet had a much lower
final population.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

<p> Fibre hemp (cv. Kompolti Hibrid TC) was shown to be resistant
to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <i>M. chitwoodi</i>, but susceptible to <i>P.
penetrans</i>, under experimental conditions. Furthermore, it is
suggested that pulling of the stubble of fibre hemp directly
after harvest will reduce the formation of new microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. However, the experiments were conducted under
greenhouse conditions or in field trials at a single location and
in one year. This can make generalization of the results
precarious. Inclusion of crops of known host status in the
experiments reduces this problem. In this way it is possible to
draw conclusions on the host status of fibre hemp by comparison
with the other species.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp can possibly be used to suppress <i>M. chitwoodi</i>.
In the field experiment strong suppression was found and in the
laboratory experiment reduction of the population of <i>M.
chitwoodi</i> was evident even at very low inoculum levels. This
is an important result, because of the wide host range and the
high damage potential of this nematode.</p>

<p> The population suppression of <i>V. dahliae</i> by hemp was
similar to that on wheat or in the fallow treatment. But
above-ground parts of fibre hemp may contribute to the population
of <i>V. dahliae</i>, if the stubble is allowed to die off
naturally. Pulling the stubble inhibited the formation of
microsclerotia. This measure can further reduce the population of <i>V.
dahliae</i> after the cultivation of fibre hemp.</p>

<p> It seems that fibre hemp is susceptible to <i>P. penetrans</i>.
The results of the greenhouse experiment call for caution in
introducing fibre hemp in the crop rotation at sites where
problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> occur and susceptible crops are
grown. However, since this conclusion is based on greenhouse
experiments only, further studies are necessary to assess the
risks under field conditions.</p>

<p> The host suitability of a large number of hemp cultivars to
the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne hapla</i> was tested by De
Meijer (1993). This author found varying resistance levels,
ranging from highly resistant to moderately susceptible host
quality. The standard cultivar, Kompolti Hibrid TC, had an
average reproduction rate of <i>M. hapla</i>, both in a
laboratory and a field trial. Similar results were obtained by
Kok and Coenen (unpublished results). However, since some sources
of hemp germplasm showed very high levels of resistance (De
Meijer 1993), it should be possible to develop fibre cultivars
with good yield properties and a high resistance level to <i>M.
hapla</i>.</p>

<p> Modern European fibre hemp cultivars are thought to be
relatively closely related. Landraces, ornamental cultivars and
drug varieties however seem to be more distantly related (De
Meijer and van Soest 1992). Therefore, generalization of the
results to the latter types of hemp is precarious.</p>

<p> The results presented indicate that fibre hemp reacts
differently to various soil-borne diseases and that the notion
that fibre hemp will cause no problems with diseases in crop
rotation is not generally justified. Cultivation of fibre hemp is
likely to reduce the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. Problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> however could be
increased by fibre hemp. The results presented here are, however,
more of a qualitative than of a quantitative nature. Long-term
field studies are necessary to accurately assess the quantitative
impact of the cultivation of fibre hemp on soil-borne diseases.</p>

Cannabis is a plant with worldwide distribution, yielding fiber and food, as well as a psychoactive drug. The flowers have been used as a medicine for millennia. Investigation of its major chemical components has revealed their utility for the treatment o
f a wide variety of diseases. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is currently approved as an oral prescription drug for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and for appetite stimulation in cases of the anorexia associated
 with AIDS. However, many patients find that smoking Cannabis offers a superior route of administration and therefore illicitly self-medicate. <P>

<P>

<HR>



<H4>Introduction</H4>



For those not familiar with marijuana and in need of it for medical purposes, the prospect of consuming an illicit drug may seem rather daunting. However, marijuana is used by 20-30 million people in the US and many times that number worldwide, under comp
letely uncontrolled circumstances, with little apparent harm. It is the world's fourth most popular recreational drug behind caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Unlike these latter drugs, Cannabis is not addictive and no one in the several thousand year histo
ry of its use is known to have died from its effects.  The intent of this article is to provide the prospective medical user with an introduction to this drug as a possible therapeutic option. The basics of our subject start with the realization that this
 much-discussed drug, like many of the others we consume, is from a plant with an interesting natural history. <P>



<H4>Cannabis, the plant</H4>



Cannabis is a dioecious annual producing approximately equal numbers of male and female plants. Marijuana comes from the flower-associated bracts of female Cannabis. The male plant is much less useful for this purpose. Almost all of the Cannabis found wor
ldwide is classified as Cannabis sativa. Many taxonomists argue that C. indica and C. ruderalis are also valid species names (Emboden 1974, Schultes et al. 1974) although this remains controversial (Small and Cronquist 1976). However, even accounting for 
these additional species, 95% of the cultivated Cannabis in the world would still be classified as Cannabis sativa.<P>

<P>

As it grows well at low temperatures, Cannabis is well adapted to temperate climates (Van der Werf 1994). Ancient northern Asian and European societies used Cannabis mostly for its fiber and seed. It is also an aggressive weed plant at higher latitudes wo
rldwide. South Asian and African cultures used Cannabis mostly for its drug content, and the frost-free climates allowed more time for development of the psychoactive resin. Intense levels of ambient ultraviolet radiation and of insect predation in the tr
opics may also have contributed to a natural selection for these drug types (Pate 1983). In any case, Cannabis has evolved into two basic races. Plants grown for fiber and seed are universally called "hemp". Cannabis grown for its drug content is commonly
 called "marijuana" or "drug Cannabis". Its female flower bracts are covered with numerous small resin glands containing the pharmacologically active cannabinoids (Fig. 1) that that are unique to this genus.<P>



Most of the psychoactive properties of marijuana can be attributed to its content of a cannabinoid (Fig. 1a) named delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In some literature, it is designated as delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol due merely to a conflict between tw
o methods of naming chemicals, but it is the very same molecule. Modern hemp varieties are nearly devoid of THC and, therefore, cannot be practically diverted into the drug trade. Hemp has been heavily selected for high fiber content, high stalk yield, hi
gh seed yield, and low (<0.3 %) inflorescence THC content (De Meijer et al. 1992). Drug-type Cannabis varies widely in THC content from approximately 1-2% in unselected strains to over 10% in the best modern varieties (Watson 1994). It is not feasible to 
"get high" on hemp, and most marijuana produces very little low-quality fiber. Hemp should never be confused with marijuana, as their roles cannot be reversed.<P>



<H4>Cannabis, the medicine</H4>



Cannabis has been recognized for centuries as a valuable therapeutic agent. Folk uses of Cannabis include treatment of insomnia, inflammation, various psychoses, digestive disorders, depression, rheumatism, migraine, neuralgia, fatigue, constipation, diar
rhea, parasites, appetite disorders and it has also been employed by women to facilitate childbirth, stimulate lactation, and relieve menstrual cramping (Mechoulam 1986). These traditions continue in every region where Cannabis is available. Modern Wester
n Cannabis users also frequently claim relief from many of these same medical complaints. <P>

<P>



Cannabis or THC have been used experimentally to effectively lower the elevated intraocular pressure of glaucoma (Adler and Geller 1986) and have shown potential for the treatment of alcoholism (Rosenburg 1976) and drug dependence (Hine et al. 1975). THC 
has been used as a bronchodilator for the relief of asthma symptoms (Graham 1986) and may also be effectively used as an analgesic for pain relief (Segal 1986). It has even been shown to have antibacterial properties (Van Klingeren and Ten Ham 1976).<P>

<P>

The low toxicity of THC is best indicated by its widespread use with very few reports of anything even approaching an overdose. Occasionally, people may get too "high" for their psychic comfort, but their bodies continue to function fairly normally. The d
osage sufficient to kill half of the organisms tested (LD50) for orally ingested THC is approximately 1 g/kg of body weight. Simply interpreted, this means an average sized human would have to consume 50-100 g of pure THC to reach the LD50 level. Since hi
gh-potency Cannabis contains approximately 10% THC, a person would have to eat at least 500-1,000 g of this marijuana before having a 50% chance of death. A 1 g marijuana cigarette of 10% THC Cannabis contains 100 mg of THC and is usually shared among sev
eral smokers. Clinically effective oral doses for the relief of nausea start at 5-10 mg. This means that, even accounting for pyrolytic decomposition and smoke loss, there is a several-thousandfold difference between an effective dose of THC and a potenti
ally lethal one! For alcohol, this difference is only about twentyfold. Other common non-prescription drugs, such as aspirin, have similar relatively narrow margins of safe use. Research into the actions of the natural cannabinoids led to the creation of 
many artificial ones based on variations of their basic molecular structure. However, none of these artificial compounds are currently approved for medical use in the US. Nabilone proved to be toxic to laboratory test animals and in 1978, human tests were
 suspended, although it is available in Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom as Cesamet¬. Levonathrodal, another synthetic cannabinoid analog, was not approved for use in the US, also following incidents of toxicity in test animals.<P>



Other natural cannabinoids (Fig. 1b-d), such as cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) have been shown to have potential therapeutic value, and can be isolated from both non-psychoactive as well as psychoactive Cannabis varieties,
 Epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, dystonias, and other neurological disorders have been experimentally treated with CBD (Consroe and Snider 1986). CBD has also been shown to relieve anxiety, especially the minor anxiety occasionally associated with the medic
al use of THC (Zuardi et al. 1982). CBC, CBD, and CBG and related analogs have been shown to have anti-microbial action (ElSohly et al. 1982, Van Klingeren and Ten Ham, 1976). These non-psychoactive compounds are generally not restricted by international 
regulations prohibiting Cannabis and THC. <P>



Various delivery systems for these cannabinoids, such as suppositories, time release encapsulation, eye drops, nasal sprays, aerosols, topical ointments, and transdermal patches will eventually become available. Several such cannabinoid delivery systems h
ave already been patented (e.g., ElSohly 1990, Hussain 1984).<P>

<P>

The only cannabinoid medicine currently available in the US is a synthetic THC encapsulated in sesame oil (generically known as "Dronabinol"). It is sold under the trade name Marinol¬ as a Schedule II controlled substance (allowing restricted prescription
, similar to morphine and cocaine) and was afforded a narrow, specific legal exemption from the Schedule I status of other Cannabis products (forbidden from clinical use). It has been accepted and prescribed in the United States since 1985 as an anti-emet
ic to treat the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy (Levitt 1986). Use as an appetite stimulant to correct the weight loss related to anorexia in AIDS patients was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 22, 1992 (Anonymous 1992
). THC is not a cure for cancer or AIDS, but helps to relieve suffering and improve quality of life, perhaps prolonging the lives of those afflicted. THC may also eventually win approval as a general appetite stimulant for anorexia nervosa and other appet
ite disorders.<P>

<P>

Before other cannabinoids or Cannabis can become available to patients in the US, they must be similarly rescheduled. This also applies to the non-psychoactive compounds or even an otherwise identical, but plant-derived THC medicine! On April 29, 1991, th
e UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs decided that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate its therapeutic use. Similar rescheduling in each member count
ry would allow doctors to prescribe it as a medicine and permit easier research. This has already been accomplished in England and Germany. Patients claim there is an acute need to reform the laws concerning other Cannabis products, especially in response
 to the medical plight of thousands of cancer and AIDS patients. If economic incentives could be created by liberalizing outdated anti-Cannabis laws and streamlining new drug registration and testing procedures for AIDS related medicines, several new Cann
abis medicines would appear on the market within the next few years.<P>

<P>

Currently, in the US, the cost of a single dose of Marinol¬ ranges between $4.00 and $8.00 and the average patient cost ranges from $12.00 to $32.00 per day. Since Marinol¬ is expensive, narrowly prescribed and often less effective than crude Cannabis pre
parations, potent sinsemilla-type (seedless) marijuana remains the most viable form of Cannabis medicine, despite the fact that its illegality artificially inflates its cost. Physicians learned as much from their patients and began to publish guidebooks o
n the appropriate medical use of Cannabis (e.g., Roffman 1982), which is most often smoked or consumed in baked goods.<P>

<P>

In some respects, it may be unfortunate that Cannabis has played such a prominent role in the American media's coverage of the counterculture movement since the 1960s. The popularization of Cannabis as the drug of choice increased its exposure to the gene
ral public, but government disinformation promoted the mainstream cultureÍs confusion of it with hard drugs. It has been difficult for even the more knowledgeable patients and practitioners to view Cannabis as a genuine medicine rather than merely a recre
ational drug. Of course, many doctors are also reluctant to suggest Cannabis use because it is illegal. Marinol¬ is too expensive for many patients to afford and orally ingested anti-emetics are of questionable value because their application must be care
fully timed to avoid vomiting the drugs. Many patients who both smoke Cannabis and swallow Marinol¬ report that THC absorbed through the lungs offers more immediate relief, better dose titration, fewer side-effects and shorter duration of action. <P>





<H4>Conclusions</H4>



For millennia, Cannabis has been used as an effective medicine. Modern research has revealed the clear potential for this plant and its cannabinoid products to resume their place in the pharmacopoeia. Further work is urgently needed to determine how Canna
bis can be best utilized as a clinical tool. Meanwhile, cancer and AIDS patients and members of the medical marijuana movement have taken responsibility for their own health and self-medicate without a doctor's prescription. <P>

<H6> A brief review of the history of paper making reveals the important role of hemp in the development of the industry. The technical aspects of classical hemp pulping and paper making and the present status of the hemp pulp and paper industry are discu
ssed. It is shown that for new applications of hemp as a paper making fibre source, new pulp technology is required. This article is the first in a series about hemp pulping and paper making. </H6>

<HR>







<H3>History of paper making</H3>



The use of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) for pulp and paper dates back more than 2,000 years. The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world was discovered by archeologists in 1957 in a tomb near Sian in Shensi province, China (Temple 1986). It is abo
ut 10 cm square and can be dated precisely between the years 140 and 87 BC. This paper and similar bits of paper surviving from the next century are thick, coarse, and uneven in their texture. They are all made of pounded and disintegrated hemp fibres. Pa
per historians agree that the earlier Egyptian papyrus sheets should not be referred to as paper, because the fibre strands are woven and not ñwet-laidî (Hunter 1957). The Chinese paper-making craftsmanship was transferred to Arabic and North-African coun
tries, and from there to Europe. The first European paper making was reported in the first half of the 16th century (Hunter 1957). <P>

Until the early 19th century, the only raw material available for paper making was rags. Rags are worn-out clothes. Since at that time clothing was solely made of hemp and flax (sometimes cotton), almost all paper in history was thus made of hemp and flax
 fibres. With the industrial revolution, the need for paper began to exceed the available rag supply. Although hemp was the most traded commodity in the world up to the 1830Ís (Conrad 1993), the shortage of rags threatened the monopoly for hemp and flax a
s paper-making fibres. This was the major incentive for inventors and industries to develop new processes to use the worldÍs most abundant (and cheap) source of natural fibres: our forests.<P>

Currently, only about 5% of the world's paper is made from annual plants like hemp, flax, cotton, sugarcane bagasse, esparto, wheat straw, reeds, sisal, abaca, banana leaf, ananas and some other more exotic species. The world hemp paper pulp  production i
s now believed to be around 120,000 tons per year (FAO 1991), which is about 0.05 % of the worldÍs annual pulp production volume. Hemp pulps are generally blended with other (wood-) pulps for paper production. There is currently no significant production 
of 100 % true hemp paper.<P>



<H3>Renewed interest in hemp paper</H3>



The recent renewed interest in hemp as a paper-making fibre seems to originate from a strong environmental motive. All primary forests in Europe, and most in North America have been destroyed, amongst others for paper production. Now we accuse the nations
 which still have primary forests of not guarding theirs. <P>

In Europe all trees harvested for paper making were intended for that purpose, so there seems to be no valid reason to switch to a non-wood or ñtree-freeî fibre source. This of course is a little different in the Americas and in Asia and Australia, where 
primary forests are cleared at a huge environmental cost. In these regions hemp has a number of advantages as an alternative source of paper-making fibre. Hemp does not need pesticides or herbicides, and yields three to four times more usable fibre per he
ctare per annum than forests. And last but not least: paper recycling was invented to make up for the mistake of cutting down our primary forests. Technically speaking, one doesnÍt need to recycle hemp paper, because it is a renewable raw material.<P>

One disadvantage of using hemp or other annual plants as fibre source is that the present pulping technology has been optimised for tree-fibre pulping, so some adjustments in the pulping processes need to be made when applying this technology to hemp fibr
es. Before going into technical details, we will first examine the technology of pulp and paper making.<P>





<H3>Pulping and paper making</H3>



Paper making is essentially the rearranging of elementary fibres from whatever source (a tree, a hemp stalk, an old pair of jeans or even a scoop of algae) into a flat thin sheet. <P>

Elementary fibres are the basic building blocks of trees and many plants. The average paper making fibre is about 2 mm long and about 20 micrometers (0.02 mm) thick. All fibres are assembled of chains of cellulose molecules, arranged as a rigid structure.
 These building blocks are glued together with other biological components (lignins, pectins), which give a certain flexibility and strength to the tissue, so that the tree or plant can bend at high stresses, and doesnÍt break in a storm, and is able to c
arry its seeds and fruits. The following explains what is needed to process a fibre source into paper (Smook 1982):



<H4>Pulping (from fibre source to pulp):</H4> 

<UL><LI>cleaning: all non-fibrous components need to be removed from the raw material, and the remaining fibres must be cleaned of dirt, rocks and other contaminants.

<LI> fiberizing: the elementary fibres are taken apart by either chemically removing the glue that holds them together, or mechanically tearing the fibre structure apart. From this step on, the material is referred to as "pulp".

<LI>cutting: especially hemp fibres are too long to give a homogeneous paper sheet, so the fibres have to be cut to the right size. 

<LI>classification: the fibres suitable for use in paper are separated from the ones too short, too long, too wide, too thin, too crooked, too dirty and too old. Fibres can be classified by weight (centrifugal and gravitational processes) and size (variou
s sieving processes).

<LI>bleaching: optionally, the suitable fibres may be bleached to a higher "whiteness". The whiter a sheet, the better the contrast with the ink. Old-style pulp mills use chlorine compounds with hazardous side-effects. Modern pulp mills use oxygen-based b
leaching (compounds like oxygen, ozone and peroxide). Hemp pulp can be bleached with relatively harmless hydrogen peroxide. For some applications bleaching is not required, for instance for packaging paper and board.

<LI>refining: this is a separate process step in which the fibre surfaces are "roughened". The greater surface roughness of a fibre, the better it adheres to other fibres in the paper sheet and the greater the strength of the paper.

</UL>

<H4>Papermaking (from pulp to paper):</H4>

<UL><LI>Dilution: in order to lay the fibres evenly into a homogeneous sheet, the pulp is diluted with large amounts of water (sometimes up to 200 times as much water as fibre pulp).

<LI>Formation: the fibre-water slurry is poured on a fine mesh wire. Most of the water will fall through the wire, leaving the fibres to settle into a flat sheet.

<LI>Drying: in the next steps, the wet sheet is dried by subsequent pressing and steam heating.

<LI>Sheeting: finally, the formed sheet is cut to the required size.</UL>

These processes are essentially the same for manual paper making and for modern paper machines, with the difference that the old paper maker put out one handmade sheet per minute, and the state-of-the-art Fourdrinier newsprint paper machine puts out 15,00
0 square meters a minute: a 10 meter wide sheet at 90 kilometers an hour! <P>





<H3>Remainders of the hemp pulp industry</H3>



Although there are thousands of non-wood paper mills in the world, only a few of them use hemp as a fibre source. At present 23 paper mills use hemp fibre, at an estimated world production volume of 120,000 tons per annum. Most of the mills are located in
 China and India, and produce moderate quality printing and writing paper. Typically, these mills do not really have a fixed source of fibre, but they simply use whatever can be found in the region. About 10 of the mills are located in the western world (
US, UK, France, Spain, eastern Europe, Turkey), and these mills produce so-called specialty papers such as: 

<UL><LI>cigarette paper: even popular American cigarette brands have a 50% hemp cigarette paper and filter. Some countries still have legislation prescribing the use of hemp in cigarette paper, because other fibres (like spruce) generate hazardous fumes w
hen incinerated (!).

<LI>filter paper (for technical and scientific uses)

<LI>coffee filters, tea bags

<LI>specialty non wovens

<LI>insulating papers (for electrical condensators)

<LI>greaseproof papers

<LI>security papers

<LI>various specialty art papers</UL>

These papers can generally only be produced from special fibres like hemp, flax, cotton and other non-wood fibre sources. The average hemp pulp and paper mill produces around 5000 tons per annum. This should be compared to a ñnormalî pulp mill for wood fi
bre, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The only reason the remaining mills can still produce at this extremely small size is that there is a very special use for the pulp. This partly explains the high price for a hemp pulp: about US $25
00 per ton versus about US $400 for a typical bleached wood pulp. The remaining mills in the western world are unable to cope with western environmental regulations because of their small size and archaic technology. Some mills survive by shipping their w
aste water to a large wood pulp mill nearby, others have to close down. There is a clear shift in capacity towards countries that do not as yet take environmental problems very seriously.<P>

One reason for the high price of hemp pulp is the inefficient pulping processes used. Another reason is that hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (most
ly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles, which accounts for a high raw material cost.<P>





<H3>Classical pulping technology</H3>



Most mills predominantly process the long hemp bast fibres, which arrive as bales of cleaned ribbon from preprocessing plants located near the cultivation areas. The bales are opened and fed into a spherical tank, called a digester. Water is added (5 to 1
0 times the fibre weight), together with the cooking chemicals to remove the "glue" components lignin and pectin from the fibres. Most mills use sodium hydroxide and sulphur cocktails.<P>

The fibres are cooked for several hours (sometimes up to eight hours) at elevated temperature and pressure, until all fibres are separated from each other. After cooking, the cooking chemicals and the extracted binding components are separated from the fi
bres by washing with excess water. This is where most of the polluting waste emerges from the process. Often wastes are discharged as such into the local surface water.<P>

The remaining clean fibres are then fed into a Hollander beater, which is best compared to an industrial size bathtub, with a large wheel revolving around a horizontal axis at one point in the tub. The wheel pumps the pulp round and round, and meanwhile c
uts the fibres to the right length, and also gives the fibres the required surface roughness for better bonding capacity. This beating goes on for up to twelve hours per batch. Some mills add bleaching chemicals in this beating process, other mills pass t
he pulp from the beating machines to separate tanks for bleaching. These separate bleaching treatments often use chlorine compounds, which are also discharged into the environment. The bleached pulp is then ready to be pumped to the paper machine, or can 
be pressed to a dryness suitable for transportation to a paper mill elsewhere. The processing time of more than twenty hours make this process very expensive, as the costly equipment and handling must be depreciated over a very low throughput.<P>





<H3>Necessity for new technology</H3>



New applications for hemp as a paper making raw material require a new pulping technology which must be able to use hemp from wet storage. Some new technologies have been developed, albeit in laboratory or on pilot scale. The next item in this series abou
t hemp pulping and papermaking will discuss these new technologies and their benefits.<P>

<html><TITLE>Commercial hemp cultivation in the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries</TITLE>

<body><H1>Commercial hemp cultivation in the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries</H1>



From the late middle ages until the 19th century hemp was grown in the Netherlands for use in the fishing industries. 

Further light has been shed on this interesting subject by a study carried out at Wageningen Agricultural University with financial support from the Historical Research Foundation, which is part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO
). By the end of this year, H. Hoogendoorn will publish the results of this study in his PhD thesis.<P>



The rise of commercial hemp cultivation was associated with an increasing demand for vegetable oils and for fibrous materials. In a sea-faring nation such as the Netherlands, there was a major demand for hemp fibre as the raw material for making ropes, sa

ils and fishing nets. This demand was very large during the 17th century, which for the Dutch was their Golden Century. The herring fleet and the sailcloth industry gave preference to hemp produced in the Netherlands for the manufacture of nets, rigging a
nd cordage, and sails. (The word canvas is, in fact, derived from the Latin word Cannabis) The sail makers required a fine type of fibre and Dutch hemp producers introduced specific processes in order to meet this demand. This commercial chain from raw ma
terial to finished product provided a living for a large number of specialists such as hacklers (who combed the fibres), spinners, weavers and sail canvas manufacturers and represented a significant contribution to the contemporary economy. The Dutch mode
l became an example for the other countries.<P>



Commercial hemp cultivation was a specialty in the western part of the central Netherlands, and required a number of special facilities in the areas of agricultural engineering, hydraulic engineering and commercial management. The hemp farmers grew the cr
op on a small scale using advanced water-supply methods, and largely as a monoculture, therefore necessitating the intensive use of manure. Hemp cultivation was a labour-intensive activity, and the process of "retting", in which the crop was soaked in wat
er in ditches to separate the fibres, led to a high level of environmental pollution.<P>



After the 17th century, developments on both the supply and demand sides led to the gradual decline of hemp cultivation. Dutch maritime activity had passed its zenith, and other fibrous products such as flax, cotton, jute and even silk competed with hemp.
  Moreover, cheaper hemp was imported from eastern Europe. It became increasingly difficult for Dutch hemp farmers to produce at a profit, and they therefore gradually changed over from a combination of hemp growing and cattle rearing to dairy farming. Cu
rrent overproduction in the foodstuffs sector means that agricultural interest is once again being shown in hemp, while new industrial applications for hemp fibres are also being studied.<P>

<H1>The UK hemp project in 1993</H1>

<H4><I>Ian Low,  Director</I></H4>

<H4> Hemcore Ltd. <BR>

Station Road, Felsted, Essex CM6 3HL, United Kingdom</H4>



<HR>

Pulling, retting, grassing, breaking, scutching and hackling were going on in East Anglia in Elizabethan times. There was even a law which enforced hemp growing on pain of a fine. The hemp produced was quite coarse and was used for smocks, sheets, bolster
s, fishing nets and rope. All over the area there are village names to remind us of the long hemp growing tradition such as Hempstead, Heckfield and Bleach Green. So in 1993 when Hemcore was formed by two East Anglian businesses to redevelop the hemp crop
 in the area, we were treading a well-worn path, albeit one that hadn't been walked for 50 years.<P>



The reasoning behind our move into hemp production involved a common mixture of circumstances and opportunities, in detail:

<UL>

<LI><B>Market Openings:</B>

 for the fibre into paper and textiles, for the core of the plant as livestock bedding, for the seed as fishing bait and bird seed.



<LI><B>Growing Opportunities:</B>

 with farmers looking for alternative crops to remove the pressure from over production in most of the main arable crop markets.



<LI><B>Environmental Benefits:</B>

 which were commonly seen as coming from hemp cultivation, both in the growing crop and in the replacement of synthetic or imported products in the market place.

</UL>

<H3>The project</H3>

In 1992 my partner Robert Lukies and myself set up a trials programme covering as many different varieties of hemp as we could obtain. These trials were taken through to harvest at Hatfield Broad Oak in Essex and the resulting plants were trial processed.
 
Following the successful outcome of these trials, a decision was made to go ahead with a commercial venture. An application was made to the British Home Office for a licence to grow 600 ha (1,500 acres) of hemp in 1993. After considerable discussion a lic
ence was granted on February 18, 1993, and our plans went into action for establishing a new U.K. hemp industry. <P>

 In March 1993, Hemcore Ltd. was formed. It is owned by Harlow Agricultural Merchants, a large East Anglian Merchanting Company and Robert Lukies, who farms and runs a seed processing business in Essex. During March and April, 30 growers were chosen and s
ites were approved by the Home Office. 

<P>

<H3>The growing crop</H3>

Drilling took place during the first week of May at approximately 50 kg/ha of seed, drilled 2-3 cm deep on 10-18 cm row widths. We found it important to obtain as fine as possible a seed bed with minimum compaction and used conventional cereal drills for 
sowing. No agricultural chemicals were used in the growing of the crop, but we did find it very responsive to fertilizer. We used fertilizer rates of about 120 kg/ha of nitrogen, 100 kg/ha of phosphate and 160 kg/ha of potash. 
The impressive growth rate of the hemp crop is already well known and our crops certainly lived up to expectations, average heights reached were 3 metres with some up to 3.5 m. Maximum heights were reached in early to mid August. There were noticeable pla
nt losses between establishment and full growth, with final plant populations ending at around 180 per metre square.<P>



In July and August, a number of incidents occurred where people stole cuttings of our contract crops. It is extremely doubtful whether they were rewarded for their troubles, but they were certainly of considerable nuisance value and caused the authorities
 some concern. One particularly troubled crop was harvested in early August to get it out of the way, otherwise harvesting did not begin until September.<P>



<H3>The harvest</H3>

   September and early October were very wet in East Anglia in 1993. This proved a considerable test of our pioneering harvest plans. Whilst we tried different machines and methods, the mainstay of our operation hinged on a modified rape swather and John 
Deere Round Balers. We are particularly grateful to the latter company for their wholehearted support. Although weather conditions delayed a large proportion of the baling until mid October, we were delighted by the condition of the crop, and in the end e
very hectare of every field was cleared. Following such a steep learning curve, we intend to put into practice for the '94 harvest a number of new plans that give us a lot of confidence for the long-term future of hemp production.<P>



<H3>The market</H3>

I will not go into detail on processing, as a large amount of what we are doing is at the prototype stage and all of it is confidential. Suffice to say that we have at the moment two products coming out of the factory, fibre from the stem sheath for paper
 and possibly for the textile trade, and the core of the stem which is going into the livestock bedding market. Both products have created a lot of interest and there seems at the moment to be good demand. <P>



<H3>Summary</H3>

1993 was a year of considerable achievement for Hemcore. The ripples from what we have done have gone round the world. We succeeded in a difficult year to grow and harvest 600 hectares of hemp and we will build on this in 1994. We have continued to do ext
ensive variety and agronomic trials and these too will be extended this year. Processing caused us many more problems than we originally envisaged. Marketing will also present a challenge as the present volumes are only satisfying a small niche market. We
 have made it clear from the outset that Hemcore's philosophy, unlike that of much of the agricultural world, will be to satisfy market leads, not to be output driven.<P>

<TITLE>Hemp or wood: potential substitutes</TITLE><body>
<H1>Hemp or wood: potential substitutes</H1>
<H2>V.S. Krotov</H2>
<H3>The Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute</H3> <H4>18/7 Kutuzovstreet, Kiev 252133, Ukraine</H4>
<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

Three major factors are restraining the development of the pulp and paper industry of Ukraine:

<UL><LI>1. The capital costs for the construction of new production facilities are high, with payback time often exceeding the normative service life of the main process equipment. 

<LI>2. The current obsolete equipment causes environmental problems, as it has a high consumption of raw materials, water and energy and a relatively low yield of finished products. Over 10 % of the raw materials, the pulping chemicals, and almost all bleaching agents are discharged into the environment.

<LI>3. Ukraine is sparsely wooded, and a lack of traditional raw materials hampers the development of its pulp and paper industry. Forests take up only 13.2 % of its territory, and logging covers about one third of its pulp requirements. At the same time, Ukraine's agriculture generates millions of tons of fibrous products: cereal straw, sunflower and corn stems, flax, hemp and others. 
In this paper fibre hemp as a raw material for paper pulp will be compared to poplar.</UL>

<H4>Pulping of non-wood raw materials</H4>

In principle, all fibre-containing by-products can be used for pulping, but their processing in the pulp and paper industry is more expensive than the processing of wood. Agricultural by-products are more bulky and dispersed over larger territories than wood, making their transport and storage more costly. Other factors increasing the costs of pulping of non-wood raw materials using existing technologies are:

<UL><LI>-heterogenous morphology of the raw material containing stems, leaves, spikes, seeds etcetera, and the presence of non-fibrous impurities (e. g. soil),

<LI>-high ash content of raw materials and especially the presence of silicon compounds,

<LI>-lower pulp yield as compared to wood pulping.</UL>

The negative effect of these factors on production and environmental safety can be minimized by additional expenses for the preparation of raw materials, the removal of silicon and the disposal of wastes. However, the extra costs involved would make non-wood pulp more expensive than wood pulp.


<H4>Poplar or hemp?</H4>

The development of a competitive pulp industry in sparsely wooded countries requires:
<UL><LI>1. Setting up plantations of fast-growing plants with a high yield of fibrous raw materials,

<LI>2. The development of a new technology adapted to the specific characteristics of local raw materials, including  agricultural by-products.</UL> 

For the conditions of Ukraine, the choice of plants to be grown on plantations and to be used for pulp and paper is limited to fast-growing poplars or hemp. The technology for growing poplar in short rotation (12 years) plantations has been developed by one of the Ukrainian Research Stations. In the south of Ukraine, Toropogritsky's poplar is recommended for growing. The annual increment of such poplar plantations on irrigation areas of the Kherson Region varies from 20 to 40 m3/ha, depending on fertility, planting pattern and irrigation practice. Taking an average annual increment of 30 m3/ha, and a poplar wood density of 420 kg/m3, we obtain an amount of wood of 12.6 ton per ha per year. A feasibility study for such poplar plantations has shown that the costs of the wood were four to five times higher than those of aspen wood logged and delivered to the Kherson Pulp and Paper Mill from Central European regions of Russia.<P>

Hemp is promising as a raw material for pulp and paper. Southern hemp is most suitable for growing under the conditions of Ukraine, since it is hardy, suffers little damage from pests and diseases, and can be grown in monoculture for many years. At present its yield of dry stems is 8-10 ton/ha in many areas, which is four to five times more than the average annual increment in Ukranian forests and approaches the increment of the most productive plantations of fast growing poplars. <P>

<H4>Perspectives</H4>


The Ukranian Institute of Bast Crops (UIBC) at Glukhov, Sumy Region, has bred hemp cultivars containing practically no psycho-active components. Until the present the hemp selection was aimed at breeding varieties for the textile industry, i.e. the selection work took into account the bast portion of the stem, as well as the content of THC. In the pulp and paper industry, the entire stem can be used. Based on its large experience, the UIBC expects it can breed cultivars yielding 12-14 ton/ha of dry stems. In this case the stem yield is comparable to the wood yield of the best polar hybrids. As opposed to hardwoods such as poplar, hemp can meet all the requirements of the paper industry for short- and long-fibred pulps for practically any paper or board grade.
In 1992, UIBC compared the labour costs of growing and harvesting hemp to those of poplar. Proceeding from the present average yield of 6 ton/ha for hemp and from an annual increment of poplar of 12.6 ton/ha, the costs were comparable. Thus, hemp plantations are more efficient than poplar plantations as a source of raw materials for the pulp and paper industry. However, the advantages of hemp can be realized only if a new technology allowing pulping of the entire stem is developed. Such a technology has been developed at the Ukrainian Pulp and Paper Research Institute. Its basic concepts are summarized in a research proposal (page 28) and will be presented more in detail in a future paper.<HR>

<TITLE>Hemp in Australia</TITLE><body>

<H1>Hemp in Australia</H1>

<HR>





<H2>The Tasmanian Hemp Company</H2>

<H3>In the beginning</H3>

"What happens to those beautiful native forests in Tasmania?" was the question posed in a Dutch living-room in 1988 when we were sharing photographs and experiences. After explaining that a good proportion ended up as woodchips for Japan which we then bought back as paper, a friend said that he had seen something on Dutch TV about hemp for paper. I was brought up as a logger's daughter in Tasmania, and began to feel very angry with myself for not having seen beyond trees for paper.  

So began our long search to track down this curious phenomenon. Our lives are now totally dominated by hemp, despite the warnings of a visiting Dutch Hemp Project leader not to let it do so.



Frits' niece helped us to locate the Dutch university students researching hemp and our knowledge (and Frits' translation skills) began to improve dramatically. Since then, we have visited the Dutch Hemp Project's pulp researchers and the research farm and hosted two of the top researchers for a whirlwind tour here in 1993.<P>



<H3>The Tasmanian hemp story</H3>

Our achievements, apart from notoriety and positive public education throughout Australia, include three annual licensed trials of low-THC hemp supervised by the University of Tasmania. Frits harvested our 1994 trial between a morning rehearsal and evening orchestral concert with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra at the end of March. Our bureaucrats are nervous about the venture, but have not yet put a stop to our endeavours, although they suggest that we should walk before we run. In our opininon we have walked for too long: the world can't wait for sensible solutions and our campaign has broadened from hemp for paper to hemp for just about everything! Tasmanian farmers are most interested and the general public is supportive. The only abusive phone call we ever had was from an elderly ex-employee of one of Australia's pulp and paper manufacturers who claimed the Dutch were "decadent"!<P>

 We set up the Tasmanian Hemp Company to help our negotiations with government and business. We had already founded the Hemp for Paper Consortium Incorporated, a small non-profit community association aiming to spread information on the agricultural, industrial and environmental benefits of a hemp industry. I began by submitting a plan to the Tasmanian Government in February 1991 for an environmentally sound pulp mill based on hemp. This was in answer to a call for expressons of interest in a Northern Tasmanian Pulp and Paper Mill. Frits' translations of Dutch research as well as information gathering since 1988 provided the basis for the submission.<P>

The later establishment of the company was seen as a practical example of promoting an industrial approach to hemp, a lead which the consortium had hoped would be taken up by business people in Tasmania. This did not happen, however, mainly through lack of government interest. Considering the enormous obstacles placed in the way of the Hemp for Paper Consortium Incorporated when lobbying for licences to grow hemp, it is little wonder that others have not wanted to venture in.<P>

Our company is the first importer of hemp fabric to Tasmania. We are sewing this into clothes which we sell, to promote products that could be produced from fibre grown here. Our biggest step will be achieving a commercial licence to grow hemp here in Tasmania, for which we began negotiations with the Tasmanian government officials recently.
It is interesting to note that our licence applications now need to go through the Poppy Advisory Board of Tasmania. Tasmania is the only Australian state which grows opium poppies. The poppy officials are nervous of Tasmania's "clean" image being ruined by the media painting Tasmania as the drug state of Australia, were we also to grow hemp. They insist that the low THC content of our crop will not get in the way of a good story.

<H3>Our objectives</H3>

<UL><LI>Long-term: to develop hemp as a new crop and a sustainable industry which will help overcome Australia's problems of soil degradation, pollution from agricultural chemicals, and controversy over the use of native forests.

<LI>  Short-term:<UL><LI> a) to provide organically grown hemp for export to existing markets, 

<LI>b) to set up separating machinery in Tasmania as a first step to down-streaming, so that companies in Tasmania interested in either the bast or core fibre can be supplied (e.g. to replace expensive, imported Kraft pulp; to provide horse bedding), 

<LI>c) to set up a small integrated pulp/paper/textile/fluff mill in Tasmania.</UL></UL><P>

<H2>Tasmanian trials</H2>



During the 1992/93 growing season, the University of Tasmania at Hobart, carried out field trials together with the Tasmanian Hemp Company to investigate the production potential of fibre hemp in Tasmania.<P>

 The dioecious Hungarian cultivar Kompolti was sown in a replicated field experiment at a rate of 50 kg/ha of seed. Sowing dates were November 2, 16 and 30 and the experimental plots were harvested about 4 months later. All crops emerged rapidly within a week of sowing, and full ground cover was reached soon. Weeds were effectively smothered, so no extra control methods were required. No significant pest or disease damage was observed. Irrespective of sowing time, plants started to form inflorescences in the middle of January, which slowed down vegetative growth in favour of reproductive development. Yields were 8.0, 8.4 and 6.1 ton/ha of stem dry matter. Delta-9-THC content was measured in young leaves and female inflorescences several times during the growing season, and it was always well below the legal limit of 0.3 %. If better adapted (i.e. later flowering) varieties were used, yields of 10 to 12 ton/ha of stem dry matter could probably be obtained in Tasmania.<P>

<H2>Australia, Eucalypts and Hemp</H2>



In many countries around the world, the impact of decades of neglect and thoughtless exploitation of the natural environment is beginning to show. Australia is one such country. Despite much rhetoric to the contrary, it remains that our country continues to suffer severe degradation of the land, air and water due to thoughtless agricultural, forest and water management policies.<P>

Australia enjoyed unparalleled prosperity for decades, based on the production of wool and wheat. The agricultural base has broadened to include sugar cane, many fruits and cotton for domestic consumption and export. The fragile soils of the Australian continent were not suitable for chemical methods of farming, neither were they able to withstand the impact of imported domestic cattle and sheep. Intensive herbicide and pesticide dependent cultivation methods lead to high costs and decreasing returns.<P>

One of the most profound problems has been that of water management. Even though Australia has lush tropical rain forests in the north-east, it is the driest continent on earth. Large scale damming of rivers and sinking bores for irrigation have led to severe salination due to evaporation, concentrating trace amounts of salt present in artesian water. This has been compounded by clearing of tree cover. The most shameful aspect of policy here is to allow the clear-felling of old growth forest to be chipped for Kraft paper.<P>

 The roots of Eucalyptus trees reach deep into the subsoil to extract water. After clearing of trees, the water table rises, bringing buried salt to the surface. In some parts of the inland river system thousands of hectares have been permanently lost to a smothering layer of salt. Excess phosphates from chemical fertilizers have entered the waterways. With flow rates seriously reduced by irrigation, the protective flushing effect is lost and there have been several outbreaks of toxic blue green algae.<P>

Fortunately, there have been small improvements. Forward thinking people have formed a "land care" organization to plant trees and practice more sustainable farming. There is a growing movement in Australia to introduce fibre hemp for the production of fabric and paper, as well as developing a ligno-cellulosic ethanol fuel industry. Despite recent developments in Europe and England, where fibre hemp cultivation under licence is in progress, little cultivation is taking place. The legislative power to regulate hemp is held by each state government. Modest progress has been made in Tasmania by the "Hemp for Paper" Consortium.
In New South Wales, the most populous state with the most suitable agricultural land and climate, there has been a complete refusal by the authorities to allow fibre hemp trials, despite the support of Universities, agricultural firms and farmers. Economic projections have indicated that hemp will be a highly profitable crop, provided we can convince the government to follow the United Nations policy on fibre hemp and permit industrial scale trials.<P>

<H1>Paper from Dutch hemp?</H1>


<H3>Hayo M. G. van der Werf</H3>
<H4>International Hemp Association, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands</H4>
<HR>
From January 1990 until December 1993, a total of 12 research institutes in the Netherlands spent Dfl 17 million (US $9 million) on a hemp research programme. The objective of this programme was to establish whether fibre hemp can be of economic interest to farmers and to the pulp and paper industry in the Netherlands. The major research disciplines within the programme were: plant breeding, crop physiology, plant pathology, harvest and storage technology, pulp technology, and economics and market research. This research yielded a large amount of factual information, which was recently summarized in two reports in Dutch (Bakker et al. 1993, Van Berlo 1993).<P>

Several researchers who were involved in the Hemp Research Programme will contribute papers on the results they obtained in their field to this and following issues of this Journal. One of the major results of the programme: a business concept, outlining the required specifications for a viable hemp-paper business to be set up in the Netherlands, is summarized in this article (Van Berlo 1993).  
<HR>
<H3>The business concept</H3>
<H4>Pulp markets</H4>
Market research  has shown that both high-value and low-value markets are relevant for fibre hemp grown in the Netherlands. High-value pulp markets consist of applications in Light-Weight Coated paper (LWC), sanitary papers and tissues, and 'fluff', which is used in the production of diapers. In the Netherlands, the size of each of these three markets is about 10,000 ton/year. Low-value pulp markets consist of applications in the production of massive and corrugated cardboard. In the Netherlands, the market for hemp pulp for cardboard production is about 160,000 ton/year. Pulp quality specifications, such as whiteness and purity, are lower for low-value markets than for high-value markets.<P>
The high-value market is the eventual major objective, but initially pulp will be made for the low-value cardboard market, because it does not require top quality specifications. Pulp technology will be gradually optimised, and pulp production for high-value markets will then be possible. First the LWC market will be approached, and finally the sanitary paper, tissue and fluff markets. The low-value market will continue to be served, as the high-value market probably can not absorb all the pulp produced.
Initially, when pulp is produced for low-value markets only, a market price of Dfl 600/ton of pulp is expected. After several years, when pulp will be produced for both high- and low-value markets, a price of Dfl 1,000/ton is possible. <P>

<H4>Hemp production</H4>
A hemp-growers cooperative should be set up by arable farmers in the north-east of the Netherlands. In the first year, the members of this cooperative will grow 2,500 hectares (1 hectare or ha = 2.47 acres) of fibre hemp. Over a period of 6 to 7 years, this area will expand to 11,000 ha and the cooperative will consist of a total of 1,000 to 1,100 farmers. In the crop rotation, hemp will replace cereals. Initially a yield of 10 ton/ha of stem dry matter is expected. After 5 years, improved cultivars will be available and an average stem yield of 12 ton/ha is expected. Initially farmers will get Dfl 130/ton of stem dry matter, this price will increase to Dfl 180/ton as pulp production is geared more to high-value pulp markets. In addition, the European Union (EU) supplies a Dfl 1,700/ha subsidy to hemp growers. The crop is harvested in September by contractors who will use modified silage maize harvesters. The crop is ensiled on the farm and sodium hydroxide is added to the chopped stems for preservation.<P>

Provided the EU maintains its Dfl 1,700/ha subsidy, and if a an average yield of 12 ton/ha at a price of Dfl 180/ton is obtained five years after the start of the project, the farmer's gross margin (financial yield minus direct costs) will be Dfl 2,343/ha. This is more than the gross margin of wheat and less than that of potato.<P>

<H4>Pulp production</H4>
The pulp factory will be set up stepwise. It will start at a production capacity of 20,000 ton/year of pulp. Ensiled hemp will be brought from the farms to the factory and separated into bark and core using a flotation system. Both fractions will be pulped using chemo-mechanical pulp technology. The resulting pulp will meet the requirements of the low-value market. At this scale, pulp technology and waste water treatment technology will be further optimised. 
The size of the factory will then be increased to 40,000 and finally to 90,000 ton/year by adding parallel chemo-mechanical pulp lines. As the pulping process will be more sophisticated, pulps for the high-value markets will be produced. A total investment of Dfl 127 million would be required for a pulp factory producing 90,000 ton/year for both high- and low-value markets.

<H4>Financing</H4>
In order to be economically feasible, the pulp factory should reach a capacity of at least 40,000 ton/year. This would require an investment of Dfl 57 million. Three sources could contribute to this investment:
<UL><LI>a) Shares. Shares are owned by the hemp growers (Dfl 500/ha), other farmer cooperatives, banks and paper factories. Shares should finance 50 % of the total investment.
<LI>b) Subsidies. Subsidies from several sources should supply 25 % of the total investment.
<LI>c) Low-interest loans. These should be supplied by national and regional governments, and make up the remaining 25 % of the total investment.
Based on this financial structure and on the other assumptions outlined above, the shares would yield a return on investment of 16 % with a pay back time of 4.8 years. </UL>

<H4>Feasibility of the business concept
</H4>
A committee, consisting of representatives of farmers, the paper industry, farmers cooperatives and of the provincial and national government, was asked to give its advice on the business plan. This committee concluded that some of the assumptions the business plan relies on are uncertain, which make it impossible to decide on its feasibility. The committee recommends further research to resolve the uncertainties. This research should include setting up a pilot plant producing 1,000-5,000 ton/year of pulp, and growing the hemp required to supply the pilot plant. The pilot plant would allow improvement of the pulp technology and a better estimate of the costs involved. This additional research would take about 2 years and cost Dfl 8-10 million. Currently, funding for this pilot research is being solicited from the paper industry and the national and provincial governments.

<H2>Bioregional Fibres, the potential for a sustainable regional paper and textile industry based on flax and hemp. </H2>



<H3>By S. Riddlestone, P. Desai, M. Evans and A. Skyring.</H3>
<H4> Bioregional Development Group, Sutton Ecology Centre, Honeywood Walk, SM5 3NX Carshalton, Surrey, UK. £33, 130 pp.</H4><HR>

This report, printed on hemp-straw-recycled paper, is a study of the feasibility of reviving the cultivation and processing of flax and hemp as a sustainable industry in south-east England. <P>
The first section of the report provides the background of the study. It explains why the authors think that local production for local needs is required for a sustainable society. The environmental and social problems accompanying the growing of cotton and the need for alternatives to cotton are summarized; the link between paper use and the disappearance of ancient forests is outlined.<P>
The second section starts with an interesting overview of the history of flax and hemp, followed by a review of cultivation and processing of flax and hemp in the 1990s, with particular emphasis on the situation in the European Union. It discusses textile and paper markets in the UK and evaluates the potential of flax and hemp as sustainable alternatives to cotton and wood.<P>
Section three provides details of the expertise and technology available and under development for processing hemp and flax into textiles and paper. It goes into the details of fibre extraction and pulping technologies. The environmental and economic implications of the technologies are discussed.
Sections four and five summarize the main points from the previous sections, build models for a bioregional fibre industry in south-east England and present conclusions and recommendations.
This study makes very interesting reading for all those interested in fibre hemp. It is well written, well documented and very quantitative.  The attitude and approach of this study is nicely illustrated by the following citation from Section II.8, entitled: 'Current and potential uses and markets for hemp': "Much of the information promoted in favour of the revival of hemp comes from the lobby for the legalisation of Cannabis as a recreational drug. Some of these sources are quoted in this section, but our own experience has suggested that in certain instances the case for hemp is overstated. The facts will have to be verified in the field. Nonetheless, hemp is a truly remarkable plant with a myriad of potential uses."<P>
For both flax and hemp the study advocates whole crop utilisation. The highest value line fibre should be processed into textiles, the lower value short fibres (tow) should be pulped to produce high quality paper. The woody core (hurds) can be used for paper, composite boards or heat generation. The study points out that currently, there is no hemp textile industry in western Europe. If hemp is to be revived for textile use, considerable investment in machinery would be required.<P>
In conclusion, this study provides a realistic assesment of the role fibre hemp may play in a more sustainable society. It indicates the potential of the crop, as well as some problems to be resolved. All in all, this publication seems very much worthwhile for those seriously interested in the topic. HvdW.

<H3>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years </H3>



<H4>By Ernest L. Abel</H4>
<H5> 1980. Plenum Press, New York  US $39, 289 pp.</H5>

<B>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years</B> is the single most complete and authorative work on the history of the genus Cannabis. Abel presents his thorough and unbiased investigation of the history of drug Cannabis, as well as the even more ancient uses of Cannabis hemp as a source of edible seed and fiber for the manufacture of paper, rope, and textiles.<P>
The detailed explanations of the spread of hashish by the Arabs, and the introduction of hemp to the New World by European colonists, provide fascinating reading for historians and Cannabis aficionados alike. The section presenting the relationship between hemp and slavery is particularly enlightening. Abel describes the strategic importance of supplies of high quality hemp, especially for naval rigging. The Romans, Venetians, Portuguese, Dutch, and English all used the power of hemp to exert their naval might and build trade routes to the world's corners.<P>
Abel's sources span a wide range of disciplines, and are well referenced in an extensive bibliography. A detailed index allows ready access to the many facts contained in the text.<P>
No Cannabis researchers, nor botanical libraries, could possibly consider their collections complete without including the extensive knowledge contained in <B>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years</B>.

<H1>Interview</H1>
<H2>Professor Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, the discoverer of THC</H2> 
<HR>
Although research into the psychoactive components of Cannabis began before the start of this century, it was not until 1964 that Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the most active compound. Mechoulam's discovery led to a lot of research into other natural and synthetic cannabinoids. In recent years many exciting discoveries were made. In 1990 the cannabinoid receptor, the "lock" into which cannabinoids fit, activating the specific biochemical events, was discovered. This of course intensified the search for the cannabinoid-like brain molecule that binds to the cannabinoid receptor. In 1992 William Devane and Raphael Mechoulam identified a natural brain molecule that binds to the cannabinoid receptor. They called it anandamide, from the Sanskrit word for "eternal bliss". While the substance mimics the action of THC, interestingly, it doesn't look anything like it. Additional natural anandamides have since been found and it is specula
ted that a family of receptors may exist. 
One thing is certain: the pace of cannabinoid research has picked up and the field is entering a new and exciting era! An exclusive interview (June 17 1994) with the man who has been in the forefront of Cannabis research for the last thirty years: Professor Raphael Mechoulam.<HR>

<B>David Pate:</B> Can you describe anandamide, its possible function in the brain and where its discovery leads us?<P>
<B>Raphael Mechoulam:</B> It has been known since 1988 that THC acts on a specific receptor in the brain. This specific receptor obviously was not built by the brain just for the sake of tetrahydrocannabinol - a compound present in a plant - which is of course foreign to the receptor. Presumably the receptor is present because it has a function, which has nothing to do with a plant constituent. We considered that possibly this particular receptor is activated by a compound found in the brain itself. We succeeded 2 years ago to identify such a compound in pig brain. We called it anandamide. It binds to this cannabinoid receptor. Anandamide differs completely from THC in its structure. THC is an aromatic compound, while anandamide is a fatty acid derivative. It also has a nitrogen atom in it, which is rather unusual for fatty acid derivatives.<P>
 
<B>DP:</B> Any speculation as to why it is there, what it actually does, both the receptor and its ligand?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We know that the cannabinoid receptor system is involved in sedation; at high doses THC can even cause catalepsy in animals. In humans we know that Cannabis has a lot of effects which together cause the well known "high".  These also include memory effects and some effects on movement. Most of the effects caused by THC are also seen with anandamide in animals. Anandamide has not yet been given to humans but judging from the animal effects these two compounds seem to parallel each other in activity. Whatever THC does, anandamide does as well.<P>

<B>DP: </B>What is the role of anandamides in the brain?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Anandamides and the receptor are found in areas of the brain which have to do with the coordination of movement, with memory and with emotions. We assume that the brain has anandamides and the receptors to participate in the regulation of movement and to participate in memory and emotions. But there is no proof that this is indeed the case, it is a circumstantial evidence.<P>
<B>DP:</B> Since three natural anandamides have been found, how broad do you think the family is? Are there multiple types of receptors?<P>


<B>RM:</B> The three anandamides which are known bind to the same receptor. They are actually a family of closely related compounds. This is well known with other fatty acid derivatives in the body which also appear in large families of closely related substances, such as prostaglandins and the leukotriens. The three  anandamides so far known seem to have the same biological activity, but once we know more about how and what they do we may find small differences. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Are there families of receptors as well?<P>

<B>RM:</B> This is another point. In the brain, so far, just one receptor has been found. However, a second receptor has been found in the spleen, it is related chemically to the brain receptor and anandamide binds to both the central receptor (in the brain) and to the peripheral receptor (in the spleen). Anandamide has not been found so far in the periphery, so chances are that the fact that it binds to the receptor in the spleen is just because the structures of the two receptors are somewhat close. Maybe the brain transmits the brain mediator. The peripheral receptor seems to have its own endogenous ligands. As a matter of fact we have found an endogenous compound in the gut which binds to both the central and peripheral receptors. We are working on it at the moment and have not published its structure or function. I think that the peripheral receptor has to do with the immune system as it is well known that THC affects this system. At present however this is just a speculation.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Can you further speculate on what triggers production of anandamides naturally and whether they are degraded by an enzyme system like the cannabinoids?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Incidentally, also in answer to your previous question, the peripheral receptor is found in the spleen, but there is also a receptor in the testis, we do not know whether it is the peripheral or the central receptor and we know that THC and anandamides act on the sperm. There is a paper in publication in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that both THC and anandamides act on activation of the sperm before it fertilizes the egg. So it is involved, whether that is relevant or not, I don't know. <P>
We do not know what triggers the production of anandamides. Inciden-tally, Bill Devane and J. Axelrod at NIH have now found an enzyme which synthesizes anandamide in the brain from arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The anandamides are labile compounds and they are degraded by an enzyme - an amidase. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Are there interactions between the cannabinoid receptor and other receptors or receptor systems?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Most definitely. The cannabinoids (and presumably the anandamides) like most mediators in the body interact with other systems: the dopaminergic, the adrenergic, the opiate systems etc. For example we have found that when anandamides are injected into the brain the concentration of cortical steroids goes up. There are indications that the cortical steroids themselves may act on the cannabinoid receptor, presumably bringing down its activity.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Were you surprised that anandamide was the structure it was and not a protein?<P>

<B>RM:</B> No, there is no reason why it should be a protein. As a matter of fact, we thought originally that anandamide should be a lipid-soluble compound, because the cannabinoids are lipid-soluble, and therefore chances were that the compound in the body will be lipid-soluble and it turned out to be a fatty acid.<P>

<B>DP:</B> How do cannabinoids and anandamides happen to fit into the same receptor, considering their structures are quite different?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We assume that in space and in distribution of electronic charges the anandamides and the cannabinoids take up the same kind of structure. A few groups are using models to calculate the electronic densities and the structures of both types of compounds in space and to compare them. However, as yet no definite answer has been provided.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Are the relative affinities of cannabinoids and anandamides and their receptors about the same?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Anandamides and THC have more or less the same affinity for the receptor. There are synthetic cannabinoids which are a hundred and maybe a thousand times more active than THC. But that is irrelevant, THC and anandamide are not very potent, but then the body does not want very potent compounds. It wants compounds with intermediate potency, because if the potency is very high and there is a chance increase of the compound the body will go into stress. Changes in the body are usually gradual so one does not need very active compounds in the body. This is of course a generalization which does not aply to all body constituents as there are some compounds present in the body which act at extremely low concentrations.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Do you think there is sufficient research into cannabinoids and will cannabinoids play a significant role in the future of therapeutic medicine? If so, for what indications?<P>

<B>RM:</B> After the identification of delta-9-THC as the active component of Cannabis there was a huge wave of research in chemistry, pharmacology and clinical aspects dealing with this plant constituent. Many thousands of papers were published on it. By the late 1970s research started slowing down as the mode of action was not clear at all. With the discovery of receptors and of endogenous ligands interest has very much increased and numerous new laboratories are working on various aspects. We can expect in the future clarification of many of the problems associated with cannabinoid activity and possibly advances in the field of therapeutics. So far the only cannabinoid which has been legalized is THC for use in cases of vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. THC has also been used for a few other things like appetite stimulation (in cases of AIDS) as well as in glaucoma. There is also illegal use in some  neurological diseases such as spasticity in multiple sclerosis and even in asthma. In the past several companies worked on synthetic cannabinoids as analgetics or in reduction of blood pressure but these projects were terminated. The synthetic compounds produced still caused psychotropic effects which were unacceptable. In the last few years we have synthesized and widely tested a cannabinoid, HU-211, which causes none of the typical psychotropic cannabinoid effects but is a blocker of the action of the stimulatory transmitter glutamic acid, in particular on one of its subreceptors named NMDA. This receptor is involved in stimulatory activity. However, during trauma it causes excessive opening of ion channels in many cells in the vicinity of the trauma. This introduces large amounts of calcium ions into the cells and they may die. Blocking this activity is of considerable potential importance in cases of trauma and possibly stroke, and a company with which we are associated is developing HU-211 as an anti-trauma agent. We expect to start human testing within a few months.The discovery of anandamide has apparently stimulated interest in several pharmaceutical companies. I am aware of a Japanese company which is working in the field as well as a French one. Apparently the French company has discovered an antagonist to anandamide - the first ever described antagonist in the cannabinoid series. They are about to present it at a forthcoming meeting.<P>

<B> DP:</B> Do you see the very limited use of cannabinoids in medicine as the result of their intrinsic medicinal value or as the result of the restrictions surrounding them?<P>

<B>RM:</B> In the past most companies  refrained from working on cannabinoids mostly  because of the legal restrictions. It seems reasonable to expect that as at the moment there are no such legal restrictions concerning anandamides it will be easier for companies to start projects in this field. I expect that such research projects will be mostly in the neurological area and possibly in inflammation research and immunology. This assumption is based on the high concentrations of the cannabinoid receptor in the basal ganglia - an area involved in coordination of movement and the peripheral receptor being in the spleen - an organ of immune importance.  <P>

<B>DP:</B> Do you think new delivery systems would help cannabinoid therapeutics gain more acceptance?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Definitely. One delivery system which has not been investigated is the aerosol system. People smoke cannabinoids, this is the best way of getting them into the body, and getting them to act fast. And in asthma for example, THC is known to be a bronchodilator. So if people want to use a compound against asthma, obviously they will prefer inhalation rather than any other way and very little work has been done in this area. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Was THC patentable at the time of your discovery? Why didn't you patent its synthesis?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We didn't patent THC as it was of no apparent medical use. One cannot patent compounds which have no practical use. <P>

<B>DP:</B> I'm thinking now of the Unimed use of this as a pharmaceutical.<P>

<B>RM:</B> We didn't patent the synthesis either. I had asked my university authorities about this and they decided against it. There was no apparent practical use of THC or its synthesis. On the other hand we should have patented the major cannabinoid metabolite - THC-11-oic-acid which we identified and synthesized in 1972. This acid stays in the body for a very long time and most tests of cannabinoid use look for the presence of this acid rather than for THC itself. Numerous radio immuno assays are based on this acid  and we realize now that it was foolish not to patent it.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is this approach basically a reflection of your background, which is academic rather than industrial?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Yes, now we patent quite a few things, we patented HU-211 and that's why a company was willing to take it over. We now patent quite a few more compounds, but at that time we didn't and it is a pity, and the university lost a lot of money.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is there any relatively unknown  or unusual Cannabis research, past or present, that deserves a wider mention?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Well, if you look at what is going on now, there is a huge amount of research going in all kind of directions. For example, groups working on the immune system may be using the receptor in the spleen. Research goes into subjects like emotions, asking why does Cannabis do what it does? People are looking into schizofrenia and finding some unusual things, some relationship between cannabinoids and schizofrenia, I think it has to do with the receptor. Even though all these things are not well defined, I am under the impression that there is a burst of research in many directions. Where that will lead I don't know. I think that the most promising approach is to look into neurological problems, coordination of movement and things of that sort.<P>

<B>DP:</B> So the cannabinoids serve less as prototypes for drugs per se, but rather as probes of the systems, which other drugs may be later able to affect.<P>

<B>RM:</B> Many if not most drugs used today are really structural modifications of natural products, be they plant products of known therapeutic value, or hormones, or transmitters. In most cases the new drugs have less side effects than the natural product. I expect that this is going to happen with the cannabinoids and anandamides. Academic and industrial research groups will probably try to modify these molecules in order to minimize the side effects as well as to make the compounds more specific. This is what we did with HU-211 and this is probably going to be done with these compounds in other fields as well.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is there anything else you may want to add to any of the previous questions?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Research in the last 20 years has shown that Cannabis differs from most other illicit drugs - it is not a major addictive agent and it seems to act through mechanisms which are quite different from those of the opiates and cocaine.  Hence investigations in this field may lead us into understanding of very basic problems in biology such as memory and emotions. There are few tools for work in these areas and any additional one may be of great importance. The National Institute of Drug Abuse of the USA which is the major granting agency in the field of drug abuse is looking into cannabinoids with great interest now and this will be of considerable help. I would like to mention that the United Nations which has a huge budget devoted to drug abuse prevention does not support research at all. This is a strange situation and probably reflects the background of the officials dealing with drug abuse at the UN level. They view drug abuse as a social problem with little value of research for the solution of this problem. Too bad. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Would you say that the perceptions are changing as cannabinoids are seen less as a source of problems and more as a source of opportunity for exploration?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Right, you just put it down very well.<P>
<B>DP:</B> Sorry, I didn't want to put words in your mouth.<P>
<B>RM:</B> No, no, you just said it.<P>

"In 1824, domestic hemp was pitted against Russian hemp by rigging the USS Constitution on one side with 
American and the other with Russian grown hemp, 'and after being thus worn for nearly a year, it was found, 
on examination, that the Russian rope, in every instance, after being much worn, looked better and wore more 
equally and evenly than the American.' But the commander said, 'the difference between them was not so 
great as to warrant a declaration that the proof was conclusive in favor of the Russian....'"<br>

"The Federal Government in 1841 authorized a bounty, which allowed for the payment of not more than $280 
per ton for American water-retted hemp, provided it was suitable for naval cordage. Many of the planters 
prepared large pools and water-retted the hemp they produced. But the work was so hard on Negroes that the 
practice was abandoned. Many Negroes died of pneumonia contracted from working in the hemp-pools in the 
winter, and the mortality became so great among hemp hands that the increase in value of the hemp did not 
equal the loss in Negroes." <br>

manufactures which now employ thousands of tons of imported fibers." <br>

"Several [varieties of hemp] are grown in this country, that cultivated in Kentucky and having a hollow stem, 
being the most common. China hemp, with slender stems, growing very erect, has a wide range of culture. 
Smyrna hemp is adapted to cultivation over a still wider range and Japanese hemp is beginning to be 
cultivated, particularly in California, where it reaches a height of 15 feet.  Russian and Italian seed have been 
experimented with, but the former produces a short stalk, while the latter only grows to a medium height. A 
small quantity of Piedmontese hemp seed from Italy was distributed by the Department in 1893, having been 
received through the Chicago Exposition...." <br>

Investigations. Report No. 8. p.7.<P>
 
 
 
"In Nebraska, where the [hemp] industry is being established, a new and important step has been taken in 
cutting the crop with an ordinary mowing machine. A simple attachment which bends the stalks over in the 
direction in which the machine is going facilitates the cutting...The cost of cutting hemp in this manner is 50 
cents per acre, as compared with $3 to $4 per acre, the rates paid for cutting by hand in Kentucky."  <br>
USDA. 1902. USDA. Yearbk of Agric. p. 23.<P>
 
 
 
"The most important fact to be recorded in connection with the hemp industry during the past year is the 
successful operation of a machine brake in the fields of Kentucky. This machine breaks the retted stalks and 
cleans the fiber, producing clean, straight fiber equal to the best grades prepared on hand brakes, and it has a 
capacity of 1000 pounds or more of clean fiber per hour.  So far as we have any record, this is the first 
machine having sufficient capacity to be commercially practical that has cleaned bast fiber in an entirely 
satisfactory manner." <br>
USDA. 1905  Report of Office of Fiber Investigations. Bureau of Plant Industry. p. 145. <P>
 
"When the work with hemp was begun in Wisconsin, there were no satisfactory machines for harvesting, 
spreading, binding, or breaking. All of these processes were performed by hand. Due to such methods, the 
hemp industry in the United States had all but disappeared.  As it was realized from the very beginning of the 
work in Wisconsin that no permanent progress could be made so long as it was necessary to depend upon 
hand labor, immediate attention was given to solving the problem of power machinery. Nearly every kind of 
hemp machine was studied and tested. The obstacles were great, but through the cooperation of experienced 
hemp men and one large harvesting machinery company, this problem has been nearly solved. The hemp crop 
can now be handled entirely by machinery." <br>

293. p.5.<P>
 
 
 
"The organized hemp growers of Wisconsin, working in cooperation with the field agent of fiber 
investigations [Andrew Wright], have so improved the quality and standardized the grades of hemp fiber 
produced there that it has found a market even in dull times. The hemp acreage in that State has been kept up, 
although there has been a reduction in every other hemp-producing area throughout the world." <br>

"The crop of hempseed last fall, estimated at about 45,000 bushels, is the largest produced in the United States 
since 1859. A very large proportion of it was from improved strains developed by this bureau in the hempseed 
selection plats at Arlington and Yarrow Farms." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1917. Report of the Chief. p. 12.<P>
 
 
 
"Early maturing varieties, chiefly of Italian origin, are being grown at Madison, Wisconsin, in cooperation 
with the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. This is the third year of selection for some varieties, and 
the results give promise of the successful production in that State of seed of hemp fully equal to the Ferrara of 
northern Italy." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1918. Report of the Chief. p. 28.  <P>
 
"The second-generation hybrid Ferramington, combining the height and long internodes of Kymington with 
the earliness and heavy seed yield of Ferrara, gives promise of a good fiber type of hemp that may ripen seed 
as far north as Wisconsin." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1919. Report of the Chief. p. 21. <P>
 
"The work of breeding improved strains of hemp is being continued at Arlington Farm, Va., and all previous 
records were broken in the selection plats of 1919.  The three best strains, Kymington, Chington and 
Tochimington, averaged, respectively, 14 feet 11 inches, 15 feet 5 inches, and 15 feet 9 inches, while the 
tallest individual plant was 19 feet. The improvement by selection is shown not alone in increased height but 
also in longer internodes, yielding fiber of better quality and increased quantity." <br>
USDA. Bureau of Plant Industry. 1920. Report of the Chief. p. 26. <P>
 
"In 1929 three selected varieties of hemp (Michigan Early, Chinamington and Simple Leaf) were grown in 
comparison with unselected common Kentucky seed near Juneau, Wis. Each of the varieties had been 
developed by 10 years or more of selection from the progeny of individual plants. The yields of fiber per acre 
were as follows: Simple Leaf, 360 pounds; Michigan Early, 694 pounds; Chinamington, 1054 pounds; 
common Kentucky, 680 pounds." <br>
USDA. 1929. Bureau of Plant Industry, Annual Report. p. 27.<P>
 
"The hemp breeding work, carried on by the Bureau for more than 20 years, was discontinued in 1933, but 
practical results are still evident in commercial fields. A hemp grower in Kentucky reported a yield of 1750 
pounds per acre of clean, dew-retted fiber from 100 acres of the pedigreed variety Chinamington grown in 
1934. This is more than twice the average yield obtained from ordinary unselected hemp seed." <br>

<H3>THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF CRADLE TO GRAVE

<H4>March 30, 1943 </H4>
The New Deal Bureaucrats and their fellow "dollar a year" fiber racketeers of the War Production Board are 
now offering Hemp Marijuana (dope) narcotic to the American people instead of increased food production. 
The American people are footing the bill. <P>
In one of the most dastardly propositions ever "cooked" up the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the War 
Production Board are manipulating the proposition of a promotion and scheme to grow and produce hemp 
from a plant, outlawed by law, that is the fount of the insiduous [sic] drug known as Marijuana, the worst and 
most serious source of all (dope) narcotic evils afflicting children, in the schools and outside, and grown-ups 
alike in all walks of life. The fiber itself from this plant is worthless. The seeds from this plant fly far and wide. 
The resultant wild growth becomes dangerously uncontrollable. In the face of shortage and scarcity of labor, 
foodstuffs, linseed oil, fibers and other critical materials which are peculiarly being denied us, these corruptors
 [sic] of American life are now engaged in the promoting of 350,000 acres, erecting 100 buildings and building 
a large volume of equipment and machinery in a number of Mid-Western States for the production of this narcotic
 (dope) plant product, all of which must reach the staggering cost of $500,000,000 and end in catastrophic
 failure. A number of land-
grant educational institutions are in on this racket. The Commodity Credit Corporation and the War 
Production Board and the Defense Plant Corporation, through their own created socalled [sic] "War Hemp 
Industries, Inc., Agency," something new in the New Deal bureaucratic set-up, are running this (dope) 
narcotic show with private racketeers as undercover men. Large profits have been made already by them on 
the seeds by cheating and gipping [sic] the government. The financial "kill" is figured to be colossal for all the 
participants. The kill to agriculture, industry, (the choicest and most fertile land or soils are being demanded) 
and health and welfare of the American people is going to reach disastrous proportions from which recovery 
may never be found possible. Congressman Hampton P. Fulmer, Chairman, Agricultural Committee, and 
Congressman Paul Brown, overseeing the Commodity Credit Corporation, and certain other members of the 
Congress, among them Senators Harry S. Truman and Scott W. Lucas, and Donald 
M. Nelson, Chairman, War Production Board, and John R. Hutson, President of the government Commodity 
Credit Corporation, Agricultural Adjustment Administration, etc. (the latter active participant) are acquainted 
with the facts as are being described here and have been presented to them in detail. The power-pressure of 
the participants in this narcotic (dope) racket is obviously superior to the best interests of the American people 
even during these dangerous times of their sacrifices and sufferings at home and on the battle front. The truth 
of the above report is vouched for. Do you want this (dope) narcotic in your community? You are lined up for 
it. It is to be noted that increased acreage for guayule rubber has been stopped because of the acute food 
shortages but though rubber scarcities exist yet. <P>

NOTE:---This whole hemp marijuana racket will be dumped out of existence right after the war is over in 
accordance to with [sic] a statement from Washington, D.C., but obviously not before the "kill" in taxpayers' 
money has been made and the narcotic has been spread to dope them. <br>

<H1>Guide for authors
</H1>
<HR>
The Journal of the International Hemp Association publishes original research, literature reviews and news items on hemp. Contributions concern fibre, seed and resin, and can come from a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, chemistry, ecology, economy and markets, genetic resources and breeding, history, medicine, physiology, phytopathology, products and applications, and technology. Since the readership of the IHA Journal is much broader than for a single-discipline journal, highly specialized terminology should be defined or avoided. The significance of a statement, or the reasoning behind a conclusion, may have to be more fully explained than in a more specialized journal.<P>

Contributions should be written in English and not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words), longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized in two consecutive issues. Authors not fluent in English should have their paper reviewed and checked by a colleague who is fluent.<P>

Manuscripts can be submitted to:
 IHA Journal,<br> Editorial Office,<br> Postbus 75007, 1070 AA<br> Amsterdam, The Netherlands.<br> The preferred medium of submission is on disk with accompanying manuscript in triplicate. <P>

<H4>Units.</H4> Research papers and literature reviews should use the International (SI, or metric) system throughout. <P>

<h4>Title page.</h4> The title page should give the following information: 1) title of the paper; 2) names and addresses of the authors.<P>


<H4>Abstract.</H4> The abstract should be 100 to 250 words suitable for readers from a broad range of disciplines. The abstract should summarize the aim of the work, the methods used, and give the main results and conclusions.<P>

<H4>Structure.</H4>Research papers should be subdivided into four main sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion. The last three sections may be subdivided to improve clarity; a Conclusions section may be added if appropriate. The section on Materials and Methods should be succinct, but should contain sufficient detail to enable the reader to deduce what exactly was done. All abreviations and acronyms must be fully defined when first used. Numerical results should be shown in tables or figures.<P>

<H3>Clean hemp pulp technology</H3>

<P>
At the Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute (UPPRI) a new  ammonia-sulfite-alcohol drip percolation pulping technology has been developed on laboratory scale. Current pulping technology for bast fibre crops such as hemp and kenaf requires the separation of the stems into bast and core. The processes of removal, storage and utilisation of the core involve environmental and technical problems which had not been solved so far. The pulping of the bast encounters problems associated with the tendency of its long fibres to twist. 

The new drip percolation technology makes it possible to process the whole hemp stem into pulp. Costs for capital, energy and labour are less than with current technologies and environmental pollution is strongly reduced.<P>

The UPPRI wants to set up a pilot plant with a capacity of 7 ton/day of air dried pulp to further develop and optimize the new technology. The project will be partially financed from the institute's budget. The UPPRI is looking for parties interested in this project. A more detailed proposal is available at the IHA, or inquiries can be made to The Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute: 18/7 Kutuzovstreet, Kiev 252133, Ukraine. <P>

<H3> Marijuana and driving ability</H3>
After alcohol, Cannabis is the drug which is found most often in the blood of drivers involved in road accidents. The effects of THC, the major psychoactive component of Cannabis, on driving ability have been investigated by Dr. H.W.J. Robbe at the Institute of Human Psychopharmacology of the University of Limburg in Maastricht, The Netherlands.<P>

In his PhD thesis, "Influence of Marijuana on Driving" (available through the IHA), which  Robbe defended on May 26, he concludes that marijuana is not a safe drug in traffic. After using marijuana drivers were less able to drive in a straight line. However, compared to the effects of alcohol and many medicines (antidepressants and sedatives) on driving ability, the effects of marijuana are not exceptional.<P>

The use of a moderate amount of marijuana did not affect driving ability, but the drivers thought their ability had been negatively affected. The use of a moderate amount of alcohol had a negative effect on driving ability, while the drivers thought their performance had not been affected.  The use of alcohol seems to stimulate risky behaviour, whereas the use of marijuana leads to a more prudent driving style. <P>
<HR>
<H3>Higher yields from late hemp</H3>
By growing very late-flowering  cultivars at a relatively low plant density, fibre hemp yields can be much higher than when using conventional cultivation techniques. This is the main practical conclusion from the research on fibre hemp conducted by Dr. H.M.G. van der Werf at the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility and the Agricultural University in Wageningen, The Netherlands.
<P>
In his PhD thesis, "Crop physiology of fibre hemp" (available through the IHA), which van der Werf defended on June 30, he concludes fibre hemp may be an interesting new crop. Traditionally fibre hemp is sown very densely (300-400 plants/m2), and harvested in August. By using late-flowering hemp cultivars and harvesting these at the end of September the growing season is longer and yields can be increased by about 30 %. <P>
Such late high-yielding hemp crops are not compatible with the traditional high plant density. As a result of severe inter-plant competition, many plants die during August and September in these late crops ("self-thinning"). As a consequence of the occurrence of self-thinning, in fibre hemp optimum plant density is lower when the yield is higher.

<p>The production of cannabinoids and their associated terpenes
in <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to environmental influences as
well as hereditary determinants. Their biosynthesis occurs in
specialized glands populating the surface of all aerial
structures of the plant. These compounds apparently serve as
defensive agents in a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial,
antifeedant and UV-B pigmentation roles. In addition, the more
intense ambient UV-B of the tropics, in combination with the UV-B
lability of cannabidiol, may have influenced the evolution of an
alternative biogenetic route from cannabigerol to
tetrahydrocannabinol in some varieties. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<em>

<p>Cannabis</em> may have been the first cultivated plant.
Records indicate use of this crop for paper, textiles, food and
medicine throughout human history (Abel 1980). It is a dioecious
annual with rather distinctive palmate leaves, usually composed
of an odd number of leaflets. Best growth occurs on recently
disturbed sites of high soil nitrogen content, so it is commonly
found as a persistent weed at the edge of cultivated fields.
Mature height ranges from 1 to 5 meters, according to
environmental and hereditary dictates. Typically, the male plant
is somewhat taller and more obviously flowered. These flowers
have five yellowish tepals, and five anthers that hang
pendulously at maturity, dispersing their pollen to the wind. The
female plant exhibits a more robust appearance due to its shorter
branches and dense growth of leaves and flower-associated bracts.
Its double-styled flower possesses only a thin, closely adherent
perianth, but is further protected by enclosure in a cuplike
bracteole (i.e., perigonal bract), subtended by a usually
monophyllous leaflet. A single achene is produced per flower and
shed or dispersed as a result of bird predation. The life cycle
of the male is completed soon after anthesis, but the female
survives until full seed ripeness. </p>

<p><em>Cannabis</em> seems a virtual factory for the production
of secondary metabolic compounds. A variety of alkanes have been
identified (Adams, Jr. and Jones 1973, De Zeeuw <em>et al.</em>
1973b, Mobarak <em>et al.</em> 1974a &amp; 1974b), as well as
nitrogenous compounds (ElSohly and Turner 1976, Hanus 1975b),
flavonoids (Gellert <em>et al.</em> 1974, Paris <em>et al.</em>
1975b, Paris and Paris 1973) and other miscellaneous compounds
(Hanus 1976a &amp; 1976b). Terpenes appear in abundance (Hanus
1975a, Hendricks <em>et al.</em> 1975) and contribute to the
characteristic odor of the plant (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973) and
some of its crude preparations, such as hashish. The compounds
which comprise the active drug ingredients are apparently unique
to this genus and are termed cannabinoids. Cannabinoids were
originally thought to exist as the phenolic compounds, but later
research (Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971a, Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Small and Beckstead 1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b) has
indicated their existence predominantly in the form of carboxylic
acids which decarboxylate readily with time (Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b), upon heating (De Zeeuw <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Kimura and Okamoto 1970) or in alkaline
conditions (Grlic and Andrec 1961, Masoud and Doorenboos 1973).
There are over 60 of these type compounds present in the plant
(Turner <em>et al.</em> 1980). </p>

<p>Much has been published concerning the influence of heredity
on cannabinoid production (e.g., Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971b,
Small and Beckstead 1973), but ecological factors have long been
thought to have an important influence by stressing the <em>Cannabis</em>
plant (Bouquet 1950). The resultant increased biosynthesis of the
cannabinoid and terpene containing resin, in most cases, seems
likely of advantage to the organism in adapting it to a variety
of survival-threatening situations. This work reviews these
biotic and abiotic challenges and speculates on the utility of <em>Cannabis</em>
resin to the plant. </p>

<h3>Anatomical distribution and biogenesis of the cannabinoids</h3>

<p>The major sites of cannabinoid production appear to be
epidermal glands (Fairbairn 1972, Hammond and Mahlberg 1973,
Lanyon <em>et al.</em> 1981, Malingre <em>et al.</em> 1975) which
exhibit a marked variation in size, shape and population density,
depending on the anatomical locale examined. While there are no
published reports of glands present on root surfaces, most of the
aerial parts possess them, along with non-glandular trichomes (De
Pasquale <em>et al.</em> 1974). These epidermal glands seem to
fall into two broad categories: stalked and sessile. The stalked
gland (Fig. 1, front page) can consist of a single cell or small
group of cells arranged in a rosette on a single or multicellular
pedestal. Lack of thorough ontogenetic study has led to the
speculation that some of this variation may be attributable to
observation of various developmental stages (Ledbetter and
Krikorian 1975). The sessile gland possesses no stalk and has
secretory cells located at or below the epidermal surface
(Fairbairn 1972). In either case, the glandular cells are covered
with a &quot;sheath&quot; under which the resins are secreted via
vesicles (Mahlberg and Kim 1992). This sheath consists of a
cuticle that coats a polysaccharide layer (presumed cellulose)
originating from the primary cell wall (Hammond and Mahlberg
1978). The resins accumulate until the sheath bulges away from
the secretory cells, forming a spheroid structure. The resin is
then released by rupture of the membrane or through pores in its
surface (De Pasquale 1974). The cannabinoid content of each plant
part varies, paralleling observable gland distribution (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp; 1971b, Kimura
and Okamoto 1970, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971, Ono <em>et al.</em>
1972), although Turner <em>et al.</em> (1978) have disagreed.
Roots contain only trace amounts. Stalks, branches and twigs have
greater quantities, although not as much as leaf material.
Vegetative leaf contains varying quantities depending on its
position on the plant: lower leaves possessing less and upper
ones more. Leaf glands are most dense on the abaxial (underside)
surface. The greatest amount of cannabinoids is found in the new
growth near each apical tip (Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Steinberg <em>et
al.</em> 1975), although Ono <em>et al.</em> (1972) seem to
differ on this point. This variation in leaf gland placement may
be due to either loss of glands as the leaf matures or a greater
the endowment of glands on leaves successively produced as the
plant matures. Additional study on this point is required. </p>

<p>Once sexual differentiation has occurred, the generation of
female reproductive organs and their associated bracts increases
total plant cannabinoid content. Bracts subtending the female
flowers contain a greater density of glands than the leaves. The
small cuplike bracteole (perigonal bract) enclosing the pistil
has the highest cannabinoid content of any single plant part
(Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp;
1971b). Second only to this is the flower itself (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b). Since it has no reported epidermal gland
structures, the cannabinoids present must be due to either
undiscovered production sites or simple adherence of resin from
the inner surface of its intimately associated bracteole. This
conjecture is supported by the finding that the achenes do not
contain substantial amounts of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b, Ono <em>et al.</em> 1972). Reproductive
structures of the male plant are also provided with greater
concentrations of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et al.</em>
1971b, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971). Stalked glands have been
observed covering the tepal, with massively stalked glands
occurring on the stamen filament (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976). In
addition, rows of very large sessile glands are found situated in
grooves on the anther itself (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976,
Fairbairn 1972) and apparently provide the pollen with a
considerable cannabinoid content (Paris <em>et al.</em> 1975a). </p>

<p><em>Delta</em>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the cannabinoid
responsible for the main psychoactive effects of most <em>Cannabis</em>
drug preparations (Mechoulam 1970). In some varieties of <em>Cannabis</em>,
additional cannabinoid homologs appear that have the usual pentyl
group attached to the aromatic ring, replaced by a propyl (De
Zeeuw <em>et al.</em> 1972b &amp; 1973a, Fetterman and Turner
1972, Gill 1971, Gill <em>et al.</em> 1970, Merkus 1971, Vree <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973a) or occasionally a
methyl group (Vree <em>et al.</em> 1971 &amp; 1972b). Other
claims have been made for butyl (Harvey 1976) or heptyl (Isbell
1973) substitutions, but the latter announcement seems
particularly tenuous. THC is thought to be produced by the plant
(Fig. 2, next page) from cannabidiol (CBD) which, in turn, is
derived from cannabigerol (CBG) generated from non-cannabinoid
precursors (Hammond and Mahlberg 1994, Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1984, Turner and Mahlberg 1988). CBG is also the biogenetic
precursor of cannabichromene (CBC). Some of the cannabinoids
(e.g., cannabielsoin, cannabinol, and cannabicyclol) are probably
degradation products of the enzymatically produced cannabinoids
(e.g., CBD, THC and CBC, respectively). </p>

(THC). </p>

<h2>Cannabinoids and environmental stress</h2>

<h3>Desiccation</h3>

<p>THC is a viscous hydrophobic oil (Garrett and Hunt 1974) that
resists crystallization (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1971) and is of low
volatility (Adams <em>et al.</em> 1941). Since the sticky resins
produced and exuded on the surface of the plant are varying
combinations of THC, other cannabinoids and a variety of
terpenes, they can be seen as analogous to the waxy coatings of
the cacti and other succulents that serve as a barrier to water
loss in dry environments. </p>

<p>Bouquet (1950) has mentioned that the western side of
Lebanon's mountainous <em>Cannabis</em> growing areas is less
favorable for resin production because of humid sea winds. De
Faubert Maunder (1976) also observed that the copious separable
resin needed for hashish production occurs only &quot;in a belt
passing from Morocco eastwards, taking in the Mediterranean area,
Arabia, the Indian sub-continent and ending in Indo-China.&quot;
These are mostly areas notable for their sparse rainfall, low
humidity and sunny climate. Is it merely coincidence that resin
is produced according to this pattern, as well? </p>

<p>Experimental evidence is accumulating that reinforces these
notions. Sharma (1975) reported a greater glandular trichome
density on leaves of <em>Cannabis</em> growing in xeric
circumstances. Paris <em>et al.</em> (1975a) have demonstrated a
marked increase in the cannabinoid content of <em>Cannabis</em>
pollen with decreased humidity. Murari <em>et al.</em> (1983)
grew a range of <em>Cannabis</em> fiber cultivars in three
climatic zones of Italy and found higher THC levels in those
plants grown in the drier &quot;continental&quot; (<em>versus</em>
&quot;maritime&quot;) climate. Hakim <em>et al.</em> (1986)
report that CBD-rich English <em>Cannabis</em> devoid of THC
produced significant amounts of THC and less CBD, when grown in
the Sudan. This trend was accentuated in their next generation of
plants. </p>

<p>Haney and Kutscheid (1973) have shown significant correlations
of plant cannabinoid content with factors affecting soil moisture
availability: content of clay or sand, percent slope of plot, and
competition from surrounding vegetation. In some cases, this last
factor was noted to have induced a stunted plant with
&quot;disproportionally smaller roots&quot;, which would tend to
increase both the frequency and severity of desiccation stress. </p>

<p>In a study of 10 Kansas locations, Latta and Eaton (1975)
found wide differences in plant cannabinoid content, observing
that &quot;<em>delta</em>-9-THC ranged from 0.012 to 0.49% and
generally increased as locations became less favorable for plant
growth, suggesting increased plant stress enhanced <em>delta</em>-9-THC
production.&quot; Mention was also made of a positive correlation
between competing vegetation and THC content. Although the
sampling area was not considered very moisture deficient, they
speculated that &quot;Greater difference among locations might
have been observed under drought conditions.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature </h3>

<p>Temperature may play a role in determining cannabinoid
content, but perhaps only through its association with moisture
availability. Boucher <em>et al.</em> (1974) reported an increase
in cannabinoid content with temperature (32o C. <em>vs.</em> 22o
C.), however, some variables such as increased water loss due to
accelerated evaporation and plant transpiration at high
temperatures were left unaccounted. In contrast, Bazzaz <em>et
al.</em> (1975), using 4 <em>Cannabis</em> ecotypes of both
tropical and temperate character, demonstrated a definite
decrease in cannabinoid production with increased temperature
(32o C. <em>vs.</em> 23o C.). Later studies by Braut-Boucher
(1980) on clones of 2 strains from South Africa revealed a more
complex pattern of biosynthesis according to strain, gender and
chemical homologue produced. Clearly, further study of this
parameter is needed. </p>

<h3>Soil Nutrients</h3>

<p>Mineral balance seems to influence cannabinoid production.
Krejci (1970) found increases related to unspecified &quot;poor
soil conditions&quot;. Haney and Kutcheid (1973) have shown the
influence of soil K, P, Ca and N concentrations on Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>.
They report a distinctly negative correlation between soil K and
plant <em>delta</em>-9-THC content, although K-P interaction, N
and Ca were positively correlated with it. These minerals were
also shown to affect the production of CBD, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and cannabinol (CBN), although the latter two compounds are now
thought to be spontaneous degradation products of <em>delta</em>-9-THC.
Kaneshima <em>et al.</em> (1973) have demonstrated the importance
of optimal Fe levels for plant synthesis of THC. Latta and Eaton
(1975) reported Mg and Fe to be important for THC production,
suggesting that these minerals may serve as enzyme co-factors.
Coffman and Gentner (1975) also corroborated the importance of
soil type and mineral content, and observed a significant
negative correlation between plant height at harvest and THC
levels. Interestingly, Marshman <em>et al.</em> (1976) report
greater amounts of THC in Jamaican plants growing in
&quot;organically&quot; enriched (<em>vs.</em> artificially
fertilized) soils. </p>

<h3>Insect predation</h3>

<p>Wounding of the plant has been employed as a method to
increase resin production (Emboden 1972). This increase may be a
response to desiccation above the point of vascular disruption.
Under natural circumstances, wounding most often occurs as a
result of insect attack. This is a source of environmental stress
which the production of terpenes and cannabinoids may be able to
minimize. <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to few predators (Smith
and Haney 1973, Stannard <em>et al.</em> 1970) and has even been
utilized in powdered or extract form as an insecticide (Bouquet
1950) or repellent (Khare <em>et al.</em> 1974). Its apparent
defensive mechanisms include a generous covering of non-glandular
trichomes, emission of volatile terpenoid substances, and
exudation of the sticky cannabinoids. <em>Cannabis</em> is often
noted for its aromatic quality and many of the terpenes produced
are known to possess insect-repellent properties. Among these are
alpha and beta pinene, limonene, terpineol and borneol. Pinenes
and limonene comprise over 75% of the volatiles detected in the
surrounding atmosphere, but account for only 7% of the essential
oil (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973). Consistent with glandular
trichome density and cannabinoid content, more of these terpenes
are produced by the inflorescences than the leaves, and their
occurrence is also greater in the female plant (Martin <em>et al.</em>
1961). </p>

<p>No insect toxicity studies using isolated cannabinoids have
been published to date. Rothschild <em>et al.</em> (1977) found
THC-rich Mexican (<em>vs.</em> CBD-rich Turkish) <em>Cannabis</em>
fatal to tiger moth (<em>Arctia caja</em>) larvae, but not
Nigerian grasshopper (<em>Zonocerus elegans</em>) nymphs.
Rothschild and Fairbairn (1980) later found that pure THC (<em>vs.</em>
CBD) sprayed on cabbage leaves, does repel the large white
cabbage butterfly (<em>Pieris brassicae</em>). </p>

<p>The cannabinoids may also serve as a purely mechanical
defense. A tiny creature crossing the leaf surface could rupture
the tenuously attached globular resin reservoirs of the glandular
trichomes (Ledbetter and Krikorian 1975) and become ensnared in
resin. A sizable chewing insect, if able to overcome these
defenses, would still have difficulty chewing the gummy resin,
along with the cystolithic trichomes and silicified covering
trichomes also present on the leaf. The utility of these
epidermal features as insect antifeedants is also inferable from
their predominant occurrence on the insect-favored abaxial leaf
surface. Although the above strategies represent a seemingly
sophisticated system, many other plants (Levin 1973) and even
arthropods (Eisner 1970) utilize similar defense mechanisms,
often employing identical terpenes! </p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Terpenes may also help to suppress the growth of surrounding
vegetation (Muller and Hauge 1967, Muller <em>et al.</em> 1964).
Haney and Bazzaz (1970) speculated that such a mechanism may be
operative in <em>Cannabis</em>. They further ventured that since
the production of terpenes is not fully developed in very young
plants, this may explain their inability to compete successfully
with other vegetation until more mature. The observation (Latta
and Eaton 1975) of increased THC production by plants in
competition with surrounding vegetation &quot;at a time in the
growing season when moisture was not limiting&quot;, may indicate
a stimulus for cannabinoid production beyond that of simple water
stress. </p>

<h3>Bacteria and fungi</h3>

<p>The cannabinoids may serve as a protectant against
microorganisms. <em>Cannabis</em> preparations have long served
as medicines (apart from their psychoactive properties) and are
effective against a wide variety of infectious diseases (Kabelic <em>et
al.</em> 1960, Mikuriya 1969). These antibiotic properties have
been demonstrated with both <em>Cannabis</em> extracts (Ferenczy <em>et
al.</em> 1958, Kabelic <em>et al.</em> 1960, Radosevic <em>et al.</em>
1962) and a variety of isolated cannabinoids (ElSohly <em>et al.</em>
1982, Farkas and Andrassy 1976, Gal and Vajda 1970, Van Klingeren
and Ten Ham 1976). CBG has been compared (Mechoulam and Gaoni
1965) in both &quot;structure and antibacterial properties to
grifolin, an antibiotic from the basidiomycete <em>Grifolia
conflens</em>.&quot; Ferency (1956) has demonstrated the
antibiotic properties of <em>Cannabis</em> seed, a factor that
may aid its survival when overwintering. Adherent resin on the
seed surface, as well as a surrounding mulch of spent <em>Cannabis</em>
leaves, may serve in this regard. </p>

<p>Some of the many fungal pathogens that affect <em>Cannabis</em>
include <em>Alternaria alterata</em> (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), <em>Ascochyta
prasadii</em> (Shukla and Pathak 1967), <em>Botryosphaeria
marconii</em> (Charles and Jenkins 1914), <em>Cercospora
cannabina</em> and <em>C. cannabis</em> (Lentz <em>et al.</em>
1974), <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> (McCain and Noviello 1985), <em>Phoma</em>
sp. (Srivastava and Naithani 1979) and <em>Phomopsis ganjae</em>
(McPartland 1984). </p>

<p>While <em>A. alterata</em> attacks Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>
and destroys 2.8-45.5% of the seed (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), the
balance of these species are leaf spot diseases. McPartland
(1984) has demonstrated the inhibitory effects of THC and CBD on <em>Phomopsis
ganjae</em>. However, De Meijer <em>et al.</em> (1992), in
evaluating a large collection of <em>Cannabis</em> genotypes, did
not find a correlation between cannabinoid content and the
occurence of <em>Botrytis</em>. Fungal evolution of a mechanism
for overcoming the plant's cannabinoid defenses may be
responsible for their success as pathogens. Indeed, some have
been demonstrated to metabolize THC and other cannabinoids
(Binder 1976, Binder and Popp 1980, Robertson <em>et al.</em>
1975). </p>

<h3>Ultraviolet radiation</h3>

<p>Another stress to which plants are subject results from their
daily exposure to sunlight. While necessary to sustain
photosynthesis, natural light contains biologically destructive
ultraviolet radiation. This selective pressure has apparently
affected the evolution of certain defenses, among them, a
chemical screening functionally analogous to the pigmentation of
human skin. A preliminary investigation (Pate 1983) indicated
that, in areas of high ultraviolet radiation exposure, the UV-B
(280-315 nm) absorption properties of THC may have conferred an
evolutionary advantage to <em>Cannabis</em> capable of greater
production of this compound from biogenetic precursor CBD. The
extent to which this production is also influenced by
environmental UV-B induced stress has been experimentally
determined by Lydon <em>et al.</em> (1987). Their experiments
demonstrate that under conditions of high UV-B exposure,
drug-type <em>Cannabis</em> produces significantly greater
quantities of THC. They have also demonstrated the chemical
lability of CBD upon exposure to UV-B (Lydon and Teramura 1987),
in contrast to the stability of THC and CBC. However, studies by
Brenneisen (1984) have shown only a minor difference in UV-B
absorption between THC and CBD, and the absorptive properties of
CBC proved considerably greater than either. Perhaps the
relationship between the cannabinoids and UV-B is not so direct
as first supposed. Two other explanations must now be considered.
Even if CBD absorbs on par with THC, in areas of high ambient
UV-B, the former compound may be more rapidly degraded. This
could lower the availability of CBD present or render it the less
energetically efficient compound to produce by the plant.
Alternatively, the greater UV-B absorbency of CBC compared to THC
and the relative stability of CBC compared to CBD might nominate
this compound as the protective screening substance. The presence
of large amounts of THC would then have to be explained as merely
an accumulated storage compound at the end of the enzyme-mediated
cannabinoid pathway. However, further work is required to resolve
the fact that Lydon's (1985) experiments did not show a
commensurate increase in CBC production with increased UV-B
exposure. </p>

<p>This CBC pigmentation hypothesis would imply the development
of an alternative to the accepted biochemical pathway from CBG to
THC via CBD. Until 1973 (Turner and Hadley 1973), separation of
CBD and CBC by gas chromatography was difficult to accomplish, so
that many peaks identified as CBD in the preceding literature may
in fact have been CBC. Indeed, it has been noted (De Faubert
Maunder 1970) and corroborated by GC/MS (Turner and Hadley 1973)
that some tropical drug strains of <em>Cannabis</em> do not
contain any CBD at all, yet have an abundance of THC. This
phenomenon has not been observed for northern temperate varieties
of <em>Cannabis</em>. Absence of CBD has led some authors (De
Faubert Maunder 1970, Turner and Hadley 1973) to speculate that
another biogenetic route to THC is involved. Facts scattered
through the literature do indeed indicate a possible alternative.
Holley <em>et al.</em> (1975) have shown that Mississippi-grown
plants contain a considerable content of CBC, often in excess of
the CBD present. In some examples, either CBD or CBC was absent,
but in no case were plants devoid of both. Their analysis of
material grown in Mexico and Costa Rica served to accentuate this
trend. Only one example actually grown in their respective
countries revealed the presence of any CBD, although appreciable
quantities of CBC were found. The reverse seemed true as well.
Seed from Mexican material devoid of CBD was planted in
Mississippi and produced plants containing CBD. </p>

<p>Could CBC be involved in an alternate biogenetic route to THC?
Yagen and Mechoulam (1969) have synthesized THC (albeit in low
yield) directly from CBC. The method used was similar to the acid
catalyzed cyclization of CBD to THC (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1966).
Reaction by-products included cannabicyclol, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and <em>delta</em>-4,8-iso-THC, all products which have been
found in analyses of <em>Cannabis</em> (e.g., Novotny <em>et al.</em>
1976). Finally, radioisotope tracer studies (Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1975) have uncovered the intriguing fact that radiolabeled CBG
fed to a very low THC-producing strain of <em>Cannabis</em> is
found as CBD, but when fed to high THC-producing plants, appeared
only as CBC and THC. Labeled CBD fed to a Mexican example of
these latter plants likewise appeared as THC. Unfortunately,
radiolabeled CBC was not fed to their plants, apparently in the
belief that CBC branched off the biogenetic pathway at CBD and
dead ended. Their research indicated that incorporation of
labeled CBG into CBD or CBC was age dependent. Vogelman <em>et
al.</em> (1988) likewise report that the developmental stage of
seedlings, as well as their exposure to light, affects the
occurrence of CBG, CBC or THC in Mexican <em>Cannabis</em>. No
CBD was reported. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although the chemistry of <em>Cannabis</em> has come under
extensive investigation, more work is needed to probe the
relationship of its resin to biotic and abiotic factors in the
environment. Glandular trichomes are production sites for the
bulk of secondary compounds present. It is probable that the
cannabinoids and associated terpenes serve as defensive agents in
a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial, antifeedant and UV-B
pigmentation roles. UV-B selection pressures seem responsible for
the distribution of THC-rich <em>Cannabis</em> varieties in areas
of high ambient radiation, and may have influenced the evolution
of an alternate biogenetic pathway from CBG to THC in some of
these strains. Though environmental stresses appear to be a
direct stimulus for enhanced chemical production by individual
plants, it must be cautioned that such stresses may also skew
data by hastening development of the highly glandular flowering
structures. Future studies will require careful and
representative sampling to assure meaningful results. </p>

<HEAD><TITLE>Dear Membership</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#FF00FF">
<H2>Dear Membership,</H2>
It has been an exciting 6 months since
publication of our premier issue and your response has been overwhelming.
Our membership has doubled, substantially advancing us toward
the goal of 1000 dues-paying members. This goal represents a financial
break-even point, enabling the IHA to become self-sufficient!
We suggest that all our present members send us a list of people
they consider good candidates for membership, and we will contact
them. Also, please show the first two issues of the journal to
libraries, universities or other institutions that you think might
be interested in subscribing to the JIHA, on a Sustaining Member
basis. Don't forget to send us your 1995 membership renewal fee
before March 31! Remember, all operating expenses and project
funding come from annual membership dues and the private donations
of a generous few.
<P>
We have received a lot of good publicity
around the world, having been mentioned or featured in articles
from Economic Botany (US), Farmers Weekly (UK), the Amsterdam
daily newspaper Het Parool, the Dutch national newspaper Agrarisch
Dagblad and the last 3 issues of Hemp World (US). Upcoming articles
about the IHA will appear in Diversity (US) and elsewhere. We
are also seeking funding from foundations, the Italian government
and the European Union, for support of our project to save the
world&iacute;s most extensive collection of hemp varieties, located
at the Vaviliov Research Institute (VIR).
<P>
Many prospective new members ask, "What
do I get for my annual membership fee, besides the journal?".
Your dues go towards initiation and support of many projects,
worldwide. Included are the following:
<P>
1. The aforementioned VIR project, with
activities expanded in 1994 to include grow-outs in Italy and
the Ukraine, as well as Russia. (See page 68 of this issue.)
<P>
2. Although not yet fully implemented,
the IHA is developing archives of live hemp seed lots (1-50 kg)
for every developed hemp variety available and a few native land
races, too. This gives researchers and entrepreneurs quick access
and enables them to avoid having to spend many months locating
and procuring these seeds. As a result, start-up projections will
be shorter for their pilot projects. We can also aid in locating
commercial amounts of most varieties.
<P>
3. The IHA is attempting to put the
world&iacute;s <I>Cannabis</I> literature (&gt;20,000 citations)
on a computer. First to come will be a simple title/author/journal-or-book
citation. Later, they will be annotated or abstracted. Finally,
their full text and illustrations will be included. The cost of
this will be very high (&gt;US$ 200,000) and there are copyright
problems to be worked out, but a feasibility study has been done
and the initial steps have been made. Included in this project
is translation of the entire VIR bibliography from the original
Russian to English. This project will forge a tool that we feel
will eventually become an indispensible part of every serious
<I>Cannabis</I> researcher&iacute;s information-access repertoire.
<P>
4. We are entertaining the idea of having
a convention of IHA members in the Netherlands, sometime in 1996,
as our membership rolls and funding permit. We are presently involved
in the upcoming BIORESOURCE HEMP events in Frankfurt, March 2-5,
1994 (see page 64).
<P>
A computer group in Luxembourg has offered
to distribute the JIHA over the Internet (USENET ALT.HEMP). This
is being done by other scientific publications (see <I>Scientific
American</I>, December 1994, pages 72-77). The advantages of having
more information accessable to more people are obvious, and may
well result in a larger membership. However, this may alienate
present dues-paying members. For the moment, as a trial, we will
display the VIR cover story of the JIHA Vol. 1, #1, along with
our Guide for Authors and the back cover displaying a membership
application, in an effort to increase membership and donations.
A compromise has been suggested that only outdated issues of the
JIHA be put on "The Net". Please let us know what
you think about this topic. We do care about your opinion!
<P>
Speaking of computers, an apology is
due to those who may have tried to contact us at our e-mail address.
Our computer has been "down" for many weeks. For
the present, the most reliable way to contact us is by fax or
via the good ol&iacute; post office. <BR>

sponsors projects in several countries and publishes a journal
for its members. The IHA is supported by memberships and by donations
from foundations, corporations and individuals.
<P>
Although many IHA members may feel that
in light of the great economic potential of <I>Cannabis,</I> the
current legal restrictions hampering <I>Cannabis</I> research
and hemp cultivation should be reconsidered, the IHA does not
endorse a political stance on <I>Cannabis</I> legislation, nor
will it serve as a forum for the <I>Cannabis</I> legalization
debate.<BR>
<P>

<P>
The IHA has three types of membership:
Student (US $25/NLG 45 per year), Individual (US $50/NLG 90 per
year) and Sustaining (US $100/NLG 180 or more per year). Membership
participation will be balloted. Members may order additional or
previous issues for US $10 (postpaid), non-members pay US $ 15
(postpaid). Members joining after June may join for the next year
and purchase the issues of the current year. Payments may be made
by International Postal Money Order, American Express/Thomas CookMoney Order, or via AmEx credit card.
<P>
Authors who contribute an accepted article
to the journal will receive a year's membership including subscription
to the journal. Sustaining members can direct their contribution
toward any specific project they prefer. A financial audit of
income and expenditures is available to sustaining members.<BR>
<P>
Submission of manuscripts
<P>
The IHA Journal publishes original research,
literature reviews and news items on hemp. Preferably, contributions
should not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words).
Longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized
in two consecutive issues. Manuscripts can be submitted in triplicate
to: IHA Journal, Editorial Office, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam,
The Netherlands. Once a paper is accepted, the preferred medium
of submission is on disk (Macintosh or MS-DOS format), preferably
MS Word 5.0 or later, with accompanying manuscript. A guide for
authors can be found on page
65 of this issue or can be obtained from the IHA.

<H2>Congratulatory</H2>
Congratulations on a journal, well done. The Journal of the International Hemp Association is the world&Otilde;s first authoritative organ on the economic botany of hemp. A peer reviewed journal offering a balanced blend of scholarly and newsworthy information, JIHA is destined to become the main vehicle of information critical to the renewed industrializaton of hemp. I recommend it as essential reading, whether one&#146;s interest is medical, economic, agricultural or general.

<H2>Australian</H2>

Australian Hemp Recource and Manufacture (AHRM) is a business recently formed in Brisbane, Australia. The ultimate objective of this business is to pave the way for broad acre planting of fibre hemp throughout the country.
<P>

In all the states and territories of Australia, <I>Cannabis</I> is classified as an illicit drug and as a consequence, <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> seeds, plant material and various by-products are subject to legal prosecution. Slowly, Australians are waking up to the fact that selected varieties of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> have a very high agricultural value with absolutely no drug value.
<P>

Past endeavours to start a hemp industry in Australia have been clouded over by the highly volatile drug debate involving the decriminalisation or legalisation of marijuana. This debate has been running for several decades and appears to be no closer to a united resolution.
<P>

In the meantime, any importation of <I>Cannabis</I> seed is illegal and subject to extensive scrutiny (as experienced in the Tasmanian experiments, see JIHA, Vol. 1, #1).
<P>
As an initial step in the development of a hemp industry in this country, AHRM aims to challenge the blanket drug status of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I>. We are asking the governments to distinguish between the drug and fibre varieties of the plant. This is certainly not a novel approach, as both the United Nations and the E.C. have recognised <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> as an agricultural crop for a number of years. Understandably seed would be sourced by authorised bodies from registered fibre hemp seed companies that comply with international standards.
<P>
Once the two types of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> have been officially distinguished and recognised  hemp industry on a major scale will be the same as introducing any other major crop into this country. Fibre hemp will finally be disentangled from the drug debate where it logically does not belong.

<H2>Serious</H2>

I have received the premier issue of the Journal, and I am pleased to note the serious approach that you are taking; we certainly need much more solid research than we now have.
<P>
It is shameful that our approach to hemp use and abuse remains so puerile, ignorant and vindictive. We do need truthful information about responsible drug use and irresponsible drug abuse, of both licit and illicit drugs. We need to change the entrenched bureaucratic policies so totally committed to zero tolerance that police state environments are created. We need to change from repressive responses (police arrest, prosecution, and prison) to positive responses (education, decriminalization, treatment and rehabilitation) - no easy task, for it entails demonstrating that existing policies are counterproductive and only exacerbate a very sad situation. We seem unable to learn from history, but perhaps the generations to come can learn. And perhaps the Journal of the International Hemp Association can play a major role in effecting needed change of national and international policies. Good luck!

technology to harvest and store fibre hemp for paper pulp</b>.
Journal of the International Hemp Association 1: 38-41.</p>

<p> After mowing fibre hemp in September, field-drying is
weather-dependent and therefore not reliable under Dutch weather
conditions. Direct harvesting can be done by field choppers
equipped with a row-independent header. Storage and preservation
of the wet material on the farm is possible under acid and
alkaline anaerobic conditions. No losses of cellulose were
measured, but fibre strength was decreased. Bark and core can
easily be separated by water flotation of the preserved chopped
stems. Decortication of the stems in the field was less effective
and would be more expensive. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1990, the Dutch government initiated a four year programme
to research the technical and economic feasibility of cultivating
fibre hemp for paper pulp. Both bast and core had to be processed
and the objective was to cultivate a crop with a maximum fibre
yield. This meant that harvest could not start before September
and that traditional harvesting methods might not be suitable. </p>

<h3>Available harvesting systems for tall fibre crops</h3>

<p>Fibre hemp is usually grown for textile fibres. For this
application, the strength, colour, softness and fineness of the
bast fibres are very important and harvesting technique focuses
on these aspects (for example, a retting process is necessary).
Because of the decreased demand for bast fibres, in most areas
the mechanization of bast fibre crops is not advanced. In the
Ukraine, hemp is mown and laid down in swaths to ret (van der
Werf 1994). In the USA, an experimental machine was developed to
cut kenaf. The stems were also laid down in a swath to ret or to
dry (USDA 1988). In Australia, sugar cane harvesters and field
choppers have been used to harvest kenaf for paper pulp (Wilkes <i>et
al.</i> 1969, Wood <i>et al</i>. 1978). Both types of machines
technically functioned well, but the harvest costs of a sugar
cane harvester were found to be much higher than those of a field
chopper. In the USA and Australia, initial attempts to start a
kenaf-processing industry failed.</p>

<p> In France, 6000 ha of fibre hemp is grown for processing into
paper pulp. Two harvesting systems are used, depending on whether
the seed is to be harvested or not (FNPC 1985). For the best and
highest fibre yield, the hemp is cut with a mower conditioner for
field drying in the third week of August. In about 4 days, the
moisture content is under 15% and the hemp is baled with a round
baler. However, if the seed is also to be harvested, the stem
tops are cut and threshed with a combine in the first week of
September. Subsequently, the crop is mown and laid down in a
swath to dry. With this second harvesting system the fibre yield
is much lower (depending on the cutting height of the combine)
and because of poor weather conditions in September, the fibre
quality can be lower. </p>

<h3>Research objectives</h3>

<p>From the beginning of the Dutch Hemp Research Programme, two
specific research topics were formulated. First, a system for
preservation and storage of the harvest was needed so as to
enable supply of pulp processing plants with fibres for the whole
year. Because hemp may not be harvested dry, many experiments
were performed concerning the preservation and storage of wet
hemp. Secondly, the processing of hemp into paper pulp demands a
separation of bark and core because these fractions differ
physically (fibre length and diameter) and chemically (cellulose
and lignin content) (Zomers <i>et al</i>. 1991). The separation
may be done as a harvest operation in the field or as a
preprocessing step of the pulping. The Institute of Agricultural
and Environmental Engineering (IMAG-DLO), together with the
Department of Agricultural Engineering and Physics of the
Wageningen Agricultural University, investigated these aspects to
determine the best processing chain in which harvest,
preservation, storage and bark/core separation are integrated. </p>

<h2>Materials and methods</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>Field tests were carried out with a cutter bar, a mower
conditioner, balers, field choppers and a decorticator. All
machines, except the decorticator, are commonly used in other
crops. When relevant and necessary, minor adaptions were made to
make them suitable for hemp. The main objective of the field
tests was to learn and solve the difficulties in handling a fibre
hemp crop utilizing different techniques.</p>

<p> We investigated the possibility of wet preservation by
anaerobic storage. The hemp stems were cut in short pieces (1 cm)
and preserved in bottles of 1.5&nbsp;l capacity. After flushing
with nitrogen, the bottles were closed air tight. To create
different environments, we used the following additives: <i>Foraform </i>(Barenbrug
Holland BV), a silage additive consisting primarily (92%) of
formic acid; kitchen salt; sodium hydroxide; and <i>Silage
inoculant 1188</i> (Pioneer Hi-bred Nederland BV), a silage
additive containing <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Streptococcus
facium</i>. After preservation, pH was measured of a 1:10 aquatic
extract. The cellulose and hemicellulose sugars and the lignin
were determined using an analysis derived from TAPPI-249 and
TAPPI-222 (de Maeyer and Huisman 1994). Bast fibres were cooked
for 1 hour in a 2% sodium hydroxide solution and the strength was
measured in a controlled environment (23<sup>o</sup> C, relative
humidity 50%) with a stelometer according to ASTM D-1445 (ASTM
1967). </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<p>We used 3 methods to separate bark and core: decortication of
green stems in the field, sieving of chopped stems, and flotation
of chopped stems. The decorticator broke the core of whole stems
and beat the core pieces from the bark. The sieving and flotation
of chopped stems were done after a 6 month wet preservation
period. The sieve dimensions were 2 x 4 cm. With flotation, the
hemp was thrown into a bath of slow moving water in which part of
the pieces floated and the rest sank. By measuring bark and core
masses, we determined the efficiency of each operation. </p>

<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>For storage of dry hemp, the moisture content must be less
than 15% to avoid fibre decay by micro-organisms. In France,
field drying takes at least 4 days for the crop to reach the
necessary dry matter (dm) content of 85%. Comparing weather data
from two Dutch and two French weather stations, we estimate that
in the Netherlands, on average, 6 days of dry weather in
succession are needed to have the hemp sufficiently dried. Based
upon data of the workability of the grain harvest (Portiek 1975),
in September for 9 out of 10 years, only 3.5 days are available
to harvest winter wheat with a moisture content below 24%. If the
moisture content of wheat is higher than 23%, it is not expected
that a mown hemp crop, lying on the ground, will reach the
necessary moisture content of less than 15%. So, in September,
the field drying period would be longer than 6 days for many of
the years and the crop would start dew retting. This would
decrease bast fibre strength (Hessler 1945, Robinson 1946). If
the crop stays wet, retting can even become rotting. So, we
concluded that field drying is not reliable in the Netherlands in
September.</p>

<p> Chopping of the standing crop is less weather dependent and a
field chopper with a row independent header can mow the crop
easily. Fewer problems occurred with a drum type chopper than
with a flywheel type chopper. To avoid blockages, the crop chute
must be smooth and without any augers or blind areas. The knives
must be sharp and the chopping length set short (6&nbsp;mm). To
handle hemp, great attention has to be paid to avoid bark
wrapping around rotating machine parts.</p>

<p> After chopping, the hemp has a dm content of 33%. Artificial
drying is too expensive, so we tried to preserve the hemp by
ensiling (wet anaerobic preservation). In corn or grass silages,
lactic acid bacteria consume available sugars and produce lactic
acid to yield a pH of 4.2. Then the product is preserved and no
further losses occur (McDonald <i>et al</i>. 1991). In hemp
silage, the pH did not drop to 4.2, even after addition of lactic
acid bacteria. The reason for this was lack of the necessary
sugars. Only 4 g of sugars per kg of stem dm were available and
based upon grass silage, about 75 g are needed for a sufficient
fermentation (Wieringa 1961). Despite the inadequate
fermentation, no cellulose or hemicellulose was lost in silage
(Table 1). Only with the addition of sodium hydroxide did some
hemicellulose and lignin dissolve. This was also shown by de
Groot <i>et al</i>. (1994). Impregnation of hemp core, during 30
minutes with 1 M sodium hydroxide at 20<sup>o</sup> C, removed
some xylan (the main component of the hemicellulose) and some
lignin.</p>

<p> It is important to maintain fibre strength when processing
the bast for paper pulp. Paper tensile strength is positively
correlated with the quantity and the quality of the bast fibres.
The bast fibre strength was best preserved in an acidic
(pH&lt;4.5) or alkaline (pH&gt;12) environment (Table 2).
However, even under these circumstances fibre strength decreased.
Because the control fibres, after 3 and 6 months, were not the
same (dry compared to frozen fibres), no clear results can be
given on the decrease of fibre stength in time. However, the big
difference between the data after 3 and 6 months' storage
indicate that fibre strength may be slowly decreasing, even in a
stable acidic or alkaline environment. More research is necessary
to determine how much this strength decreases and whether this
decrease can be stopped. </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<pre>Figure 1 presents the results of decortication in the field and the separation of bark and core after chopping and ensiling, by sieving or by flotation. With decortication, the bark could not be cleaned well enough and still contained more than 40% of the core. About two thirds of this core was not attached to the bark. Bark and loose core should be easily separable by sieving since the size of the bark and of the loose core pieces greatly differ. The length of the core pieces ranged from 1 to 8 cm and the length of the bark from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The quantity of the remaining fixed core would be very difficult to reduce. It was clear that the quantity of fixed core mainly depended on stem diameter: the smaller the diameter, the higher the quantity of fixed core.</pre>

<p> With field chopping, the bark was not cut as short as the
core. The bark was very tough and the knives stripped some of the
bark from the core. So after chopping, about 90% of the mixture
consisted of clean bark and core pieces. This made it possible to
separate bark and core by sieving or flotation. Sieving of
chopped hemp resulted in a 'contamination rate' of both bark and
core of about 25%, since the size difference between the chopped
bark and core was not big enough to separate them by sieving.
With flotation, very clean bast could be collected, although some
bark floated because it stuck to a piece of core, resulting in
its collection with the core.</p>

<p> A disadvantage of decortication is the low processing
capacity. The costs would be high, approximately 110 Dfl per ton
of dm, especially because the machine only can be used in hemp.
Flotation seems most satisfactory and would cost approximately 5
Dfl per ton of dm. It is expected that a simple chopping
operation of the floating material can reduce the mass of bark in
the core. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<pre>Field choppers equipped with a row-independent header can harvest fibre hemp, but the sharpness of the knives and the throughput of the chopped fibres need special attention to prevent wrapping or blocking. The chopping operation loosens about 90% of the bark and core. Because the bark sinks in water and the core floats, flotation is an easy and effective separation method. This operation perfectly fits into a harvesting system with chopping and ensiling. In a system of cultivation, harvest and storage of fibre hemp, wet anaerobic preservation is the most uncertain factor for the supply of consistent good-quality fibres throughout the year. Acidic and alkaline preservation techniques seem to be the best methods, but more research is needed on these processes, with special attention paid to the observed decrease in fibre strength.

<p> Use of marijuana as a medicament is on the rise. Many medical
marijuana users have a suppressed immune system, owing to their
disease or treatment. Herbal marijuana, whether field grown or
hydroponically cultivated, contains many microorganisms. Many of
these organisms may pose a threat to immunosuppressed
individuals. The microflora of marijuana is well described in the
literature. Similarly, the microflora that cause opportunistic
infections in AIDS patients is well documented. These separate
literatures are correlated with commentary, and methods for
detecting and eliminating microbial contaminants are discussed. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug &quot;having no
medical use, with a high potential for abuse&quot; by the US Drug
Enforcement Administration. Nevertheless, a handful of US
citizens are permitted use of government-supplied &quot;medical
marijuana&quot; for a variety of ailments (Bowersox 1992).
Additionally, a large clinical trial utilizing marijuana in AIDS
patients has been approved in San Francisco (Doblin 1994).</p>

<p> Doblin and Kleiman (1991) document the widespread illicit use
of marijuana for medical purposes. Nearly half of the oncologists
polled by Doblin and Kleiman recommended that their patients
experiment with marijuana as a medicine. Many of these patients,
however, are immuno-suppressed, making them very susceptible to
opportunistic bacteria and fungi. Since hundreds of bacteria and
fungi are associated with the cultivation of marijuana
(McPartland 1991), possible microbiological hazards need to be
assessed.</p>

<p> A majority of the organisms associated with marijuana are
strictly plant pathogens. They cannot infect healthy humans. But
a subset of opportunistic plant pathogens are associated with
&quot;post-harvest&quot; or &quot;storage&quot; decay of
marijuana. These organisms may infect immuno-compromised
individuals and become opportunistic human pathogens.
Additionally, many opportunist organisms on plants produce
dangerous toxins and/or elicit allergenic reactions when inhaled.</p>

<p> Lastly, a handful of strictly human pathogens have been
isolated from marijuana, as contaminants. These agents are highly
infectious, and some also exude toxins. </p>

<h2>AIDS and opportunistic infections</h2>

<p>People with AIDS are immunosuppressed, and very susceptible to
infections. According to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), the most
common infectious agents include viruses (cytomegalovirus,
hepatitis A &amp; B, herpes simplex), bacteria (<i>Mycobacterium</i>
spp., <i>Salmonella</i> spp.), fungi (<i>Cryptococcus neoformans,
Coccidiodies immitis, Histoplasma capsu-atum, Candida</i> spp.),
and protozoans (<i>Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii,
Cryptosporidium</i> sp.).</p>

<p> Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990) also describe rare infections in
AIDS patients caused by opportunistic fungi &#151; <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus, Penicillium marneffei, Fusarium proliferatum,
Alternaria alternata, Mucor</i> sp., <i>Rhizopus</i> sp., <i>Curvularia</i>
sp., and <i>Bipolaris</i> sp.</p>

<p> Most of these organisms infect people <i>via</i> the
respiratory tract, or by oral-mucosal contact with contaminated
material. Inhaling a marijuana cigarette contaminated with any of
these organisms poses a risk. </p>

<h2>Microflora of marijuana</h2>

<h3>Viruses and protozoans</h3>

<p>Cates &amp; Warren (1975) associated marijuana use with an
epidemic of hepatitis B in Germany, but did not isolate the virus
from plant material. An outbreak of Hepatitis A in Washington
state was linked to consumption of Mexican marijuana, fertilized
with human excrement (Alexander 1987). No protozoans are reported
from marijuana in the literature. </p>

<h3>Bacteria</h3>

<p>Several bacteria species cited as present on marijuana are
human pathogens, and produce toxins: Taylor <i>et al.</i> (1982)
isolated <i>Salmonella muenchen </i>from illicit marijuana.
Ungerlerder <i>et al.</i> (1982) cultivated <i>Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae,</i> <i>E. agglomerans,</i>
group D <i>Streptococcus, </i> and <i>Bacillus</i> sp. from
marijuana supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA). Kurup <i>et al.</i> (1983) isolated several thermophilic
actinomycetes from marijuana cigarettes, including <i>Thermoactinomyces
candidus, T. vulgaris, </i> and <i>Micropolyspora faeni.</i>
These organisms, while not infectious, cause allergic pneumonitis
in hypersensitive individuals. </p>

<h3>Fungi</h3>

<p>In the popular press, Margolis and Clorfene (1975) and DuToit
(1980) describe molds colonizing marijuana in the United States
and South Africa, respectively. Surprisingly, both accounts
report the mold enhancing psychotropic effects of marijuana.
These publications initiated a fad among marijuana users, who
exposed their marijuana to molds in the hope of increasing the
potency of their crop.</p>

<p> The &quot;black weblike fungus&quot; described by Margolis
&amp; Clorfene (1975) suggests an <i>Aspergillus</i> species.
Chusid <i>et al.</i> (1975) cite <i>A. fumigatus</i> causing
pneumonitis in a patient who buried his marijuana in the ground
for &quot;aging.&quot; <i> </i>Llamas <i>et al.</i> (1978)
recovered <i>A. fumigatus </i> from marijuana owned by a patient
suffering allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Kagen (1981)
isolated several <i>Aspergillus</i> species from moldy marijuana,
including <i>A. fumigatus, A. niger </i>and <i>A. flavus. </i>Babu <i>et
al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>A. niger, A. flavus, A. tamarii, A.
sulphureus,</i> and <i>A. repens</i> from seeds in marijuana.
Schwartz (1985) isolated <i>A. niger</i> from the sinuses of a
marijuana smoker who suffered severe headaches. Llewellyn &amp;
O'Rear (1977) demonstrated aflatoxin production in marijuana
contaminated with <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>A. parasiticus.</i></p>

<p> <i>Penicillium</i> species have been isolated from marijuana
cigarettes by Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i>
(1983). Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>P. chrysogenum</i>
from <i>Cannabis</i> seeds. Bush Doctor (1993) reports isolating <i>P.
italicum</i> from marijuana stored with an orange peel at 0<font
size="1">o </font>C.</p>

<p> <i>Mucor</i> species have been recovered from marijuana by
Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i> (1983). A
related zygomycete, <i>Rhizopus stolonifer,</i> was isolated from
damp marijuana by Bush Doctor (1993).</p>

<p> Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured several other fungi from <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds that, according to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), may cause
opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. These include <i>Alternaria
alternata </i>and <i>Curvularia lunata.</i> McPartland (1983,
1991, 1992) recovered these fungi from <i>Cannabis</i> in the
field, plus a <i>Fusarium</i> spp. All these fungi produce
toxins. Ramrez (1990) reports four policeman contracting
histoplasmosis, caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum,</i> after
destroying a <i>Cannabis</i> field in Puerto Rico. </p>

<h2>Detecting contaminants in marijuana</h2>

<p>Cultivators and consumers of illicit marijuana identify
microbiological contaminants by several crude, but seemingly
effective, screening techniques (Bush Doctor 1993). Their methods
mimic those used by tobacco growers (Lucas 1975). </p>

<h3>Visual screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana often darkens in color and exhibits
changes in surface texture. Strands of white to pale-gray fungal
hyphae become visible in moldy material. Exposed to light, the
fungi sporulate, providing a &quot;fuzzy&quot; appearance.
Generally, <i>Rhizopus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species produce
grey-black spores, <i>Penicillium</i> conidia are light
blue-green, and <i>Aspergillus</i> conidia are dark green-black. </p>

<h3>Olfactory screen</h3>

<p>Uncontaminated marijuana produces a minty or aromatic odor.
Once infested, the smell changes to a &quot;stale&quot; or
&quot;musty&quot; odor. Bush Doctor (1993) reports <i>P. italicum </i>producing
a lavender or lilac odor, and <i>A. flavus</i> &quot;smells like
a locker room.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana undergoing rapid decay may feel warm to
touch. </p>

<h3>Fluorescence screen</h3>

<p>Bush Doctor (1993) screened marijuana for aflatoxin-producing <i>A.
flavus</i> with a UV-A lamp. Contaminated material fluoresces a
light green color. This screening method has not been tested by
other researchers (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear 1977). </p>

<h3>Identification</h3>

<p>If any of the above screening tests is positive, the suspect
marijuana is discarded, without identifying the contaminant. If
identification is desired, the marijuana is either cultured or
bioassayed. Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kagen<i> et al.</i>
(1983) provide the description of culture methods used to
identify microbiological contaminants.</p>

<p> Marijuana can also be tested with bioassay kits, to detect
specific organisms. These assays utilize ELISA (enzyme linked
immunoabsorbent assay) biotechnology. They are more sensitive
than cultures and much quicker, but also much more expensive.
Positive identification of microbiological toxins may require gas
chromatography (Rood <i>et al</i>. 1988) </p>

<h2>Eliminating contaminants</h2>

<p>Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) demonstrated that spores of <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species survive in smoke drawn
from pyrolyzed marijuana cigarettes. Also, some microbiological
toxins are not degraded by combustion (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear
1977).</p>

<p> Moody <i>et al. </i>(1982) evaluated waterpipes for smoking <i>Aspergillus-</i>
contaminated marijuana. They found only a 15% reduction in
transmission of fungal spores.</p>

<p> Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home
ovens at 150<font size="1">o </font>C, for five minutes before
smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of <i>A. fumigatus, A.
flavus</i> and <i>A. niger, </i>and did not degrade the active
component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</p>

<p> Ungerlerder <i>et al. </i>(1982) gas-sterilized marijuana
with a mix of 12% ethylene oxide and 88% dichlorodifluoromethane,
at 8.5-10 psi, for 4.5-5 hours. They report no loss of THC from
fumigation. But residues remain in air pockets of fumigated
material, posing another health hazard. They also sterilized
marijuana with high-dose Cobalt 60 irradiation (20,000 Gray Units
or less), again without THC reduction.</p>

<p> None of these methods, however, degrade microbial antigens.
Sensitized patients may still develop bronchospasm after smoking
treated material. Nor do these methods decompose microbial
toxins.</p>

<p> The best method of eliminating microbial antigens and toxins
is by exclusion. This requires careful attention by both
cultivators and consumers. Proper cultivation techniques should
eliminate human pathogens. Careful cultivation also excludes most
opportunistic plant pathogens. Particular attention is required
at harvest, to avoid damaging marijuana before it completely
dries. Flue-cured marijuana contains fewer opportunistic fungi
than air or sweat-cured crops. Sweat-cured <i>Cannabis </i>
(common in illicit marijuana from Colombia) maintains a
&quot;tradition&quot; of <i>Aspergillus</i> contamination (Bush
Doctor 1993).</p>

<p> Bush Doctor (1975) states that infestation by opportunistic
fungi cannot occur in plant material below 15% moisture content
(MC). Properly dried marijuana contains about 10% MC (material
below 10% MC becomes excessively brittle). The dried, unmanicured
marijuana, in small aliquots, can then be vacuum-sealed in
plastic pouches. This packaging differs from the marijuana
currently supplied by NIDA. NIDA supplies marijuana as manicured,
pre-rolled cigarettes, in tin cans (Chait and Pierri 1989).</p>

<p> Opening sealed pouches of marijuana reexposes the material to
contamination. Consumers must prevent marijuana from resorbing
moisture above 15% MC. Storage at freezer temperatures will not
protect marijuana above 15% MC. Placing a lemon or orange peel in
stored marijuana (to impart a &quot;pleasant bouquet,&quot;
according to Frank and Rosenthal, 1978) is discouraged, because
the peel may introduce <i>Penicillium</i> or <i>Aspergillus</i>
spp. into the stored marijuana. Contaminated material should be
discarded. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Many publications have described a variety of microorganisms
resident on marijuana. Nevertheless, most researchers remain
unaware of these hazards. Schwartz (1987) wonders if the source
of a young patient's <i>Curvularia lunata</i> sinusitis could be
from contaminated marijuana. Brummund <i>et al.</i> (1987) reply
that this is possible, but no <i>Curvularia </i>species have been
cited in the <i>Cannabis </i>literature. However, this was indeed
reported by Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977). More recently, another
Schwartz (1992) states, &quot;I am unaware of any report of non-<i>Aspergillus </i>fungal
contamination of marijuana cigarettes.&quot; The publications
cited herein, provide such reports.</p>

<p> Carefully cultivated and harvested marijuana harbors a
minimum of hazardous microorganisms. For added protection,
material must be screened for contamination before it is packaged
for use as medical marijuana. Since opportunistic infections pose
the greatest danger to immunosuppressed consumers, marijuana
should be sterilized, preferably by gamma irradiation. Lastly,
consumers must be given careful instructions to ensure their
marijuana does not become contaminated prior to use. </p>

This article concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. It presents the major results of one laboratory and three on-road driving studies. The latter were conducted on a closed section of a primary highway, on a highway in the presence of other traffic and in urban traffic, respectively. This program of research has shown that marijuana produces only a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to the consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a steady lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight into their performance and will compensate where they can (<I>e.g</I>., by increasing distance between vehicles or increasing effort). As a consequence, THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program.
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

After alcohol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), marijuana's major psychoactive constituent,  is the drug which is found most often in the blood of drivers involved in road accidents. With some exceptions, epidemiological studies indicate the presence of THC in roughly 4-12% of drivers injured or killed in traffic accidents: for example, 10% in New York (Terhune 1982), 7% in New South Wales (Chesher and Starmer 1983), 8% in North Carolina (Mason and McBay 1984), 11% in D&#159;sseldorf (Daldrup <I>et al</I>. 1987), 10% in Tasmania (McLean 1987) and 11% in Ontario (Cimbura <I>et al</I>. 1990). The most recent data regarding the incidence of drugs in fatally injured drivers in the United States are available from a nationwide study conducted in 1990 and 1991 (Terhune <I>et al.</I> 1992): THC was found in only 4% of the drivers. This relatively low percentage may indicate a declining trend in the incidence rate of THC in fatally injured drivers in the United States, explainable by the declining prevalence of marijuana use throughout the 1980s (Johnston <I>et al</I>. 1992).<P>
These numbers are, however, inconclusive regarding THC's contribution to accidents because alcohol has been a severe confounding factor in all surveys of injured or killed drivers: generally 60-80% of drivers who were found positive for THC also showed the presence of alcohol. Another problem of these surveys is the common lack of sound control groups. To determine whether drivers under the influence of THC are overrepresented in accidents, the THC incidence in accident victims should be compared to the THC incidence in randomly selected drivers passing the same accident site at the same times and days of the week. This has been done for alcohol (Borkenstein <I>et al</I>. 1974), but not for THC.<P>
The lack of separate control groups has been circumvented by the use of a 'culpability index'. This index is the ratio of the percentage of drivers with detectable drug levels and deemed responsible for a traffic accident to that of drug-free drivers from the same sample who were likewise culpable. But results from this approach have not been consistent: three studies yielded a culpability index of about 1.7 (Warren <I>et al</I>. 1981, Terhune 1982, Donelson <I>et al</I>. 1985), two other studies failed to find a significantly elevated culpability index for marijuana users (Williams <I>et al</I>. 1985, Terhune <I>et al</I>. 1992). For this and other reasons given above, the independent contribution of THC to accidents remains exceedingly obscure. Several literature reviews, the most recent by Robbe (1994), have shown that the results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in inhaled doses up to 250&#160;&#181;g/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance, certainly less than blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) in the range 0.08-0.10&#160;g%. In contrast to this, laboratory studies have repeatedly shown performance impairment occurring after inhaled doses as low as about 40 &#181;g/kg. These became large and persistent after 100-200 &#181;g/kg doses. Tracking, divided attention and vigilance test performance were particularly vulnerable to THC's effects. Assuming that both sets of results are valid for the particular circumstances under which they were obtained, they demonstrate that performance decrements obtained under the artificial and non-life threatening conditions in the laboratory do not automatically predict similar decrements in driving simulations that are closer to real-world driving. These conflicting results led, however, to opposing opinions regarding marijuana's effects on driving performance. Real-world driving studies were therefore warranted.<P>
Only one study (Klonoff 1974) had been conducted in actual traffic before the present research program started. In a city driving study, Klonoff assessed the effects of two THC doses, 4.9 and 8.4 mg, which are equivalent to 70 and 120&#160;&#181;g/kg for a 70 kg person. Aspects of subjects' driving performance were scored by a professional examiner. The results showed that subjects performed less competently when under the influence of the highest, but not the lowest dose. In particular, they scored lower on judgment and concentration scales. Several investigators, however, criticized the method used by Klonoff for measuring driving performance on the grounds that the examiners' reliability was never determined and that the scoring instrument had never been shown to provide measures related to driving safety (Moskowitz 1985, Smiley 1986). Furthermore, Klonoff administered relatively low THC doses to his subjects. The effects of high doses of THC on driving in real traffic still needed to be determined.<P>
The studies reported in this article were conducted to escape these limitations. First, the effects of low, moderate and high THC doses on highway driving were determined, both in the absence and presence of other traffic. Second, Klonoff's city driving study was replicated, with some modifications with regards to the employed procedures and with the addition of another group of subjects who undertook the same driving test but then under the influence of a low dose of alcohol.<P>
An important practical objective of the program was to determine whether degrees of driving impairment can be accurately predicted from either measured concentrations of THC in plasma or performance measured in potential roadside 'sobriety' tests of tracking ability or hand and posture stability. The results (Robbe 1994), like many reported before, indicate that none of these measures accurately predicts changes in actual driving performance under the influence of THC. 


<H2>General procedures</H2>
Subjects in all studies were recreational users of marijuana or hashish, <I>i.e.</I>, smoking the drug more than once a month, but not daily. They were all healthy, between 21 and 40 years of age, had normal weight and binocular acuity, and were licensed to drive an automobile. Furthermore, law enforcement authorities were contacted, with the volunteers' consent, to verify that they had no previous arrests or convictions for drunken driving or drug trafficking.<P>
Each subject was required to submit a urine sample immediately upon arrival at the test site. Samples were assayed qualitatively for the following common 'street drugs' (or metabolites): cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and barbiturates. In addition, a breath sample was analyzed for the presence of alcohol using a Lion-SD3 breath-analyzer.<P>
	Subjects were accompanied during every driving test by an licensed driving instructor. A redundant control system in the test vehicle was available for controlling the car, should emergency situations arise.<P>
Marijuana and placebo marijuana cigarettes were supplied by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. The lowest and highest THC concentrations in the marijuana cigarettes used in the studies were 1.75% and 3.57%, respectively.


<H2>Pilot study</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The pilot study was conducted in a hospital under strict medical supervision to identify THC doses that recreational marijuana users were likely to consume before driving. Twenty-four subjects, twelve males and twelve females, participated. They were allowed to smoke part or all of the THC content in three cigarettes until achieving the desired psychological effect. Cigarettes were smoked through a plastic holder in a manner determined by the subjects. The only requirement was to smoke for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. When subjects voluntarily stopped smoking, cigarettes were carefully extinguished and retained for subsequent gravimetric estimation of the amount of THC consumed.

<H3>Results</H3>
	Six subjects consumed one cigarette, thirteen smoked two and four smoked three. The average amount of THC consumed was 20.8&#160;mg, after adjustment for body weight, 308&#160;&#181;g/kg. It should be noted that the amounts of THC consumed represent both the inhaled dose and the portion that was lost through pyrolysis and side-stream smoke during the smoking process. There were no significant differences between males and females, nor between frequent and infrequent users, with respect to the weight adjusted preferred dose. It was decided that the maximum dose for subsequent driving studies would be 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. This is considerably higher than doses that have usually been administered to subjects in experimental studies (typically, 100&#173;200&#160;&#181;g/kg THC).

<H2>Study 1: Driving on a restricted highway</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The first driving study was conducted on a highway closed to other traffic. One objective of this study was to determine whether it would be safe to repeat the study on a normal highway in the presence of other traffic. The second objective was to define the dose-effect relationship between inhaled THC dose and driving performance. The same twelve men and twelve women who participated in the laboratory study served again as the subjects. They were treated on separate occasions with marijuana cigarettes containing THC doses of 0 (placebo), 100, 200, and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. Treatments were administered double-blind and in a counterbalanced order. On each occasion, subjects performed a road-tracking test beginning 40 minutes after initiation of smoking and repeated one hour later. The test, developed and standardized by O'Hanlon <I>et al.</I> (1982, 1986), involved maintaining a constant speed at 90&#160;km/h and a steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the traffic lane. Subjects drove 22&#160;km on a primary highway and were accompanied by a licensed driving instructor. The primary dependent variable was the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), which has been shown to be both highly reliable and very sensitive to the influence of sedative drugs and alcohol. Other dependent variables were mean speed, and standard deviation of speed and steering wheel angle.

<H3>Results</H3>
	All subjects were willing and able to finish the driving tests without great difficulty. The study demonstrated that marijuana impairs driving performance as measured by an increase in SDLP; all three THC doses significantly affected SDLP relative to placebo. The driving performance decrement after smoking marijuana persisted almost undiminished for two hours after smoking. Marijuana's effects on SDLP were compared to those of alcohol obtained in a very similar study by Louwerens <I>et al.</I> (1985, 1987). It appeared that the effects of the various administered doses of THC (100&#173;300&#160;&#181;g/kg) on SDLP were equivalent to those associated with BACs in the range of 0.03-0.07&#160;g%. Other driving performance measures were not significantly affected by THC. Both the observed degree of driving impairment, and what subjects said and did, indicated that normal safeguards would be sufficient for ensuring safety in further testing. Hence, the final conclusion was to repeat this study on a normal highway in the presence of other traffic.


<H2>Study 2: Driving on a normal highway in traffic</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
	The second driving study was conducted on a highway in the presence of other traffic and involved both a road-tracking and a car-following test. A new group of sixteen subjects, equally comprised of men and women, participated in this study. A conservative approach was chosen in designing the present study in order to satisfy the strictest safety requirements. That is, the study was conducted according to an ascending dose series design where both active drug and placebo conditions were administered, double-blind, at each of three THC dose levels. THC doses were the same as those used in the previous study, namely 100, 200, and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. Cigarettes appeared identical at each level of treatment conditions. If any subject had reacted in an unacceptable manner to a lower dose, he/she would not have been permitted to receive a higher dose.<P>
	The subjects began the car-following test 45 minutes after smoking. The test was performed on a 16&Ecirc;km stretch of the highway and lasted about 15 minutes. After the conclusion of this test, subjects performed a 64-km road-tracking test on the same highway which lasted about 50 minutes. At the conclusion of this test, they participated again in the car-following test.<P>
	The road-tracking test was the same as in the previous study except for its duration and the presence of other traffic. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant speed of 95&Ecirc;km/h and a steady lateral position between lane boundaries in the right traffic lane. They were allowed to deviate from this only if it became necessary to pass a slower vehicle in the same lane. Data from the standard test were analyzed to yield the same performance measures as in the previous study.<P>
	The car-following test involved attempting to match velocity with, and maintain a constant distance from a preceding vehicle as it executed a series of deceleration/acceleration maneuvers. The preceding vehicle's speed would vary between 80 and 100 km/h and the subject was instructed to maintain a 50 m distance however the preceding vehicle's speed might vary. The duration of one deceleration and acceleration maneuver was approximately 50 seconds and six to eight of these maneuvers were executed during one test, depending upon traffic density. The subject's average reaction time to the movements of the preceding vehicle, mean distance and coefficient of variation of distance during maneuvers were taken as the dependent variables from this.

<H3>Results</H3>
	All subjects were able to complete the series without suffering any untoward reaction while driving. Road-tracking performance in the standard test was impaired in a dose-related manner by THC and confirmed the results obtained in the previous closed highway study. The 100&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a slight elevation in mean SDLP, albeit not statistically significant. The 200&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a significant elevation, of dubious practical relevance. The 300&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a highly significant elevation which may be viewed as practically relevant but unexceptional in comparison with similarly measured effects of many medicinal drugs. After marijuana smoking, subjects drove with an average speed that was only slightly lower than after a placebo and very close to the prescribed level.<P>
	In the car-following test, subjects maintained a distance of 45&#173;50&#160;m while driving in the successive placebo conditions. They lengthened mean distance by 8, 6 and 2&#160;m in the corresponding THC conditions after 100, 200 and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg, respectively. The initially large drug-placebo difference and its subsequent decline is a surprising result. Our explanation for this observation is that the subjects' caution was greatest the first time they undertook the test under the influence of THC and progressively less thereafter. The reaction time of the subjects to changes in the preceding vehicle's speed increased following THC treatment, relative to placebo. The administered THC dose was inversely related to the change in reaction time, as it was to distance. However, increased reaction times were partly due to longer distance. Statistical adjustment for this confounding variable resulted in smaller and non-significant increases in reaction time following marijuana treatment, the greatest impairment (0.32 s) being observed in the first test following the lowest THC dose. Distance variability followed a similar pattern as mean distance and reaction time; the greatest impairment was found following the lowest dose.


<H2>Study 3: Driving in urban traffic</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
	The program proceeded to the third driving study, which involved tests conducted in high-density urban traffic. There were logical and safety reasons for restricting the THC dose to 100&#160;&#181;g/kg. It was given to a group of regular marijuana (or hashish) users, along with a placebo. For comparative purposes, another group of regular alcohol users was treated with a modest dose of its members' preferred recreational drug, ethanol, or a placebo, before undertaking the same city driving test. Two groups participated, each composed of sixteen new subjects comprising equal numbers of men and women. Subjects in the alcohol group were regular users of alcohol, but not marijuana. Both groups were treated on separate occasions with the active drug and a placebo. Marijuana was administered to deliver 100&Ecirc;&#181;g/kg THC. The driving test commenced 30 minutes after smoking. The alcohol dose was chosen to yield a BAC approaching 0.05&#160;g% when the driving test commenced 45 minutes after onset of drinking. Active drug and placebo conditions were administered double-blind and in a counterbalanced order in each group.<P>
	Driving tests were conducted in daylight over a constant 17.5 km route within the city limits of Maastricht. Subjects drove their placebo and active-drug rides through heavy, medium and low density traffic on the same day of the week, and at the same time of day. Two scoring methods were employed in the present study. The first, a 'molar' approach, required the driving instructor acting as the safety controller during the tests to rate the driver's performance retrospectively using a standard scale. The second, a more 'molecular' approach, involved the employment of a specially trained observer who applied simple and strict criteria for recording when the driver made or failed to make each in a series of observable responses at predetermined points along a chosen route.

<H3>Results</H3>
	The study showed that a modest dose of alcohol (BAC = 0.034&#160;g%) produced a significant impairment in city driving, as measured by the molar approach, relative to a placebo. More specifically, alcohol impaired both vehicle handling and traffic maneuvers. Marijuana, administered in a dose of 100&Ecirc;&#181;g/kg THC, on the other hand, did not significantly change mean driving performance as measured by this approach. Neither alcohol nor marijuana significantly affected driving performance measures obtained by the molecular approach, indicating that it may be relatively insensitive to drug-induced changes.<P>
	Driving quality, as rated by the subjects, contrasted with observer ratings. Alcohol impaired driving performance according to the driving instructor, but subjects did not perceive it; marijuana did not impair driving performance, but the subjects themselves perceived their driving performance as such. Both groups reported about the same amount of effort in accomplishing the driving test following a placebo. Yet only subjects in the marijuana group reported significantly higher levels of invested effort following the active drug. Thus there is evidence that subjects in the marijuana group were not only aware of their intoxicated condition, but were also attempting to compensate for it. These seem to be important findings. They support both the common belief that drivers become overconfident after drinking alcohol and investigators' suspicions that they become more cautious and self-critical after consuming low doses of THC, as smoked marijuana.


<H2>Discussion</H2>

The results of the studies corroborate those of previous driving simulator and closed-course tests by indicating that THC in inhaled doses up to 300&#160;&#181;g/kg has significant, yet not dramatic, dose-related impairing effects on driving performance. Standard deviation of lateral position in the road-tracking test was the most sensitive measure for revealing THC's adverse effects. This is because road-tracking is primarily controlled by an automatic information processing system which operates outside of conscious control. The process is relatively impervious to environmental changes, but highly vulnerable to internal factors that retard the flow of information through the system. THC and many other drugs are among these factors. When they interfere with the process that restricts SDLP, there is little the afflicted individual can do by way of compensation to restore the situation. Car-following and, to a greater extent, city driving performance depend more on controlled information processing and are therefore more accessible for compensatory mechanisms that reduce the decrements or abolish them entirely.<P>
	THC's effects after doses up to 300&#160;&#181;g/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08&#160;g% and were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs (Robbe 1994). Yet THC's effects differ qualitatively from many other drugs, especially alcohol. Evidence from the present and previous studies strongly suggests that alcohol encourages risky driving whereas THC encourages greater caution, at least in experiments. Another way THC seems to differ qualitatively from many other drugs is that the former's users seem better able to compensate for its adverse effects while driving under the influence.<P>
	Although THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program, one can still easily imagine situations where the influence of marijuana smoking might have a dangerous effect; i.e., emergency situations which put high demands on the driver's information processing capacity, prolonged monotonous driving, and after THC has been taken with other drugs, especially alcohol. Because these possibilities are real, the results of the present studies should not be considered as the final word. They should, however, serve as the point of departure for subsequent studies that will ultimately complete the picture of THC's effects on driving performance.

In the course of the last 30 years, the amount of land used in hemp production area in the former USSR as well as present-day Russia has been incessantly decreasing. Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, hemp was produced on 50-60 thousand hectares. However, the reduction in crop acreage was basically due to a mistaken government economic strategy, in which they preferred to purchase hemp fibre abroad, spending the equivalent of over US $200 million per year instead of developing domestic production. This policy resulted in the absence of complex harvest and post-harvest mechanized procedures and in insufficient funding of hemp breeding programmes.<P>
Despite these constraints, a number of regions (Poltava, Oryol, Krasnodar, etc.) produced good yields of fibre (1.0-1.2 tons/hectare) and seed (0.6-0.8 tons/hectare).


<H2>Fiber varieties</H2>
Breeding also progressed. Conventional breeding techniques were applied: hybridization, followed by continuous family/group selection. In later stages of seed production, mass selection methods were used.<P> 
The unceasing 20 year systematic selection for higher fiber content, performed at the All-Union Research Institute of Bast Crops (in Glukhov, Ukraine), increased this parameter by 13.8%, achieving a total plant fiber content of 35-37% in a number of varieties.<P>
These breeding programmes were based on the accessions of the plant genetic resources collection of the Vavilov Institute (VIR). For instance, cv. Yuzhnosozrevayushchaya Odnodomnaya 14 (YUSO-14) produced by the Institute was bred by family/group selection methods on progeny from crosses of female YUSO-1 (VIR Cat. no. 429*) and pollen from the monoecious Bernburg hemp of the former East Germany. This resulting cultivar now covers nearly half of the present hemp production area of Russia and is fairly uniform in its sexual expression, monoecious pistillate hemp accounting for up to 90% of the plants. Agricultural production of this strain yielded 1.0-1.2 tons of fiber and 1.3-1.5 tons of seed per hectare.<P> 
Cv. YUSO-16 has been bred from the French monoecious hemp cultivar Fibrimon 56 (VIR 537*). This cultivar is notable for a low cannabinoid content and a long vegetative period. Average fibre yield is 2.0 tons/hectare and seed yield is 1.0-1.2 tons/hectare.<P>
Cv. Dneprovskaya Odnodomnaya 6, a southern hemp cultivar, has been obtained by hybridization of the Hungarian cultivar Szegedy 9 (VIR 437) with Fibrimon 56 (VIR 537*), followed by family/group selection. This cultivar has high fibre yield (31.5%) and a seed yield of 0.55 ton/hectare. Plant height is up to 2.5 meters. 


<H2>Low-THC varieties</H2>

One of the priorities for the next few years of hemp breeding may be to obtain cultivars without active drug substances. In the initial breeding phase, the recommended cultivars with low cannabinoid content will be YUSO-14, YUSO-16 and Dnepropetrovskaya Odnodomnaya 6. The next phase will be marked by developing the cultivar Yuzhnosozrevayushchaya Odnodomnaya (YUSO-31), which contains half the THC content and ripens 5-6 days earlier than YUSO-14, but gives the same yields. An even lower cannabinoid content has been noticed in cv. Zolotonozhskaya YUSO-11.<P>
In recent years, the Krasnodar Research Institute of Agriculture has accomplished a series of experiments on breeding southern hemp with an absence of active cannabinoids. Selection of southern hemp without cannabinoids has been closely linked to breeding for higher fibre content and yield. This breeding was based on the families identified by means of multiphase family/group selection in the hybrid Szegedy 9 (VIR 437) X Krasnodarskaya 56 with individual analysis of each plant for its seed weight, stem fibre content and flower cannabinoid content, followed by testing of the identified families. Ten phases of selection resulted in a dioecious cultivar of southern hemp, Kuban, having a vegetative period of 160 days, only 20% of the THC content of the Krasnodarskaya 35 standard, a fibre content of 28.3%, a seed yield of 0.35 ton/hectare and a plant height of 260 cm. This cultivar is being produced commercialy on an area of 3,000 hectares.<P> 
Hemp breeders mastered a method which made it possible to identify cannabinoid content by thin-layer chromatography of selected leaves from each crop during the period from budding to flowering. This led to the establishment of the Transpollination Direction Nurseries (TDN) where plants were discarded or selected in accordance with precise data on their THC contents. In 1990, application of this method resulted in such new cultivars as YUSO-42 and YUSO-45, with THC contents of 0.004 and 0.007%, respectively.<P> 
Recently, a rapid method for plant cannabinoid content analysis has been developed on the basis of a qualitative reaction, and this has now been introduced into practice. It takes just 10-13 seconds to analyze each plant in the field before budding. Thus it is now possible to discard cannabinoid-containing plants before budding, greatly increasing the efficiency of selection against this trait and allowing a wider range of initial breeding stock. It should be noted that breeding for the absence of cannabinoids is accompanied by strict control over commercially valuable traits, despite the fact that practically no interrelationship between yield and cannabinoid content has been established.

<H2>Seed varieties</H2>

Hemp is cultivated primarily for fibre production, but hemp seed is also important. Seeds contain approximately 30-35% oil, which is used widely for industrial purposes and in food production. Optimum ratios of the fatty acids depend on the purpose of the oil. Industrial utilization requires a quick-drying oil with a high content of polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. These fatty acids are also highly desirable for human nutrition, but their chemical lability causes them to spoil easily in the presence of air and light. This imparts an unpleasant flavor to mishandled oils and requires special precautions to preserve oil freshness.<P> 
The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR in cooperation with the Biochemistry Laboratory have analyzed 100 hemp accessions of different origins, including 48 domestic and 52 foreign varieties acquired by the VIR which are characterized by good fibre quality and low drug content. Plantings were performed in the fields of the Ustimovka Experimental Station of the VIR (Poltava Province, 1983-1985). In spite of the plant varieties being from widely diverse origins, the variability in their seed fatty acid content was not large. Average data reported for three years revealed that palmitic content varied from 5.8 to 7.4%, stearic acid from 1.6 to 3.0%, oleic acid from 10.6 to 15.3%, linoleic acid from 55.6 to 59.5%, and linolenic acid from 16.2-24.3%.<P> 
Relatively high in linoleic acid (over 22%) were the accessions from Uzbekistan (VIR 455*), Armenia (VIR 482), Hungary (VIR 548*), and the cultivars Maikopskaya 1 (VIR 491*), Dneprovskaya 4 (VIR 510), Dneprovskaya 5 (VIR 511). High oil content (over 35%) was identified in the accessions from Daghestan (VIR 524), Karachaevo-Cherkessia (VIR 525), Hungary (VIR 481, VIR 535), Yugoslavia (VIR 479*) and cv. Maikopskaya 1 (VIR 491*).


<H2>Conclusions</H2>

Hemp breeding faces a series of complex problems which may be solved by wide utilisation of the global hemp germplasm collection stored at VIR. For this purpose, it would be necessary to perform in depth and complex studies of the accessions in this collection, especially of the monoecious drug-free varieties identified for their earliness. Research should aim to identify sources of flexibility, firmness and other fibre quality traits, including disease and pest resistance, and sources of variation in oil yield and quality. It is necessary to create varieties with more economically valuable traits by individual selection, applying the express method of cannabinoid content evaluation, and to perform hybridization with the purpose of uniting all required parameters in a single genotype. This would result in obtaining early ripening monoecious materials for breeding, which would also possess high productivity and high quality of fiber and oil.<P>
It is necessary to conduct research on the genetics of sexual, technological and biochemical characteristics, lack of which impedes the efficiency of hemp breeding.<P> 

* = Accessions no longer maintained in the VIR collection. The remainder of the accessions noted in this article are threatened with extinction. A concerted effort must be made to preserve these valuable accessions for future breeders.

<FONT SIZE=5>A report from France</FONT><P>

Houses have always been built out of what was around &#151; mostly stones and lumber. But where stones and trees were scarce, chopped straw mixed with a soil, rich in clay, was a common material. Modern building with hemp is very different from this old technique, yet it too allows for building with what grows around you. (At least in a country like France, where hemp is a legal crop).<P>
Hemp, when grown for fiber, is sown very densely, so as to grow into branchless slender stalks that so resemble straw that French farmers call them hemp straw (&quot;paille de chanvre&quot;). After harvest, the long fibers that make up to about 25% of the hemp stalks are removed. In some parts of the world, like China, these fibers are still spun and woven into cloth. In France, the machinery presently used to remove the fibers from the stalk does not allow processing of the fibers into a thread strong enough to be woven into cloth.<P>
Hemp is still grown for its fiber but today, in France, these are entirely bought by paper making companies (mostly by de Mauduy, a French company now belonging to Kimberley Clarke). Added to ordinary wood pulp, hemp fibers make &quot;specialty paper&quot; particularly pliable and resistant, for banknotes or cigarette paper.

<H2>For cats and horses, too</H2>

The strong fibers are what hemp has always been grown for. Yet
after the fibers have been removed from the stalk, there remains
about 75% of the plant. This bulky by-product, known as hurd (&quot;ch&egrave;nevotte&quot;
in French) looks like fine wood chips, only much lighter. Hemp
hurds are extremely absorbent: they will soak up about five times
their own weight in moisture. They are commercialised in France
by the hemp growers co-op &quot;La Chanvri&#143;re de l'Aube&quot;,
as bedding for livestock under the brand name &quot;Aubiose&quot;.
Aubiose is used, in particular, for race horses, who will have
nothing but the best. The most minute hurd particles are molded
into pellets and commercialized as cat litter. These were first
made by La Chanvri&#143;re de l'Aube, who commercializes them
as &quot;Biochat&quot; in France, or &quot;All Hugro&quot; in
Germany. Since hemp growing became legal in England in 1993, cats
there can enjoy the same product, made out of British hemp, known
as &quot;Posh Paws&quot;. Hemp hurds are not only very absorbent,
they are also uncommonly rich in silica, a chemical compound naturally
occurring as sand or flint. The high mineral content of hemp hurds
brings us naturally to one of their most interesting applications:
building. Hemp hurds mixed with lime undergo a process of mineralisation,
sometimes referred to as &quot;petrification&quot; (changing into
stone).

<H2>Midway between mineral and vegetable kingdoms</H2>

In France, where houses have been built with hemp hurds as the
main material (apart from the wooden structure), there are slight
differences in technique. But the basic process is the same: hemp
hurds are mixed with natural lime (not cement !) and water. Sometimes
plaster of Paris (pure gypsum) or sand is added. The mixing can
be done in a cement mixer and at this stage the resulting mix
does look a bit like cement. It can be poured like cement, likewise
it hardens and becomes mold and insect resistant. And yet it retains
some of the virtues proper to plant matter: the resulting material,
which becomes a lighter, tawny color when dry, has a texture vaguely
reminiscent of cork. It is many times lighter than cement (which
workers fully appreciate) and it offers both thermal and sonic
insulation. The mixture sets in a matter of hours, while the process
of &quot;petrification&quot; continues.<P>
The mix can be poured as a floor, or between sheets of plywood
(which will be removed a few hours later) for walls. Here one
material replaces several layers of conventional building materials:
bricks or cement, vapor barrier, insulation, and plaster board.
All that is needed, inside as well as outside, is a whitewash
finish (with or without pigments added). Alternatively, for interior
use, the look of the material can be preserved with a simple waxing
or varnishing, which brings out the cork-like structure of the
material.

<H2>Different schools of thought</H2>

Can the basic process of petrification of hemp hurds be improved?
This is where people working in this field disagree. The hemp
farmers co-op that initially perfected this technique (La Chanvri&#143;re
de l'Aube) registered a patent for a process that coats the hurds
with silica. The prepared hurds, meant for building, are commercialized
under the brand name &quot;Canobiote&quot;. &quot;Isochanvre&quot;
is another brand name for a similar product, prepared in another
hemp-growing area (near Le Mans). Canobiote and Isochanvre look
identical, though the latter is almost twice as expensive. Isochanvre
costs about 800 FF per cubic meter, Canobiote about 500 FF. France
P&eacute;rier, the woman who developed Isochanvre, initially worked
for La Chanvri&egrave;re de l'Aube, promoting Canobiote (and then
left to start her own business). She insists that Isochanvre is
a better product, though it is not clear exactly in what way.<P>
Finally there are those like Yves Kh&uuml;n who think that regular
hemp hurds, untreated, just as nature made them, are as perfect
as can be for the petrification process to best take place &#151;
provided the right kind of lime or plaster of Paris, is used.
He calls this technique &quot;Canosmose&quot;.<P>
This former solo dancer with the prestigious B&#142;jart company,
now an entrepreneur who works with his architect wife, maintains
that coating the hurds with silica makes them less absorbent,
which in turn interferes with the petrification process. He therefore
prefers to use the hurds as they are, and points out that they
are also much cheaper that way (only 270 FF per cubic meter).<P>
Whatever form of hurd is used, it certainly provides a very attractive
building material, one that is both healthy for people to live
in and environmentally friendly.<P>

<h2>Historical overview</h2>

<p>The cultivation and use of hemp in Germany has a long history
(Krber-Grohne 1988). The earliest findings of hemp-based ropes
and fabrics in Europe were made in the Stuttgart area and can be
dated back to the pre-Roman period (800-400 BC). Fabrics were not
yet made from processed hemp fibers, but from the bast stripped
from the plant's stem. During the early Middle Ages, retting, a
biological process for the separation of plant fibers which had
been used for flax, was transferred to hemp. The nutritious hemp
seeds have been used as a food staple since the Middle Ages and
early descriptions of the plant's medical applications date back
to the 16th century. To this day, traditional hemp dishes are
prepared in some of the former German provinces, such as the
Silesian hemp soup made from hemp seeds and millet (Pelz and
Kretschmer 1977).</p>

<p> In the 14th century, the traditional Chinese art of making
paper arrived in Germany <i>via</i> Italy. Exclusively used as
raw material were rags from flax and hemp textiles. Wood based
paper came into use only after mechanical and chemical pulping
was developed in the mid eighteen hundreds in Germany and
England, respectively. Because of the significantly lower costs
of wood, often obtained by clear-cutting, flax and hemp as
resources for the pulping industry were rapidly displaced.</p>

<p> Hemp experienced its heyday in Germany in the 17th century.
Because of the high tensile strength of its fibers and their
tolerance of moisture, essentially all sails, tows, nets, flags,
and uniforms for the growing fleet of sailing ships were made
from hemp. Within the boundaries of what later became Germany,
hemp was grown on an area of approximately 150,000 hectares (ha).</p>

<p> The decline of hemp in Germany began in the 18th century,
when technical improvements simplified the processing of cotton.
This subsequently displaced flax and hemp from the textile market
because their processing remained labor intensive. The concurrent
decline in sailing caused the loss of yet another important
market for hemp fibers.</p>

<p> </p>

Germany), BRD = Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). </p>

<hr size="4">

<p>In the 19th century, jute and sisal, novel fiber plants from
the colonies, were introduced to Germany. Jute in particular
competed with hemp in its traditional domains at only half the
price because of the pittance paid to workers in the colonies. At
the same time, German hemp came under pressure from cheaper hemp
imports from Russia. The already mentioned displacement by wood
in the pulping sector resulted in the loss of yet another market
for hemp fibers. Figure 1 demonstrates the steady decrease in
acreage used for hemp cultivation in Germany during the 19th and
20th century, before it essentially ceased in 1915. </p>

<h2>During the world wars</h2>

<p>Hemp became a war profiteer during the two world wars. Cut off
from its overseas supplies of cotton, jute, sisal and ramie, the
German governments reconsidered hemp and supported improvements
to cultivation, harvesting and processing technologies. For
example, the development of the so-called cottonization process
allowed production of a short-fiber, high-quality cotton
substitute from hemp fiber. During the 1920s, the substitution of
all cotton imports by cottonized domestic hemp was seriously
discussed. It would have required an area of approximately one
million hectares (Gminder 1924). While these considerations were
driven mainly by a desire for self-sufficiency, they still
demonstrate the potential which was attributed to hemp fiber.
Towards the end of World War II, hemp was grown in Germany on
about 21,000 ha, which supplied approximately 20% of the demand
for hemp fiber. Most of the balance was imported from Italy.</p>

<p> Of high relevance today are the various fiber separation and
processing technologies, which were intensively developed and
tested in Germany after the turn of the century in order to
expand the range of applications for hemp fiber and to lower
production costs. A comprehensive summary of these developments
can be found in the book <i>Hemp and Hard Fiber</i> by Herzog <i>et
al.</i> (1927). </p>

<h2>Post war developments</h2>

<p>After World War II, the cultivation of hemp in Germany rapidly
shrank to insignificant levels, mainly due to the competition
from imported natural fibers and the newly developed synthetic
fibers. In the former GDR (East Germany) the cultivation of hemp
survived through the late 1960s. Despite the concurrent decline
of German hemp research, researchers were able to breed several
varieties which combined a high fiber yield with a low content of <i>delta</i>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of hemp (Bredemann 1952,
Bredemann <i>et al.</i> 1961). These varieties are now considered
lost in Germany, but their existence elsewhere (e.g., Russian
gene banks) is conceivable.</p>

<p> The final blow to the cultivation of fiber hemp in West
Germany was dealt by the 1982 amendments to the federal narcotics
act (BtMG) which outlawed the cultivation of hemp, regardless of
its THC content. Exemptions may only be granted for scientific
purposes or in the case of public interest. To this day, these
amendments effectively ban the commercial cultivation of hemp in
Germany. In 1981, they also forced the last West German hemp
farmer, Martin Butter, to give up his production (Karus <i>et al.</i>
1994). At the time, he employed 15 persons involved in the
cultivation of hemp on 150 ha of land. Fibers were sold to
manufacturers of ropes, textiles and cigarette paper. The woody
core (shives or hurds) of the stems was used locally to produce
building materials, such as particle board and pellets for
thermal insulation. The leaves were used as litter in stables.
Instead of taking his case to the European Court (the European
Community had already permitted the cultivation of low-THC
varieties at that time) Butter accepted a DM 800,000 settlement
from the German government.</p>

<p> Subsequently, agricultural research on hemp essentially
ceased. One of the few exceptions is the work of Prof. Megnet who
investigated, in the early 1980s, whether hemp could be grown on
soils contaminated with heavy metals. Initial results indicated
that the fibers remain virtually free of heavy metals. However,
Megnet soon had to abandon his work because of governmental
requirements he could not comply with.</p>

<p> When renewable bioresources, such as flax, were rediscovered
in Germany in the 1980s, hemp was simply ignored. The knowledge
of its potential uses had largely been lost within just a few
decades. Younger agricultural scientists and engineers knew hemp
merely as an exotic drug plant, not as a traditional, domestic
fiber resource.</p>

<p> At this point, only one agricultural use of hemp in Germany
has been exempted from this general prohibition: as a pollen
insulator in the commercial breeding of beets. No other plant
forms such impermeable hedges and minimizes undesirable outside
pollination. </p>

<h2>Current research</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, even this remaining application came under
attack from a Bavarian politician. In this context, the late
Prof. Dambroth at the Agricultural Research Laboratory (FAL) in
Braunschweig was asked to investigate the variability in the THC
content of low- THC varieties and the development of the THC
content during the plant's growth period. Hemp has been grown at
the FAL for research purposes since 1992. Dambroth added to this
program the investigation of the impact of chemical (nitrogen)
fertilizer and plant density on fiber quality, and fiber and seed
yield. Delayed by his death in 1993, the results are now
scheduled for publication in early 1995. Preliminary findings
indicate hemp's comparatively low nitrogen demand and the high
fiber yield of the Hungarian Kompolt variety. </p>

<h2>Rediscovery of the &quot;new &quot; bioresource, hemp</h2>

<p>The rediscovery of hemp in Germany as a promising,
ecologically benign resource was largely triggered by the
publication of <i>The Rediscovery of the Resource Hemp Cannabis
Marihuana</i> in September 1993 (Herer, Brckers, KATALYSE
1993). The book became an immediate bestseller. It contains, in
addition to the German translation of Jack Herer's popular book <i>The
Emperor Wears no Clothes</i>, a historical review of the use of
hemp in Europe by Mathias Brckers and a current scientific
evaluation of the industrial crop hemp by the KATALYSE Institute,
Cologne (Karus <i>et al.</i> 1993, 1994a).</p>

<p> The book was well received by the German media and general
public and caused a downright hemp &quot;avalanche&quot;.
Following a decade-long period of neglect, numerous dissertations
covering a broad range of subjects in the areas of cultivation,
processing and use of hemp are now under way or have already been
published. At the same time, numerous domestic firms are
developing technologies and product lines based on imported hemp.
A number of professionally manufactured products entered the
market in 1994 with good initial success. Total sales in 1994 of
these products are estimated at DM 20-40 million, up from
essentially zero in 1993. Much of the enthusiasm of these firms
is due to hemp's positive marketing image. It results from the
ecological advantages of the bioresource hemp, as well as from
its modern, fresh image caused by the association with its sister
plant, marihuana.</p>

<p> In January 1994, &quot;Die Hanfgesellschaft&quot; (The Hemp
Society) was founded in Berlin as an association of hemp
protagonists in the areas of agriculture, processing, industry
and marketing. Its goal is to promote the reintegration of hemp
into the economic cycle by creating a network of major players,
providing public education and supporting specific projects. The
society's most visible venture is the &quot;Hanfhaus&quot; (Hemp
House) chain. In addition to its Berlin headquarters, it operates
retail outlets in six major German cities which market, under
considerable attention by the media, a wide range of hemp-based
products.</p>

<p> This rapid development in the areas of research, development
and marketing had to manage essentially without public funding.
The federal agencies in charge, the Ministry of Agriculture (BML)
and the Agency for Renewable Bioresources (FNR) are not willing
to fund hemp projects for the time being. Their main objections
are that the cultivation of hemp is still illegal in Germany and
that they do not want to sponsor a plant which would compete with
flax, the promotion of which has received DM 60 million of public
funding to date, without the hoped-for breakthrough.</p>

<p> Meanwhile, the general ban on the cultivation of hemp and its
main supporter, the newly created federal drug administration,
Bundesinstitut f&#159;r Arzneimittel und Medizin-produkte (BAM),
have come under intense public criticism. The debate centers
around the question of whether even low-THC varieties may somehow
be used for the production of marihuana and can therefore not be
tolerated. In this context, the validity of the EU-wide accepted
limit of 0.3% THC content in the upper one third of the leaves is
questioned by BAM. A publication which demonstrates the
irrelevance of the arguments used by the supporters of the ban is
being prepared by the nova-Institute. Results from another recent
study (Karus <i>et al.</i>, 1994b) also suggest that low-THC
varieties cannot be misused as a drug and that the EU limit of
0.3% is sufficient.</p>

<p> Prior to presenting potential solutions for this somewhat
muddled situation, the major ongoing R&amp;D activities in
Germany in the various sectors will be summarized in the
following. </p>

<h2>Cultivation tests</h2>

<p>In addition to the already mentioned tests at the FAL
Braunschweig, several cultivation tests have been approved in
1994 by the authorities as scientifically useful, and are now
being carried out at various universities. Worth mentioning are
tests at the Humboldt University, Berlin aimed at the cultivation
of low-THC varieties, and an investigation of the suitability of
hemp as boiler fuel at the Gesamthochschule Kassel. </p>

<h2>Harvesting and fiber separation</h2>

<p>Innovative harvesting and fiber separation processes for flax
plants have been researched and developed on a laboratory scale
in Germany for the last decade. Various public and private
institutions were involved in this program, supported by
considerable amounts of public funding (approximately DM 60
million). The primary goal of this program is the development of
ecologically benign processes which produce fiber material with
high yields and standardized quality, particularly for industrial
fiber use, at a competitive price. A detailed understanding of
the product characteristics demanded by industry, and the
identification and quantification of their respective fiber
parameters are essential for the achievement of this goal. This
approach was based on the desire to eliminate the dependence of
flax sales on short-lived trends in textile fashion and to create
stable markets in the industrial sector. Studies carried out
under this program suggest that market potentials for short flax
fibers exist, particularly as substitute for glass and mineral
fibers and in the production of press-molded parts.</p>

<p> Various fiber separation processes, based on the use of steam
explosion, detergents, or ultrasound have now been developed on
the laboratory scale. While the quality of the produced fibers
has been met with keen interest from industry, these technologies
still lack demonstration on the pilot and production scales. Most
advanced at this point are purely mechanical methods which
combine harvest and separation. They provide a limited range of
product qualities or serve as preprocessing step for the already
mentioned biochemical or physical processes.</p>

<p> Despite this favorable starting position, the implementation
of innovative flax technologies has been slowed down considerably
due to the virtual elimination of public funding.</p>

<p> These initial results from the R&amp;D program for flax are
highly relevant for the use of hemp as well. For a fraction of
the funds spent to date on flax, the results could also be
applied to the use of hemp fiber. These favorable starting
conditions raise the hope that hemp, with its players being fresh
and not yet involved in quarrels, and its modern marketing image,
may bring about the breakthrough for both domestic fiber
resources, flax and hemp. Consequently, major players in the flax
domain, most notably the Institute for Applied Research (IAF) at
the Fachhochschule Reutlingen, have begun in 1994 to apply these
newly developed technologies to hemp. This includes a detailed
analysis of the fiber's characteristics. However, to get off the
ground at a pace that could satisfy the rapidly growing demand,
demonstration projects are essential. Obtaining adequate public
or private funding of such projects is difficult as a result of
the recent funding priorities in post-reunification Germany. The
implementation of a modern facility for the separation and
processing of hemp and flax fibers should be the natural focus of
these efforts. </p>

<h2>Pulp and paper</h2>

<p>In 1993, Schneidershne, Germany's largest paper
manufacturer, introduced its first hemp-based paper products, and
presently markets a complete line of hemp paper. The collection
includes basic paper for the production of books, as well as four
different varieties of graphical papers under the names
Sativaprint (stationery) and Luxosativa (art paper). The papers
are based on mixtures of bleached hemp pulp and de-inked recycled
paper, most commonly 50/50 blends. Since the fall of 1994, paper
based on 100% hemp pulp is also available. Sales of 500 (metric)
tons are anticipated for 1994, corresponding to revenues of DM
4-5.5 million.</p>

<p> The hemp pulp is provided by the Spanish firm Celesa,
currently the sole supplier in Western Europe. The comparatively
high prices for hemp pulp, approximately DM 4,000/ton, are due in
part to its monopoly position. However, ongoing developments in
the pulp supply will soon break this monopoly, resulting in lower
prices and improving the cost competitiveness of hemp pulp.</p>

<p> A remodeled pulp mill is scheduled for startup near Dresden
in early 1995. It will be capable of producing 6,000 tons per
year of pulp based on hemp, flax and linseed. Both unbleached and
hydrogen peroxide bleached pulp will be offered. Hemp tow,
initially imported from Eastern Europe, will be the raw material
for the hemp pulp. Prior to pulping it will be cut to a fiber
length of 2-6 millimeters. Schneiders&#154;hne will not remain
the sole buyer of hemp pulp produced in Germany. Several German
firms are also interested in the use of hemp pulp for
manufacturing technical and household filters. Their main
motivation is the development of product lines which provide
ecological benefits compared to wood pulp based products. For
example, hemp-based filter papers are more resistant to moisture
and can meet quality requirements without the addition of
synthetic resins. The first of these products will likely be
introduced in early 1995.</p>

<p> The major German producer of cigarette paper, EFKA-Werke,
introduced 100% hemp based paper for the first time in the summer
of 1994. These Cauma hemp papers were introduced successfully
by a smart marketing campaign. The paper is manufactured in
France where all of the hemp pulp produced is converted
domestically to paper. </p>

<h2>Textiles</h2>

<p>The market for hemp-based textiles has grown much faster than
was expected based on the results from previous studies. Since
early 1994, the Hemp House chain has successfully marketed
various kinds of hemp textiles, such as denim-type jackets and
pants. The textiles are predominantly manufactured in Hungary.
Over the last several months, ecologically minded textile
companies have shown an increased interest in the bioresource
hemp. It can be expected that fabrics and garments, some of them
probably produced in Germany, will soon be available on the
market, sold not only by outlets specializing in hemp products
but also by ecologically oriented mail-order businesses and
boutiques.</p>

<p> Apparently, the German market is particularly open for
natural hemp fiber because the ecological aspects are taken more
seriously in the textile sector there, and because natural
fiber-based textiles, well suited for a strict eco-labeling, are
rare and expensive. The positive marketing image of hemp will
further contribute to the development of markets which are not as
accessible to flax.</p>

<p> A frequently heard argument is that hemp fiber is not well
suited for the production of soft and easy-care textiles, which
provide the familiar cotton comfort. However, initial tests in
the textile industry have shown that certain environmentally
friendly, predominantly mechanical processes allow improvements
in the everyday-wear characteristics of hemp textiles. Additional
processes are currently being developed. The already mentioned
use of cottonized short fibers, instead of the traditional long
fiber, will create further opportunities for hemp, once the
process is established on the full-scale level. This may allow
hemp to make inroads into the market now held by cotton-based
textiles in the not too distant future. </p>

<h2>Building materials</h2>

<p>Following publication of the &quot;Hanf&quot; book in Germany,
the already strong domestic ecologically-oriented building
movement developed a high level of interest in the use of hemp
shives as a material for construction. Most popular to date has
been the French product ISOCHANVRE which is used as a building
and thermal insulation material. In 1994, ISOCHANVRE was first
used in Germany, in combination with lime, as an insulating
plaster in the remodeling of older buildings. A German company
has been using hemp shives for the construction of floors since
1957. Current efforts to use shives in the production of
ecological particle boards and building blocks are also
promising.</p>

<p> In the long-term, the use of hemp fiber may become more
important for the building industry. Potential products include
light-weight construction boards, fiber-cement boards and
fiber-reinforced plaster. Earlier this year, a German firm
introduced flax fiber-based insulating mats which substitute for
rock wool mats and provide the same level of thermal insulation.
The company is also developing hemp tow based mats but will
suspend their release until domestic hemp is available, since
they deem the necessary long-distance transport of the tow
ecologically unacceptable. </p>

<h2>Hemp oil</h2>

<p>The characteristics and potential uses of hemp seed oil are
the subject of several ongoing studies in academia and industry.
Initial results show that hemp oil is one of the most valuable
vegetable oils, both for food and technical applications. The
research focuses on various aspects which had been investigated
previously for oil seeds other than hemp. This includes, for
example, the composition of the fatty acid spectrum of hemp oil
from various sources, shifts in this spectrum during plant
growth, the biodegradability of hemp oil based detergents, and
taste and durability of hemp oil.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It can be expected that the application for registration of
hemp oil as an edible oil will be initiated in early 1995. In
1994, an Austrian firm surprised the public with the presentation
of a complete line of hemp oil-based personal care products, such
as soap, shampoo, bubble bath etc. A German firm recently
introduced a hemp oil perfume which is based on a 19th century
recipe. </p>

<h2>Medical uses</h2>

<p>The potential medical applications of hemp, or rather
cannabinoids, have been under a taboo in Germany for a long time
and cannabinoid research is virtually non-existent. This
situation is now changing, due in part to the translation of the
well-known book &quot;Marihuana - the forbidden medicine&quot; by
Grinspoon and Bakalar (1993), which was complemented by a review
of the results from recent medical research and a summary of the
legal and medical situation in Germany (Grotenhermen and Karus
1994). This and a concurrent modification of the federal
narcotics act (BtMG) which simplified clinical tests with <i>delta</i>-9-THC
are likely to result in an increase in the research of
cannabinoids in the near future. </p>

<h2>Forecast</h2>

<p>At this point, it can only be speculated how the current
German prohibition on the cultivation of low-THC hemp will
eventually be overcome. Ongoing legal activities include a law
suit filed by the agricultural association GAIA against BAM with
a Berlin court. The subject is permission to cultivate hemp on a
110 ha plot near Berlin. While filing a suit with the European
Court is another promising strategy, this route has not been
taken because of the costs and time involved. Administratively
the easiest way to eliminate the prohibition is a modification of
the BtMG to EU guidelines as part of its routine adjustment, a
process which is carried out almost annually without much
publicity. The fact that a majority of political players in the
agricultural and environmental arenas, such as the German
Association of Farmers, have already come out in support of the
re-admission of hemp for cultivation suggests that such a change
will probably occur once the cultivation and use of fiber hemp
become more established in other European countries.</p>

<p> Until such time, it is advisable to press forward with the
development of hemp technologies and products and to benefit from
the current favorable technological and marketing conditions in
Germany. Such a strategy would allow hemp to be processed by
modern and ecologically sound technologies and turned into
innovative products as soon as the prohibition on cultivation is
ended. This would effectively close the value-adding chain
between cultivation and marketable product. Thus, the primary
tasks ahead are to overcome the existing lack of funding for hemp
R&amp;D through the use of scientifically founded arguments, and
then to integrate the numerous ongoing activities, undertaken
with much enthusiasm and little financial support, into
professionally coordinated, interdisciplinary projects.</p>

<p> The first steps in this direction are currently being taken.
Only a few examples can be mentioned here. The Hanfgesellschaft
is currently in the planning stages for a large scale
German-Polish hemp cultivation and processing project. Co-funding
from the EU's Eastern Europe Incentive program will be applied
for. The nova-Institute, Cologne, is coordinating the planning
for a major technology project which would focus on research,
development and pilot-scale implementation of innovative,
ecological product lines based on hemp. Finally, the BIOROHSTOFF
HANF (Bioresource Hemp) trade fair and conference will be held in
March 1995 in Frankfurt. BIOROHSTOFF HANF combines the first
international product and technology exhibit with the first
technological-scientific symposium on the subject of hemp as a
bioresource. Scientists, farmers, and developers and vendors of
technology and products from around the world will present the
status of their research, concepts and products. For more
information on this event refer to the announcement on page 64. </p>

<H3>The Dutch hemp-for-paper project</H3>
In February 1994, the final report of the Dutch hemp research programme was presented. It took Dfl 17 million to evaluate several alternatives for a hemp paper production sequence from seed to final product. The most viable sequence was transformed into a business concept (Van Berlo 1993). The developed methods should have provoked a major breakthrough in large-scale hemp processing in the Netherlands. However, the paper industry was not interested in risking an investment in a pilot plant. 
<H3>Hemp-Flax, a new initiative</H3>
Contrary to the paper industry, some people believe that the time is ripe for reintroduction of hemp for fibre. In early 1994, one of the authors (E.D.) founded Hemp-Flax B.V. for the production and processing of hemp and flax. These annual fibre crops may provide a solution to problems in agriculture and industry (and thus the economy). A modern flax processing factory in Nagele, the Netherlands, was purchased and in this facility a new hemp processing line is being installed next to the existing one for flax, which will remain operational. 
<H3>Hemp cultivation</H3>
Several farmers were contracted to cultivate 140 hectares (ha) of hemp in the Veenkoloni&euml;n (N.E. Netherlands) during the summer of 1994. This was the largest hemp cultivation area in the Netherlands in sixty years. The objective of this first season was to explore the agronomy, the logistics, and Dutch markets for hemp. Paper-based products and textile markets were not primary targets for strategic reasons.<P>
The farmers did the soil preparation and sowing according to their own views. Seed from the French monoecious hemp varieties F&#142;dora, F&#142;lina, Fibrimon, and F&#142;drina were supplied by Hemp-Flax. The crop was harvested by Hemp-Flax in cooperation with the farmers. This way, the farmers gained experience and developed various practical methods. The influence of soil structure and water regime on hemp growth were surveyed. Furthermore, liquid manure was demonstrated to be a good fertilizer. The farmers applied for a larger hemp growing area for 1995 because they were enthusiastic about hemp's effect on the soil structure, its cultivation, and its performance. Local youths, who had taken some plants, were probably less enthusiastic about its performance.
<H3>Hemp harvesting</H3>
Although fungicides or pesticides were not used, the losses from <I>Botrytis cinerea</I> and other pathogens were insignificant. Self-thinning, as described by van der Werf (1994), was observed, but the level was unclear. Plant numbers of 50-200 per m<FONT SIZE=1>2 </FONT>have been counted with a sowing density of 30-90 kg/ha. The harvested yield was 6-9 tonnes/ha of air-dried matter. The yield was not expected to be optimal, since farmers had no previous experience with hemp cultivation and harvesting. Several harvesting methods were tested and the most practical method proved to be swath mowing, followed by dew retting and turning of the swath. The air-dried crop was pressed in large bales and transported to a storage place. This harvesting method resulted in clean fibre during the dry period in August and a nicely retted fibre after the wet periods in September, 1994. 
<H3>Hemp processing</H3>
In the factory, hemp bast fibres are separated from the core by a special process developed by Hemp-Flax. Several applications of the bast and core have been optimized. These products include a planting substrate, a building material, non-wovens, bio-filters and adsorbants. Industries that want to explore applications with hemp are welcome to contact Hemp-Flax for consultation and sample material.
<H3>Future developments</H3>
Hemp is a strong natural fibre with great endurance.
The agronomic advantages of hemp over other fibre crops include:
a high yield, reduction of agro-chemical requirements, soil improvement
and weed control. Hemp fibre can replace other natural fibres,
wood, asbestos, glass fibre, steel, polypropylene and polyethylene
(Brouwer 1991). Prices of current artificial and mineral fibres
have increased, which makes substitution by natural fibres possible.
So, sooner or later, hemp will become more attractive as a sustainable
source of fibre produced in the western world. Governmental and
agricultural organizations can help to bring about regulations
which will make it easier for farmers to grow this crop. Regulations
and public acceptance will determine the rate of introduction.
Hemp-Flax B.V. will encourage all parties to grow more hemp, which
will contribute to a more healthy, natural environment.

<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Hemp facts and hemp fiction</H1>
Hayo M.G. van der Werf<P>
International Hemp Association, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, the Netherlands</CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
Jack Herer's book, <I>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</I>, edited by Chris Conrad, Lynn Osburn and Judy Osburn, provides fascinating reading. It was one of the major causes of the enormous increase in interest in fibre hemp in recent years. Although most of the information contained in the book is valid, some of its claims are clearly incorrect.<P>
Like Jack Herer and his editorial team, I am convinced that hemp has real potential as a 'new' crop and that it deserves more attention from farmers and agronomists. We are currently witnessing the renaissance of fibre hemp, but I think this renaissance is not well served by making unrealistic claims regarding the potential of hemp.<P>
Some quotes from <I>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</I> :<P>
&quot;Hemp [...] uses the sun more efficiently than virtually any other plant on our planet&quot; (page 2).<P>
&quot;Depending on which U.S. agricultural report is correct, an acre of full grown hemp plants can sustainably provide from four to 50 or even 100 times the cellulose found in cornstalks, kenaf or sugar cane - the planet's next highest annual cellulose plants&quot; (page 44).<P>
&quot;Hemp hurds are 77 % cellulose&quot; (page 44).<P>
Herer and his editorial team claim that hemp produces higher yields than other crops and that hemp hurds, which make up 60 to 80 % of the stem dry weight, contain 77 % cellulose. These claims are repeated in other books: <I>Energy Farming in America</I> (by Osburn), <I>Hemp, Lifeline to the Future</I> (by Conrad). Both claims are simply wrong.<P>
For a start, cellulose content of hemp hurds has been found to vary between 32 and 38 % (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994). Possibly, Herer confuses the hurds, which form the woody core of the hemp stem, with the bark, which forms the outer layer of the hemp stem. The bark contains the long bast fibres which are used in textile manufacturing. The cellulose content of the bark is much higher than that of the core. It has been found to lie between 53 and 74 % (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994).<P>
One of the objectives of the research I conducted over the last four years was to investigate the yield of hemp relative to that of other crops.<P>
Essentially, all agricultural crops do the same thing: they intercept light with their canopy and, in the leaves, sugars are formed as a result of photosynthesis. Most of the sugars move out of the leaves to other parts of the plant and are transformed into other organic substances, e.g., cellulose and lignin in the stem, and starch, protein and oil in the seed.<P>
When growing conditions are optimal, that is, in the absence of limitations due to lack of water or nutrients, or due to pests, diseases, or other stresses the yield of any crop will depend on:<P>
a) the total amount of light (L) intercepted by the crop canopy during the growing season;<P>
b) the radiation use efficiency (RUE): the amount of dry plant material produced per unit of light intercepted by the canopy;<P>
c) the harvest index (HI): the fraction of the plant parts of economic value in the total plant dry matter produced.<P>
This can be summarized in a simple formula:<P>
<H4>Yield = L x RUE x HI</H4>
Grown side by side under favourable growing conditions, different crops may have different yields. Relative to most other crops grown in the Netherlands, fibre hemp intercepts quite a lot of light (L is high) because the crop can be sown early and it grows well at low temperatures, so the canopy is established rapidly. The radiation use efficiency of fibre hemp is relatively low, probably as the result of the structure of the canopy and the relatively high lignin content in the stem. As with other annual fibre crops, such as flax or kenaf, the harvest index of fibre hemp is relatively high.<P>
In the most favourable growing conditions, we obtained yields of up to 15,000 kg of stem dry matter per hectare (6,070 kg per acre). Under simular conditions, other crops such as maize, sugar beet or potato produced similar dry matter yields. All results indicate that as far its yield is concerned, fibre hemp is in no way exceptional.<P>
These results have been detailed in my thesis, <I>Crop Physiology of Fibre Hemp</I> (<I>Cannabis sativa </I>L.). From these results I cannot help but conclude that the claim that hemp produces higher yields than other crops, simply is not true. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that hemp is not an interesting crop for farmers. I think that hemp is an excellent candidate to fill the niche for an annual fibre crop in temperate climates. Hemp seems to be an attractive crop for a sustainable agricultural system, as it has moderate fertilizer requirements, needs little or no pesticides and suppresses weeds and some major soil-borne pathogens.<P>
<I>Cannabis</I> is certainly a valuable crop plant, and its future succes will depend in part on the responsible dissemination of accurate information concerning its benefits.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Re-discovery of the Crop Plant <I>Cannabis</I> Marihuana Hemp<BR> 
(Die Wiederentdeckung der Nutzplanze <I>Cannabis</I> Marihuana Hanf).</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
By Jack Herer, Mathias Br&ouml;ckers  and Katalyse. Zweitausend-eins, Frankfurt am main, Germany. Nineteenth printing, 463 pp.<P>

Judging by its length and the broad spectrum covered, this book could be regarded as a monograph if the style, contents and presentation were not of such a popular nature. It will still fill a definite need, however, since over the past 40-50 years not only has the production and processing of this crop been discontinued in Western Europe, but the plant itself has almost faded into oblivion. One reason for this was the craze for synthetic fiber materials in the late fifties and early sixties (e.g., nylon) which supplanted not only hemp, but flax as well, though they were also unable to compete with cotton. The other reason was the hysterical attitude towards drugs, which started in the USA and had such an influence on other governments. They were poorly informed on this subject, but committed to this campaign for other reasons and even fibre hemp, which is not classified as a drug, was banned from cultivation (as in Germany, for instance). The only exceptions to this were France, where 4,000-5,000 hectares of hemp have always been grown for paper manufacturing purposes, and Holland, with its liberal drug policy, where the sale and consumption of hashish was tolerated in the justified hope that this would distract the attention of the population from harder drugs (e.g. heroin, cocaine etc.). This concept has been a success.<P>
Returning to a criticism of the book itself, it is a pity that the title includes the word marihuana, which is compromised throughout the world. This is hardly the way to popularise hemp. To date, only specialists are aware of the medical effects of THC, while marihuana still has a disreputable sound for society in general.<P>
The book is characterised throughout by an enthusiasm and bias in favour of a good cause that sometimes goes to extremes, leading to material errors and illusory lines of argument. Nevertheless, the book does good service towards the enlightenment of the relevant authorities, organisations and governments in the hope that this propaganda on behalf of hemp will be a success.<P>
The book is a &quot;hybrid&quot;: chapters II and III were written by Germans on the European and specifically German aspects of the plant. While the first chapter, written by the American author Herer, deals mainly with the many-sided practical utilisation of hemp, the German sections attempt to give a certain amount of scientific background: botany, ecological requirements, production technology, etc. Of particular interest are the detailed discussion of the process which finally led, in 1937, to the prohibition of hemp production in the USA and to the banning of research into THC, again in the USA, in 1978, and the description of the road which led to synthetic THC. The struggle being wrought in the USA by marihuana lobbyists at all levels right up to the president also makes fascinating reading, while the arguments and factual information presented on the medicinal action of THC are convincing, as are references to the collusion between the pharmaceutics industry and the government, aimed at maintaining the ban on THC.<P>
Finally, there is a unique summary of the history of hemp cultivation, the like of which, as regards both the extent and richness of data, has never previously been published.<P>
The Americans have every right to complain about the prohibition of hemp production and to lobby for its reauthorisation since the ban was actually lifted for a few years during the war (&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;), but Western Europeans have no cause to complain about the disappearance of hemp, because they have undeservedly forgotten about it over the last 40 years.<P>
In Western Europe, nobody banned the cultivation of hemp. It was simply ousted by artificial fibres. The largest hemp producing state was Italy, where cultivation also ceased in the sixties, so the statement that hemp is still grown commercially in Italy (p. 269) is incorrect. On the other hand, French hemp production is mentioned as if it had begun again in 1990, although it was never abandoned there, an area of 4,000 - 5,000 hectares having been constantly sown to hemp for paper manufacturing purposes. It was also the French who produced the first low THC monoecious varieties. In Eastern Europe, the production of hemp was never discontinued, though the situation differed considerably from one country to the other. Large-scale production was only carried out in the Soviet Union, Romania, and Hungary, which is not mentioned at all in the book, but where the highest yield averages were produced (9 t stems/ha on 6,000 ha in 1989). Hungary was also the biggest exporter of hemp cloth to the Soviet Union (5 million m<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>/year), since it provided the best quality. I do not know where the author found his data on the highly developed hemp production of Romania, because the average yields in this country were actually extremely low. Regarding the Bulgarian hemp production, it was never of great importance and there has been no breeding for the last 30 years.<P>
It is true that no books on hemp have been published in Germany over the last 40 years, but there was no call for such books, as nobody was interested in the subject. It is only now that the time is ripe for this venture. It is also true, however, that in 1961 Prof. Hoffmann devoted a full chapter to hemp breeding in the monumental work by Roemer and Rudorf <I>Handbuch der Pflanzen-z&uuml;chtung</I> in which he made frequent references to the author of this review. A decade later, the book by Hoffmann, Mudra and Plarre, <I>Lehrbuch der Z&uuml;chtung landw. Kulturpflanzen,</I> also discussed hemp breeding at far greater length than was justified by its importance in Germany, and this was repeated in the 2nd edition published in 1980. Finally, in 1988, Prof. Geisler included a brief but correct chapter on hemp production in his book entitled <I>Pflanzenbau</I>. So there was no shortage of literature, just a lack of interest.<P>
It is disappointing to note that both the American and the German authors betray a great deficiency in knowledge on hemp production and research in Eastern Europe, though a book of this calibre deserves to have been supported by more accurate data. Instead,  the authors plead the difficulty of not understanding the language (though the publications always have a German or English summary). I myself, for example, have written four articles in German, published in various German journals, reporting on the results of Hungarian hemp breeding. If the authors had read these articles they would not have written the erroneous statement that monoecious hemp varieties have a 50% higher fibre content than dioecious varieties. The variety with the highest fibre content in the world is, in fact, the Hungarian dioecious variety KOMPOLTI, which was used to improve the fibre content of French varieties and which has a considerably greater stem yield than any monoecious variety. It was also in Hungary that the first hybrid varieties were produced and the first unisexual forms consisting solely of females. Dutch researchers from Wageningen set up the experiments needed for their paper project (p. 344) using the Hungarian variety Kompolti hybrid TC, which proved to have the greatest stem yield.<P>
Romania is often mentioned in the book, though it has only two varieties with moderate yield potential (Fibramulta and Secueni 1). A number of dioecious varieties are available in Italy, but these are not cultivated now. Many monoecious varieties are available at Gluchov in the Ukraine, and many types of harvesters have been developed in Gluchov, but yield averages are very low. It is strange that the book makes no mention of French monoecious hemp varieties (Futura, F&eacute;drina, F&eacute;lina, etc.), although these are grown on the greatest area in EU countries at present.<P>
As already indicated above, over- enthusiasm, sometimes without good groundings, often leads the authors into the dead-end of objective errors and illusory lines of argument. For instance, it is a great exaggeration to calculate that hemp could be grown on 6 million hectares in the EU countries. This would require an enormous infrastructure, for which the funds are simply not available. Several dozen hemp factories, oil plants, spinning and weaving mills and panel-making factories would be needed within the production area, since it is not worth transporting hemp more than 40-50 km even in bales. It is a great error to expect an oil yield of 24 million tons: this is obviously based on the data in Table 12 (p. 452), which have been incorrectly understood from Romanian literature, suggesting that hemp gives a seed yield of 4000 kg/ha (pp. 314, 347, 349). This is a biological absurdity. Present knowledge puts the yield potential of the best seed-producing varieties (mid-Russian) as 1000 kg/ha, which is far lower than that of sunflower, and on average only 600-800 kg can be expected. It follows from this that in Germany rapeseed far surpasses hemp in seed-yielding ability and thus in oil yield. It can thus be seen that hemp is not, and never will be, a mass oil-producing plant, as it produces few seeds. For this reason, its excellent but expensive oil will remain the foodstuff of the rich. Herer's speculation on the conversion of hemp into methanol is equally illusory (p. 105). If even 10% of the many hundreds of millions of tonnes of oil used in the USA each year were to be replaced by hemp methanol, hemp would have to be sown on 5-10 million hectares: the cost of infrastructure and technology would exceed even the capital potential of the USA. In addition, due to transportation problems, thousands of decentralised methanol plants would be required. This belongs to the world of fantasy.<P>
I think it is also unrealistic to expect a dry stem yield of 10-12 t/ha in Germany. This can only be achieved in more southern-lying countries and only with southern (late) varieties.<P>
It is an exaggeration to suggest that hemp fibre could be used without mixing with other fibres to weave the finest cloths (shirts), since it is common knowledge that with the present technology, threads of at most Nm 10-12 can be spun from hemp, compared to Nm 40-50 for flax. The difference in fineness between the two plants requires no explanation. We do know that very fine hemp yarn is made in China using various half-manual technologies. However these processes can not be directly applied in Europe.<P>
In summary, the publication of this book was very timely and provides interesting, convincing and useful reading for all those who wish to work with or perhaps invest in this crop, or who have to teach or study it. Although it is a popular account rather than a scientific work, it will nevertheless prove informative for researchers, since it contains many data which are only otherwise available after long searching in libraries.<P>
The errors and exaggerations listed above do not detract from the usefulness of the book or from the burning desire of the authors to see hemp reinstated to its rightful place among the valuable crops, for the good of humanity. The criticism is not intended to deter the authors, but to encourage them to eliminate the exaggerations and errors from later editions of the book.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Professor Dr. Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa, the breeder of Kompolti hemp</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa is the eldest and one of the most successful active hemp breeders of Europe. For 40 years, he improved eight state-registered fibre hemp varieties, four of which are still cultivated. The improvement of the first unisex hybrids (pure female F1 originating from a monoecious x dioecious crossing) and the development of Bredemann's idea and method are linked with his name.<P>
During his career he bred only dioecious and unisex hybrids. He used monoecious varieties only as crossing partners because he was convinced (later proven by experimental evidence) that the monoecious varieties produce lower yields than the dioecious ones due to a 20 % inbreeding depression. He also improved the chlorophyll-deficient yellow-stemmed and the spherical ornamental varieties that characterise the extensiveness of his breeding work.<P>
We introduce here a part of this multifarious and rich life-work via interview (12 October 1994).<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Journal of the IHA:</STRONG> When was hemp introduced to Hungary?<P>
<STRONG>Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa:</STRONG> We don't know exactly. The Slavic people, who inhabited what is now Hungary up 'till about 900 AD, probably cultivated hemp. The first written reference to hemp is found in a royal customs bill of Esztergom from 1198 AD (At the time Esztergom was the capital of Hungary, where the kings of the first dynasty ruled). In this 800-year old customs document written in Latin, hemp was mentioned together with flax. At the time, hemp was not imported into Hungary but was an age-old native crop. Until 1860-1870 hemp was grown and processed solely by peasants. After that time, Italian hemp cultivars, which were grown and processed on an industrial scale, were introduced into Hungary. Until 1960, peasant and industrial hemp production coexisted. The forced collectivisation of agriculture in 1960 caused the disappearance of hemp production by peasants.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you get interested in hemp breeding?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In 1949, at the beginning of my career, I was appointed as the assistant of Dr. Rudolf Fleischmann, who founded the Kompolt Research Institute in 1918 and who started working with hemp in 1920. His cultivar &quot;Fleischmann&quot; was very famous in all of Eastern and Central Europe. It replaced the Italian cultivars Carmagnola and Bolognese which were grown until then. Our cultivar &quot;Kompolti&quot; initially originated from &quot;Fleischmann&quot;. After Fleischmann's death in 1951 his 'inheritance' was divided between the three breeders working at Kompolt. As I was the youngest of the three, I got the two crops the others did not want: hemp and alfalfa. Hemp was not an easy crop to do breeding work on, as there was not much literature available. At that time only German and Russian literature was available.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Why have you bred dioecious cultivars while many other hemp breeders have developed monoecious cultivars?
<HR SIZE=4>

























Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa <FONT SIZE=2>(Photo R.C. Clarke.)</FONT>
<HR SIZE=4>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> The natural state in which hemp appears was and is dioecious. Monoeciousness is artificial in hemp, it can only exist with the help of man, and without selection, the dioecious state will return in two or three generations. It is therefore very hard and demanding to keep 90 to 95 % monoeciousness during seed multiplications. Apart from that, however, monoecious hemp is appropriate only when the crop is grown for so-called double use, i.e. when both stem and seed are harvested. This is the case in France and in the former Soviet Union, where most crops are grown for double use. In a dioecious crop, the male plants will be strongly deteriorated when the crop is harvested at seed ripeness, so in this case one needs monoecious cultivars. In Hungary and its neighbouring countries, like formerly in Italy, this double use is unknown. Here fibre hemp is grown as a dense crop which is harvested at the time of male flowering (&quot;green hemp&quot;), while seed production takes place in crops grown at a low plant density and with completely different growing techniques. For this 'classic' use monoecious cultivars are of no use, so we never bred a monoecious cultivar.<P>
Furthermore, monoeciousness has two large disadvantages. In the first place, all monoecious cultivars which I tested over the last 20 to 25 years yielded 10 to 20 % less than dioecious cultivars. This is caused by the possibility of self-pollination and the resulting inbreeding. With model experiments and with biometric determinations we have established that 20-25 % of self-pollination takes place in monoecious hemp, and this is the cause of the lower stem yield. In the second place, in monoecious hemp, the genetic progress for fibre content is slow, because the so-called Bredemann principle can not be used. The Bredemann principle consists of the rapid determination of fibre content in male plants before they flower, so that only the males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate the female plants. In a breeding garden (nursery) of one hectare, I have 15,000 to 20,000 plants and I need only the very best 50 to 100 males for the pollination. (This can be compared to breeding of dairy cows, where a few hundred extremely good bulls inseminate all the cows of an entire country.) In monoecious hemp this approach can not be used, so the rate of genetic progress is only 50 % or less of that in dioecious hemp. In spite of these disadvantages, we use a monoecious hemp cultivar in breeding, but only as a parent for unisexual hemp.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Which brings up the next question: why did you develop a unisex cultivar?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> After the collectivization of agriculture in Hungary in the early sixties, the farmers were no longer interested in producing hemp seed, an activity which has not been mechanized until the present day. As a result of this, seed for sowing became scarce and the hemp industry had to import poor-quality land races from Turkey. From the research conducted by McPhee, von Sengbusch and Hoffmann we know that when a monoecious hemp plant pollinates a dioecious female the offspring (F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>) consists for over 90 % of females, for 3-5 % of monoecious plants bearing mainly female flowers and for only 2-3 % of true males. This small number of males however is sufficient to ensure adequate pollination of the crop. As the stand consists mainly of seed-bearing (female + monoecious) plants, with the same habit, we called it unisexual hemp. Such a stand yields 60 - 80 % more seed than a dioecious cultivar. The seed produced on this stand (F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>) is used as sowing seed for fibre production. We called this cultivar &quot;UNIKO-B&quot;. It is, in fact, a &quot;single-cross&quot; between Kompolti and Fibrimon, but it is the F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT> generation which is commercialized. Von Sengbusch and Hoffmann described the phenomenon, but they did not think of its practical use. In Kompolt we make the cross between Kompolti and Fibrimon on a surface of 5 hectare (ha), this yields 2,500 kg of F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> seed. The F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> seed is sown on a surface of 500 ha, yielding 400,000 kg of F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT> seed, which is used to sow 3,000-3,500 ha of fibre hemp.<P>
Unisexuality also can be used to exploit the effect of heterosis which occurs when Chinese and European (Kompolti) cultivars are crossed. This heterosis can increase stem yield by 8-15 %. To be able to cross two cultivars we have to construct a female parent which is &quot;male sterile&quot;, a unisexual F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> can be used as such. In order to obtain a unisexual chinese line we used Fibrimon as the donor, which was backcrossed many times until we obtained a monoecious line with a Chinese habit. We crossed this line with the original dioecious Chinese cultivar to obtain a unisexual Chinese F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>. This F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> was crossed with Kompolti hemp to obtain Kompolti Hybrid TC. The stem yield of Kompolti Hybrid TC  is 5-8 % higher than that of Kompolti. The unisexual Chinese F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> has an unsurpassed seed yield potential of up to 1,500-1,600 kg per ha.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> You made Kompolti Hybrid TC by crossing populations. Do you think much can be gained by using inbred lines to make hybrids?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> I can not answer this question because I never made inbred lines. It takes too long to make inbred lines and it is technically very difficult.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What techniques did you use to develop your cultivars which have the highest fibre content of all existing hemp cultivars?<P> 
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> As I explained in response to an earlier question, I used the Bredemann principle, which consists of the rapid determination of fibre content in male plants before they flower, so that only the males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate the female plants. In some of my cultivars bark content is 38 - 40 %, this corresponds to a bast fibre content of 32 - 34 %. If the bark content is higher than 40 % the crop may lodge.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How important is fibre quality relative to fibre content?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Fibre quality is negatively related to fibre content. As we continue to select for fibre content we unwillingly increase the proportion of secondary fibre, which has a negative effect on fibre quality.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Do cultivars differ in fibre fineness?
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In a study comparing several cultivars on a number of locations, we found that the differences in fibre fineness between the locations were bigger than the differences between the cultivars.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you develop Panorama, the world's only ornamental hemp cultivar?<P>  
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In a grow out of hemp from Lebanon we found two or three short and strongly branched plants. This character was lost in the F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>, it reappeared in the F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>. Through breeding I obtained a pure variety. We also made a monoecious version, because for an ornamental cultivar it is preferable if there are no male plants which die early. Panorama was commercialized in Hungary in the 1980s, but it was not much sold.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you develop Kompolti S&aacute;rgasz&aacute;r&uacute;, the yellow stem hemp cultivar?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Yellow stem was a mutation from professor Hoffmann, it was very early and very short. I crossed and backcrossed it often with the normal Kompolti to improve its stem yield and fibre content. In the end, we reached a very high fibre content, but its stem yield remained 15 % inferior to that of Kompolti. The textile factory liked the yellow stem very much, because in poor weather conditions the yellow stems can be dried in sheafs instead of being dried on the field. If this is done with normal hemp it causes problems because the stems in the middle of the sheaf do not lose their green colour, which eventually has a negative effect on the fibre colour.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Current hemp cultivars were developed for textile fibre production. Do you think it will be feasible to develop special cultivars for seed production or for paper production?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> For textile production, new cultivars are not needed, because we have maximum stem yield and maximum fibre content. For paper production the high-fibre cultivars are very suitable, the presence of secondary bast fibre is no problem in this case. For seed production we have unisex, the single cross mother of Hybrid TC. It can yield up to 1,600 kg/ha of seed.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What is the present status of your hemp cultivars, which can be bought in commercial quantities and through whom?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Currently available are Kompolti, UNIKO-B, Kompolti Hybrid TC (but this cultivar contains too much THC for growing it in the EU) and Fibriko, which is like Kompolti Hybrid TC but with Kompolti  S&aacute;rgasz&aacute;r&uacute; instead of Kompolti as the father. Fibriko is not yellow but its fibre quality is better than that of Kompolti Hybrid TC. The cultivars belong to the GATE Agricultural Research Institute, but the institute is not allowed to do business, so a company called Fibroseed was founded. Fibroseed sells seed and pays the royalties to the GATE Institute.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What was the most important discovery or technique in the history of hemp breeding?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> The use of the Bredemann principle was the most important innovation, the second most important  contribution to hemp breeding was the development of monoecious hemp and in the third place I would list the making of unisexual hemp.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What would be the most important developments to help make hemp a main-stream agricultural crop?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> First the laws which forbid hemp growing in a large number of countries will have to be changed. In the second place technical innovation is needed, we need better machines for harvesting and for the entire processing chain.

<CENTER>63<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>The 1994 TAPPI pulping conference</H1>
<FONT SIZE=4>Ir. Gertjan van Roekel, Jr.</FONT><P>
ATO-DLO Agrotechnology, P.O. Box 17,  6700 AA Wageningen, The Netherlands.<BR>

The scenic San Diego (California, USA) bay was this year's setting for the annual pulping conference of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry of the USA.<P> 
Eleven hundred engineers, managers, consultants, equipment manufacturers, suppliers and researchers presented and discussed almost 150 papers on various aspects of pulping wood and non-wood fibre sources. Papers covered the whole range of raw material supply, up to the quality of pulps for papermaking, with a clear emphasis on raw material supply and on advances in bleaching technology.<P> 
A number of countries are experiencing shortages in wood supply: western Canada, northwest USA, Japan, China, and India. The US and Canada import trees from, for instance, Chile to keep a major economic activity (pulping) going, and Japan is importing Eucalypts from Australia. Especially for Asia, the importance of nonwood fibres to meet the rapidly increasing demand for paper was widely recognised.<P>
Bleaching operations and research for advanced bleaching technology were widely discussed, since the industry is in the process of changing from open bleaching systems using chlorine to closed systems using peroxide, oxygen and ozone with reduced emissions to the environment. Also, the recently developed use of microbial enzymes in the so-called biobleaching process has actually been implemented in large scale pulpmills.
<H3>Non-wood pulp</H3>
In the non-wood sessions, papers were presented on cultivation, harvest, storage, preprocessing, pulping and papermaking properties of kenaf, bagasse, bamboo, reed canary grass, wheat straw, seedflax and hemp. The heavily crowded &#147;non-wood room&#148; gave the impression that non-wood fibres have gained increased interest.  
<H3>New technologies</H3>
Several research institutions had come up with new systems and ideas for more efficient pulping methods, with higher yields and less environmental impact.<P> 
The process of treating hemp and kenaf fibre with fungi prior to mechanical pulping showed that such a method can prove useful in reducing energy consumption without losing pulp quality. The fungal treatment may be combined with the storage between harvest and processing.<P>
A paper by J.E. Harsveld van der Veen from ATO-DLO in the Netherlands disputed one of the most firm beliefs in fibre pulping: the idea that fibres are held together only by lignin. The paper suggests that not only lignin, but also pectin plays an active role in fibre bonding in plants and trees. Therefore, pulping methods designed for removing lignin are inefficient, and should be modified to remove the complex of both lignin and pectin.
<H3>Hemp</H3>
The use of hemp as a papermaking fibre was mentioned a few times in  relation to very special and technical applications. Delegates tended to opt for kenaf and seedflax for bulk non-wood papermaking in the US. Seedflax is a fibre very much comparable to hemp, and actually in use as a specific cigarette paper. It is available in huge quantities in Canada, virtually for free, since it is a byproduct of linseed oil production. Kenaf is grown in the southern US states, and seems to do very well. It is preferred over hemp for non-wood &#147;tree-free&#148; paper production in the US, because of the prohibition of hemp cultivation.
<H3>General impression</H3>
The pulping industry is running short of trees. As a result, woodpulp prices have gone sky-high (+130% in one year). Even with this in mind, the majority of delegates still feel that it will take another thirty years before fibre crops will be grown on a large scale in the western world. The reason is the low cost of bulk transport, and the often government-supported exploitation of wood plantations all over the world. It is still cheaper to ship wood from Chile to Canada than to grow hemp there (although the situation is changing rapidly). When the cost of bulk transportation increases,  certain areas will be better off growing their own fibre crops.<P>
Until then, the use of agricultural wastes such as seedflax straw and cereal straw will be encouraged. These materials are available free, and will probably attain a negative cost as they become more and more difficult to dispose of by incineration.<P>
Asian countries like China and India will see continued and increased use of non-wood fibre, but with improved and environmentally cleaner technology. It may well be that the technologies developed in the West will be applied and fine-tuned in the East, until the West starts using nonwood fibre. The only exception in the western world is the market where consumers insist on paper made without cutting trees. The tree-free paper market is expected to grow further, since cutting of primary forests is still going on, even for papermaking, and many consumers are not willing to support deforestation.<P>

in Cologne and the marketing firm TriTec, Bochum, have organized
the first international product and technology exhibition on hemp
as a bioresource, to be held from March 2-5, 1995.in Frankfurt.
The first international scientific-technological symposium on
the subject of hemp will be held concurrently.
<H3>Product and Technology Exhibition</H3>
The aim of the BIORESOURCE HEMP  is to support the realization
of innovative ecological products based on hemp; to bring together
scientists, companies and institutions involved in hemp technology
and hemp product development. Further synergistic effects result
from its proximity to BIO FACH '95, which is the largest trade
fair of ecological consumer goods world-wide. In March 1994, more
than 675 BIO FACH exhibitors displayed their products. At the
same time, the BIO FACH Congress also takes place. There, experts
report on current topics relevant to the eco-industry.<P>
Owing to the proximity to BIO FACH,  the exhibitors of BIORESOURCE
HEMP  have the opportunity to present their new product lines
and innovative technologies to a great number of ecologically
interested visitors. Approximately 30 companies and institutes
from various countries will present their technologies and products
in a projected exhibition area of 1,000 square meters.
<H3>Technological-Scientific Symposium</H3>
A four-day hemp symposium will also be held. Conference languages
are German and English and the admission fee for 4 days is DM
600 (students DM 300). For one day it is DM 250 (students DM 125).
For IHA members, a 20% reduction applies if the registration fee
is paid before February 28.<P>
The symposium will cover the entire spectrum of current international hemp research and technology development. The scientific level of the symposium is intended to allow a realistic assessment of the unquestionably attractive biological resource, hemp.<P>
Preliminary program:<P>
First day, March 2:
<UL>
<LI>Introduction 
<LI>The rediscovery of hemp: status reports from selected countries.
</UL>
Second day, March 3:
<UL>

<CENTER>65<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Guide for authors</H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE></CENTER>The Journal of the International Hemp Association publishes original research, literature reviews and news items on hemp. Contributions concern fibre, seed and resin, and can come from a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, chemistry, ecology, economy and markets, genetic resources and breeding, history, medicine, physiology, phytopathology, products and applications, and technology. Since the readership of the IHA Journal is much broader than for a single-discipline journal, highly specialized terminology should be defined or avoided. The significance of a statement, or the reasoning behind a conclusion, may have to be more fully explained than in a more specialized journal.<P>
Contributions should be written in English and not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words), longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized in two consecutive issues. Authors not fluent in English must have their paper reviewed and checked by a colleague who is fluent.<P>
Manuscripts can be submitted to: IHA Journal, Editorial Office, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The preferred medium of submission is on disk with accompanying manuscript in triplicate.<P> 
<B>Units</B>. Research papers and literature reviews should use the International (SI, or metric) system throughout.<P> 
<B>Title page</B>. The title page should give the following information: 1) title of the paper; 2) names and addresses of the authors.<P>
<B>Abstract</B>. The abstract should be 100 to 250 words suitable for readers from a broad range of disciplines. The abstract should summarize the aim of the work, the methods used, and give the main results and conclusions.<P>
<B>Structure</B>. Research papers should be subdivided into four main sections: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results and Discussion. The last three sections may be subdivided to improve clarity; a Conclusions section may be added if appropriate. The section on Materials and Methods should be succinct, but should contain sufficient detail to enable the reader to deduce what exactly was done. All abreviations and acronyms must be fully defined when first used. Numerical results should be shown in tables or figures.<P>
<B>References. </B>Publications are cited in the text by author(s) and date e.g. (Smith 1980). For publications by more than two authors use (first author et al. date). Under references, papers should be cited as follows:<P>

<H3>Manuscript preparation.</H3> 
The entire manuscript, including abstract and references, should be typed on one side of standard-size paper, double spaced with all margins 2.5 cm. Starting with the title page, label all pages in the upper righthand corner with the first author's last name and the page number. Do not use hyphens unless the hyphen is part of the word. Tables should fit on one page, be numbered consecutively, and each table should be on a separate sheet. Every figure and table should have an explanatory title, so that it can be understood without reference to the text. For both tables and figures, authors should indicate on the manuscript the preferred position of insertion in the text of the paper. Every table and figure should be mentioned at least once in the text.
<H3>Manuscript submission.</H3>
Manuscripts should be submitted in triplicate to: Editorial Office, IHA Journal, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. All research papers and literature reviews will be carefully refereed for international relevance and quality. Submission of an article is understood to imply that the article is an original contribution that has not been published elsewhere in substantially the same form, and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere. 
<H3>Electronic manuscripts.</H3>
Once a paper is accepted, the preferred medium of submission is on 3.5 inch disk (Macintosh or MS-DOS format), preferably MS word 5.0 or later, with accompanying manuscript. It is important that the file on disk and the printout are identical. Do not allow the word processor to introduce word splits and do not use a 'justified' layout. It is very important that files are saved in the word processor format. If the word processor features the option to save files &quot;in flat ASCII&quot;, please do not use it. Please ensure that only the relevant file (one complete article) is on the disk. Also, specify the type of computer and word processing package used and label the disk with the first author's name and the name of the file on the disk.

<H1>VIR germplasm preservation project</H1>

In 1994, the Vavilov Research Institute/International Hemp Association <I>Cannabis</I> Germplasm Preservation Project had its second successful year of growing out endangered seed accessions. The project was expanded in 1994 to include facilities in the Ukraine and Italy. However, additional grow out locations must be arranged for 1995 and 1996. A progress report will be presented by the IHA at the Bioresource Hemp symposium to be held in Frankfurt, Germany, March 2-5, 1995 and will also be published in the third issue of the Journal of the International Hemp Association.<P> 
The most important obstacle the VIR/IHA project faces is funding for the 1995 grow outs. A concerted effort will be made to canvas the symposium participants for both IHA membership and public/private grants to support the <I>Cannabis</I> Germplasm Preservation Project.<P>
The IHA will also present several other talks at Bioresource Hemp concerning various aspects of <I>Cannabis, </I>its production and utilization. We anticipate that this symposium will bring together many interesting members of the <I>Cannabis</I> community and it should be very worthwhile for those interested in the advancement of <I>Cannabis</I> as an environmentally friendly crop (see announcement on pg. 64).

<H1>Diversity in <I>Cannabis</I></H1>

The PhD thesis, &quot;<B>Diversity in <I>Cannabis</I></B>&quot; (available through the IHA), which  Etienne de Meijer defended on 22 December 1994, reports on the evaluation of a collection of <I>Cannabis</I> germplasm at the Centre for Plant Breeding and Reproduction Research, at Wageningen, in the Netherlands.  About 160 accessions were evaluated for traits related to stem production, stem quality, psychoactive potency and resistance to soil pathogens. Prospects for the breeding of improved cultivars for paper pulp production were based on the diversity for these traits, their stability, and mutual relations.<P>
Variation in stem production could be attributed largely to differences in phenological development, which again was related to the latitude of origin of the accessions. Large variation was found for the fraction of bark tissue, woody core and primary and secondary bark fibre in the stem. Since woody core fibres of <I>Cannabis</I> are on average too short to produce high quality paper, the evaluation was directed at variation for core fibre dimensions as well. This variation proved to be very limited and breeding for improved core quality was not considered promising. Accessions were classified into the phenotypes 'drug', 'intermediate' and 'non-drug' on the basis of their contents of the cannabinoids <I>delta</I>-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. There were no strict relationships between the cannabinoid profiles and other traits. Significant variation was further revealed in host reactions to the root-knot nematode <I>Meloidogyne</I> <I>hapla</I>.<P>
The study indicated that many combinations of character states can be established through breeding. An <I>a</I> <I>priori</I> grouping of accessions based on the purpose and status of domestication (fibre cultivars, fibre landraces, drug strains, and wild or naturalized populations) was validated by the experimental observations. Contents of bark fibre and cannabinoids discriminated most between groups. A genetic characterization on the basis of electrophoretic patterns of seed proteins was unsatisfactory as it neither reflected common ancestry, nor showed a relation with groupings based on origin or agronomic and morphological traits.

conference that doctors who prescribe or recommend marijuana
under voter-approved provisions in California and Arizona may
face criminal prosecution under federal law and lose their
ability to write prescriptions.&nbsp; Federal officials had
threatened to take such action for months, but had not endorsed a
formal strategy until Monday's press conference.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The recent passage of propositions which make dangerous
drugs more available in California and Arizona poses a threat to
the National Drug Control Strategy goal of reducing drug abuse in
the United States,&quot; stated Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey in a
seven-page release outlining the administration's response to the
initiatives.&nbsp; &quot;These propositions are not about
compassion, they are about legalizing dangerous drugs,&quot; he
told reporters.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The administration's proposal states that the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) will revoke the federal registrations of
physicians who recommend or prescribe marijuana according to the
provisions of the newly enacted state laws.&nbsp; McCaffrey and
Attorney General Janet Reno also stated that the Justice
Department may criminally prosecute physicians who prescribe
marijuana for use in treatment.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe it's outrageous that the federal government is
using taxpayer's money in this way, to go after honest doctors
caring for very sick people,&quot; said Dr. Toni Brayer of the
San Francisco Medical Society, which represents about 2,200 AIDS
and cancer specialists in the bay area and backs California's
medical marijuana measure.&nbsp; Brayer was one of many
physicians nationwide who criticized the administration's
strategy.&nbsp; She accused the administration of using
&quot;scare tactics to frighten legitimate doctors from using
[marijuana] for very sick people.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Fellow San Francisco physician, Dr. Richard Cohen agreed.
&quot;The federal government is stepping in and literally
intimidating ... a patient population that could be helped,&quot;
he told reporters.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">They can't go after the voters in California and Arizona, so they
go after the medical profession,&quot; said Dr. David C. Lewis,
director of the Center for Alcohol and Addictive Studies at Brown
University.&nbsp; &quot;Now the federal government is entering
the practice of medicine, placing itself in the physician's
office between the doctor and patient.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also announced his opposition
to the Clinton-backed plan.&nbsp; &quot;Medical practitioners who
are following the dictates of their profession and the laws
adopted by the voters of their states by prescribing the method
they think best suited to reduce suffering in seriously ill
people do not deserve to be persecuted by the federal
government,&quot; said Frank, a longtime supporter of medical
marijuana.&nbsp; Frank worked with <strong>NORML</strong> in 1995
to introduce federal legislation permitting physicians to
prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent for seriously ill
patients (H.R. 2618).&nbsp; &quot;What we have here is an
instance of the Federal Executive Branch... overturning the
voters of two states, not because of some conflict with some
Constitutional principle, but because the federal government
disagrees with the citizen's policy choices.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>NORML</strong> Executive Director, Attorney R. Keith
Stroup elaborated on Frank's statements.&nbsp; &quot;Although the
state initiatives exempt medical patients from state criminal
penalties prohibiting the cultivation and use of marijuana,
Justice Department lawyers concede that there exists no solid
constitutional grounds for attacking the initiatives in
court.&nbsp; There is no requirement that each state adopt
criminal penalty to mimic each and every federal drug law.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stroup also questioned the administration's assurance that it
&quot;will continue to review claims about the possible [medical]
benefit of smoked marijuana,&quot; noting that an FDA-approved
protocol by San Francisco researcher Dr. Donald Abrams to examine
marijuana's effect on the AIDS wasting syndrome has been
stonewalled by the National Institute on Drug Abuse for four
years.&nbsp; Recent plans to conduct a state-sponsored study at
Washington State University to evaluate claims by cancer patients
and others about the medical effectiveness of marijuana have also
been delayed by federal officials, Stroup added.&nbsp;
&quot;Government officials are engaging in sophistry.&nbsp; On
the one hand, they deny the existence of scientific studies
conducted throughout the 1970's and 1980's indicating marijuana's
medical utility and block new federal research, while on the
other, they argue that the sick and dying should be denied an
effective medication because there is not enough research.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Loren Siegel, director of public education for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) agreed. Calling McCaffrey's remarks the
&quot;height of hypocrisy&quot; in a released statement, Siegel
noted that the federal &quot;government has consistently impeded
research into medical marijuana -- for political, not scientific
reasons.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Another critical aspect of the controversial federal plan allows
the DEA to &quot;adopt&quot; seizures of marijuana and other
Schedule I controlled substances made by state and local law
enforcement officials following an arrest where state and local
prosecutors must decline prosecution because of the newly
established state laws.&nbsp; Once in the possession of the DEA,
the drugs can be destroyed and further criminal action may be
pursued.&nbsp; However, federal officials admit that it is
unlikely that the agency will prosecute small time offenders.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The administration also warned employees and contractors who
received federal funds that individuals may not use the state
provisions as an exemption to the requirements of the Federal
Drug-Free Workplace program.&nbsp; &quot;Medical Review Officers
will not accept physician recommendations for Schedule I
substances as a legitimate explanation for a positive drug
test,&quot; the plan states.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the plan recommends that physicians who prescribe or
recommend marijuana to patients be excluded from the Medicaid and
Medicare programs.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The American Medical Association (AMA), one of the country's
primary physician's groups, urged doctor's &quot;to prescribe
[only] effective, legal medications ... to compassionately treat
disease and relieve pain&quot; for now, and requested for
&quot;federal funding of research to determine the validity of
marijuana as an effective medical treatment.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The administration's actions this week effectively wreak
havoc on not only states' rights and the will of the voters, but
also on the First Amendment rights of doctors and the privileged
relationship between a physician and his or her patient,&quot;
summarized <strong>NORML</strong> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Patients who could benefit from marijuana's
therapeutic value remain held hostage by a federal administration
that appears more concerned about political rhetoric than the
well being of the sick and dying.&quot;<br>

<p align="center">December 19, 1996</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Latest High School Senior
Survey Data Fuels Anti-Drug Rhetoric<br>
NORML Responds To Calls To Escalate Drug War</b></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The statistics indicating rising levels of teen marijuana use
among secondary school students as reported by the Monitoring the
Future study should be an issue of concern for both parents and
political leaders alike.&nbsp; <b>NORML opposes the use of
marijuana, or other drugs including alcohol and tobacco, by
adolescents.&nbsp; NORML remains committed to the notion that
adolescents should grow up drug-free.</b>&nbsp; <u>However, there
is no evidence to demonstrate that increasing penalties against
adult users will address this problem.</u>&nbsp; In fact, federal
statistics indicate that just the opposite is true.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite criticism that the Clinton administration has
abandoned the drug war, FBI figures show that nearly six hundred
thousand Americans were arrested on marijuana charges in
1995.&nbsp; This brings the total number of arrests under the
Clinton administration to 1,450,751 and equates to an arrest
every 54 seconds over the past year!&nbsp; (More than 83 percent
of those arrests were for simple possession.)</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In spite of this significant increase in the enforcement of
marijuana laws, recent evidence such as the Monitoring the Future
study indicates that the use of marijuana is rising, especially
among adolescents.&nbsp; <b>This fact confirms that marijuana
prohibition does not effectively deter marijuana use.</b></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Today's rates of adolescent drug use are better understood
when put in historical perspective.&nbsp; Data from the
Monitoring the Future study indicate that current rates of
adolescent marijuana use, both regular and lifetime, remain well
below what they were some years ago.&nbsp; According to the
Monitoring the Future Study, lifetime prevalence of marijuana use
among high-school seniors peaked in 1979 at 60 percent, a figure
that remains almost one-third higher than today's 44.9 percent.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We will probably never know why marijuana use-rates fluctuate
over time.&nbsp; It is crucial to note, however, that the recent
increase has occurred among the same population of young people
who have been exposed to a decade-long anti-marijuana campaign in
the schools and the media.&nbsp; <b>That campaign, based on
exaggerations of marijuana's alleges harms and a 'Just say no'
ideology has clearly failed.</b>&nbsp; Programs like DARE lack
credibility and have not influenced adolescents to abstain from
drugs.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The issue of adolescent marijuana use remains a key concern
for <b>NORML</b> and must be dealt with rationally by
America.&nbsp; Recently, we have offered to work with Office of
National Drug Control Policy Director Barry McCaffrey
specifically on this matter.&nbsp; Clearly, today's figures
should serve as a wake-up call to change our current, often
extremist drug education strategies.&nbsp; Moreover, while
today's figures should warrant concern among parents and all
Americans, they certainly do not justify intensifying the war
against adult marijuana users.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Reform Measure Signed Into Law In
Arizona</b></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 9, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; Arizona Gov. Fife
Symington has signed Proposition 200 into law.&nbsp; The
voter-approved measure, formally known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; drastically
reforms state drug policy by shifting the emphasis from law
enforcement to treatment and education.&nbsp; Symington had
threatened to veto the measure last month despite it having
passed with 65 percent of the vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although more attention has been paid to California's recenfly
approved medical marijuana law, Arizona's measure is a far more
radical departure from current anti-drag strategies.&nbsp;
Specifically, Proposition 200 states the following: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Any person convicted of the personal possession or use of a
controlled substance shall be eligible for probation.</b>&nbsp;
Eligibility for probation is limited to first and/or second time
offenders and is contingent upon an individuals participation in
an &quot;appropriate drug treatment or education
program.&quot;&nbsp; State funds will be set aside and made
avallable to those unable to pay for such programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Non-violent persons currently in prison for personal
possession of illegal drugs and not serving a concurrent sentence
for another crime shall be made eligible for immediate parole and
drug treatment, education and community service.</b>&nbsp;
Prisoners so eligible must be deemed not to be a &quot;danger to
the general public&quot; by the Arizona Board of Executive
Clemency.&nbsp; Currentiy, the state Department of Corrections
has identified 976 inmates who are eligible for release under the
new law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Any person who commits a violent crime while under the
influence of illegal drugs should serve 100 percent of his or her
sentence with absolutely no early release.</b> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Any medical doctor licensed to practice in Arizona may
prescribe a controlled substance included in Schedule I to treat
a disease, or to relieve the paln and suffering of a seriously or
terminally ill patient.</b>&nbsp; In order for the prescription
to be valid, Proposition 200 requires the prescribing physician
to &quot;obtain the written opinion of a second medical doctor
[stating] that the prescribing of the controlled substance is
appropriate.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, the prescribing physician
must document that scientific research exists which supports the
use of the Schedule I drug being prescribed.&nbsp; Drafters of
the legislation maintain that this last clause currently limits
the Schedule I drugs that may be prescribed solely to marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* A nine-member Parents Commission on Drug Education and
Prevention shall be created to establish programs that will
increase parental involvement and education about the risks and
public health problems caused by the abuse of alcohol and
controlled substances.&nbsp; Members of the commission shall be
appointed by the governor for a term of two years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Taken as a whole, the message sent by 65 percent of the
Arizona voters who supported Proposition 200 is staggering,&quot;
announced <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Never in recent memory have such a large number of American
voters so resolutely rejected our nation's federal policy of 'Do
Drugs, Do Time.'&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This could be a crack in the Berlin Wall,&quot; rejoiced
Phoenix surgeon Jeffrey Singer, who campaigned for the law.&nbsp;
&quot;Five years from now, people will see Arizona is not
suffering from mass addictions and, perhaps, even having rational
discussions about decriminalization of all drugs -- that's what
the drug warriors fear most.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;As with We fall of Communism, the drug wars will be over in
a few years and America will be safer for it,&quot; agreed
Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson.&nbsp; Wilson and other
AZ4NORML members are hoping to work with the offices of Gov.
Symington and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to establish
&quot;tolerance zones&quot; where patients with marijuana
prescriptions may have them filled by state licensed marijuana
dealers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Arizona can take pride in being the first state in the
nation to realize the 'War on Drugs' is a dismal failure and has
gone on long enough,&quot; summarized Arizona NORML Secretary
William Green, who is licensed by the state to sell and possess
marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Arizona is set to lead the nation out of
the nightmarish 'War on Drugs.'&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For more information or copies of Proposition 200, please contact

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Drug Czar, Secretary Of
Transportation Reaffirm<br>
Federal Drug Testing Laws</b></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey and Department of Transportation Secretary
Federico Penn held a joint press conference today to issue a
strong national warning from the Clinton Administration that the
federal transportation drug testing laws will continue to be
fully enforced without any effect whatsoever from the recent
passage of Proposition 215 in California or Proposition 200 in
Arizona. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The [federal] law is clear,&quot; said McCaffrey and Pena.&nbsp;
&quot;If you are a safety-sensitive transportation worker and
you're caught using drugs, these propositions don't mean a
thing.&nbsp; You're out of a job.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Drug Czar elaborated that users of medical marijuana will not
be granted an exemption from federal drug testing
regulations.&nbsp; &quot;The use ... of marijuana under
California Proposition 215 or of any Schedule I drug under
Arizona Proposition 200 is not a legitimate explanation,&quot; he
emphasized.&nbsp; &quot;As a matter of fact and a matter of
federal law, marijuana and other drugs listed on Schedule I of
the Controlled Substances Act do not have legitimate medical use
in the United States.&nbsp; Thus, if you test positive for
marijuana, and tell the MRO that a doctor recommended or
prescribed the use of marijuana for you, the MRO will [still]
verify the test positive&quot; and you will lose your job. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since the passage of these initiatives, it has been clear
that the administration would rather work against the will of the
voters rather than with them,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Rhetoric Mounts Over Medical Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 3, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Voter-approved initiatives in California and Arizona regarding
medical access to marijuana are not only garnering national
headlines, but also the ire of various federal and state
officials.&nbsp; Most recently, the initiatives were the subject
of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which federal elected
officials and representatives from law enforcement reaffirmed
their opposition to the notion of medical marijuana and warned of
the potential for similar initiatives to crop up in other states. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This ballot measure] begins a road to destruction of
people's lives in this country,&quot; said Sen Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.),
one of only three senators who attended the hearing.&nbsp; Kyl
called the Arizona and California drug-law reform campaigns
classic examples of &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactics and
alleged that the voters in those states were &quot;deceived&quot;
by proponents. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The contention that the public was duped is absurd,&quot;
countered Marvin S. Cohen, who testified on behalf of Arizonans
for Drug Policy Reform.&nbsp; &quot;Voters knew exactly what they
were doing on November 5.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Rather than accept the outcomes of the initiatives as a
mandate that Americans want access to medical marijuana for the
seriously ill, some elected officials on both the state and
federal level are in a state of denial,&quot; charged <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It is more
convenient for them to claim that voters were somehow misled by
initiative proponents rather than to acknowledge that they are
out of step with their constituents.&nbsp; The voters of America
strongly favor allowing seriously ill patients to use medical
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the initiatives' passage, there has been considerable
public speculation as to whether the federal government will
target physicians and patients who comply with the new state
laws.&nbsp; To date, no specific recommendations have come from
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).&nbsp; Both
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey and Drug Enforcement Administrator
Thomas Constantine testified that federal law prohibiting
cultivation and possession of marijuana remain in full force
despite the states' actions.&nbsp; Constantine also threatened
that the federal government could &quot;take both administrative
and criminal actions against doctors who violate the terms of
their DEA drug registrations that authorize them to prescribe
controlled substances.&quot;&nbsp; However, both officials also
admitted the federal government lacks the manpower to enforce the
federal marijuana laws on a wide scale within the states. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that, &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions
of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It further provides that, &quot;Physicians
shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for
recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The Act does not supersede state
legislation prohibiting persons from possessing or cultivating
marijuana for non-medical purposes.&nbsp; California voters
approved the measure by a vote of 56 to 44 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; is broader than
California's measure and would essentially &quot;medicalize&quot;
Arizona's drug policy.&nbsp; The Act calls for mandatory, court
supervised treatment and probation as an alternative to
incarceration for non-violent drug users and provides expanded
drug treatment programs.&nbsp; It also permits doctors to
prescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patients
suffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiple
sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS.&nbsp; Arizonans voted in favor of
the initiative by a vote of 65 to 35 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Fallout from the ongoing medical marijuana debate has quickly
branched out to other states.&nbsp; In Ohio, lawmakers have
threatened to repeal a 1995 provision that provides patients with
an &quot;affirmative defense&quot; in court if they can prove
they were using marijuana under the prior written order of their
physician.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> activists in Ohio lobbied the state
legislature for nearly two years on behalf of the measure which
took effect on July 1, 1996.&nbsp; To date, no medical marijuana users
have had to utilize the new law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If it is repealed, there is every reason to believe that
the voters will get a chance to put the law back on the books in
1998, through an initiative,&quot; said Dave Fratello of
Americans for Medical Rights (AMR), which sponsored the
successful Proposition 215 campaign in California.&nbsp;
&quot;Our group will work with local patients' rights advocates
and medical groups to examine the options if repeal
happens.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML President John Hartman, who lobbied for the
provision, is hopeful that such action will not be
necessary.&nbsp; Currently, he is mobilizing citizens to urge
legislators to keep the present law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, in Connecticut, Chief State's Attorney John M. Bailey
warned Monday that a similar referendum regarding medical access
to marijuana could develop in that state as well.&nbsp; &quot;People
who are promoting legalizing drugs will be coming into
Connecticut,&quot; he told the press in reference to the
successful Arizona and California campaigns.&nbsp; Ironically,
Connecticut already has a law on the books that allows physicians
to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from glaucoma or
cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp; Because of apparent conflict with
federal law and the fact that the state measure fails to make
provisions regarding a legal supply of marijuana, the law has
never been used. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is somewhat presumptuous for the Connecticut State
Attorney General to claim that medical marijuana reformers will
be coming to his state, specifically when Connecticut is one of
the few states that already has a law on the books allowing
physicians to prescribe marijuana,&quot; said St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;I am unaware of any current plans by medical marijuana
proponents to target Connecticut.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The outpouring of national debate and public sympathy
regarding medical marijuana since the election has been
tremendous,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Publications Director Paul
Armentano.&nbsp; &quot;The American people have spoken and our
state and federal officials have an obligation to listen, not to plot
against them.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Senate To Hold Hearing Regarding
Medical Marijuana Initiatives</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 26, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Monday,
December 2, regarding the potential impact of and federal
response to voter-approved drug reform initiatives in California
and Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as a
medicine.&nbsp; The committee, headed by vocal medical marijuana
opponents Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Joe Biden (D-Del.), has
entitled the hearing: &quot;A Prescription for Addiction?&nbsp;
The Arizona and California Medical Drug Use
Initiatives.&quot;&nbsp; Biden and others previously voiced their disapproval
over the notion of medical marijuana at a September 4 hearing
regarding adolescent drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among those who have reportedly been invited to attend the
hearing are Drug Czar Barry Mccaffrey, California Attorney
General Dan Lungren, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, Drug Enforcement
Administrator Thomas Constantine, and Maricopa County Prosecutor
Rick Romley, all ardent opponents of the initiatives.&nbsp;
Reportedly, neither McCaffrey nor Lungren is likely to appear
because of scheduling conflicts.&nbsp; It is expected that a
physician opposed to medical marijuana will be brought in to
testify as well. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In defense of the initiatives, <b>NORML</b> is currently working
with Senate Judiciary Committee member Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
to try to get Harvard Medical Professor, Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
scheduled to testify at the hearing.&nbsp; Grinspoon is a member
of <b>NORML</b>'s Board of Directors and has authored numerous
books and articles in scientific journals regarding marijuana's therapeutic
value.&nbsp; At this time, the committee has yet to make a final
decision. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the initiatives' passage, proponents have speculated as to
whether the federal government will target physicians and
patients who comply with the new state laws.&nbsp; So far, no
specific recommendations have come from the Office of National
Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).&nbsp; Both McCaffrey and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have issued statements affirming that
federal law prohibiting cultivation and possession of marijuana
remain in full force despite the states' actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that, &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The voters of California and Arizona have given a mandate
to Washington to address the issue of access to medical
marijuana,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately, by limiting the invitees to
mainly law enforcement personnel, it appears that this hearing
will be far from balanced.&nbsp; Hopefully, subsequent hearings
will feature broader points of view and will allow both doctors
and patients to testify.&quot; <br>

Restates Opposition To Medical Marijuana Initiatives</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 15, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey re-emphasized the administration's
opposition to voter-approved drug reform initiatives in
California and Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as a
medicine.&nbsp; The announcement came following several closed-door
meetings with law enforcement and state officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There could not be a worse message to young people than the
provisions of these referenda,&quot; stated McCaffrey in a
November 15 press release.&nbsp; &quot;Just when the nation is
trying its hardest to educate teenagers not to use psychoactive
drugs, now they are being told that 'marijuana [is] medicine.'&nbsp;
The conflicting message is extremely harmful.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that, &quot;Patients or defined

prescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patients
suffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiple

is in direct conflict with federal law.&nbsp; Arizonans voted in
favor of the initiative by a vote of 65 to 35. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By our judgment, increased drug abuse in every category
will be the inevitable result of the referenda,&quot; said
McCaffrey. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the weeks following the initiatives passage, proponents have
speculated as to whether the federal government will target
physicians and patients complying with the new state laws.&nbsp;
On this matter, McCaffrey stated that federal law remains in
&quot;full force&quot; despite the states' actions and that the
Justice Department &quot;will take action&quot; when the evidence
merits. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is unfortunate that General McCaffrey chose only to meet
with those who oppose the notion of marijuana as medicine when
meeting to strategize the federal response to the passage of the California
and Arizona initiatives,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre, who noted that at least two physicians who
learned of the meetings were barred from attending.&nbsp;
&quot;These initiatives address health issues; to exclude input
from physicians who are explicitly and specifically mentioned is
unacceptable.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Drug Czar's Office Refuses NORML
Meeting</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has denied <b>NORML</b>'s
request for a meeting with Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
had offered to meet with McCaffrey following comments made by the
General on National Public Radio that he &quot;welcomed&quot; <b>NORML</b>'s
involvement in the national debate over drug policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to a letter signed by Janet Crist, Chief of Staff,
&quot;The Director feels strongly that, in light of <b>NORML</b>'s
vigorous support for pro-marijuana ballot initiatives in
California and Arizona along with its longstanding advocacy for
the legalization of marijuana, the meeting you proposed would
serve no useful purpose.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">She added that, &quot;Your organization's agenda to legalize the
use of ... marijuana ... is unsupportable (sic) on health,
safety, as well as humanitarian grounds.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a shame that the Drug Czar was not sincere in his
offer to meet with <b>NORML</b> to discuss certain aspects of
American drug policy,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Executive Director
R. Keith Stroup.&nbsp; &quot;He has said on numerous occasions
that we cannot arrest our way out of the drug problem; <b>NORML</b> has
said for 26 years that an adult marijuana user should not face
criminal penalties.&nbsp; I think that there are a number of
points that we could agree on.&nbsp; Certainly, healthy discourse
on this pertinent topic can only move the issue forward.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, McCaffrey reiterated his invitation to meet with <b>NORML</b>
representatives while speaking at American University in
Washington D.C. on November 13.&nbsp; This action prompted <b>NORML</b>'s
Executive Director to again request a meeting with the Drug Czar
to discuss policy options. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Overturns Ohio Traffic Stop
Decision</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Supreme Court ruled that police do not have to inform drivers
during a routine traffic stop that they are legally free to go
before asking for consent to search their vehicle.&nbsp; The
ruling overturns a 1995 Ohio Supreme Court decision mandating
that police must first inform motorists that they are
&quot;legally free to go&quot; before requesting the driver's
permission to search their car for drugs or other contraband. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist said that the court has &quot;consistently eschewed
bright-line rules&quot; in Fourth Amendment analysis, and instead
must examine the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; on a
case by case basis.&nbsp; &quot;It would be unrealistic to
require the police to always inform detainees that they are free
to go before a police consent search may be deemed
voluntary,&quot; Rehnquist concluded. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In deciding the case, the High Court rejected the argument that
many individuals will assume that they are in a police officer's
custody as long as the officer continues to interrogate
them.&nbsp; &quot;While knowledge of the right to refuse consent
is one factor to be taken into account, the government need not
establish such knowledge as the <i>sine qua non</i> of an
effective consent,&quot; Rehnquist opined. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The case is cited as <i>Ohio v. Robinette</i>, No. 95-891. <br>

<p align="center"><b>German State Plans To Sell Marijuana Over
The Counter</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 19, 1996, Schleswig-Holstein,
Germany:</b>&nbsp; The small German state of Schleswig-Holstein
recently announced plans to sell marijuana over the counter in an
attempt to separate cannabis from the &quot;hard&quot; drug
market, according to <i>Reuters News Service</i>.&nbsp; The state said
it will soon apply to the federal drugs agency for a permit to
sell marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The state Health Minister, Heide Moser, said authorities were
losing credibility by treating marijuana as if it were as a
dangerous as other &quot;harder&quot; drugs such as cocaine and
heroin.&nbsp; &quot;General warnings about the dangers of drugs
are no longer being taken seriously,&quot; she said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The idea drew criticism from the German federal government whose
spokesman said that, &quot;Schleswig-Holstein's stance has little
to do with reality.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The state, which is governed by a coalition of Social Democrats
and environmentalist Greens, said it had not yet decided
precisely where and how much cannabis would be available if its project
wins approval. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is technically illegal in Germany, but the Supreme
Court ruled in 1994 that possession of small amounts of cannabis
for personal use should no longer be punished.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Holds Meeting With California Law
Enforcement To Discuss</b> <b>New State Medical Marijuana Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 14, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to meet today with
California law enforcement officials from the &quot;No on
215&quot; campaign, including Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates,
to discuss the federal response to the passage of Proposition
215. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Office of National Drag Control Policy (ONDCP) had vigorously
campaigned against the initiative and reaffirmed the
Administration's opposition to the passage of the measure in a November
9 press release. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The passage of [Proposition 215] creates a significant
threat to the drug control system that protects our
children,&quot; the release said.&nbsp; &quot;...As the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Department of Justice have
stated, Federal law is unchanged by the passage of th[is]
initiative.&nbsp; Doctors in ... California ... who prescribe a
Schedule I drug as medicine, notwithstanding state law, will
violate federal law.&nbsp; The provision in the California
measure that allows patients and caregivers to grow and possess
marijuana also violates federal law.&nbsp; The decision to bring
appropriate criminal or administrative enforcement action will
be, as always, decided on a case by case basis.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dr. Tod H. Mikuriya, who has long been involved with medical
marijuana research, recently learned of the meeting, but was
denied attendance by Assistant General Counsel Warren Hall.&nbsp;
It was explained to Mikuriya that the list of participants was
limited to those opposed to Proposition 215.&nbsp; A follow up
letter requesting Mikuriya's attendance was faxed by Rep. Ronald
Dellums (D-Calif.) who asked that the White House &quot;do
everything possible to gain admission to this meeting for Dr.
Mikuriya. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mikuriya has requested that the meeting be rescheduled to a later
date in order to allow representatives from the California
medical community to attend the meeting.&nbsp; &quot;The
limitation of the list of invitees to those in law enforcement to
strategize on the response to the passage of Proposition 215 in
California ... would appear to be possibly illegal if not grossly
improper,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;[This] proposition involves
health issues.&nbsp; To exclude input from physicians who are explicitly
and specifically mentioned is unacceptable.&nbsp; This act of
institutional denial demonstrates bad faith on the part of the
participants from California who are sworn to uphold and enforce
state law.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Supporters Plan
'Effective, Responsible' Procedures, Legislation To Implement
Proposition 215</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 6, 1996, Santa Cruz, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
meeting has been scheduled in Santa Cruz on November 16 to
discuss plans for implementing legislation to provide for the
well regulated distribution of medical marijuana to patients and
researchers.&nbsp; Although Proposition 215 makes concessions for
patients who possess and use marijuana for a legitimate medical
need, it does not address the question of distribution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We want Proposition 215 to work as effectively and
responsibly as possible in meeting the needs of patients and
researchers, with appropriate safeguards to prevent abuses,&quot;
says Lynnette Shaw, co-chair of the California Medical Marijuana
Council (CMMC), which is organizing the meeting.&nbsp; The CMMC
includes representatives of the state's medical marijuana
&quot;Cannabis Buyers' Clubs,&quot; that are currently supplying
patients through the underground market. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference will discuss ways in which CBC's can legitimize
their operations under Proposition 215, with well defined
procedures for identifying medical marijuana patients, validating physicians'
recommendations, and preventing diversions to non-medical
uses.&nbsp; Proposition 215 supporters are hoping to propose some
form of legal licensing system for CBC's via implementory legislation
in the state legislature next year.&nbsp; They also want to
establish legal cultivation facilities to supply both patients
and researchers with high-quality marijuana under legal, well
controlled conditions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 215 supporters contest claims by opponents, such as
Attorney General Dan Lungren, that the initiative was written
loosely so as to encourage abuses.&nbsp; &quot;Proposition 215
was deliberately framed in general terms so that the state and
federal governments could work out regulatory details of the
distribution system,&quot; says Dale Gieringer of California
NORML.&nbsp; &quot;We want to work with local state and federal
authorities in ironing out any ambiguities in the law so as to
prevent abuses.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Proposition 215 is not the last word on the subject, just
the first,&quot; said Shaw. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Arizona Governor May Veto Voter Approved
Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 6, 1996: Phoenix, AZ:</b> Arizona
Gov. Fife Symington may attempt to veto a recently passed state
initiative allowing physicians to prescribe marijuana as a
medicine and mandating that non-violent drug offenders receive
treatment rather than incarceration.&nbsp; The initiative passed
on November 5 by a vote of 65 percent to 35 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An aide to Symington said last week that the governor believes he
has the authority to veto successful ballot initiatives which
pass with a simple majority of voters, but without a majority of
all <i>registered</i> voters.&nbsp; The governor has up to 30
days to decide a course of action.&nbsp; Symington campaigned
against the measure prior to the election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">John MacDonald, Government Affairs Director of the Arizona
Attorney General's Office, said a veto by the governor would
violate the state's constitution, though he added that the
subject of referendum vetoes hasn't been fully studied by the
attorney general or members of his staff. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Our opinion is that the governor has no constitutional
authority to veto what the people have voted in favor of,&quot;
he said.&nbsp; &quot;We expect he will follow the law.&nbsp; If
he does not, we expect that one way or the other he will wind up
in court.&quot; <br>

defendants from the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club plead
&quot;morally not guilty&quot; at their arraignment in Alameda

charged with possession of marijuana for sale, the sale or
transportation of marijuana, and conspiracy, stemming from an
August 4 raid by state law enforcement on the nearly 12,000

<p align="center"><font size="3">November 6, 1996</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>California, Arizona Voters
Approve Initiatives In Favor Of Medical Marijuana</b> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Voters in both California and
Arizona have approved initiatives endorsing marijuana's therapeutic
value and allowing patients to use marijuana for medical purposes
where its use has been deemed appropriate by a physician.&nbsp;
The result came despite heavy campaigning by opponents and
decades of anti-marijuana hysteria. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The passage of Proposition 215 in California and Proposition 200
in Arizona demonstrates that Americans can clearly distinguish
between the use of marijuana as a medicine for serious ill
patients and legalization for recreational use.&nbsp; It further
shows that the country has reached a consensus on the former, even
as it remains divided on the latter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is a victory for medical marijuana as well as for
patients and doctors,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It shows that Americans do not want
the federal government to interfere with the relationship between
a seriously ill patient and the recommendation of his or her physician.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both state and nationwide polls taken prior to this election's
vote have shown that a majority of Americans favor medical
marijuana reform.&nbsp; The recent events in California and
Arizona may finally push those on Capitol Hill to take a close and
objective look at this issue.&nbsp; It may also encourage some of
the 23 states that currently have laws regarding medical
marijuana to modify their measures so that they can begin
directly benefiting patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;These votes demonstrate that the public are ahead of the
politicians when it comes to reforming our drug policies,
specifically medical access to marijuana,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Executive Director R. Keith Stroup.&nbsp; &quot;Americans do not
believe that denying medicine to the sick and dying should ever be
a part of the drug war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions
of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It further provides that, &quot;Physicians
shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for recommending marijuana
to a patient for medical purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The Act does not supersede
state legislation prohibiting persons from possessing or
cultivating marijuana for non-medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Despite heavy opposition from federal politicians and law
enforcement, the California medical marijuana initiative passed
because individuals know by either their own personal experience
or by the experiences of those around them that marijuana has
medical utility,&quot; said St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The government
has lost all credibility on this issue by claiming
otherwise.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;With the passage of Proposition 215 in California, new
legal protections will be put into place for patients who use
marijuana under a doctor's order,&quot; said Dave Fratello of
Californians for Medical Rights (CMR), one of the primary proponents
of the measure.&nbsp; The group also announced that they will
offer a toll-free number, 1 (888) YES-4-215, to explain how 215
works, and for whom it is and is not designed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; is broader than
California's measure and would essentially &quot;medicalize&quot;
Arizona's drug policy.&nbsp; The Act calls for mandatory, court supervised
treatment and probation as an alternative to incarceration for non-violent
drug users and provides expanded drug treatment programs.&nbsp;
It will also allow doctors to prescribe controlled drugs such as
marijuana to patients suffering from serious illnesses such as
glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS.&nbsp; Arizonans
voted in favor of the initiative by a vote more than two to one. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;These votes give a flashing green light to the American
public that they have the power to change the course on American
drug policy,&quot; said St. Pierre.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">October 30, 1996</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="1"><b>In light of next week's vote
regarding a California ballot initiative to allow physicians to
prescribe marijuana to seriously ill patients, NORML is forgoing
its usual weekly news release to spotlight the following *special*
report.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Making The Case For Medical
Marijuana</b></font><font size="4"><br>
</font><font size="3"><b><i>by NORML Publications Director Paul
Armentano</i></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Marijuana is medicine.&nbsp; It
has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of ailments.&nbsp;
Marijuana was legal in the United States and prominent in the
pharmacopoeia until 1937, when possession and use of marijuana
was outlawed by the federal government.&nbsp; Today, eight patients receive
marijuana legally from the government; for all other Americans
who could benefit from its therapeutic value, it remains a
forbidden medicine.&nbsp; The passage of Proposition 215 in California,
the Medical Marijuana Initiative, would be a first step in
amending this grievous and unnecessary crisis. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Contrary to popular belief, there have been
hundreds of studies on the medical uses of cannabis since its
introduction to western medicine in the mid-nineteenth
century.&nbsp; The best established medical use of smoked
marijuana is as an anti-nauseant for cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp;
During the 1980s, smoked marijuana was shown to be an effective
anti-emetic in six different state-sponsored clinical studies
involving nearly 1,000 patients.&nbsp; For the majority of these
patients, smoked marijuana proved more effective than both conventional
prescription anti-nauseants and oral THC (marketed today as the synthetic
pill, Marinol).&nbsp; For example, in a 1988 study by Dr. Vincent Vinciguerra
published in the <b><i>New York State Journal of Medicine</i></b>,
78 percent of patients who had shown no improvement with standard
anti-emetics responded favorably to marijuana.&nbsp; In addition,
29 percent of those patients who did not respond to oral THC did
respond to smoked marijuana.&nbsp; Vinciguerra concluded that the
results of the pilot study &quot;demonstrate that inhalation marijuana
is an effective therapy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting
due to cancer chemotherapy.&quot;[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#1"><font size="3"><b>1</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Similar findings were noted in state-sponsored
studies in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, and California.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#2"><font size="3"><b>2</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Currently, many oncologists are recommending marijuana
to their patients despite its prohibition.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#3"><font size="3"><b>3</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In addition to its usefulness as an
anti-emetic, there exists evidence -- both scientific and anecdotal
-- that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering
for patients with a variety of other serious ailments, and that
it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which
it may be substituted.&nbsp; For example, marijuana alleviates
the nausea, vomiting, and the loss of appetite caused by the AIDS
wasting syndrome and by treatment with AZT and other drugs without
accelerating the rate at which HIV positive individuals develop
clinical AIDS or other illnesses.&nbsp; Reportedly, 75 percent of the
12,000 members of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club were
Patients With AIDS (PWAs) and a recent survey of HIV-positive
patients in Australia found that one-quarter were using marijuana
therapeutically.[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#4"><font size="3"><b>4</b></font></a><font
size="3">,</font><a href="96-10-30.html#5"><font size="3"><b>5</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">It is generally accepted -- by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) and others -- that marijuana reduces
intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients suffering from glaucoma,
the leading cause of blindness in the United States.&nbsp; This
was first shown in a series of experiments by Robert S. Hepler of
UCLA, stemming from research aimed at finding out whether
marijuana dilated pupils.&nbsp; Hepler found a
&quot;statistically significant&quot; drop in IOP in 429 subjects
treated with marijuana or THC, 29 of which showed continued
benefits during 94 days of treatment with no signs of tolerance.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#6"><font size="3"><b>6</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Currently, three of the eight patients who
receive medicinal marijuana legally use it to treat glaucoma. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">There also exists historical evidence that
marijuana is effective in treating a variety of spastic conditions
such as multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, epilepsy, and
quadriplegia.&nbsp; In the book, <u>Marijuana: The Forbidden
Medicine</u>, Dr. Lester Grinspoon of Harvard Medical School
describes several case histories of patients suffering from
multiple sclerosis and other disorders whose condition improved
while they smoked marijuana and deteriorated after they stopped smoking.&nbsp;
In addition, a number of animal studies have supported
marijuana's ability to suppress convulsions.&nbsp; These studies
specifically indicate cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive ingredient
of marijuana unavailable in Marinol, to be a potent
anti-convulsant.&nbsp; This latter fact was recently reaffirmed
by the government's premiere marijuana expert, Dr. Mahmoud
ElSohly of the Marijuana Project at the University of
Mississippi, who stated during an interview with the <b><i>Journal
of the International Hemp Association</i></b> that, &quot;CBD
[cannabidiol] is famous for [its] anti-convulsant
activity.&quot;&nbsp; ElSohly concluded that, &quot;There is no
question about the use of cannabis for certain conditions.&nbsp;
It does have a history.&nbsp; It does have utility.&quot;[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#7"><font size="3"><b>7</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Marijuana is also used to treat those who seek
relief from chronic pain.&nbsp; Historically, marijuana was used
as an analgesic from ancient times through the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; This usage declined with the introduction of
faster acting and more potent, yet sometimes addicting, opiates
such as morphine.&nbsp; However, anecdotal reports demonstrate
that some patients currently receive their most effective pain
relief from using marijuana.&nbsp; Limited scientific studies on
nearly 100 patients have shown marijuana to be a potent
analgesic.[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#8"><font size="3"><b>8</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Evidence in support of marijuana's medical
value has existed for centuries and has been validated by
numerous studies, researchers, committees, health organizations,
and even the Drug Enforcement Agency's Chief Administrative Law
Judge, Francis L. Young, who in 1988 declared marijuana to be
&quot;one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man.&quot;[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#9"><font size="3"><b>9</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Unfortunately, patients who could benefit from
marijuana's therapeutic value have been held hostage by a federal
government that continues to treat the issue as a political football.&nbsp;
American medical patients deserve better and Proposition 215 is a genuine
and encouraging step to address their needs. </font></p>

<p align="center"><b>American Nurses Association Reviews Medical
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Congress of Nursing Practice recently approved two motions
regarding the use of marijuana as a medicine.&nbsp; The Congress
agreed to: A) &quot;Support education for RNs regarding current
evidence based therapeutic uses of cannabis,&quot; and B) &quot;Support
investigation of therapeutic efficacy of cannabis in controlled
trials.&quot;&nbsp; These recommendations will be included in a
report from the Congress to the American Nurses Association (ANA)
Board of Directors at their next scheduled meeting. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Congress took up the issue of medical marijuana following a
presentation at the Centennial Conference of the American Nurses
Association by two of the eight legal marijuana patients in support
of the drug's therapeutic value.&nbsp; The Congress also reviewed
a position paper submitted by the Virginia Nurses Association
entitled &quot;Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis,&quot; but failed to
issue a position statement on that issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nevertheless, Mary Lynn Mathre, RN, of Patients Out Of Time said
that the Congress' twofold motion &quot;is a de facto statement
by the ANA that marijuana has medical value; a way of showing support
for similar resolutions passed by other U.S. health care
organizations; and should be recognized by the U.S. government as
a polite way of calling for the denial of marijuana as medicine
for the sick and dying as illogical.&quot;&nbsp; Mathre notes
that state nursing associations of Virginia, Mississippi,
Colorado, New York, and California have endorsed the use of
marijuana as a medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Patients Out of Time is a non-profit organization comprised of
five of the eight legal marijuana patients in the United States
and various health care professionals. <br>

Iowa man is facing prison for using marijuana to relieve the
symptoms of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, a painful
muscle disorder.&nbsp; On Monday, October 28, the Black Hawk
County District Court will decide whether to revoke his probation for
refusing to stop smoking marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Allen Helmers sustained a broken back in a 1983 car accident and
was injured again in 1994 after being struck by a drunken
driver.&nbsp; Six months before the second accident, police
seized three ounces of marijuana from Helmers' home.&nbsp; He was
placed on probation for 2 to 5 years under intensive supervision
and fined $1,800. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Helmers says that the pain he suffers daily makes it necessary
that he use marijuana.&nbsp; Helmers' doctor, W. H. Verdyne,
agrees.&nbsp; &quot;Chronic neurological pain responds well to
the medicinal use of marijuana ... causing much less side effects
than the standard pain medications,&quot; Verdyne said.&nbsp; He notes
that routine medications have been unsuccessful in managing
Helmers' pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The state of Iowa gave Allen a criminal conviction for
possession of marijuana, and now they want to revoke his
probation because he refuses to stop smoking it,&quot; said Carl

<p align="center"><b>Clinton Proposes Drug Testing Teenage
Applicants For Driver's Licenses</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 19, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton proposed a new federal mandate on Saturday to
require teenagers to pass a drug test before receiving a driver's
license. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stating that a driver's license is a &quot;privilege that should
not be available to those who fail to demonstrate responsible
behavior,&quot; Clinton directed the Office of National Drug
Control Policy to come up with a strategy to implement nationwide
drug testing for all teen applicants.&nbsp; Clinton said that he
hoped the &quot;90 percent [of adolescents] who are
drug-free&quot; would participate in the program willingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We're already saying to teens if you drink you aren't
allowed to drive.&nbsp; Now we should say that teens should pass
a drug test as a condition of getting a driver's license.&nbsp;
Our message should be simple: No drugs or no driver's
license.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Clinton's announcement drew harsh criticism from civil
libertarians. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Once again we see civil liberties being pulverized by the
political posturing of the president,&quot; charged Libertarian
Presidential candidate Harry Browne.&nbsp; &quot;Once again, we
see millions of Americans having to prove their innocence to
government bureaucrats.&nbsp; ... Once again, we see the 'War on
Drugs' being used as an excuse to give the federal government
more power.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Arthur Spitzer, the legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union's (ACLU) District of Columbia branch, said the
move was an example of &quot;this drug mania gone
crazy.&quot;&nbsp; He said the organization would consider
mounting a legal challenge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is not yet known whether Clinton's proposal, if implemented,
would be in violation of Constitutional guarantees against
unreasonable search and seizure.&nbsp; Most recently, the Supreme Court
ruled that high school athletes could be randomly drug tested
regardless of individualized suspicion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mandatory drug testing is an affront to human dignity, and
it's making a mockery of the United States Constitution,&quot;
said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Clinton's latest proposal is ill conceived and unjustly
labels an entire generation as suspected drug users.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Allen St. Pierre
or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> at (202)

<p align="center"><b>California Man Fired From Job After Charged
With Growing Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Santa Rosa, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
epileptic charged with marijuana cultivation this past August was
suddenly dismissed from his two caregiver jobs.&nbsp; Alan
Martinez of Santa Rosa maintains that he grows and uses marijuana
as a medicine and plans to raise a medical necessity defense in
court.&nbsp; He notes that individuals like himself, if they
possess a physicians recommendation, would have an exemption
under the law if Proposition 215 passes this November. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez worked for eight years as a well respected caregiver
until his arrest this summer.&nbsp; He believes that the media
attention that surrounded his plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; and
request for a trial to prove his medical necessity has caused his
employers to fire him without notice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I don't know what I'll do for money, but I know I will be
acquitted and my name will be cleared,&quot; said Martinez.&nbsp;
&quot;I did not expect all the uproar, but I will not back
down.&nbsp; This is a matter of my life and my health.&nbsp; I
hope no other patients have to go through this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A rally in support of Alan Martinez and his caregiver, Jason
Miller, is scheduled for 12 noon in front of the Santa Rosa Court
House on Tuesday, October 29. <br>

<p align="center">October 17, 1996</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEA Herbicide Under Fire From
Hawaii Residents</b></font><b><br>
Locals Complain Of Nausea, Other Ailments Due To Spraying</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 17, 1996, Hawaii Island, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp;
Residents of Hawaii's Big Island are complaining of nausea,
headaches, and fatigue and some are pointing fingers at the
federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For nearly a decade, Drug Enforcement Agency-coordinated
marijuana eradication efforts have targeted Hawaii Island, often
spraying a glyphosate-based herbicide from low-flying helicopters over
suspected marijuana patches.&nbsp; Recently, however, some
residents are claiming that the pesticide, a chemical weed-killer
similar to &quot;Round Up,&quot; is killing wildlife and making
some citizens sick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;You can actually taste it in your mouth,&quot; said Roger
Christie of the Hawaii Hemp Council, who alleges that diesel fuel
is occasionally mixed with the pesticide.&nbsp; Christie claims
that gusts of wind disperse the pesticide to outlying
communities, where it collects in rainwater catchments.&nbsp;
Rooftop catchments are a common source of residents' drinking
water. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In the last two weeks, hundreds of people have come to me
with their complaints and said that's why I'm feeling this way
too,&quot; said Ka'u resident Susan Smith in an interview with KGMB-TV
earlier this month.&nbsp; &quot;[Law enforcement] are flying over
my house every other day.&nbsp; ... It's like a war zone out
here.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our
bio-diversity,&quot; said Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw
Institute Inc., an Oklahoma organization that works to strengthen
environmental laws.&nbsp; Berry cited a 1995 <i>Journal of
Pesticide Reform</i> report that said glyphosate exposure was the third
most commonly reported pesticide illness among agricultural
workers in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DEA spokesman Sidney Hayakawa acknowledged the residents' concern
and noted that the spraying procedure is currently under
evaluation.&nbsp; He told KGMB-TV that the agency will issue an updated
Environmental Impact Statement next year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lenny Terlip of the state Department of Land and Natural
Resources (DLNR) told <b>NORML</b> that claims of glyphosate
harming the environment and endangering the health of residents
were &quot;erroneous.&quot;&nbsp; He denied reports that the
herbicide was mixed with any additives and said that the sprayings
were not being conducted near houses or residential areas.&nbsp;
The helicopter-mounted spray-guns have &quot;pin-point
accuracy,&quot; he added. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For now, however, the battle rages on and many residents remain
unconvinced.&nbsp; This is an example of &quot;law enforcement
run amuck,&quot; claimed environmental activist and resident
Jerry Rothstein, who recently attended a town meeting where
numerous residents complained of health complications such as eye
irritation, itchy throats, and bronchial problems due to
spraying.&nbsp; Photographs on display at the meeting documented
orange-sprayed foliage in forests and yards as well as dead bird
carcasses.&nbsp; &quot;From the response of the Ka'u community,
th[ese] latest aerial herbicide attack[s] appear to be among the
worst yet,&quot; noted Rothstein. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Why do we have to wait [until] five years from now [for an
answer?]&quot; asked Smith.&nbsp; &quot;Why do we have to wait
... till they tell us, okay, it's toxic and now it's
outlawed?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, only one other state, South Dakota, engages in aerial
herbicide spraying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Roger Christie of

<p align="center"><b>Drug Tax Ruled Unconstitutional By Texas
Appeals Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1996, Austin, TX:</b>&nbsp; A
state law meant to penalize drug dealers by making them pay taxes
on confiscated drugs violates constitutional guarantees against
double jeopardy, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled
Wednesday.&nbsp; The decision is similar to a 1995 Arizona ruling
that prohibited an individual who possessed marijuana from
criminal prosecution &quot;because the tax imposed prior to the
prosecution served a punitive purpose.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lawyers involved in the case said the 5-4 decision means the
state can either impose a drug tax or prosecute an individual for
illegal activity; it can't do both.&nbsp; &quot;This [ruling]
means the state only gets one chance to punish you,&quot; said
Tom Moran, a Houston attorney representing the defendant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision could lead to the review of nearly 1,000 of drug
cases in which both criminal penalties and taxes were
assessed.&nbsp; In cases which all or some of the state drug tax
has been paid, this ruling could be &quot;a pretty good
get-out-of-jail-free card,&quot; said Dan McCrory, an assistant district
attorney for Harris County.&nbsp; A spokesman for the state
comptroller's office told the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> that
counties had referred over 9,000 cases to their offices for
collection of the drug tax. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the recent decision, the court found that Texas' $98 tax on an
ounce of marijuana and $200 per gram of controlled substance was
so high as to conclude, &quot;it ... is a penalty for criminal conduct.&quot;&nbsp;
Therefore, the court ruled that because the defendant had already
been punished by &quot;imposition and partial collection of a
tax,&quot; further prosecution would violate his Fifth Amendment protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The case had initially been denied by Texas courts, but the U.S.
Supreme Court ordered the state courts to reconsider based upon a
1994 Supreme Court ruling on double jeopardy.&nbsp; In that case, <i>Department
of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that to
collect a tax on the possession of drugs from defendants who had
already been charged, convicted, and sentenced on criminal
charges involving the same drugs was the functional equivalent of
a successive criminal prosecution. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Enforcement Administration Attacks
California Medical Marijuana Measure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Drug Enforcement Administration has come out against a
California ballot initiative (Proposition 215) to prevent the
state prosecution of patients who use marijuana for a documented
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a press release issued by Thomas Constantine, chief
administrator, the agency states that it is &quot;firmly
opposed&quot; to the proposal.&nbsp; The agency cites rising
adolescent drug use and an alleged lack of evidence regarding
marijuana's therapeutic value as reasons for holding its
position. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;How can we tell American children to refuse to use illegal
drugs when medical practitioners are prescribing marijuana as
casually as they prescribe penicillin or cough syrup?&quot; he
asked.&nbsp; &quot;The children of America deserve to live a
drug-free life, safe from the effects of drugs, and safe from the
crime and degradation that drug-taking breeds.&nbsp; Proposition
215 sends the unequivocal message that we have surrendered to the
legalizers and have relinquished our principles.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This initiative is not about sending messages to kids, it's
about reality,&quot; said Dave Fratello of Californians for
Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;The reality is that marijuana is
helpful as a medicine.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Marijuana has a 5,000 year medical history and was declared
to be 'one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man' in 1988 by the DEA's own Chief Administrative Law
Judge,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana's medical utility has been endorsed
by such well respected organizations as the American Public
Health Association, National Academy of Sciences, and Federation
of American Scientists.&nbsp; For the DEA to claim otherwise is
fallacious.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 215 is currently endorsed by the San Francisco
Academy of Family Physicians, San Francisco Medical Society,
California Nurses Association, and others.&nbsp; It continues to
have strong voter support and leads by 33 percent, according to
an October 15 Field Poll. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Marijuana Arrests For 1995
Most Ever</b></font><b><br>
FBI Data Confirm Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Toughest Yet</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An estimated* <b>588,963 total marijuana arrests</b>
were made by state and local law enforcement during 1995,
according to the latest edition of the FBI <i>Uniform Crime
Report</i>.&nbsp; This figure is an 18 percent increase above the
1994 level and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests under
the Clinton administration to a staggering 1,450,751.&nbsp; The
1995 yearly arrest total for marijuana violations is the highest
ever recorded by the FBI. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of the 588,963 arrests made for marijuana in 1995, approximately <b>86
percent (503,350) were for simple &quot;possession.&quot;</b>&nbsp;
The remaining 14 percent (85,614 arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot;
a category that includes <b>all</b> cultivation offenses -- even
those where the marijuana was being grown for personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data confirms what <b>NORML</b> has been maintaining
all along,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Despite criticism on Capitol Hill
that this present administration is soft on drugs, the raw data
clearly demonstrates that the federal government's war on
marijuana smokers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime.&nbsp; <b>These new FBI statistics indicate that
one marijuana user is arrested every 54 seconds in America</b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's three
year average of total marijuana arrests (483,548 arrests per
year) is 30 percent higher than the average number of yearly
arrests under the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp;
&quot;These latest figures expose those who claim that America
has abandoned the drug war under Clinton as the political
charlatans they are,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Publication's
Director Paul Armentano.&nbsp; &quot;The fact that adolescent use
rates for marijuana are rising at the same time that law
enforcement is arresting record numbers of users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s
long-held belief that marijuana prohibition is not an effective
deterrent to marijuana consumption.&nbsp; Clinton hasn't
abandoned the drug war; the drug war simply isn't working.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Additional statistics gathered from the <i>Uniform Crime Report</i>
reveal <b>that law enforcement made 1.5 million arrests for drug
abuse violations in 1995,</b> the most ever.&nbsp; This figure is
a 7 percent increase above the 1994 level, 41 percent higher than
in 1991, and 65 percent higher than in 1986.&nbsp; The FBI report
further discloses that the number of individuals arrested for
marijuana possession in 1995 virtually equaled the <b><u>combined</u></b>
total number of individuals arrested for possessing heroin,
cocaine, and/or their derivatives. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on marijuana arrests, please contact
Allen St. Pierre or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>
@ (202) 483-5500.</i></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">*No arrest data for Kansas,
Montana, and most of Illinois law enforcement agencies were available
to the FBI for 1995.&nbsp; Therefore, arrest totals for these
states were estimated by the FBI for inclusion in the overall
total.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b>Multiple Sclerosis Patient To Travel To
Washington For Medical Marijuana<br>
Husband To Push Wheelchair For 250-Mile Walk</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 10, 1996, Jersey City, NJ:</b>&nbsp;
On October 14, Jim and Cheryl Miller will embark on a 235-mile
walk to Washington D.C. to raise awareness for medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1971, Ms. Miller has been
unable to walk for over a dozen years.&nbsp; Her physician has
prescribed her numerous medications, including the synthetic THC capsule
Marinol, yet she claims that natural marijuana offers her the
greatest relief for her illness.&nbsp; Her doctor states that he
would prescribe her marijuana in the plant form if it was legal
to do so. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that by bringing attention to my wife Cheryl, I can
cause marijuana to be made available so that she and others are
no longer needlessly forced to suffer with their pain or risk
arrest,&quot; said Mr. Miller.&nbsp; &quot;Right now, the only
relief Cheryl can get from her painful muscle spasms subjects her to
the risk of being put in jall and having her bank account and
property seized.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Millers intend to arrive in Washington, D.C. on October 21,
where they plan on meeting with representatives from the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, Drug Enforcement Administration,
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp; They
also hope to persuade their representatives in Congress to come
out in favor of legal access to medical marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Challenges Harassment Of
Students With Hemp Jewelry</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 8, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML has sent a letter to the Willoughby/Eastlake School
District demanding that the school system stop harassing students
for wearing jewelry made from hemp fiber.&nbsp; Schools in the
district have been sending students to the principle's office and
calling parents to &quot;discourage&quot; students from wearing
hemp jewelry, in accordance with a new policy enacted by school
officials in September. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Spokespeople for the school system claim that the policy is
designed to promote a drug-free environment and stifle
&quot;sympathetic&quot; leanings toward marijuana, but Northcoast
NORML contends that the administrators' intentions do not give
them license to violate the First Amendment.&nbsp; &quot;Legal precedents
make it clear that students have the right to engage in symbolic
speech,&quot; said Northcoast NORML President John Hartman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter, written by Attomey William Saks, states that the
courts have consistently ruled that &quot;students' viewpoints
cannot be constitutionally suppressed even if they can be
interpreted as being pro-drug.&nbsp; Assuming ... that the
students wearing hemp are expressing sympathy for marijuana use,
... the fact that marijuana use is illegal does not invalidate
the First Amendment protection for the students'
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter demands a written promise that the school system will
cease all action inhibiting the wearing of hemp in school. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Hemp is a natural, [legal] fiber that is attractive and
hip,&quot; said Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;A student has a right to
wear it whether they are promoting the medicinal value of
marijuana, protesting the laws against it, or just for fun.&quot; <br>

Northcoast NORML @ (216) 521-9333.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Dole Aide Reportedly Used Pot In College</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1996, Hartford, CT:</b>&nbsp; John
Buckley, communications director for Republican Presidential
Candidate Bob Dole, may have regularly used marijuana while in
college, according to allegations made by former classmates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a story that first ran in a Boston weekly last month, former
classmates of Buckley said that they recall him using and
occasionally selling marijuana while he attended Hampshire
College in Amherst, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Most describe Buckley's
alleged relationship with marijuana to have been typical for the
environment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Yes, he smoked pot.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; A lot of people
smoked pot,&quot; said former college roommate Ed Benfey during
an interview with <i>Reuters News Service</i>.&nbsp; &quot;It was
socially acceptable in that place and time to smoke pot.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Benfey said that he didn't specifically remember Buckley ever
selling pot, but a second classmate speaking to the Boston
Phoenix anonymously maintained he both smoked and bought marijuana
from Buckley. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the allegations in a prepared statement, Buckley
maintained that, &quot;Whether I or any member of the Dole or
Clinton staff used marijuana 20 years ago when in college is not
a relevant issue and I'm not going to respond to further
questions on the subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole has recently attacked Clinton as being soft on the drug
issue and specifically criticized the President for hiring people
to the White House who had used drugs in the past.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Aims For 1998
Election</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1996, Portland, OR:</b>&nbsp; A
proposed Oregon initiative measure to allow adults to purchase
cannabis in state liquor stores has been certified by the state
Supreme Court and activists are already gearing up to place the
measure on the November 1998 state ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although this year's proposal failed to collect the 73,261
registered voters' signatures necessary to place the initiative
on the 1996 ballot, organizers are convinced that a future, more
organized, and better funded campaign will be successful.&nbsp;
&quot;The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA) made it two-thirds of
the way to the ballot with less than $10,000,&quot; stated a
press release from initiative organizers.&nbsp; &quot;That is
amazing in this age of dollar driven politics.&nbsp; We [expect]
to raise $100,000 to qualify OCTA for the 1998 Oregon ballot
[and] we will begin on a volunteer effort now.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If passed, OCTA will replace all state and local marijuana laws
except for DUI laws and will permit adults to purchase marijuana
from state liquor stores.&nbsp; The measure would also allow doctors
to prescribe marijuana to patients through pharmacies, allow
farmers to grow marijuana with a license for sales to the state,
allow adults to grow marijuana for personal use without a license,
and allow for industrial hemp cultivation.&nbsp; Ninety percent
of the net proceeds will go to a state general fund, and the
remaining 10 percent will be used to fund drug abuse education
and treatment programs.&nbsp; Sale and possession to minors will
still remain strictly prohibited. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on OCTA, please contact the Campaign for
the Restoration &amp; Regulation of Hemp @ (503) 235-4606 or

<p align="center"><b>Political Cartoonist Supports Proposition
215, Angers State Attorney General</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 3, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California State Attorney General Dan Lungren thinks that the
nationally syndicated comic-strip <i>Doonesbury</i> is going to
pot, and he isn't amused. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lungren is upset over this week's series of Doonesbury cartoons
focusing on the police raid on the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers
Club and promoting Proposition 215, a state ballot initiative to prevent
the state prosecution of patients who use marijuana for a
documented medical need.&nbsp; Lungren was responsible for
ordering the August 4 raid on the club and is one of the chief opponents
of Proposition 215.&nbsp; He has asked Universal Press Syndicate,
which distributes the cartoon, to either pull this week's strips
or include a disclaimer saying the cartoon is inaccurate.&nbsp; UPS
is doing neither. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This week's <i>Doonesbury</i> strips clearly advance the
wink-and-nod attitude toward drug use that is most responsible
for the addition of thousands of American kids to the drugged and
at risk roster,&quot; argued Lungren in a letter to the <i>San
Francisco Chronicle</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cannabis Buyers' Club Founder Dennis Peron countered that Lungren
was advocating censorship.&nbsp; &quot;Instead of attacking
characters in a cartoon, why doesn't he meet me in a
debate?&quot; he asked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This week's <i>Doonesbury</i> strips are bringing national
exposure to a situation in dire need of widespread attention and
reform,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;National polls indicate that Americans
delineate between marijuana use for recreational purposes and medical
needs and strongly support the latter.&nbsp; If Doonesbury can
help further the debate, then it's a positive step.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Doonesbury</i> creator Garry Trudeau has refused to comment
specifically on Lungren's attacks, but did weigh in on the issue
of marijuana prohibition in the September 16 issue of <i>Time
Magazine</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Before we can get any traction on controlling pot, ... the
generation that popularized the stuff has got to finally come
clean about what made it so alluring in the first place -- and
then square that with current marijuana policy,&quot; Trudeau
wrote.&nbsp; &quot;A good start might be for every middle-aged public
official in America to take the following oath. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... I concede that I once did not view marijuana as
dangerous.&nbsp; ... It was only after my appetite for
recreational drugs had abated, and I produced children whom I did
not believe capable of 'handling' marijuana as responsibly as I
had, that I came to oppose decriminalization.&nbsp; I acknowledge
that it was this fear, and not new medical evidence, that caused
me to subsequently support mandatory sentencing for other
people's children caught emulating the actions of my generation.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court To Rule On Drug Testing Of
Political Candidates</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Supreme Court will review the constitutionality of a Georgia
law mandating candidates to pass a drug test before qualifying to
run for elected state office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The law is being challenged by attorney and former Libertarian
candidate for Lieutenant Governor Walker Chandler.&nbsp; Chandler
is appealing a 2-1 decision issued this past January by the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the law.&nbsp; Chandler said
that the 11 page dissent in that case made his challenge
appealing to the High Court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I do not believe that the suspicionless search in these
circumstances serves any special governmental need beyond the
normal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe that
the candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmental
interests,&quot; opined dissenting Circuit Judge Rosemary
Barkett, raising questions about the U.S. Constitution's Fourth
Amendment guarantee to be free from unreasonable search and
seizure.&nbsp; &quot;We are not merely dealing with the denial of
a job opportunity, but with the denial of the opportunity to
participate in our democratic form of government.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barkett's dissent also called into question apparent First
Amendment violations posed by the controversial law.&nbsp;
&quot;The majority maintains that the government's purpose [in
passing this legislation] is not suppression of free
expression.&nbsp; Yet, it supports it by citing the importance of ensuring
that elected officials are 'persons appreciative of the perils of
drug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction efforts.'&nbsp;
Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holding
public office appears to be a content-based restriction on free
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In taking the case, the Supreme Court will also determine how far
the government may go in requiring people to submit to drug tests
where there is no particular suspicion of individual wrongdoing,
reports the Washington Post. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s Amicus Curiae Committee will file an amicus brief
in the case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Georgia law does not apply to congressional candidates, whose
qualifications are prescribed by the U.S. Constitution and
Congress itself. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Ohio High School Cracks Down On Hemp</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 3, 1996, Eastlake, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Students at North High School in Eastlake Ohio who wear jewelry
made out of hemp fiber will be sent to the principle's office and
have their parents notified, according to a new policy enacted by
school officials this past Tuesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Critics of the policy argue that the new rule inhibits freedom of
expression and amounts to nothing more than harassment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's extremism on the [anti-drug] issue,&quot; said
Northcoast NORML chapter president John Hartman, who announced
that he would provide hemp clothing and twine to interested
students.&nbsp; &quot;Is the intention to pick out students and
harass them or attempt to enforce their drug-free school policy?&nbsp;
Either way, [it's] persecuting them for wearing [legal] hemp
jewelry.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to principle George Spinner, a proponent of the policy,
hemp jewelry symbolizes &quot;sympathy&quot; toward marijuana, a
view that he believes to be unacceptable in a school
environment.&nbsp; &quot;The truth is, they are wearing it
because of the relationship of hemp and marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Spinner noted that the jewelry will not be confiscated, but
admits that officials are asking students not to wear it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By their own admission, school officials are trying to
suppress a political statement about our government's policies
toward marijuana and industrial hemp,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This harassment
clearly infringes upon a student's constitutional guarantee of freedom
of expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Several students have approached Northcoast NORML to complain
about the new policy and some have begun to hand out fliers
challenging the rule.&nbsp; Over 1,500 students attend the
school. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Government Marijuana Researcher Speaks
Favorably About Marijuana's Medical Utility</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 21, 1996:</b>&nbsp; In a recent
interview conducted by the Journal of the International Hemp
Association (JIHA) in Amsterdam, Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly -- Director
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA's) Marijuana
Project at the University of Mississippi and one of the federal
government's premiere marijuana experts -- spoke openly about
marijuana's medical potential. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, ElSohly discussed the possible medical role of
cannabichromene (CBC), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in
marijuana.&nbsp; He also spoke about the limited effectiveness of
oral THC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to ElSohly, CBC occurs in high portions of certain
strains of marijuana, but has been typically overlooked because
it is difficult to distinguish from the more familiar property, cannabidiol
(CBD), in standard chemical tests.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the
pharmaceutical properties of CBC and CBD are quite distinct. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;CBD is famous for [its] anti-convulsant activity ... [and]
CBC obviously has good anti-inflammatory activity,&quot; remarked
ElSohly.&nbsp; &quot;Certainly there is the [anecdotal use of
medical marijuana historically] and every day you look at the
cannabinoids and activities in the light of today's science and
today's pharmacology and so on, and you can really go back and
scientifically and legitimately explain the use of cannabis over
the years for so many things. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot; ... There is no question about the use of cannabis for
certain conditions.&nbsp; It does have a history.&nbsp; It does
have the utility and so on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the issue of smoked inhalation of marijuana versus
orally consumed THC, ElSohly commented that THC in oral
preparation &quot;doesn't seem to be doing the good job it should.&quot;&nbsp;
He speculated that this is because oral and smoked THC produce
different pharmacological profiles in the body.&nbsp; Because
oral doses are processed by the liver before entering the
bloodstream, oral THC produces high levels of the metabolite
11-hydroxy-THC, while smoked marijuana does not.&nbsp; Since
11-hydroxy-THC is four to five times more psychoactive than regular
THC, this may explain why some users report a high rate of
overdoses and discomfort with Marinol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The comments made by Dr. ElSohly indicate that their exists
not only anecdotal, but accepted scientific evidence supporting
marijuana's medicinal properties,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It also specifies that
there exists chemical properties in marijuana other than THC that
hold medical value, further supporting the argument that
marijuana appears superior to synthetic THC as a medicine.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>House Holds Hearing On Adolescent Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, 1996, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Purporting that adolescent drug use has reached &quot;epidemic&quot;
levels, a joint hearing of the House Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Youth and Families, and the House Government Reform
and Oversight Subcommittee on National Security was held today. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Those testifying before the House included Former Administrator
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Robert Bonner,
Executive Vice President of the Parents' Resource Institute for
Drug Education (PRIDE) Douglas Hall, Ohio Congressman Rob
Portman, and others. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hall's appearance before the committees coincided with the
release of a 1996 PRIDE survey indicating rising levels of
adolescent illicit drug use.&nbsp; According to the study, nearly
38 percent of high school seniors reported trying marijuana once
within the past year.&nbsp; &quot;Drug use by today's teenagers
is not just part of growing up, a youthful indiscretion,&quot;
said Hall.&nbsp; &quot;More students are using more drugs more
frequently, and their use is more hardcore than we have ever
seen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Ladies and gentleman, drugs kill,&quot; announced Rep.
Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham, Chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families.&nbsp;
&quot;It is more important than ever to be absolutely
uncompromising about this message.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This hearing was nothing other than a pre-election dog and
pony show,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Despite claims from both parties that
spending toward anti-drug efforts have been slashed, federal
figures demonstrate that annual federal drug control spending increased
from less than five billion in 1988 to more than 15 billion for
fiscal year 1997.&nbsp; According to government statistics,
illicit drug use during this period of time has remained
virtually unchanged among adults and actually risen slightly
among adolescents.&nbsp; We cannot continue to keep throwing money
at the problem and arresting record numbers of adult users and
expect any sort of tangible results.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Medicine And Hemp Exposition To
Take Place This Weekend</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, 1996:</b>&nbsp; An exposition to
raise public awareness to the medicinal uses of marijuana will
take place on September 28 and 29 at the Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco, California.&nbsp; The show will include workshops by
both doctors and patients and will include a host of speakers,
including San Francisco Supervisors Angela Alioto and Tom Ammiano
as well as representatives of the Proposition 215 campaign for
medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Though the focus of the exposition will be on the medical uses of
cannabis, the event will also have forty booths relating to
hemp's industrial uses.&nbsp; In addition, the Human Rights 95
Exhibit, which poignantly documents the human costs of this
nation's &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; will also be featured at the
show. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Because of the controversy surrounding this issue, the show
promises to be one of the most interesting and well-attended of
the fall season,&quot; said California Coordinator Dale
Gieringer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proceeds from the event will go to benefit the medical marijuana
movement in California. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Mass/Cann NORML Rally Draws At Least 50,000</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 21, 1996, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; More
than 50,000 people gathered for a rally in support of ending
federal marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; The event, organized by
Mass/Cann NORML, featured speeches by <b>NORML</b> board member
Richard Evans, Esq., Steve Hager of High Times Magazine,
marijuana activist John Sinclair, Richard Stratton of Prison Life
Magazine, and others and included several musical acts.&nbsp;
There were almost no arrests during the all-day festival. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although organizers note that media coverage of the event was
mixed, Mass/Cann President Bill Downing called the seventh annual
event a &quot;success.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Any time you gather over 50,000 people and have no
incidents of violence and virtually no arrests is a
success,&quot; he commented.&nbsp; Responding to media criticism
about the relatively young age of some crowd-goers, Downing said,
&quot;Many of the younger attendees were Boston college students
-- many of which happen to be voters -- and we want them to be
aware that there is a group that represents their
interests.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Los Angeles Cannabis Buyers' Club Busted<br>
Third Raid Since August Sparks Outrage Among Cannabis Community</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 16, 1996, West Hollywood, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Los Angeles county sheriffs raided the Cannabis Buyers' Club in
West Hollywood and took four employees, including two cancer
patients and an AIDS patient, into custody.&nbsp; The four
individuals were later released on their own recognizance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The raid was conducted behind the backs of city officials, who
were reportedly outraged by the sheriffs' action.&nbsp; West
Hollywood is one of several California communities to have
adopted a resolution urging police to refrain from medical
marijuana arrests. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officers confiscated about one pound of marijuana, pills, some
brownies, and liquid believed to contain THC, said L.A. County
Sheriffs Sgt. Robert Stoneman.&nbsp; Witnesses to the raid said
that items relating to Proposition 215, a ballot initiative that
would allow Californians to cultivate and possess marijuana for
medical purposes, were also seized. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This marks the third bust of a cannabis buyers' club since August
and demonstrates a definite pattern among law enforcement to
target medical marijuana organizations.&nbsp; &quot;This [bust
signifies] a new low in the war on pot,&quot; said California
NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp; &quot;Our marijuana laws
are clearly bankrupt when they let law enforcement authorities
run amok arresting people for providing medicine to the
sick.&nbsp; The time has come to protect Californians' right to
medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to an article that appeared in the August 9 edition of
the Philadelphia Inquirer, the club served approximately 1,000
members and did not allow smoking to take place at the
facility.&nbsp; Members were screened by club staffers and were
only accepted if they were referred by local AIDS treatment
organizations. <br>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Alternative Therapies Group
Distributes Medical Marijuana<br>
To San Francisco's Sick</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 13, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A group that specializes in providing nontraditional remedies to
AIDS sufferers worldwide has begun distributing marijuana to
patients out of the Metropolitan Community Church in San
Francisco. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This was not an easy decision,&quot; said Curtis Ponzi of
the Healing Alternatives Foundation (HAF), the organization
responsible for the distribution.&nbsp; &quot;It was very stormy,
very emotional.&nbsp; But we're filling a void.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The foundation, founded in the early l980s, provides a variety of
herbal remedies and non-FDA approved drugs at-cost to seriously
ill patients.&nbsp; The organization makes no therapeutic claims about
its products and urges buyers to discuss therapies with a doctor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Patients purchasing marijuana from the foundation must provide a
note from their doctor stating that they have a legitimate
medical need for cannabis.&nbsp; The foundation then double
checks with the physician, a process that takes about a
week.&nbsp; The verification process is thorough enough to discourage
recreational users from attempting to purchase marijuana, stated
Ponzi. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Community reaction to the program appears positive.&nbsp;
&quot;Both Mayor [Willie] Brown and I think this is a sound
program,&quot; said Dean Goodwin, an aide to the San Francisco
mayor.&nbsp; &quot;They're concentrating on the people who really
need [the marijuana.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the San Francisco Police Department seems ready to
exercise a policy of benign neglect with regard to the renewed
distribution.&nbsp; &quot;We would only be interested in this if
it became obvious that they were selling [marijuana] to people
who weren't sick,&quot; said narcotics division Sgt. Kurt
Bruneman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Metropolitan Community Church pastor Jim Mitulski said he is
allowing his church to be used for the foundation's marijuana
sales because medical cannabis is essential to the well-being of
many congregation members.&nbsp; The current program is expected
to operate on a weekly basis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are not distributing it -- the foundation is,&quot;
Mitulski said.&nbsp; He notes that at least three additional
churches may also participate in medical marijuana distribution
in the near future. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, state law enforcement officials claim they will
watch and wait.&nbsp; &quot;We're looking at it and we're aware
of [marijuana being distributed by the HAF,]&quot; said Steve
Telliano, press secretary for state Attorney General Dan
Lungren.&nbsp; &quot;We're just keeping an eye on the situation
to see what's happening.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Washington State Supreme Court To Tackle
Medical Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, 1996, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp;
Cancer patient and medical marijuana activist Ralph Seeley will
argue before the state Supreme Court on September 25 that the
state's constitution requires marijuana to be available as a
prescription substance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1995, Seeley won a declaratory judgment from trial court Judge
Rosanne Buckner that Washington's ban on medical marijuana
violates the state's constitution's reliance on &quot;fundamental principles.&quot;&nbsp;
Under guidelines agreed upon by both Seeley and the state
Attorney General's Office before the trial, the losing party
would seek a direct review of the decision in the state Supreme Court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An amicus brief in support of medical marijuana, prepared by
Attorney Michael Cutler of Boston, Massachusetts, has been filed
by <b>NORML</b>'s Amicus Curiae Committee.&nbsp; Additional briefs
on behalf of Seeley have been filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) and The Drug Policy Foundation
(DPF).&nbsp; &quot;A positive verdict in this case would further
bolster the growing public support for access to medical
marijuana both in Washington state and nationally,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; St. Pierre noted that on
March 30, 1996, Washington State Governor Mike Lowry signed into
law a state budget allocating $130,000 to medicinal marijuana
research, including investigating ways of cultivating marijuana
to be used for medicinal purposes. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Polls Show Voters Strongly Favor
Medical Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, 1996, California:</b>&nbsp; Two
separate California polls released today indicate that voters
strongly favor Proposition 215, a statewide initiative that would
allow patients with a physician's recommendation to possess and
cultivate marijuana for medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the results of a Field Poll reported by the <i>San
Jose Mercury News</i> and <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, among
those likely to vote, 62 percent said they would vote for
Proposition 215 and 29 percent said they would vote against it;
nine percent were undecided.&nbsp; Among all registered
California voters, 61 percent favor the measure and 30 percent
are opposed.&nbsp; The survey of 291 respondents has a margin of
error of six percentage points. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a separate telephone poll conducted by the <i>Los Angeles
Times</i>, 53 percent of respondents said they would vote for the
proposal and 31 percent said they would vote against it; 16
percent were undecided. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is overwhelming support,&quot; said Steve Hopcraft of
Californians for Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;California voters
cannot accept that their doctors can prescribe morphine for
cancer, AIDS, and other [serious illnesses] but not
marijuana.&nbsp; This is great news. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;These findings, coupled with the results of similar polls
conducted both in California and nationally, demonstrate that
there is ample support for the legalization of medical marijuana
among the voting public,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The results of the two recent California polls are the latest in
a series of surveys indicating strong support for medical
marijuana.&nbsp; A 1995 survey conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of the
American public agreed that patients who find marijuana an
effective therapeutic agent should be able to use it
legally.&nbsp; In addition, nine state polls have shown that a
strong majority of Californians support medical marijuana. <br>

Czar Barry McCaffrey for speaking out against the California

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The AIDS commission's resolution urged McCaffrey, who on

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
A state Attorney General official said Grand Traverse County
Sheriff Harold Barr's decision to allow jail inmates to help put
out flyers opposing a <b>NORML</b> ballot initiative to
decriminalize marijuana possession in Traverse City may have violated
state election laws.&nbsp; The assertion comes nearly one month
after Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance, who helped to
spearhead the initiative, filed a complaint with the secretary of
state alleging that taxpayers dollars were used to influence a
political campaign.&nbsp; According to Michigan law, an
organization that knowingly violates campaign finance rules could

<p align="center"><b>Califano Attacks Attitudes Of Baby-Boomer
Parents<br>
Regarding Adolescent Mariiuana Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 9, 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
fact that a growing number of today's teens are experimenting
with marijuana is not seen as a &quot;crisis&quot; by many
baby-boomer parents who tried marijuana during their youth,
reported a recent study released by the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, approximately half of the parents surveyed admItted
to having tried marijuana in their youth and 46 percent said they
expected their teen to try illegal drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;What is infuriating ... is the resignation of so many
parents,&quot; said CASA head Joseph Califano.&nbsp; &quot;That
is not a climate that is sending a clear and loud message to a
kid: Don't use drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, Califano was alarmed at the attitudes of parents
who had formerly used marijuana.&nbsp; According to the study, 65
percent of parents who had tried marijuana believe their own
children will use drugs.&nbsp; Also, 42 percent of those parents
did not perceive use of marijuana by an adolescent under 16 years
of age as a crisis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Califano argued that many parents need to be aware that the
marijuana used by individuals today is far stronger than the
marijuana of yesteryear.&nbsp; This claim has been refuted by <b>NORML</b> repeatedly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There exists absolutely no evidence that marijuana THC
content has increased significantly over the past two
decades,&quot; responded <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This fact is acknowledged by both the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) and is confirmed by the scientific data
from the Potency Monitoring Project in Mississippi.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study also indicated that many adolescents have easier access
to marijuana than they do other regulated intoxicants like
cigarettes and alcohol.&nbsp; Califano did not believe that this
finding supported a need to regulate marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Legalization of marijuana would be a disaster,&quot; he
responded on a National Public Radio broadcast.&nbsp; Califano
did not elaborate further. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that children currently have easier access to
marijuana than they do cigarettes or alcohol speaks volumes of
the need to legalize and regulate marijuana, if only to more
effectively keep it out of the hands of children,&quot; said St.
Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;CASA National Survey of American attitudes on Substance
Abuse II: Teens and Parents&quot; was conducted during July and
August by telephone of 1,200 adolescents age 12 through 17 and 1,166
parents, all with children of the same age group. <br>

Dole Proposals To Increase Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>
Libertarian Presidential candidate Harry Browne has sharply
criticized proposals by Republican Presidential candidate Bob
Dole to greatly expand the role of the U.S. military, National
Guard, and Central Intelligence Agency in the fight against
illicit drugs.&nbsp; Browne maintains that increasing the
&quot;War on Drugs&quot; will only create more suffering, more crime,
and more victims. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Like many other Republican politicians, Dole loves the
insane 'War on Drugs,'&quot; said Brown.&nbsp; &quot;But all
freedom-loving Americans should reject this vision of a nation at
war with its own citizens. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... Government can't keep drugs out of the country, it
can't even keep drugs out of its own prisons.&nbsp; Militarizing
the 'War on Drugs' won't solve the problem; the only realistic
solution is to end the war.&nbsp; Ending the insane 'War on
Drugs' will take the criminal profit out of the illicit drug trade
and bring peace to our cities once again.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Virginia County To Force Convicted Drug
Offenders To Name Their Suppliers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 5, 1996, Richmond, VA:</b> People
convicted on drug offenses, including misdemeanors, in Henrico
County will be called before a grand jury and ordered to reveal
the identity of those who sold them the drugs.&nbsp; Those who
refuse to cooperate face a contempt of court charge and jail
time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If you get caught with a little bit of marijuana, you're
telling us where you got it,&quot; said county prosecutor Toby
Vick, who helped devise the new policy.&nbsp; However, reaction
to the measure remains mixed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It makes great ink, and it makes great film at 11, but in
reality I question the effectiveness of such a program, said
defense attorney David Boone.&nbsp; Boone argued that most
individuals convicted on drug possession charges have little
first-hind knowledge of those who sell them the drugs.&nbsp;
&quot;Small time drug dealers are nameless strangers to the
people with whom they trade,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kent Willis, director of Virginia's American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), noted that Vick and the police have the legal
authority to carry out their plan, but did not believe it would
be effective.</p>

Chapter Files Complaint Alleging Campaign Finance Violations</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 11, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
A local anti-drug group who actively opposed a city ballot
initiative to decriminalize marijuana possession has returned a
$1,000 check from the city's narcotics agency over concerns the
donation may have violated state campaign finance laws.&nbsp; Traverse
City NORML President Bill Bustance, who was behind the
narrowly-defeated initiative, recently filed a complaint with the
Secretary of State alleging that taxpayer dollars were used to influence
a political campaign.&nbsp; According to Michigan law, an
organization that knowingly violates campaign finance rules could
be fined $20,000. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I was wondering who was going to step up to the
plate,&quot; said Bustance, who is seeking a new election.&nbsp;
&quot;We've had two successful initiatory petitions filed and if
these claims [prove] substantial then we at least deserve one
fair election.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Traverse City Narcotics Team alleges that the funds donated
to the anti-drug group, Grand Traverse Families in Action, were
obtained under drug forfeiture laws and were not taxpayer dollars. <br>

medical marijuana user and activist Darrel Paulsen is scheduled
to be in court on September 30 to face charges of felony
marijuana possession in the fifth degree. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An outspoken advocate for medical marijuana, Paulsen has
acknowledged to using marijuana as a means to control his
cerebral palsy.&nbsp; He has been featured on local news
telecasts, spoken at national gatherings, run for city council,
and was one of several patients spotlighted at NORML's 1994
Medical Marijuana Day rally and press conference. <br>

Participation In Drug Debate</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 5, 1996, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey said that he welcomed <b>NORML</b>'s
involvement in the national debate over drug policy, while
speaking on National Public Radio. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b> Executive Director R. Keith Stroup, Esq. immediately
responded to the invitation and delivered a written acceptance
stating that the organization would be ready and willing to meet with

appropriate forum. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We hereby request the opportunity to meet with you to
discuss our concerns with the administration's current drug
policy,&quot; announced Stroup.&nbsp; &quot;Although we clearly
do not agree on many issues, there may well be some areas, such
as adolescent marijuana smoking, in which we can work
cooperatively to achieve a common goal.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Senate Holds Special Hearing On Teen Drug
Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 4, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In wake of a Department of Health and Human Services report
indicating that monthly use of illicit substances has doubled
among adolescents since 1992, the Senate Judiciary Committee
convened a special hearing to examine the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Speaking before the committee were Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY),
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala, and John Walters.&nbsp; All agreed that programs
to reverse current trends in teen drug use must focus on 1)
tougher drug penalties for adult users; 2) a clear and concise
message that use of any illicit substance is wrong; and 3) increased
federal spending on youth education programs such as DARE. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;What both the speakers and senators neglected to mention is
that none of these options have been effective in reducing teen
drug use,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Publications Director Paul
Armentano, who attended the hearing.&nbsp; &quot;Today's
graduating seniors are the first generation of adolescents who were
exposed to the most massive, consistent, and expensive federal
anti-drug campaign ever launched.&nbsp; They grew up listening to
DARE officers in the classroom and public service announcements
from the Partnership for a Drug Free America when they came home;
yet the statistics indicate that they are using drugs at far
higher rates than were their predecessors just four and five
years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In addition, more drug offenders are being arrested and
incarcerated for longer periods of time than ever before in our
nation's history.&nbsp; Clearly, this problem requires more than
the standard Washington rhetoric.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Re-Enacts Temporary &quot;Smoke A
Joint, Lose Your License&quot; Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 3, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Minutes before its post-midnight adjournment, the California
State Senate enacted a temporary, emergency &quot;Smoke a Joint,
Lose Your License&quot; bill.&nbsp; The decision surprised many
who noted that the Senate had turned down a similar measure
earlier in the day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation was passed at the insistence of Gov. Pete Wilson,
a long-time advocate of the federal mandate.&nbsp; The law
requires a six-month driver's license suspension for all drug
offenses, regardless of whether they are driving-related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">State Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer is said to have
reluctantly agreed to the measure as a means of guaranteeing
federal highway aid.&nbsp; Under federal law, California must be
in compliance as of October 1, 1996 or else lose $100 million in
highway funding.&nbsp; The bill was passed as an emergency
measure so as to take effect immediately upon the Governor's
signature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In deference to opponents, the new law is set to expire within
six months.&nbsp; This will set the stage for another &quot;Smoke
a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; battle next year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Gov. Wilson's insistence on this foolish federal mandate is
one more costly example of Republican anti-drug hypocrisy,&quot;
said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp;
&quot;It's clearly absurd for the government to take [your]
driver's license away for possessing a joint in your home, yet
not for speeding and reckless driving with a bottle in your
car.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Activists Arrested On Trespassing
Charges<br>
After Being Banned From Attending Public Rally</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Columbus, NC:</b>&nbsp; A
North Carolina couple were arrested and charged with trespassing
by the Polk County Sheriff's Department after attending a public
rally to promote medicinal marijuana in front of the county
courthouse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both Steve and Jean Marlowe were involved in organizing
the event, billed as the Second Annual Freedom Rally, Mr. Marlowe
had been told by county officials that he was forbidden from
attending because of allegations he smoked marijuana at last
year's festival.&nbsp; Marlowe was arrested on charges of
marijuana possession after last year's event, but the case is still
pending. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jean Marlowe argues that the recent arrest was in violation of
their civil liberties and the couple plans on pursuing legal
action against the county.&nbsp; &quot;County council says they
can set their own rules, but they can't violate your
rights,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;They can't forbid you to
attend a rally.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Philadelphia attorney Lawrence Hirsch has agreed to take the case
on behalf of the Marlowes and called the suit a matter of
principle.&nbsp; &quot;To me, every step of the way, [the county]
seem to be creating a case that's bound to blow up in there
face,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1995, <b>NORML</b> and the Southern California American Civil
Liberties Union filed a civil rights lawsuit against an Anaheim
ordinance that prohibited certain prior drug offenders from the right
to use public parks for lawful purposes.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
eventually prevailed in the challenge. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Juror Held In Contempt After Refusing To
Convict Drug Offender</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Gilpin County, CO:</b>&nbsp; A
juror who maintains that she had &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;
regarding the guilt of a drug defendant could face over six
months in prison and an unspecified fine after being cited by
Gilpin County Judge Kenneth Barnhill for contempt of court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Laura Kriho is scheduled to begin a jury trial in late September
to defend herself against allegations that she tainted a jury in
the case of a 19 year-old female defendant charged with felony possession
of methamphetamine.&nbsp; According to Barnhill, Kriho allegedly
disobeyed a court order by discussing sentences in her
deliberations.&nbsp; Kriho insisted that she ultimately voted to
acquit because she had reasonable doubts as to the defendant's
guilt based on the facts of the case as presented by the
prosecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barnhill also alleged that Kriho committed perjury by lying under
oath to the Judge and the attorneys by failing to volunteer
information regarding a prior drug conviction from 1984.&nbsp;
Kriho argued that she was never specifically asked about her
criminal history and notes that she received a deferred sentence
for the 1984 conviction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I tried to do my job as a juror well,&quot; Kriho
said.&nbsp; &quot;I had never been on a jury before, and the whole
experience was unique and very stressful.&nbsp; Now I feel I am
being unfairly singled-out and punished for coming up with the
'wrong' verdict.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Paul Grant, who is representing Kriho in this case,
warned that the prosecution of his client threatens to undermine
the jury system.&nbsp; &quot;Jurors must be able to deliberate
independently of the judge, without the threat of criminal
prosecution hanging over their heads,&quot; he stated. <br>

through illegal activities, is against the law.&nbsp; The
allegation is the latest in a series of accusations made by state
law enforcement officials since the club was raided on August
4.&nbsp; To date, no individuals have been arrested in connection
with the club, nor have any formal charges been filed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California Bureau of Narcotics Chief Joe Doane said that the
issue of possible tax evasion arose because agents found no
documents related to the withholding of salary for Social
Security, state and federal taxes and workers' compensation for
employees of the club.&nbsp; &quot;That indicates [that club
founder Dennis Peron] was not following state and federal laws
regarding payment of taxes on salaries and benefits,&quot; argued
state attorney general's office spokesman Steve Telliano. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dennis Peron told United Press International that standard
business practices were not followed at the club because of the
underground nature of supplying medical marijuana to those who
needed it.&nbsp; &quot;Until we change the law, you have to
realize that what we are doing is illegal.&nbsp; We've had to do things
a certain way to protect the people whose lives we were trying to
help.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Californians for Compassionate Use treasurer John Entwistle
called the state's latest allegation &quot;another red
herring&quot; and reiterated that all profits were distributed
back into the club.&nbsp; &quot;If we had bought big houses, then
we'd be ashamed,&quot; he remarked.&nbsp; &quot;But we didn't;
we've all taken vows of poverty.&nbsp; There is no hidden
money.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officials report that criminal charges involving both the tax
issue as well as other facets of the club's activities may be
filed in three to four weeks. <br>

After Voters Strike Down Ballot Proposal To Decriminalize
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a city ballot initiative to decriminalize marijuana
possession have filed a complaint with the Secretary of State
alleging that opponents of the measure violated state campaign
finance laws.&nbsp; The proposal was rejected by voters by a 58
to 42 percent vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaint, spearheaded by Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance,
maintains that Traverse City Police Chief Ralph Soffredine, Prosecutor
Dennis LaBelle, and others acted as a political committee but
failed to file any papers with the county clerk as required under
the Michigan Campaign Finance Acts.&nbsp; The complaint also
alleges that opponents sent out a biased flyer against the
proposal using the tax-funded mailing permit of Traverse
City.&nbsp; Bustance is demanding a new election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We've had two successful initiatory petitions filed and if
these claims [prove] substantial then we at least deserve one
fair election,&quot; Bustance said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Traverse City officials admit that the city paid to send out over
9,400 flyers in a one-time mailing, but deny that the mailing was
an attempt to influence voters against the ballot proposal.&nbsp; The
flyer was titled &quot;Marijuana: Facts to Consider.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Michigan law, a person who knowingly violates
campaign finance rules could be punished by up to a year in jail
or a $2,000 fine.&nbsp; An organization that does so may receive
up to a $20,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot had been a rocky one for marijuana
activists. Chapter organizers' 1994 initiative drive was rejected
by the city commission despite having well over the required
number of signatures, because it allegedly conflicted with state
law.&nbsp; This year's petition was devoid of legal problems, but faced
severe opposition from city commissioners who in December unanimously passed
a resolution asking residents not to sign the petition.&nbsp; The commission
later passed a resolution encouraging voters to vote against the proposal. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1996, Delfzijl, Netherlands:</b>&nbsp;
For two decades, Dutch officials have tolerated the sale of
marijuana and hashish in coffee shops; now some are going into
business for themselves. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Authorities in the town of Delfzijl are spending $294,117 to open
a coffee shop on September 1, reports the Associated Press.&nbsp;
It is modeled on a similar project in the town of Bussum, outside Amsterdam.&nbsp;
Profits from the store will fund education campaigns on drug use,
and the store will be staffed with counselors and youth workers
offering free health information on drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Of course we don't want people to use drugs, but that's not
realistic,&quot; said Delfzijl City Hall spokeswoman Marjon
Edzes.&nbsp; &quot;This is a healthier solution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite their policy of tolerating the sale of marijuana and
hashish, the number of Dutch adolescents who have ever used
marijuana is far lower than in America.&nbsp; Dutch politicians
maintain that their policy discourages hard drug use by

<p align="center"><b>Dole Calls For Larger Military Presence In
Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 25, Palos Park, Ill:</b>&nbsp;
Responding to figures of rising illicit drug use among
adolescents, Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole vowed to
greatly increase the role of the military in combating drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We will make drug interdiction a priority for our
intelligence services, beefing up not just technical operations
but also human intelligence operations,&quot; said Dole during a
recent campaign speech.&nbsp; &quot;We will expand the use of
military technology, including reconnaissance and satellites and area
surveillance and listening posts to track drug movements toward
our borders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole also advocated using the National Guard in domestic drug
interdiction efforts.&nbsp; &quot;Working with the governors, we
will create designated National Guard units with appropriate
training and equipment to provide a rapid response
capability.&nbsp; If we need the National Guard to move in, they'll
have the training.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Dole's proposals are nothing new,&quot; commented <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Increasing the use
of military technology to interdict drugs began under the Bush
administration at the cost of millions of taxpayers' dollars, yet
yielded few tangible results.&nbsp; Also, the National Guard has
been utilized in domestic drug enforcement -- generally marijuana
eradication -- since Congress authorized its use in 1988 by
sidestepping the Posse Comitatus Act of 1879 that forbids the use
of federal troops in civilian law enforcement.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole defended his proposals by alleging that the threat of drugs,
like the threat of terrorism from abroad, was an area where the
military had a proper role. <br>

Doubles In A Decade</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
There were approximately 1.6 million men and women in the
nation's jails and prisons last year, reported the Department of
Justice.&nbsp; This figure is a 113 percent increase since 1985
and equates to one out of every 167 U.S. residents in jail or

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since 1980 -- when the number of inmates in state or federal
prisons or in local jails stood at just over 500,000 --

significant factor for this dramatic increase is drug

<p align="center"><b>Latest Edition Of Household Survey Fuels
Election Year Fodder <br>
NORML Responds To Calls To Escalate The Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1996: Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Illicit drug use (defined as use at least once in the past month)
among adolescents age 12 to 17 rose 33 percent since last year
and now stands at 10.9 percent, reports the latest annual
findings from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.&nbsp; The
use of marijuana, the illicit drug used primarily by adolescents,
increased from 7.3 percent to 8.2 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Not surprisingly, both prohibitionists and politicians are using
the latest statistics to call for increased anti-drug
efforts.&nbsp; &quot;This is nothing short of a national
tragedy,&quot; said Republican nominee Bob Dole.&nbsp;
&quot;Starting next January, I'm going to make the drug war
priority No. 1 once again.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In light of the recent data, <b>NORML</b> issued the following
statement.&nbsp; As always, <b>NORML</b> remains committed to the
notion that adolescents grow up drug-free. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statistics indicating rising levels of teen marijuana
use cited by the National Household Survey should be an issue of
concern for both parents and political leaders alike.&nbsp; <u>However,
there is no evidence to demonstrate that increasing penalties
against adult users will amend the problem.</u>&nbsp; In fact,
federal statistics indicate that just the opposite is true. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Despite criticism that the Clinton administration has
abandoned the drug war, FBI figures from its annual Uniform Crime
Report illustrate that nearly one-half million Americans were
arrested on marijuana charges in 1994 -- more than 83 percent of
them for simple possession.&nbsp; This inflated figure is a
remarkable 42 percent increase over the average yearly total for
marijuana arrests under the Bush administration and equates to an
arrest every 65 seconds! <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Yet, in spite of this significant increase in the
enforcement of drug and marijuana laws, recent studies such as
the Household Survey indicate that the use of narcotics and
marijuana is rising in popularity -- especially among
adolescents.&nbsp; <b>Specifically, the fact that the use of
marijuana is rapidly growing at the same time that law
enforcement officials are arresting record numbers of users
clearly confirms that marijuana prohibition does not effectively
deter marijuana consumption.</b> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In addition, it must be noted that today's rates of
adolescent drug use are rather moderate when put in historical
perspective.&nbsp; For example, as late as 1988, during the
height of the Reagan/Bush 'Just say 'no' campaign,' the number of
adolescents age 12 to 17 who reported using an illicit substance
within the past month stood at 9.2 percent, just slightly below
today's so-called 'emergency levels.'&nbsp; In addition, today's
use rates -- despite the recent increase -- still remain well below
the peak levels recorded in the late i970s and early 1980s. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We will probably never know why marijuana use-rates go up
and down over time.&nbsp; However, it is worth noting that the
recent increase occurred among the same population of young
people who had been exposed to a decade-long anti-marijuana
campaign in the schools and the media.&nbsp; That campaign, based
on exaggerations of marijuana's alleged harms and a 'Just say no'
ideology has clearly failed.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Study To Determine Whether Marijuana Helps
Individuals Suffering From AIDS Wasting Syndrome Rejected By
National Institutes of Health</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 7, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Dr. Donald Abrams of UC-San Francisco learned that his proposal
to conduct a pilot study into the use of smoked marijuana in the
treatment of the AIDS wasting syndrome was rejected by a
peer-review committee of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&nbsp; This means the study cannot
proceed because the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
arbitrarily required that it pass the NIH peer-review process to qualify
for receiving marijuana from NIDA.&nbsp; This condition has not
been previously required of other FDA-approved studies.&nbsp;
NIDA retains a monopoly on the legal supply of marijuana for research
purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NIAID will send a letter explaining the reason for the rejection
in six to eight weeks.&nbsp; At that time, Dr. Abrams will
evaluate the comments to see if, in his opinion, they are
scientifically justified or politically motivated.&nbsp; A
decision regarding the revision and resubmission of the protocol
will be made at that time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b> board member Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has been working
closely with Dr. Abrams for four years to sponsor this
study.&nbsp; He noted that this was the second time a specific
pilot study proposed by Dr. Abrams to investigate the use of
smoked marijuana in the treatment of weight loss in patients
suffering from the AIDS wasting syndrome has been rejected by
federal health officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although having an initial protocol design extensively reviewed,
critiqued, modified, and approved by the both the FDA and the
California Research Advisory panel in 1994, Abrams was denied
receiving the marijuana necessary for his study by NIDA in April
of 1995.&nbsp; After addressing several of NIDA's concerns --
including revising the protocol to an all in-patient study --
Abrams resubmitted a grant proposal to NIH on May 1, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This latest rejection &quot;delays [us] at least a year, if not
permanently,&quot; said Doblin.&nbsp; &quot;In 1992, DEA
Administrator Robert Bonner stated: 'Those who insist that
marijuana has medical uses would serve society better by
promoting or sponsoring more legitimate scientific
research.'&nbsp; All we are asking for is simply to conduct that
research.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The events of the past weeks in San Francisco make the
bankruptcy of the government's policy glaringly evident,&quot;
said California NORML Coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp; &quot;Why
is it easier for your kids to get marijuana than for researchers,
physicians, and patients?&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Swiss State To Legalize Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 19, 1996, Zurich, Switzerland:</b>&nbsp;
The government of the state of Zurich in Switzerland approved a
proposal that could legalize the use of cannabis, reported the
Reuters news agency. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 85-40 vote, the state council endorsed a resolution by the
liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) that calls for a change in
the narcotics law through a referendum. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The FDP argued that using marijuana should no longer remain a
punishable offense because 20 years of federal prohibition have
not proved to be an adequate deterrent of either marijuana use or availability.&nbsp;
Therefore, the proposal recommends that the sale of cannabis be
organized and regulated by the state in order to insure quality
and eliminate the black market.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Board Strikes Down Proposal<br>
To Declare Medical Marijuana 'Emergency' For San Francisco's Sick</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A measure to declare a city-wide state of emergency allowing
marijuana to be used for medical purposes has been struck down by
San Francisco city officials.&nbsp; The proposal, spearheaded by
city Board of Supervisors member Tom Ammiano, was introduced
following a raid by state narcotics officers on the San Francisco
Cannabis Buyers' Club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On the advice of the city's District Attorney Terence Hallinan
and Director of Health Sandra Hernandez, a Board of Supervisors
committee backed off from the declaration.&nbsp; Many officials claimed
that approving such a controversial measure could jeopardize the
city's needle-exchange program that currently operates under an
emergency declaration.&nbsp; The decision came one day after Mayor
Willie Brown withdrew his support for the proposal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If it were up to me, I would have a state of emergency, but
given the [advice], it doesn't look a state of emergency is going
to fly,&quot; said Ammiano. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown said that he also felt a declaration of a medical marijuana
emergency could legally endanger the clean needle program.&nbsp;
He added that city officials were attempting to work out an agreement
with the state attorney general's office to let another
organization distribute marijuana to patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If they say that it can't be done [by the San Francisco
Cannabis Buyers' Club and] it has to be done [by] some other
organization that's free of any taint, then we'll do that,&quot;
Brown said at his bi-weekly press conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;My interest is to get [medical marijuana] to an
organization that has no history with legal or illegal use of
marijuana,&quot; added police commissioner Pat Norman.&nbsp;
&quot;[This] should not be a political issue; it should be
provided as treatment.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the possibility that city officials may attempt to
procure an outside entity to distribute medical marijuana, San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club founder Dennis Peron told the San
Francisco Chronicle that he would support any and all efforts to
viably get medical marijuana to the sick. <br>

Medical Marijuana Giveaway</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 19, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A city church distributed marijuana on Sunday to patients who
possessed a doctor's recommendation in wake of the temporary
injunction closing the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">About 25 patients showed up for the giveaway, news of which was
spread through word of mouth.&nbsp; Those possessing valid
documentation were provided with one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana. <br>

the law to make this marijuana available,&quot; said Rev. Jim
Mitulski of the Metropolitan Community Church of San
Francisco.&nbsp; &quot;Our church's spiritual vitality has always
come from a willingness to act where people have been reluctant
to act.&nbsp; This is not a bystander church.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Allen White, a community activist who helped organize the event,
said he had notified Mayor Willie Brown, Assistant Police Chief
Earl Sanders, and District Attomey Terence Hallinan Saturday
night about the church's plan to distribute marijuana.&nbsp;
Organizers said that they knew of no other church that had
conducted such an operation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mitulski did not specify whether he would hold repeat giveaways,

<p align="center"><b>Law Enforcement Bust Cannabis Buyers' Club
In Key West, Florida <br>
Founder, One Other Arrested On Felony Marijuana Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 14, 1996, Key West, FL:</b>&nbsp; For
the second time in two weeks, law enforcement officials have
raided and shut down operations of a cannabis buyers' club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Police sparked a wave of citizen outrage when Special Operations
detectives raided a cannabis buyers' club in Key West and
arrested two people, including club founder Zvi Baranoff.&nbsp;
Both individuals were charged with possession of felony amounts
of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of drug
paraphernalia.&nbsp; The Key West club serviced approximately 90
patients and has existed for one year.&nbsp; It is one of an
estimated 30 underground clubs throughout the United States that
distributes marijuana as a medicine to seriously ill patients who
possess a doctor's recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It seems like shabby treatment of someone who's trying to
do something good,&quot; said a former Key West city commissioner
who spoke anonymously with the Key West Citizen.&nbsp;
&quot;Where's the compassion?&nbsp; These people were dispensing
medicine to people who can't eat, sleep, or hold food in their
stomachs.&nbsp; [The raid is nothing more than an] inhumane witch
hunt.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Detective John Elmore defended the raid by saying that police
have no choice but to enforce the law.&nbsp; Elmore further
alleged that marijuana was sold to some individuals who did not
suffer from valid medical illnesses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Local citizens appeared to be strongly supportive of the club and
many club members voiced their discontent to the local
media.&nbsp; &quot;We're just trying to extend our lives a little
bit,&quot; said one HIV-positive club member.&nbsp; &quot;Maybe
these officers should attend every funeral, or read the newspaper
which would be stuffed with obituaries&quot; if we didn't have
underground access to medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Key West bust comes on the heels of a raid by California
state narcotics agents last Sunday on the 11,000 member San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club.&nbsp; No arrests have yet to be made
in connection with the raid, but a temporary injunction has been
granted to keep the club closed.&nbsp; The decision by state
Attorney General Dan Lungren to order the bust has outraged many members
of the San Francisco community -- including Mayor Willie Brown,
Sheriff Michael Hennessey, District Attorney Terence Hallinan,
former Police Commissioner Jo Daly, and several members of the
city's Board of Supervisors -- and cast harsh criticism upon
state politicians and law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;With the recent raids of cannabis buyers' clubs in
Cincinnati, San Francisco, and now Key West, the message is
clear: law enforcement is targeting the sick and dying,&quot;
said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Our sympathy goes out to the individuals and patients
affected by these unfortunate incidents.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Two State Medical Associations Endorse
Proposition 215</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 8, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Two statewide medical societies, representing a combined total of
almost 10,000 physicians, have endorsed a California ballot
initiative to legalize marijuana for medical use (Proposition
215). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The San Francisco Medical Society (SFMS), which represents about
2,200 doctors in San Francisco, announced its support for
Proposition 215 just four days after state law enforcement officers
raided and closed down San Francisco's Cannabis Buyers'
Club.&nbsp; They were joined in their endorsement by the
California Academy of Family Physicians (CAFP), which represents approximately
7,500 physicians statewide. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">San Francisco Medical Society President Dr. Toni J. Brayer said
that the society based its decision on the results of an opinion
poll of doctors who treat MDS and cancer patients as well as drug
addicts.&nbsp; The doctors surveyed reportedly told the society
that they believed legalizing marijuana for medical purposes was
a good idea because it has therapeutic value to many seriously ill
patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This initiative is an important one.&nbsp; ... It will
protect our patients,&quot; Bayer said.&nbsp; &quot;What we want to
do as physicians is to relieve pain and suffering.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The society also recommends clinical testing of marijuana as a
medicine so that scientific data may be generated on its
effectiveness in treating patients. <br>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Judge Orders Changes in
&quot;Misleading&quot; Ballot Argument Against Proposition 215</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 9, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Organizers of a campaign against a California ballot proposal to
legalize marijuana for medical use (Proposition 215) took one on
the chin as Sacramento Superior Court Judge William Ridgeway
called part of the campaign's prohibitionist argument
&quot;misleading&quot; and ordered changes.&nbsp; Advocates for
the medical marijuana initiative applauded Ridgeway's ruling and
remarked that the statements in question were &quot;yet another
in a series of deceptions&quot; waged by opponents of Proposition
215. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The judge's action was sparked by an American Cancer Society
(ACS) petition.&nbsp; The ACS asked to have two references to the
organization by opponents, collectively known as &quot;No on 215,&quot;
dropped or changed before publication in the ballot pamphlet
distributed by the secretary of state.&nbsp; The pamphlets went
to press this week. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The original &quot;No on 215&quot; rebuttal argument portrayed
the ACS as vocal opponents of the medical marijuana
initiative.&nbsp; In truth, ACS attorney George Waters maintained
that the organization neither supports nor opposes the
measure.&nbsp; Therefore, Judge Ridgeway ordered that &quot;No on
215&quot; alter their chief rebuttal argument: &quot;American
Cancer Society says no.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, the judge
ordered that a second reference to the Society's opinion on
marijuana be removed entirely. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ballot initiative proponents also note that the rebuttal falsely
claims that &quot;no major doctor's organization supports
Proposition 215&quot; when, in fact, both the San Francisco
Medical Society (SFMS) and the California Academy of Family
Physicians (CAFP) -- together representing nearly 10,000
physicians -- have already endorsed the initiative. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Perhaps the reason 'No on 215' keeps stretching the truth
is [because] the campaign has no choice,&quot; suggested Dave
Fratello of Californians for Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;The
entire campaign is predicated on a falsehood -- the notion that
marijuana has no medical value.&nbsp; This is proved wrong by the
experience[s] of tens of thousands of patients, nurses, and
doctors across California, many of whom support Proposition
215.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Michigan City Residents Vote &quot;No&quot;
To Local Measure To Decriminalize Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 7, 1996: Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
Local residents rejected a city ballot proposal that would have
made possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce of marijuana
in Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of $100 and up
to ten hours community service for a first-time offender by a 58
to 42 percent vote.&nbsp; The measure had been introduced by the
local chapter of <b>NORML</b>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the outcome, Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance
remained optimistic.&nbsp; &quot;The 42 percent [in favor of
decriminalization] was better than anyone ever expected us to
do,&quot; explained Bustance.&nbsp; &quot;Forty two percent of
Traverse City residents were ready to repent for the sins of
America's drug war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bustance further added that he believes the city government used
federal finds to sway Traverse City voters' decisions on the
initiative, a felony offense in Michigan.&nbsp; Bustance told <b>NORML</b>
that he will file a complaint with the secretary of state in
hopes of getting the initiative back on the city ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to the August 6 primary, the Traverse City Commission had
unanimously passed a resolution encouraging residents to vote
against the initiative. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Scottish Senior Judge Says Cannabis
Decriminalization Should Be Considered</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1996, Scotland:</b>&nbsp; One of
Scotland's most senior judges, Lord McLuskey, has sharply criticized
a federal &quot;white paper&quot; calling for enhanced anti-drug
penalties.&nbsp; In addition, the former solicitor general stated
that there needs to be an open debate on the issue of
decriminalizing cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The people who advocate the decriminalization of cannabis
need to be listened to and not condemned,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;Open debate is not only healthy, it is essential.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a nine page response to the June &quot;white paper,&quot;
McLuskey maintained that current prohibition ostracizes a large
percentage of the younger generation and encourages disrespect
for the law overall.&nbsp; &quot;A particular problem for the
criminal justice system is that, if the law continues to treat
all use of scheduled drugs [other than on prescription] as
criminal abuse, it will further alienate and criminalize large
numbers of younger people who regard the use of certain drugs in
sensible quantities and settings as providing enjoyment without
significantly threatening their health,&quot; McLuskey
wrote.&nbsp; &quot;Alienating large numbers of people by making
them into undetected offenders against criminal law greatly
weakens the criminal justice system.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McLuskey also argued that marijuana has medicinal value and
contested the prohibitionist belief that any use of an illicit
substance &quot;must be an abuse.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The sentiments and concerns of Lord McLuskey greatly echo
those of <b>NORML</b> and the testimony we presented this year
before Congress,&quot; stated NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McLuskey has sat in the House of Lords for 20 years.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Small Town Mayor Indicted On Marijuana
Charges<br>
After Allegedly Growing Marijuana For &quot;Educational&quot;
Purposes</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August, 1996, Copperhill, TN:</b>&nbsp;
Copperhill Mayor Janelle Kimsey has been indicted by a grand jury
on marijuana possession charges after police discovered 10
marijuana plants growing on the deck of her home.&nbsp; Kimsey
turned herself in to authorities following her arraignment and
was later released on $500 cash bond. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kimsey's legal problems began last June when 10 marijuana plants
were found growing on her front porch.&nbsp; At the time, Kimsey
alleged that she was growing the marijuana for
&quot;educational&quot; purposes.&nbsp; &quot;We made a drug bust
a couple of months ago, and citizens wanted to know what [marijuana]
looked like,&quot; she explained shortly after the
incident.&nbsp; &quot;Dumb me, I didn't know I couldn't do
it.&nbsp; I know ignorance is no excuse, but in my case, it was
ignorance.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Authorities are not buying the mayor's claim and have set a trial
date for September 20.&nbsp; However, some citizens are critical
that Kimsey is only being charged with simple possession -- a misdemeanor
-- rather than cultivation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Shari Taylor, assistant district attorney for the
10th Judicial District, the 10 plants possessed by Kimsey
&quot;came to less than one-half ounce&quot; (14 grams) when
weighed all together and did not merit felony charges.&nbsp;
However, according to federal sentencing guidelines, one marijuana
plant is presumed to weigh 100 grams.&nbsp; &quot;Apparently,
there exists one set of marijuana plant-weight ratios for
politicians and another set for the rest of America,&quot;
commented <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kimsey is due back in court on September 16 for a status hearing.</p>

<p align="center"><b>San Francisco Buyers' Club Raided, Closed By
State Authorities</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
San Francisco Superior Court Judge William Cahill granted a
temporary injunction on August 5 to close down the San Francisco
Cannabis Buyers' Club.&nbsp; The club -- the largest of
approximately 30 underground clubs located across the nation that supplies
marijuana as a therapeutic agent to patients who possess a
doctor's recommendation -- provided relief for an estimated
11,000 seriously ill patients throughout the bay area. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The injunction was granted following a raid by state narcotics
agents one day earlier.&nbsp; The early morning raid -- which
occurred without the cooperation of local law enforcement or
District Attorney Terence Hallinan -- was ordered by state
Attorney General Dan Lungren, an outspoken opponent of this
year's state ballot initiative to legalize marijuana for medical
use (Proposition 215).&nbsp; According to newspaper and
eye-witness accounts, the raid took place at 7:30 a.m., a time when
the club was not serving clients.&nbsp; Armed with a search
warrant, nearly 100 gun-toting agents broke down the club's front
door and seized medical records, at least two computers, 40
pounds of marijuana, some documents pertaining to Proposition
215, and an undisclosed amount of cash.&nbsp; In addition, five
other locations associated with the club personnel were
raided.&nbsp; A spokesman for the state Justice Department, Steve
Telliano, said that no arrests were made during the morning sweeps,
but acknowledged that charges may be filed against some of the
club's organizers at a later date. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many San Francisco leaders expressed both shock and outrage at
the actions of the state narcotics officers.&nbsp; District
Attorney Hallinan denounced the raid as a political act by
Lungren, who has been mentioned as a Republican candidate for
Vice-President.&nbsp; San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessy said
that he will refuse to enforce the injunction and Mayor Willie
Brown stated that he was &quot;dismayed by the Gestapo tactics
displayed by [the attorney general.]&quot;&nbsp; In addition,
several members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by
Tom Ammiano, expressed support for the legalization of medicinal
marijuana and requested hearings into the raid.&nbsp; Also, the
board passed a resolution calling on the Department of Health to
draw up a public health state of emergency declaration for
medical marijuana.&nbsp; Some proponents believe that this
measure could eventually pave the way for the suspension of laws
against medical marijuana in San Francisco. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I feel really angry at the way [the attorney general's
office] did it,&quot; Ammiano told the San Francisco
Chronicle.&nbsp; &quot;It's the worst kind of political
opportunism.&nbsp; We could have worked with them.&nbsp; Instead,
they chose these storm-trooper tactics.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision to close the San Francisco Buyers' Club was granted
by Judge Cahill based on affidavits from narcotics officials that
the club had sold marijuana for non-medical purposes to undercover
agents.&nbsp; In a tape released to the media, club founder
Dennis Peron was shown selling a quantity of marijuana to an
undercover agent for what were alleged to be non-medical
purposes.&nbsp; The agent was posing as an AIDS patient who
wished to provide marijuana to fellow patients in a neighboring
county.&nbsp; Evidence substantiating additional allegations of
misconduct against the club, such as the charge that club
staffers sometimes sold marijuana in excess of that required for personal
use, was not presented during the hearing. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Judge Cahill ordered the club closed, but you cannot close
the spirit of the club,&quot; announced Dennis Peron to a crowd
of approximately 800 demonstrators who attended a candlelight
march later that evening.&nbsp; &quot;We'll stay open as [the]
headquarters for Proposition 215.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The big question now looming for activists on both sides of the
medical marijuana issue is how the raid and subsequent shut-down
of the Cannabis Buyers' Club will effect California voter's sentiments
in November.&nbsp; While some Californians speculate that the
timing of the raid may have been motivated by political reasons,
many marijuana activists forsee the raid as potentially being a catalyst
to inspire voters to support Proposition 215.&nbsp; &quot;The
[actions of the attorney general] prove the need to pass
Proposition 215,&quot; said California NORML Coordinator, Dale
Gieringer, Ph.D.&nbsp; &quot;[He] has made it plain that he not
only opposes the medical use of marijuana, but is also intent on wasting
taxpayer's money enforcing laws against it.&quot; <br>

Declare Medical Marijuana Emergency<br>
Issue To Be Examined At August 15 Hearing</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
In the wake of a state raid on the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers'
Club, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors -- led by Tom
Ammiano -- has passed a resolution asking city health officials
to declare a medical emergency allowing for patients to use
marijuana as a medicine.&nbsp; Ammiano and others believe that
state laws forbidding the use of marijuana may be circumvented by
declaring an emergency.&nbsp; San Francisco already has such a program
in place regarding needle exchange. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The city attorney's office told the San Francisco Chronicle that
it has no legal opinion on the resolution at this time and Sandra
R. Hernandez, the city's director of health, remained noncommital.&nbsp;
State Justice Department spokesman Steve Telliano alleged that
county supervisors lack the authority to declare medical
emergencies with the intention of circumventing the law.&nbsp; He explained
that the needle exchange program is &quot;illegal&quot; despite
being sanctioned by the city. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The San Francisco Department of Health and the city attorney are
set to examine the issue at an August 15 hearing. <br>

Oakland City Council has unanimously passed a resolution (#72881)
establishing a working group to ensure that Oakland police
officers adhere to the city's tolerant medical marijuana

&quot;not to expend city resources in any investigation,
detention, arrest, or prosecution arising out of alleged
violations of state and federal law regarding the possession,
cultivation, and/or distribution of marijuana for medical
use.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe that this marks the first time a legislative body

<p align="center"><b>Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Research
Program<br>
May Breathe New Life From Assembly Measure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 30, 1996: Boston, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
A bill (H. 2170) introduced by Rep. Patricia Jehlen (D-Somerville)
that would reinvigorate the state marijuana therapeutic research
program and eventually provide for a medical necessity legal
defense has passed the Massachusetts state assembly and now
awaits the signature of Gov. William Weld.&nbsp; Sources close to
Gov. Weld indicate that he will sign the bill into law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As amended by the state legislature, H. 2170 will direct the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to pass rules and
regulations within 180 days for the establishment of a marijuana
medical research program.&nbsp; Like many states, Massachusetts
had previously adopted legislation allowing for such a program,
but had never addressed the issues of funding, regulations, or
viable sources for marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The new law does not solve the problem of the federal
government's denial of access to legal marijuana, but it puts
Massachusetts on the record as aggressively researching the
issues of treatment and supply,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee member Michael Cutler, Esq. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[It] creates pressure for a legal source to be
created,&quot; added an aid from Rep. Jehlen's office.&nbsp; &quot;[It
is] a step in the right direction.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The measure also provides patients who are certified to
participate in the program a legal defense against marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This provision was a concession from the
legislation's original intent which would have allowed any
patient with a physician's pre-trial diagnosis of medical necessity
to use the defense.&nbsp; Weld expressed concern that the bill~s
original language was overly broad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The governor has 10 days to either sign or veto the measure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By enacting this law, [Gov. Weld] will allow attention to
the medicinal needs of patients, whose access to treatment is
blocked by the identity of their necessary medicine rather than
by conduct which they can control,&quot; summarized Cutler.&nbsp;
&quot;For many patients, their use of marijuana enables them to
support themselves and their families rather than being totally
disabled and publicly supported.&nbsp; For these patients, who
risk arrest and prosecution every day for the crime of desiring an
ordinary quality of life, this law provides hope for a rational
future of doctor-patient therapies free from governmental
interference.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Welfare Reform Bill Amendment
Altered<br>
To Deny Federal Benefits To Those Convicted On Felony Drug
Charges Only</b> </p>

<p align="left"><br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Most recreational
marijuana smokers will be exempted from the provisions of a last
minute amendment (Samdt. 4935) introduced by Sen. Phil Gram (R-Texas)
that denies for life federal assistance-based benefits to all
individuals convicted on felony drug charges.&nbsp; The amendment
is part of Congress' overall welfare reform package. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the measure's original form, the law additionally denied
&quot;means-tested&quot; federal benefits for five years for
anyone convicted of a marijuana misdemeanor.&nbsp; Possession of
a small amount marijuana is generally treated as a misdemeanor in
all 50 states.&nbsp; The initial language was overwhelmingly
approved by the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gramm's amendment was altered during recent debate in conference
committee.&nbsp; As the amendment stands now, it will only apply
to future felony drug convictions and states will be able to opt
out of the program if they enact legislation to do so.&nbsp;
President Bill Clinton has agreed to sign the welfare reform
package into law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The conference committee has provided relief for some
marijuana smokers by altering Gramm's amendment; however, this
bill still unfairly and inappropriately targets drug users,&quot;
noted <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; Pierre
noted that under the revised amendment, a murderer, rapist, or
robber could receive federal funds and benefits, but not an
individual convicted of cultivating marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Law Enforcement Must Procure A
Warrant<br>
Before Using Heat Scanning Devices</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 26, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Supreme Court has let stand a 1st District Appellate
Court decision mandating that state law enforcement officials
must procure a warrant before conducting thermal imaging searches
of private residences where they suspect drug cultivation may be
taking place.&nbsp; The lower court ruling is now binding on
trial courts statewide. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Only Justices Marvin Baxter and Ming Chin voted to grant a
hearing on the prosecution appeal; four votes are required for a
hearing by the seven-member court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The use of thermal imaging devices can give law enforcement
information regarding activities taking place inside a residence
that they would not otherwise be privy to without procuring a search
warrant and entering the house,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;By its very nature, it is
an intrusive practice that constitutes an unreasonable search
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.&nbsp; Therefore, it should require a warrant.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
applauds the actions of the California court.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In its decision this April, the 1st District Court of Appeals
likened the use of thermal imaging to that of electronically
tracking the movement of chemicals inside a home by using a
beeper.&nbsp; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1984 (<i>U.S. v.
Karo</i>) that a warrant must be attained before law enforcement
can use a beeper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Like the beeper signal ... the thermal imaging scan of
[the] residence told the police something about activities within
the house which they could not otherwise have learned without
obtaining a warrant,&quot; opined Justice Marc Poche.&nbsp;
&quot;PreciseIy because the thermal imaging is indiscriminate in registering
sources of heat, it is an intrusive tool which tells much about
the activities inside the home which may be quite unrelated to
any illicit activity.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... [Therefore,] we find that society recognizes as
reasonable an expectation that the heat generated from within a
private residence may not be measured by the government without a warrant
permitting such a search.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Partnership For A Drug Free America<br>
Agrees To Modify Ad Criticized As &quot;Patently Homophobic&quot;</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 29, 1996, New York City, NY:</b>&nbsp;
The Partnership for a Drug Free America has agreed to re-edit a
series of anti-heroin public service announcements that had drawn
sharp criticism from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ad in question featured a teenager named David whose life
plummets downhill because of an addiction to heroin.&nbsp; The ad
concluded with the narrator saying: &quot;And now I have sex with
men for money to support my habit.&nbsp; ... I wish I didn't have
to be like this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">GLAAD first voiced opposition to the spot early this month
alleging that the ad &quot;had the potential to exacerbate
higher-than-average risks gay and lesbian youths face for
substance abuse and suicide by implying that being gay is worse
than being addicted to heroin.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, PDFA President
Richard Bonette refused GLAAD's request to pull the ad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, however, Bonette has experienced a change of
heart.&nbsp; He now says that the spots will be re-edited to omit
the references to prostitution.&nbsp; &quot;A perception of
offense, however unintended, [may] dilute or interfere our basic
message&quot; of keeping adolescents drug free, Bonette recently explained
in a letter to GLAAD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Alan Klein, news media director at GLAAD said, &quot;We're very
much pleased that the Partnership has taken the concerns of the
gay and lesbian community serious.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Conservative California Readership Strongly
Supports Medical Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 22, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
California ballot initiative (Proposition 215) that would permit
patients who have the approval of a licensed physician to use
marijuana for medical purposes received a strong vote of
confidence from the results of a recent poll conducted by the <i>Orange
County Register</i>.&nbsp; Responding to the question: &quot;Do
you think marijuana should be legalized for medicinal use?&quot;
readers answered &quot;yes&quot; by nearly a three to one
margin.&nbsp; In all, over 1,100 Californians participated in the
poll, with 73 percent responding that they approved of the use of
medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The results of the <i>Orange County Register</i> poll are
quite significant because of the widely acknowledged conservative
political slant of the paper's readership,&quot; announced <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These findings,
coupled with the results of similar polls conducted both in
California and nationally, demonstrate that there is ample
support for the legalization of medical marijuana among both
political conservatives and the general public.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The results of the <i>Orange County Register</i> poll are the
latest in a series of polls indicating strong support for medical
marijuana.&nbsp; A 1995 survey conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of the
American public agreed that patients who find marijuana an
effective therapeutic agent should be able to use it
legally.&nbsp; In addition, six California polls -- including one
conducted by the Binder Research Group -- have shown that a
strong majority of Californians support medical marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Welfare Reform Bill Amended To Deny
Convicted Drug Users Federal Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 22, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; An
amendment introduced by Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas) that would
deny federal assistance-based benefits to those individuals
convicted of drug offenses -- including marijuana misdemeanors --
has been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate.&nbsp; The
amendment is part of an overall welfare reform package (S. 1956)
that is currently in conference committee and is expected to be
sent to the president's desk shortly.&nbsp; It is not yet known
if Clinton will sign the bill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendment proposed by Gramm would deny for five years all
&quot;means-tested&quot; federal benefits, including programs
such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, and student loans, to any individual
who is found guilty of a minor drug offense.&nbsp; Those found
guilty of drug felonies would be ineligible for life. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If we're serious about our [anti-]drug laws, we ought not
to give people welfare benefits who are violating the nation's
drug laws,&quot; said Gramm. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gramm's amendment struck a chord with some congressmen, including
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) who voiced strong opposition to the
measure. &quot;Under this amendment, if you are a murderer, a
rapist, or a robber, you can get federal funds; but if you are
convicted even for possession of marijuana, you cannot,&quot; he
said.&nbsp; &quot;[This amendment] would undermine the whole notion
of providing drug treatment as an alternative sentence to a
first-time drug offender if the individual requires federal
assistance to obtain the treatment.&nbsp; ... It is overly broad
and is strongly opposed by [both] the [Conference of] Mayors and
the National League of Cities.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Over 10 million individuals have been arrested on
marijuana-related charges since 1965 with nearly one-half million
arrested in 1994 alone,&quot; stated NORML Deputy Director Allen
St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This amendment could potentially make
millions of otherwise law abiding Americans ineligible for federal
benefits and is yet one more example of how our nation's alleged
'War on Drugs' is nothing more than a war on marijuana
smokers.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendment passed by a 75 to 25 vote. <br>

In Support Of Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

state marijuana law reform proponents are anticipating a crowd of
thousands to gather on the front steps of the Washington state
capitol for the first ever Hemp Education Day on August 5.&nbsp;
In past years, marijuana reform events such as the Seattle
Hempfest have drawn crowds in excess of 20,000 people. Organizers
of the upcoming festival are hoping to harness the popularity of
past gatherings and transform the Washington hemp reform movement
into a strong political force. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are aware that in the current political climate, you
can't even discuss [the] issue [of marijuana law reform] publicly
or privately without being singled out in the media as ...
'pro-drug,'&quot; stated event organizer Gideon Israel.&nbsp;
&quot;We must use this opportunity to open up a forum for truth and
free expression on this matter.&nbsp; ... Hemp Education Day will
provide a soapbox for the people of Washington state, lawmakers,
and other citizens to educate and be educated [about]
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists scheduled to speak at the rally include NORML Legal
Committee member Jeffrey Steinborn, Esq., Hemp BC owner Marc

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; A recent
public service announcement produced by the Partnership for a
Drug Free America (PDFA) has been branded homophobic by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), a media watchdog
organization based in New York City. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ad, scheduled to air nationwide this month, depicts a

saying, &quot;And now I have sex with men for money, to support

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to GLAAD, the ad suggests that drug use ultimately
leads males to engage in homosexual sex and portrays
homosexuality as a social ill more severe than drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The spot sends a misguided message to America's young
people and specifically to lesbian and gay youth,&quot; stated
GLAAD managing director William Waybourn.&nbsp; &quot;The ad has
the potential to exacerbate higher-than-average risks gay and
lesbian youths face for substance abuse and suicide by implying
that being gay is worse than being addicted to heroin.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although GLAAD has voiced their objections about the PSA to the

will not pull the ad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While I appreciate your concerns, I simply disagree with
your perspective and, therefore, cannot honor your request to
remove 'David' from distribution,&quot; said Bonette.</p>

Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1996, Arlington, VA:</b>&nbsp; <i>USA
Today</i>, the nation's most widely read daily newspaper, has
endorsed access to medical marijuana.&nbsp; The endorsement
stemmed from a <i>USA Today</i> editorial entitled
&quot;Anti-drug focus keeps marijuana from the ill&quot; and came
just two days after the newspaper featured a major article on a
California ballot initiative that would allow seriously ill patients
to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent with a doctor's
recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling marijuana &quot;one of the least toxic medical compounds
in the world,&quot; the editorial cited both marijuana's relative
safety when compared to other legal drugs and medicines and
decades of scientific and anecdotal research maintaining its
medical efficacy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is entirely possible to fight the drug war without
harming innocent civilians in the process,&quot; concluded the <i>USA
Today</i>. &quot;But lawmakers must be careful to choose the

them.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statements made by <i>USA Today</i> in support of
medical access to therapeutic marijuana should have a positive
impact on America's views toward this issue and may translate

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Places Advertising Billboards
On Buses</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 11, 1996, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Several buses of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
will start promoting marijuana law reform thanks to the work of
dedicated local activists.&nbsp; After a year long struggle, the
Northcoast NORML chapter has paid for a three month advertising campaign
to run on the inside and outside of RTA buses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML first approached the RTA with their advertising
campaign in 1995 at which time the RTA denied the chapter's
request because they claimed the public service announcements
would promote the illegal use of marijuana.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML refused to accept the RTA's reasoning and brought the issue
to the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of
Ohio.&nbsp; After several correspondences between the ACLU and
RTA's legal staff, the RTA conceded that NORML's ad was not
promoting marijuana use and was political in nature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Northcoast NORML president John Hartman, the
chapter's billboards carry two basic messages.&nbsp; The
announcement appearing on the tailgate of buses emphasizes the 10 million-plus
marijuana arrests that have occurred since 1965 while the
billboard displayed on the inside reads: &quot;If you don't care
about the people sent to prison for smoking marijuana, at least consider
who gets released to make room for them.&quot;&nbsp; Hartman adds

<p align="center"><b>Man Sentenced To Probation<br>
After Killing Individual He Suspected Sold His Son Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Hartsville, TN:</b>&nbsp; A father
was given three year's probation after pleading guilty to killing
the man he suspected of selling marijuana to his teenage
son.&nbsp; The defendant, Dennis Denham, had been indicted for
second degree murder. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emotions ran high for participants on both sides of the
case.&nbsp; At one point, the shooting victim's mother told the
court that the defendant could see his children, but added that,
&quot;[She has] to go to the cemetery to see [hers.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Denham apparently blamed the man for injuries his son sustained
in an auto accident while allegedly driving under the influence
of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Have we demonized marijuana consumers in this country to
such a point that we allow citizens to murder them and get away
with it?&quot; questioned <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Law That Allows Citizens To Sue Drug Dealers
For Damages<br>
Moves Forward In California</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California state Senate has unanimously approved a sweeping bill
(S.B. 1754) that would allow private parties to sue drug dealers
for damages even if the defendant had nothing to do with the
specific drugs or incident that caused the damage. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Drug Dealer Liability Act, introduced by Sen. Charles
Calderon (D-Whittier) and co-sponsored by Attorney General Dan
Lungren, drug dealers could be sued in civil court for any damages
caused by the same kind of drug elsewhere in the same city or
county, regardless of who actually furnished it, using a radical,
new &quot;market participation&quot; liability doctrine.&nbsp;
For example, under the provisions of a similar law in Michigan,
dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of a controlled
substance are liable for injuries throughout the state, while
those who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuries
in the county where the sales occurred. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Those allowed to sue under the California proposal would include:
parents or family members of users; employers of users; medical
facilities, insurers, or other institutions that fund drug treatment
programs; individuals exposed in utero to an illegal substance;
and persons injured as a result of the willful, reckless, or
negligent actions of an individual substance user. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a way of fighting [drug dealers] by hitting them right
in the pocket,&quot; said actor Carroll O'Connor, who has lobbied
for the measure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendants could be sued if they (1) provided the drug or (2) had
&quot;as a pattern&quot; participated in the market for that drug
within the same city or county.&nbsp; The latter is defined to
mean that they provided the same illicit drug on at least two
instances, with at least one conviction.&nbsp; Cultivation of under
25 marijuana plants would not count as an offense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;When is enough enough?&quot; asked Mark Kappelhoff,
legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
in Washington, D.C., in a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
article.&nbsp; Kappelhoff maintained that adding civil judgments
to criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could be tantamount
to constitutionally cruel or unusual punishment or double
jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California state assembly is expected to approve the measure
by the end of August. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Teacher Under Fire For Hemp
Presentation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 2, 1996, Simpsonville, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Donna Cockrel, the fifth grade school teacher who brought Hollywood
actor and hemp businessman Woody Harrelson to her class to
discuss industrial hemp approximately one month ago, is under
fire from both parents and school officials who have voiced strong
opposition to her actions.&nbsp; Recently, the award-winning
teacher was informed by the Simpsonville Elementary School Board
that she is being investigated because of complaints that followed
Harrelson's visit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Audrey Yeager, the DARE officer for the Shelby County Sheriff's
Office, was one of Cockrel's most outspoken critics.&nbsp;
&quot;Everybody says hemp and marijuana are not the same thing,
but they are; they're both illegal and it was being promoted to
10 and 11-year-old kids,&quot; she told camera crews from the
television show &quot;American Journal.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I am
terribly against it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the criticism, Cockrel adamantly defended her actions and
maintained that Harrelson's presentation related directly to her
curriculum.&nbsp; &quot;I still believe what I did in the
classroom was positive,&quot; said Cockrel who participates in a
state program known as Environment in the Classroom.&nbsp; She
said that industrial hemp, as well as kenaf, soybeans and other
alternatives to growing tobacco are frequently discussed in her
class.&nbsp; &quot;I believe in myself.&nbsp; My students believe
in me.&nbsp; If I'm not allowed to teach the truth to students,
I'd rather quit teaching.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cockrel further added that she believed Harrelson -- who was
adorned in hemp clothing for the occasion -- was just
&quot;showing what a product could be, not promoting it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Shelby County School Superintendent Leon Mooneyhand acknowledged
that Cockrel is being investigated, but failed to indicate how
long the investigation may take.&nbsp; &quot;I am looking into
the matter as I would follow up on any matter that got this level
of concern by staff, parents, and community.&quot;&nbsp;
Mooneyhand was reluctant to speculate about what sanctions, if
any, may be taken against Cockrel, but said that her job was not
in jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the past, Cockrel has been recognized and awarded for
enthusiasm in the classroom.&nbsp; In a 1992 magazine article,
The <i>New York Times</i> called her &quot;a dynamo [with] ...
boundless energy who's geared toward change.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harrelson, who is an ardent proponent of industrial hemp and is
part owner of a California company that specializes in hemp-based
clothing, was in town to speak at an international conference on
industrial hemp in Lexington.&nbsp; He was arrested in Kentucky
two days after speaking to Cockrel's class for planting four
seeds of industrial hemp in an orchestrated protest to bring attention
to the differences between hemp and marijuana. <br>

controversy on July 10, 1996.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>High Court Strikes Down Pennsylvania Rulings<br>
Requiring 'Exigent Circumstances' To Justify Warrantless Searches
Of Automobiles</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that has drawn criticism from civil libertarians, the
United States Supreme Court has ruled in a <i>Per Curiam</i>
decision that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was incorrect in
requiring police to obtain a warrant before searching an automobile
unless &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; were present. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In two separate cases, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suppressed
evidence uncovered in warrantless automotive searches because the
&quot;Commonwealth's jurisprudence of the automobile exception
has long required both the existence of probable cause and the
presence of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless
search.&quot;&nbsp; The court maintained that the police had
sufficient time in both cases to secure a warrant.&nbsp;
Therefore, they held that, &quot;The warrantless search of [a] stationary
vehicle violated constitutional guarantees.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The United States Supreme Court concluded that Pennsylvania's
interpretation of the &quot;automobile exception of the Fourth
Amendment's warrant requirement&quot; was incorrect.&nbsp; The
court maintains that an automobile's &quot;ready mobility&quot;
is a sufficient circumstance to excuse failure to obtain a search
warrant once probable cause has been established.&nbsp; In
addition, &quot;the individual [has a] reduced expectation of
privacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasive
regulation.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the court affirmed that,
&quot;If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to
believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits
police to search a vehicle without more.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Essentially, the court has stripped Pennsylvanians of their
state constitutional guarantees that provide local citizens with
greater protections against warrantless searches of their
automobiles unless both probable cause and unforeseen
circumstances are present,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;In it's never-ending fight to
assist in the 'War on Drugs,' the Supreme Court has trampled over
civil liberties mandated by Pennsylvania's own state
constitution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Ginsburg dissented on the
basis that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the two
cases.&nbsp; &quot;A fair reading of [both cases] demonstrates
that the [Pennsylvania Supreme Court's] judgement almost
certainly rested upon [an] ... independent consideration of its
own Constitution,&quot; Stevens wrote.&nbsp; Consequently,
&quot;there is no reason for this court to disturb the state
court's findings.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>The cases are cited as Pennsylvania v. Edwin Labron and
Pennsylvania v Randy Lee Kilgore.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Washington Activists Gear Up For November
Election</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Seattle WA:</b>&nbsp; Organizers of
the annual Seattle HempFest -- one of the largest marijuana law
reform rallies in the country -- have announced plans to embark
on a mission to transform the Washington state hemp movement into

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling themselves the Washington Citizens for Hemp Reform,
activists will soon begin polling candidates in all 49 Washington

entitled the <i>Washington State Hemp Voters Guide</i>. The guide
will appear on both the Internet and in hard copy form. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Seattle-based organization also announced that it will embark
on a comprehensive voter registration drive and will launch an
educational campaign to directly inform Washington state voters
of the harm marijuana prohibition causes both society and the
environment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The debate is over,&quot; said spokeswoman Vivian
McPeak.&nbsp; &quot;It is time for state lawmakers to lead the

<p align="center"><b>License Suspension In Drug Cases Upheld By
Ohio Supreme Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp; Ohio's
highest court upheld legislation that imposes a mandatory license
suspension against individuals convicted of drug crimes,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a unanimous opinion, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that the
penalty did not violate the due process or equal protection
amendments of the Ohio or United States constitutions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Francis Sweeney
declared: &quot;All drug offenders are treated equally under
these statutes.&nbsp; The laws simply impose a penalty on persons
who have been convicted of a drug crime.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... These laws serve to punish drug offenders, to deter the
future use of drugs, and to protect the health and welfare of
society.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The opinion upheld the 2nd District Ohio Court of Appeals in 33
cases which were consolidated after a lower court refused to
suspend licenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Laws passed by virtue of police power will be upheld if
they bear a real and substantial relation to the objective sought
to be obtained, namely the health, safety, morals or general
welfare of the public, and are not arbitrary, discriminatory,
capricious or unreasonable,&quot; the court summarized. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court did not address the question of whether the suspension
constituted &quot;double jeopardy&quot; because it was a second
punishment for a single criminal action.&nbsp; Earlier this year,
the Iowa Supreme Court struck down similar license suspension
legislation because it found &quot;no direct connection between
the possession of controlled substances, driving, and public
safety.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the court ruled that, &quot;The
amended statute authorizing ... license revocation was aimed essentially
at enhancing punishment for controlled substance
possession.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b> Calling
it &quot;one of the most promising crops in half a century,&quot;
a recent issue of Farm Bureau News sings the praises of the hemp
plant.&nbsp; The publication is the weekly newspaper of the
American Farm Bureau Federation -- the largest farming organization
in the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Written by Debora Hood, the article declares that,
&quot;Legislation is needed to establish a recognized research
area for [hemp,] according to local, state and federal
regulations.&quot;&nbsp; It explores the potential economic
viability domestic hemp cultivation holds for the American
farmers and criticizes the Drug Enforcement Administration's role
in killing a Colorado bill that would have allowed the state to
grow test plots for research purposes.&nbsp; The essay also
recounts hemp's long and prosperous history as an agricultural
commodity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also included is an editorial by Bob Winter, president of the
Weld County Farm Bureau in Colorado.&nbsp; Winter worked closely
with hemp activists earlier this year and offered five acres of
his land for the proposed state test plot.&nbsp; &quot;Industrial
hemp provides a window of opportunity for U.S. agricultural
producers to take advantage of a highly profitable fiber crop
[with] many uses ...,&quot; he writes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;International trade agreements (e.g., GATT and NAFTA)
recognize the designation of 0.3 percent ... THC as the
distinction between industrial hemp and marijuana.&nbsp; [Yet,]
current U.S. law[s] do not differentiate between hemp and
marijuana.&nbsp; Thanks to these laws, the United States lags behind
other world powers in hemp production and must import raw hemp
pulp for manufacture here.&nbsp; [In addition,] U.S. farmers are
prohibited from growing a highly profitable crop without government
subsidy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The American Farm Bureau Federation passed a resolution at its
annual convention in January calling for research into the
viability of economic potential of industrial hemp production in

Medical Marijuana Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; A
bill currently in Congress that would amend the federal law to
allow a physician to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for seriously ill patients has gained another co-sponsor, Rep.
Julian Dixon (D-Calif.).&nbsp; Unfortunately, proponents recently
lost the backing of Rep. Louise Slaughter who withdrew her
support for the measure on June 18.&nbsp; The total number of
co-sponsors remains seventeen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Presently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by a
number of scientific and medical associations including the
American Public Health Association, the Federation of American Scientists,
the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services and
Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Nurses
Society on Addiction. <br>

Drafted By NORML Board Member <br>
'Harm Reduction' Placed On Back Burner For Now</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; A
report drafted by <b>NORML</b> board member and New York Medical
School Professor John P. Morgan, M.D. for the American Medical
Association has been put on hold after objections were raised by
several prominent medical groups regarding the paper's
content.&nbsp; Specifically, certain doctors were uncomfortable
with Morgan's recommendations that marijuana be legalized and
that &quot;use, possession and low- level sales of all
psycho-active drugs should be a subject of police action only
when these activities are associated with a disruption of public
order.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dr. John Ambre, director of the AMA's Office of Medical
Information Services, told reporters that he recruited Morgan to
draft a report for the AMA, but would not divulge any information regarding
the paper's contents or prospects. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Morgan said that he was contacted by the AMA's House of Delegates
requesting a report on the subject of &quot;harm reduction&quot;
-- a policy commonly defined as helping drug users minimize the dangers
to themselves without mandating that they stop using drugs.&nbsp;
&quot;It struck most of us that the biggest harm reduction we
could see would be to stop putting people in jail [for drug
use,]&quot; Morgan explained.&nbsp; Morgan was assisted by fellow <b>NORML</b>
board member Lynn Zimmer, Ph.D. of Queens College in New York,
and Ethan Nadelmann, Ph.D. of the Lindesmith Center. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although Morgan maintains that the reaction within the AMA to his
proposals was largely favorable, the issue of harm reduction was
absent from the association's agenda during it's annual meeting

expected a revised version of the report to be submitted at the

<p align="center"><b>Canadian Marijuana Reform Debate Yields Few
Results</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Ottawa, Canada:</b>&nbsp;
Ongoing debates regarding the possibility of marijuana decriminalization
in Canada yielded few tangible results as the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended no
significant changes be made to the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act (bill C-8).&nbsp; This legislation is intended to
replace the Narcotic Control Act and, according to many Canadian
activists, will greatly expand the reach of Canada's illicit drug
laws.&nbsp; Bill C-8 will become law when an Order in Council is
passed later this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Senate Committee's recommendation shocked many who noted that
several of its members had publicly stated that they supported
the decriminalization of marijuana.&nbsp; In attempt to explain
the Senate's last minute flip-flop, Committee Chair Senator
Sharon Carstairs told the <i>Montreal Gazette</i> that the
committee members were serious about decriminalization, but felt
that such a recommendation would be politically futile at this
point.&nbsp; &quot;The majority of the Senators -- and I was with
them -- felt all the evidence indicated decriminalization for
simple possession [of marijuana] is the way we should be
going,&quot; she reaffirmed.&nbsp; However, Carstairs said that
many committee members believed such a proposal would violate
several international treaties that Canada has signed and would
have been struck down by the House of Commons. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If there is to be any relief for the cannabis community after the
latest round of political debate, it may come by way of an
approved amendment by Liberal Senator Lorna Milne that exempts &quot;mature
hemp stock&quot; from the definition of marijuana.&nbsp; Although
hemp industry proponents note that the passage of the amendment
does little to open the door to allow for the widespread cultivation
of hemp for commercial purposes, it does remove some of the
regulatory restraints (e.g., licensing) that are currently in
place regarding hemp fiber and products.&nbsp; &quot;For Canada
to develop hemp as an agricultural crop, the mature hemp stalk
and the valuable fibre (sic) acquired from it must be free from
over-regulation,&quot; Milne explained.&nbsp; &quot;Without the
amendment, the stalks, fibre (sic) and fibre (sic) products
derived from them such as paper, would continue to be treated as though
they were narcotic substances, simply due to the definition of
the bill.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A staff member for Senator Milne informed <b>NORML</b> that he
believes the Canadian government intends to draft a proposal to
allow farmers to grow hemp for commercial purposes, but many
Canadian activists feel that such legislation is still a long way
off.&nbsp; Currently, tests plots of industrial hemp are grown in
Canada under strict regulation for research purposes. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Upholds Civil Forfeiture In
Drug Cases</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
United States Supreme Court ruled that the government may both
prosecute individuals on drug charges for criminal violations and
seize their property without violating constitutional protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the decision for the court, Justice William Rehnquist
wrote that, &quot;We hold that these ... civil forfeitures are
neither punishment nor criminal for the purposes of double
jeopardy.&quot;&nbsp; Rather, Rehnquist defined forfeitures as
remedial civil sanctions.&nbsp; Ironically, the high court has
ruled in earlier cases that fines and tax stamps on illicit drugs
may, in some circumstances, constitute punishment under the law
and are applicable to double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court further maintained that Congress had intended
forfeiture to be a civil act and noted that, &quot;Requiring the
forfeiture of property ... ensures that [owners] will not permit
that property to be used for illegal purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The
opinion added that the court has a long history of upholding forfeiture
as constitutional, although many of the cases cited involved
either contraband (e.g., unlicensed firearms, pirated goods,
etc.) or property that was integrally involved in the commission of
a crime.&nbsp; This latter point led lone dissenting Justice John
Paul Stevens to write, &quot;There is simply no rational basis
for characterizing the seizure of [a] ... home as anything other
than punishment for [a] crime.&nbsp; The house was neither
proceeds nor contraband and its value had no relation to the government's
authority to seize it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;During oral arguments [during which I was present,] several
justices found the government's argument intellectually
incoherent,&quot; explained <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee Member
Jeffrey Steinborn.&nbsp; &quot;In the opinion, they accept the
government's theory.&nbsp; [Therefore,] we can expect the Supreme
Court to continue to indulge the government and we can expect the
government to indulge in runaway forfeiture.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to government statistics, the Justice Department
collected nearly $550 million in assets from civil forfeiture in
1994.&nbsp; Approximately $235 million went directly to state and
local law enforcement agencies. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Government Unveils New Plan To
Target Drug Use Among Adolescents</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in cooperation
with the National Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), unveiled a
new campaign to warn adolescents of the dangers of tobacco,
alcohol, and illicit drugs.&nbsp; Entitled &quot;Reality
Check,&quot; the campaign is being launched primarily in response
to recent evidence of rising teen marijuana use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Today, too many teenagers think marijuana won't harm their
health or ruin their lives,&quot; HHS Secretary Donna Shalala
told the crowd at the 100th Annual National PTA Convention in Washington,
D.C.&nbsp; &quot;We want to help [parents] send a clear message
to their children that drugs are illegal, dangerous and
wrong.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the focus of the campaign are two publications that explain to
parents the best way to speak with their children about illicit
substances and encourage them to remain drug free. One section of the
booklet <i>Keeping Youth Drug Free</i> even advises parents how
to answer questions from their children regarding their past use
of marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Many people my age ... tried marijuana,
... but we didn't know as much about it as we do now,&quot; the
pamphlet recommends parents explain.&nbsp; &quot;I tried it [a]
couple times because friends of mine were doing it.&nbsp; And
then I stopped because I decided it just wasn't a good thing to
do.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;As long as the federal government continues to lump the
alleged dangers of marijuana alongside the harm caused by other
illicit drugs such as crack and heroin, any campaign hoping to 'educate'
children about the risks of using marijuana will be only
minimally effective,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> maintains that cannabis
consumption should be limited to adults only. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California High Court Rules<br>
That Judges Are Not Mandated To Impose 'Three Strikes' Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 20, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp; In
a ruling that may affect an estimated 16,000 inmates, the
California Supreme Court decided that judges are not required to
impose mandatory prison sentences of 25 years to life on repeat
offenders if they feel such a sentence is overly cruel.&nbsp; The unanimous
decision, which has drawn praise from many civil libertarians and
harsh criticism from Governor Pete Wilson, is retroactive and
could potentially reduce the sentences of individuals who were
given stiffer prison terms under the 1994 &quot;three
strikes&quot; law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The mindless and inexorable demand for a life sentence for
minor offenses has become a bit more mindful,&quot; said Vincent
Schiraldi, executive director of the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Because this decision was unanimous and from a conservative
court, other courts [across the nation] may look to this opinion
as challenges arise to their own laws,&quot; added Eric Sterling
of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court's decision stemmed from a San Diego case in which a
repeat offender was charged with possessing a small amount of
cocaine.&nbsp; Feeling that the mandatory sentence was an unfit punishment
for the crime, the judge moved to strike the defendant's previous
convictions so he could plea bargain.&nbsp; The prosecutor in the
case objected, maintaining that under the &quot;three
strikes&quot; legislation, the judge lacked the right. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ruling maintained that denying judges their traditional
discretion over sentencing violates the separation of powers
guaranteed in the state Constitution.&nbsp; The court asserted
that their decision did not spell the end of &quot;three
strikes&quot; law, but merely returned the customary power of
judicial discretion back to the judges. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following the court's decision, Gov. Wilson -- an ardent
proponent of mandatory sentencing -- pledged to find a way to
bypass the court's ruling with either a referendum or by
introducing similar legislation.&nbsp; However, legal scholars
believe that the court will strike these measures down as well. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Those who repeatedly assault our citizens ... must pay a
sever price for their crimes,&quot; Wilson said.&nbsp; &quot;I
intend to keep faith with the people of California who have every
right to demand protection against career criminals and
predators.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Florida To Adopt Standards Regarding Hair
Testing</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1996, Tallahassee, FL:</b>&nbsp; A bill
(SB 518) amending drug testing laws to specifically establish
standards and procedures regarding the use of hair specimens in
drug testing has become law in Florida.&nbsp; The measure passed
without the governor's signature and makes Florida the first state
in the nation to explicitly address and endorse the use of hair
samples to test for illegal drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proponents of the measure argue that the testing procedure offers
significant advantages over urinalysis.&nbsp; Specifically,
backers of the procedure maintain that hair testing gives
employers a longer window of detection -- commonly allowing
employers to determine drug use that took place several months
earlier.&nbsp; Proponents also maintain that hair tests are much
more difficult to beat than is urinalysis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, critics of the use of hair specimens in drug testing
assert that the procedure has major flaws.&nbsp; For one, recent
studies indicate that the hair of African-American males may
collect nearly eight times as much drugs as either female
African-Americans or Caucasians.&nbsp; These findings indicate
the potential for racial and sexual bias in hair testing, critics
warn.&nbsp; In addition, hair testing remains a new technology
that many feel is still in need of further scientific evaluation.
&quot;Hair analysis for the presence of drugs is unproven [and]
unsupported by scientific literature or controlled trials,&quot; said
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spokeswoman Sharon Snider in a
1995 Providence Journal interview. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the procedures recent recognition in Florida, hair
testing on a national basis has yet to receive the same level of
technical and legal acceptance that has been accorded to
urinalysis drug testing and many courts will not accept the
findings of hair testing alone as a positive indication of drug
use. <br>

Denies Assertion Of California<br>
Narcotics Officers</b></font><b><br>
Researcher Calls Claim Of Over 10,000 Studies Documenting The
Harmful Effects Of Marijuana Groundless</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, University of Mississippi:</b>&nbsp;
A recent claim made by The California Narcotics Officers
Association (CNOA) that there are over 10,000 studies documenting
the harmfulness of marijuana has been flatly denied by University
of Mississippi Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.&nbsp;
For the past 25 years, the Research Institute of Pharmaceutical
Sciences has been collecting national and international technical
research papers on marijuana.&nbsp; The organization is regarded
as the most comprehensive federal source of such information
available. The CNOA allegation recently appeared in a position
paper denouncing the use of marijuana as a medicine and has been
espoused by various other prohibitionist organizations.&nbsp;
However, in response to an inquiry by Harvard Professor and NORML
board member Lester Grinspoon, M.D., Research Associate Beverly
Urbanek said that the University of Mississippi &quot;is totally
in the dark as to where the statement that there are 10,000
studies showing the negative impact of marijuana could have originated.&quot;&nbsp;
Urbanek attests that the Research Institute does possess a
bibliography which includes over 12,000 citations to marijuana,
but notes that the total number also includes &quot;papers on the chemistry
and botany of the Cannabis plant, cultivation, epidemiological
surveys, legal aspects, eradication studies, detection, storage,
economic aspects and a whole spectrum of others that do not
mention positive or negative effects.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In conclusion, Urbanek states the following: &quot;We are
frequently contacted by various individuals and groups requesting
the current number of publications that we have listed in the
marijuana bibliography, and we readily give out that
information.&nbsp; ... However, we have never broken down that
figure into positive/negative papers, and I would not even
venture a guess as to what that number would be.&quot; <br>

Steve Morealle says his current duty is &quot;...to travel the country
to stop proposed state-level medical marijuana

agent who fell under fire last winter from civil rights
proponents for his participation in a rally held outside the

the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, Hempilation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Morealle's self-proclaimed job description,
Mass/Cann President Bill Downing sent letters to Massachusetts
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, the Massachusetts ACLU, and Congressman
Barney Frank addressing the potential improper use of federal
money and authority.&nbsp; Frank has previously engaged in
correspondence with United States Attorney General Janet Reno and
DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine over Morealle's actions
during the Hempilation protest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the DEA is using America's tax dollars to

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Morealle also stated that he is employed to appear at public

<p align="center"><b>Conference Gathers Experts To Explore
Marijuana's Medicinal Value</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 16, 1996, Dennis, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
Scientists and medical experts from around the world recently
gathered at a conference to learn more about marijuana's various
medicinal properties.&nbsp; It is the belief of the attendees
that chemical compounds found in marijuana promise to ease the
symptoms of glaucoma, the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS,
spastic disorders, the nausea associated with cancer
chemotherapy, arthritis -- and most dramatically -- severe brain injury.&nbsp;
While both <b>NORML</b> and a variety of scientific researchers
have endorsed cannabis' therapeutic properties for several years,
the possibility that marijuana may have medical utility in the treatment
of head trauma is a relatively new concept. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Esther Shohami, a senior lecturer in the department of
pharmacology at Hebrew University in Israel, stated that animal
and other tests of a synthetic compound called Dexanabinol seem
to reduce the impact of brain trauma, such as that suffered in
car accidents.&nbsp; Shohami said that less paralysis and memory
damage occurs if patients are administered the cannabinoid
compound.&nbsp; The patient's improvement is &quot;not
marginal.&nbsp; It's significant,&quot; she asserted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Conference speakers also addressed the effectiveness of Marinol
-- a THC-based synthetic drug occasionally prescribed for easing
nausea in cancer patients. Many researchers noted that whole
cannabis could be more effective than Marinol because there

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Qualifies For
November Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California's Medical Marijuana Initiative has qualified for the November
general election.&nbsp; The Secretary of State's office in
Sacramento certified the initiative measure which will allow
California voters the opportunity to legalize marijuana for
medical use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative, which gathered 775,000 signatures to qualify for
ballot access, provides that &quot;patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from general
provisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession or
cultivation of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It also provides that
&quot;physicians shall not be punished or denied any right or
privilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This measure will not legalize or otherwise change existing law
against use, sale, or possession of marijuana for recreational
use, proponents note.&nbsp; It will prevent the criminal
prosecution of those patients who have a legitimate medical need
to use marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although more research is needed, it is clear from both available
studies and rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that
marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patients
with a number of serious ailments including cancer, spastic
disorders, glaucoma, and the appetite loss associated with the
wasting syndrome of AIDS. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This proposition would not have been necessary if Gov.
[Pete] Wilson had not vetoed S.B. 1364 in 1994 and A.B. 1529 in
1995,&quot; said longtime marijuana activist Dennis Peron,
referring to two prior medical marijuana bills that were passed
by the California legislature.&nbsp; &quot;This whole issue is
more about compassion than marijuana.&nbsp; I think it's time to
let doctor's decide, not politicians.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Victorian Politicians Reject Marijuana
Decriminalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, Victoria, Australia:</b>&nbsp;
Victorian politicians failed to endorse one of the chief recommendations
of Professor David Pennington -- head of Premiere Jeff Kennett's
advisory council on drug reform -- who concluded that the
decriminalization of marijuana for cultivation and personal use
would be an effective step in steering individuals away from hard
drugs.&nbsp; Just prior to the Kennett Government's decision,
Pennington had warned Parliament that the implementation of the
council's findings without marijuana decriminalization would be
&quot;very much a second-best answer.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The government firmly believes that before the
decriminalization of marijuana is considered further, a better
coordinated, better resources, more innovative and carefully
focused education, treatment, and law enforcement strategy should
be given a chance to work,&quot; stated a press release from the
Victorian Cabinet. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The Premier's 'firm belief' ... is laughable,&quot;
responded Jamnes Danenberg of HEMP SA, spokesman for a leading
Australian cannabis law reform lobby group.&nbsp; &quot;Just how
many more people need to be convicted [under prohibition] before
the right signal is sent?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For months Victorian politicians had been debating over whether
to implement many of the 72 major drug reforms suggested by the
Drug Advisory Council report, the most controversial being marijuana
decriminalization.&nbsp; In all, the Kennett government approved
a majority of the report's policies, including shifting the state
anti-drug focus to education rather than enforcement, but rejected
taking any steps toward decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The
government did conclude, however, that it &quot;will review
penalties applying to the use and possession of drugs of
dependence to ensure that users are treated as having a health
problem first and as criminal offenders second and that
treatment, rather than punishment, is the priority.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the subject of marijuana decriminalization is
a serious topic of debate among Australian politicians is a
positive note for drug-reform advocates everywhere,&quot; noted
NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;On the other
hand, it indicates just how far behind the United States is
lagging compared to other western nations when it comes to
addressing the issue of alternative drug policies.&nbsp;
Certainly, our own politicians would be well advised to heed the recommendations
the Pennington Report.&quot; <br>

Decision<br>
To Spray Marijuana With Pesticides</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 11, 1996, Tulsa, OK:</b>&nbsp; Oklahoma
narcotics officers and area environmentalists are clashing over
the state's decision to begin spraying pesticides on wild
marijuana plants in five counties.&nbsp; Authorities argue that
the spraying will deter people from cultivating, selling, and
smoking marijuana, but environmentalists are concerned that the
chemicals could pose potential heath hazards to both the
environment and the population. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Approximately 15 to 30 narcotics agents will begin spraying
uncultivated marijuana plants with glyphosate, a chemical weed
killer commonly marketed under the brand name
&quot;Round-Up.&quot;&nbsp; State officials claim that spraying
is the most effective way to eradicate uncultivated marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The herbicide has been tested, found to be safe and has a
very low toxicity to wildlife,&quot; said Oklahoma Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs spokesman Mark Woodward to the
Tulsa World News.&nbsp; To enforce his position, Woodward noted a
1986 U.S. Department of Justice study that showed an individual
could smoke 139 marijuana cigarettes treated with glyphosate a
day and still be under the safe level in regard to the
chemical.&nbsp; However, some area environmental activists are
not convinced. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our bio-diversity;
this can wreak damage on our wildflower population,&quot;
contested Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw Institute Inc., a
state organization that works to strengthen environmental
laws.&nbsp; Berry also cited a Journal of Pesticide Reform report
from last year that claimed glyphosate exposure was the third
most commonly reported of pesticide illness among agricultural
workers in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Maybe the state should get into the dandelion eradication
business, if it's busy work they want,&quot; Berry suggested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This will mark the third year the bureau has sprayed uncultivated
marijuana crops. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Rules On Traffic Stops</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 11, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Minor traffic stops can be used as justification for detaining
motorists and searching their vehicles for drugs, ruled the
Supreme Court in an unanimous decision.&nbsp; Critics argue that
the ruling will encourage police to use phony pretexts to invade
the privacy of motorists -- particularly minorities -- while
proponents maintain that it provides law enforcement with an
additional weapon to combat illicit drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is an opinion that essentially allows police to do an
end run around the Fourth Amendment,&quot; said Steven R. Shapiro
of the American Civil Liberties Union.&nbsp; He warned that the judgment
will most likely subject motorists to arbitrary stops. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The Supreme Court has announced to the world, 'We don't
care what the method is, so long as the search can be justified
in hindsight,'&quot; agreed Natman Schaye, a Tucson Arizona
lawyer who filed an amicus brief for the defendants on behalf of
the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Officers are still bound by the same rules that they were
bound by yesterday,&quot; countered Jim Pasco, executive director
of the Fraternal Order of Police, who applauded the
decision.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's an affirmation of the manner
in which good and innovative police officers are already
conducting themselves.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Anton Scalia affirmed
that ulterior motives do not strip officers of their
justification for a stop as long as a traffic violation has
occurred.&nbsp; &quot;For the run of the mine case, ... [the
Court] think[s] there is no alternative to the traditional common
law rule that probable cause justifies a search and
seizure.&quot;&nbsp; The case is <i>Whren v. United States</i>.</p>

Harrelson Hopes To Challenge Federal Law By Act Of Civil
Disobedience</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1, 1996, Lexington, KY:</b>&nbsp; Hemp
activist and noted Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson was arrested
and charged with cultivation of fewer than five marijuana plants
after he brazenly planted four seeds of industrial hemp in full
view of Lee County Sheriff William Kilburn.&nbsp; The planting
and subsequent arrest are part of an orchestrated protest by
Harrelson to challenge the continued prohibition of industrial
hemp.&nbsp; Harrelson expects to be found guilty of the
misdemeanor charge and intends to appeal because current law
makes no distinction between marijuana and industrial hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The [law prohibiting hemp cultivation] is overly
broad,&quot; explained Burl McCoy, a Lexington attorney who was
on hand to represent the actor.&nbsp; &quot;There is no rational
basis for the statute.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a June 5 press release, the famed actor of both television and
film explained his actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am not one to go out of my way to get arrested.&nbsp; But
in this case, I thought it was important for me to take that step
in order to demonstrate the difference between industrial hemp
and marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Industrial hemp, like the four certified seeds I planted,
was first grown in Kentucky two hundred and fifty years
ago.&nbsp; It is currently grown in other countries across the
globe, including France, England, Canada, Australia, China,
Hungary, and the Ukraine.&nbsp; Industrial hemp has very little
THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. [Therefore,] it
cannot be used as a drug.&nbsp; None of the countries that allow
industrial hemp production have experienced any problems relating
to the crop. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Industrial hemp is very clean and easy to grow.&nbsp; It is
one of the most environmentally sound sources of industrial fiber
in the world.&nbsp; ... Environmentally friendly detergents,
plastics, paints, varnishes, cosmetics, and textiles are already
being made from it in Europe.&nbsp; ... Industrial hemp can meet
our fiber needs while also revitalizing our struggling rural
economies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Congress never intended to make legitimate industrial hemp
farming the same as marijuana cultivation.&nbsp; I planted
industrial hemp and got arrested because someone must highlight
this difference and in order to truly know the law, one must test
the law.&nbsp; I think it is time for all of us to make a stand
... for environmentally friendly, rural economic
development.&nbsp; If the people lead the leaders will
follow.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harrelson, who is part owner of The Hempstead Company -- one of

<p align="center"><b>Majority Of Police Chiefs Admit That War On
Drugs Is Unsuccessful</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Sixty
percent of police chiefs nationwide admit that police and other
law enforcement agencies have been unsuccessful in reducing the
drug problem in the United States and an overwhelming majority
(85 percent) call for major changes in the way America deals with
drug use, according to a joint study conducted by the Police
Foundation and Drug Strategies -- a Washington D.C. based
organization that advocates a more balanced approach to fighting
drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Police Chiefs want to see a balanced approach,&quot; Police
Foundation President Hubert Williams recently told the <i>Law
Enforcement News</i> in response to the report.&nbsp; &quot;They
recognize that a narrow strategy directed down a single corridor
will not work.&quot;&nbsp; More than 300 police chiefs from around
the country participated in the study. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The report's key findings are as follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Only 15 percent of the police chiefs polled say punishment
would be more effective than education, interdiction, or
treatment in controlling drug problems; only 10 percent of chiefs
who have served in a narcotics division choose punishment over
the other options. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Nearly three-fourths say that mandatory minimum sentences for
drug possession have been only somewhat effective or not really
the answer to drug trafficking in their communities; only 21 percent
say mandatory sentences have been very or fairly effective. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Only 28 percent regard low conviction rates, either for dealers
or users, as key limitations in their ability to deal with drugs
in their communities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* By two to one, police chiefs say that putting drug users in
court-supervised treatment programs (59 percent) is more
effective than prison or jail time (28 percent). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Only three percent believe that current efforts by law
enforcement have been very successful in reducing the drug
problem in the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The findings of the Police Foundation and Drug Strategies
demonstrate that the majority of our nation's police chiefs who
are on the front lines of the 'War on Drugs' do not favor the
'get-tough' approaches against drug users that are so often
heralded by our political leaders and supported by the American
public,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

Copperhill Mayor Janelle Kimsey admits that she grew marijuana,
but argues that she was unaware that growing marijuana for

rural-town mayor was recently found growing ten marijuana plants
on her porch and may be indicted on charges of marijuana

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There may be a perfectly good explanation for this, but at

[marijuana] looked like,&quot; said the mayor, adding that she
planned to take the full grown plants to the police department to
be used as a display.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't know it was illegal to
grow it for educational purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kimsey also maintains that she intended to use the plants to
train the city's drug sniffing dog to sniff out cannabis.&nbsp;
When asked why she was growing so many plants, the mayor
responded that she thought several plants were needed so that she
could choose the best quality. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I know ignorance is no excuse, but in my case, it was
ignorance,&quot; she remarked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although Kimsey has not been arrested, her case will be taken

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Reform Debate In Full Force In
Canadian Federal Government</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Ottawa, Canada:</b>&nbsp; Debate
over Canada's federal policies regarding both the widespread
cultivation of industrial hemp and the legalization of small
amounts of marijuana for recreational use are currently in full
swing in the Canadian Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hearings have been ongoing regarding the future of proposed
government bill C-8, a measure currently before the Senate that
will effectively replace the Narcotic Control Act with the Controlled
Substances and Abuse Act.&nbsp; Currently, the measure retains
the existing penalties for marijuana: a potential $1,000 fine or
six months in jail.&nbsp; However, a growing group of vocal senators
from both major parties feel that the time for decriminalization
of marijuana has come and the federal law must reflect that. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am in favor of decriminalizing marijuana,&quot; said
Liberal Senator Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, one of five senators who
sit on the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee
who have publicly endorsed decriminalization.&nbsp; &quot;We must
look at this very seriously.&nbsp; The approach we have now is
criminal, it's punitive.&nbsp; Maybe it's a health approach we
should be taking a serious look at.&nbsp; The punitive approach
has not worked and the problem is still there.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Cannabis is much less lethal than cigarettes and
alcohol,&quot; added Quebec Progressive Conservative Senator
Pierre-Claude Nolin.&nbsp; &quot;Are we into prohibition because
it's somewhat of a dogma that we don't question and [because]
everybody else is doing it?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Senators [are] much more interested in a harm reduction
model of drug control in this country than they [are] in a
punishment model,&quot; confirmed Liberal Senator Sharon
Carstairs, Chairwoman for the senate committee.&nbsp; &quot;That
is where almost all of the senators are coming from.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to the growing movement regarding the use of
recreational marijuana, support for policies legalizing the
widescale growing of industrial hemp is also gathering
support.&nbsp; According to a staff-member for Liberal Senator
Lorna Milne, the senator will soon be introducing an amendment to
C-8 that will make it legal to cultivate hemp by adding
&quot;mature hemp stock&quot; to a list of approved
substances.&nbsp; The staffer reports that Milne's office does
not anticipate &quot;any difficulty&quot; regarding the passage
of the amendment and adds that the proposal has the support of
Health Minister David Dingwall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Hemp cultivation] seems to me to be a sensible thing to
do,&quot; Milne said recently. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill C-8 is currently undergoing it's second committee review in
the Senate and the overall bill is expected to be amended and
returned to the House of Commons.&nbsp; Sources who have spoken
to <b>NORML</b> anticipate that any measures regarding hemp
cultivation should pass both the Senate and House without
complications, but warn that proposals regarding the
decriminalization of recreational marijuana will most likely be
opposed by the House. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Black Motorists Subject To Stops And
Searches On I-95 More Often Than Whites</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Perryville, MD:</b>&nbsp; Black
motorists are stopped and searched for drugs at least four times
more often than whites by a special Maryland highway drug unit
that patrols stretches of Interstate 95, according to a recent
report from the <i>Associated Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although state police spokesmen have flatly denied using racial
profiles, findings from an <em>AP</em> computer analysis of car
searches indicate that more than 75 percent of all drivers whose
cars were searched by the special drug squad through the first
nine months of 1995 were black.&nbsp; In all, the Special Traffic
Interdiction Force (STIF), whose six officers are white, searched
145 of the motorists it stopped along a 50 mile stretch of I-95
between the Delaware border and the Baltimore County line; of
these, 110 motorists were listed as black, 24 white, six
Hispanic, and five &quot;other&quot; minorities.&nbsp; Maryland
police maintain that the findings are a coincidence. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Maryland state troopers, like those in many states, are forbidden
to use racial profiles in traffic stops.&nbsp; In addition,
Maryland troopers are mandated to provide records on highway
searches to the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland under
terms of a legal settlement reached in 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to at least one attorney from the ACLU who spoke with
the <em>AP</em>, a future class-action lawsuit may be considered
if the data eventually proves a pattern of discrimination.&nbsp;
At least one private discrimination lawsuit has already been
filed against three STIF troopers. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Repeat Felony Marijuana Possession Penalties
Reduced In Missouri</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp; Thanks
in large part to the efforts of Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan
Viets, Gov. Mel Carnahan signed into law Senate Bill 830 which
significantly reduces the range of punishment for second and
third offense felony marijuana possession. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SB 830 was filed after Viets contacted Sen. Joe Moseley
(D-Columbia) late last year and alerted him that under the
Missouri prior and persistent drug offender statute, an
individual who merely possessed more than one and one quarter
ounces of marijuana on two occasions would be eligible for a
punishment ranging from 10 years to life in prison.&nbsp; One who
had committed three such offenses would be subject to 10 years to
life in prison without the possibility of probation or parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The passage of SB 830 changes the law to specify that simple
marijuana possession offenses will no longer be punishable under
the prior and persistent drug offender statute.&nbsp; Therefore,
a second offense of felony marijuana possession which formerly
had a sentencing range of 10 years to life now has a sentencing
range of zero to seven years.&nbsp; Furthermore, regardless of
how many drug offenses of any nature one has, no simple
possession offense will ever carry a punishment of more than
seven years and the defendant will remain eligible for probation
and parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Senator Moseley ... [is] one of the most effective
advocates for rational reform of the criminal laws generally with
whom I have ever had the privilege of working,&quot; stated
Viets. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Dennis Peron Leaves Cannabis Buyers Club</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 29, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Dennis Peron, founder of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club
-- the nation's largest and most overt supplier of wholesale
marijuana to the seriously ill -- has stepped down from his post
as director.&nbsp; Peron will now concentrate full-time on
passing the California Medical Marijuana Initiative which is
slated for the November ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Taking over for Peron as director of the 10,000 member club is
longtime AIDS and marijuana activist Beth Moore.&nbsp; Moore will
continue to run the club as a not-for-profit organization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I intend to run the Club with as much love as Dennis
founded it,&quot; stated Moore.&nbsp; &quot;I know medical
marijuana is saving lives.&nbsp; It is a moral imperative that
our mission continue.&nbsp; It is with heavy heart that we say
goodbye to Dennis, but we know that we must legalize [cannabis]
and Dennis has been chosen for the task. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I will continue to work for social justice and compassion
for our sick,&quot; said Peron upon his retirement from the
Club.&nbsp; &quot;The initiative is just the first step towards a
more loving and compassionate society.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>City Commission Urges Citizens To Just say
No To NORML Ballot Proposal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 20, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp; The
Traverse City Commission has unanimously passed a resolution
urging city residents to vote against an initiative put forth by
the Traverse City NORML chapter to reduce marijuana
penalties.&nbsp; The measure -- which will appear on the ballot August
6 - seeks to make possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce
of marijuana in Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of
$100 and up to ten hours of community service for a first-time
offender.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the City Commission
unanimously passed a resolution encouraging residents to not sign
the NORML petition. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Bustance, president of the Traverse City NORML chapter,
denounced the Commission's latest action and remarked that it
&quot;discounts the intelligence of the worthy citizens that
signed the petition.&quot;&nbsp; However, Bustance still remains
confident that there is ample voter support for the measure.&nbsp;
&quot;We're not asking: 'Are you for marijuana or are you against
marijuana?' or 'If you're for <b>NORML</b> or against <b>NORML</b>?'
...&nbsp; We're asking: 'Do you want to throw people in prison at
a cost of $30,000 per year or do you want to enact fines and
community service that will go directly to the community?'&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bustance challenged opposing groups to a televised debate. <br>

<p align="center">May 23, 1996</p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Representative Continues Probe Into
Potential Misuse Of Federal Power At Anti-NORML Demonstration</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Rep.
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) continues to make federal waves in
response to a December 1995 rally held outside the offices of
Boston radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD, Hempilation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Having previously written to Attorney General Janet Reno this
winter both condemning the actions of rally organizers, the
Governors Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting an inquiry into whether
federal law enforcement officials were involved, Frank is again
pressuring the Attorney General to take action.&nbsp; &quot;I'm
writing to express my severe disappointment in the response I received
[from DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine] to a letter I sent
you in December about the conduct of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in an effort by officials of the state and federal government
to put inappropriate pressure on a radio station, and to do so in
an inappropriate manner,&quot; Frank asserts.&nbsp; &quot;The
response confirmed my fear that the Drng Enforcement Administration
does not have the respect for free expression which ought to
exist in the federal government, especially the Department of
Justice, charged as it is with the protection of constitutional
rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to eye-witness accounts, the Massachusetts based
anti-drug group, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA
and local law enforcement, organized and participated in a protest
outside the offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of
the station &quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD, Hempilation.&nbsp; Witnesses note that protesters
arrived in state vehicles, attendees were encouraged to
&quot;bring their squad cars,&quot; and that an individual
identified as the Boston liaison to the DEA accompanied Georgette
Watson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D, as she entered the
station.&nbsp; This action prompted Bill Downing, president of
Mass Cann NORML, to charge that &quot;Th[is] sort of [behavior],
when performed by government agents, [is] specifically
[prohibited] by law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is one thing for government officials to express their
opinions as to what is appropriate behavior by radio
stations,&quot; writes Frank in his follow-up letter to Ms.
Reno.&nbsp; &quot;It is quite another for a law enforcement
official to arrive in these circumstances and participate in what
is clearly an effort to pressure them on the spot. ...&nbsp; We
are talking here about a situation where a law enforcement
officer - I assume armed with both a weapon and with the power of
arrest -- enters a radio station in the company of a state
official who has organized a demonstration and joins with her --
indeed at her specific request -- in trying to persuade people at
the station to stop playing certain music. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;My impression is that we do not have enough law enforcement
officials available to do actual law enforcement.&nbsp; Diverting
one of them to spend his time seeking to pressure radio stations
into changing their selections is it seems to me both a misuse of
scarce resources as well as a misuse of the authority of law
enforcement officials where people's first amendment rights are
involved.&nbsp; I therefore must ask that you promulgate policies
which prohibit law enforcement officials from engaging in this
sort of activity.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Modified Hemp Measure Becomes Law In Vermont</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 14, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; A bill
(H. 783) that could signal the first step in the establishment of
a domestic hemp industry in Vermont became law without the
signature of Gov. Howard Dean.&nbsp; However, hemp proponents
maintain that the approved measure falls short of the bill's
initial expectations and acknowledge that any chance for local
industrial hemp cultivation still remains far away. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Similar to a resolution recentiy approved in Hawaii, the revised
Vermont legislation allows for research to be conducted into the
feasibility of industrial hemp production, but removed language that
would have authorized the state university to grow test plots in
order to assess optimum soils and other growing conditions.&nbsp;
The bill is a &quot;compromise,&quot; admits Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney),
one of the chief backers of the original bill.&nbsp; Maslack
notes that Gov. Dean would have vetoed any legislation that
allowed for the growing of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a start,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;But it's also an indicator of just
how far we have to go.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the approved measure maintains that: &quot;The commission
of agriculture, food and markets and the University of Vermont
are requested to undertake research, of a minimum of two years in duration,
of industrial hemp production in the state.&nbsp; [This research]
shall include: (1) Analysis of market economic conditions
affecting the development of an industrial hemp industry in the
state of Vermont; (2) Analysis of whether Vermont soils and
growing conditions are appropriate for economic levels of
industrial hemp production; (3) Analysis of research undertaken
elsewhere in the world regarding minimum THC levels of industrial
hemp production; and (4) Analysis of possible law enforcement
aspects of industrial hemp production in Vermont.&quot; <br>

Prosecutions Recommends The State Grow Cannabis</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, South Australia, Australia:</b>&nbsp;
The Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia wants the
State government to grow and regulate the sale of cannabis,
according to statements he recently made in an exclusive
interview with the Australian publication, The Advertiser. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We never really had a chance [in trying to stop drug
use],&quot; Director Paul Rofe, QC, stated.&nbsp; &quot;We've
just got to do something drastic.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rofe maintains that criminal involvement in the cannabis trade
would be cut dramatically if the government were to either begin
growing the drug or issue licenses for its manufacture.&nbsp;
Rofe suggested implementing a regulatory system similar to those
already in place for the sale of alcohol and tobacco whereby
individuals could purchase marijuana over the counter.&nbsp; Such
a move would both eliminate illegal profits from the black-market
sale of the drug and would cut down on the &quot;underground&quot;
attraction of smoking cannabis, Rofe remarked. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp; For the
first time in its history, the Hawaii State Legislature has
passed a resolution to conduct a study on the economic potential
of growing industrial hemp as an agricultural product. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">House Resolution 71 and House Concurrent Resolution 63 describe
the study as a fact-finding and information-gathering forum that
would examine the following aspects of industrial hemp: 1) the commodity
value, 2) economic potential and other benefits, 3) comparison of
the economic potential with that of similar crops, 4) interest of
Hawaii landowners, businesses, and other parties in growing
industrial hemp, 5) federal procedures for obtaining a permit to
grow hemp, and 6) the barriers that prohibit the growing of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Thousands of acres of former sugar plantation land still
await the arrival of a viable alternative crop,&quot; stated Rep.
David Tarnas (D-6th District), a chief backer of the
measure.&nbsp; &quot;Industrial hemp should be allowed to prove
itself as a successful commodity here in Hawaii -- as it is doing
in other places around the world.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The joint Senate Committees on Agriculture, Labor, and Employment
and Ways and Means stated in their committee report that
&quot;given the State's current economic crisis, the viability of alternative
cash crops should be explored to the fullest extent
possible.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Hawaii Agribusiness Development Corporation will be
initiating the research project at the University of Hawaii,
College of Tropical Agriculture. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier this year, Rep. Tarnas introduced legislation to amend
the state law to authorize the production, possession, and
commerce of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii.&nbsp;
However, the House Agriculture Committee voted to postpone
deciding on that bill until next year. <br>

Count For Medical Marijuana Petition</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 15, 1996, Santa Monica:</b>&nbsp; A raw
count by the California Secretary of State demonstrates that a
state-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for medical use has
well over the necessary number of signatures to appear on the
November 1996 state ballot.&nbsp; Although the total number of
signatures will not be certified by the State for another six or
seven weeks, the Secretary of Sate announced that raw count
figures indicate that more than 758,000 signatures were collected
-- well over the 433,269 required to qualify the initiative for
the 1996 ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed
by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; The 1996 initiative maintains
that patients or defined caregivers who possess or cultivate
marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician are
exempt from the general provisions of law which otherwise
prohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana.&nbsp; In
addition, the initiative declares that physicians shall not be
punished or denied any right or privilege for recommending
marijuana to a patient for medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If the initiative is passed by California voters this fall, the
measure will become law immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Oregon Marijuana Initiative Approaches
Required Number Of Signatures<br>
To Be Placed On Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 9, 1996, Portland, OR:</b>&nbsp; An Oregon
state campaign to regulate the sale of marijuana to adults
appears to be well on its way toward qualifying for the November
1996 general election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Headed by local <b>NORML</b> activists and the Political Action
Committee Pay for Schools by Regulating Cannabis (PSRC), a
proposal to comprehensively reform marijuana laws in the state has
gathered in excess of 65,000 signatures -- more than three
quarters of the number needed to place the initiative on the
ballot.&nbsp; The PSRC must gather at least 73,261 registered
Oregon voters' signatures by July 5, 1996 to qualify. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Known as the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA), the PSRC proposal
would tax and regulate the sale of marijuana to adults, license
farmers to cultivate the drug for sale to the state, permit physicians
to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill
patients, and allow farmers to grow industrial hemp for fiber,
oil, and protein production. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The OCTA would authorize the sale of marijuana to take place in
state-run liquor stores where the age limit of 21 can be strictly
enforced.&nbsp; The PSRC estimates that the profits generated
from the regulated sale of marijuana could amount to $500 million
a year or 20 percent of Oregon's total state budget.&nbsp; The
OCTA would direct 65 percent of that money toward funding primary
and secondary education.&nbsp; In addition, 30 percent of the
revenue would go to state and community colleges, four percent
would go to fund drug abuse treatment programs, and the remaining
one percent would be used to implement realistic drug education
programs in the schools. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Chief Petitioner Paul Stanford, the pending Oregon
legislation is drafted to effectively stand up to the barrage of
court challenges that it will presumably face.&nbsp; The OCTA is written
in compliance with the restrictions imposed by several
international anti-drug treaties and the bill provides numerous
constitutional protections in its comprehensive preamble to
ensure that the act will be upheld in court.&nbsp; Moreover, the
OCTA even provides funding for the inevitable legal battles that
await it by collecting revenue through the issuing of cannabis
license fees, Stanford notes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Preliminary surveys indicate that the OCTA has a realistic chance
of passing.&nbsp; School funding is a very urgent issue in Oregon
and a poll conducted by the state's largest television station, KATU-TV,
showed that 55 percent of the respondents answered yes when
asked, &quot;Should marijuana be sold in liquor stores to fund
education?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The war on drugs is the issue on which the future of
freedom in America swings,&quot; stated Stanford.&nbsp;
&quot;Families and individuals are being destroyed by this
misguided civil war.&nbsp; The war on drugs is not about drugs,
it's about money and the continued centralization of economic and political
control.&nbsp; The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act is the first big step
toward a solution.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Railroad Accident Data Shows Few Benefits
From Random Drug Testing</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 13, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
examination of Federal Railroad Administration accidents
statistics demonstrates that random drug testing has had no
apparent effect on railroad accident safety, reports California
NORML.&nbsp; The FRA data shows that prior to the introduction of random
drug testing in 1990, the number of accidents due to human error
declined steadily, from 3.8 per million rail miles in 1978 to 1.4
in 1986.&nbsp; Since then, however, the accident rate has held steady
at around 1.4 to 1.8. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data calls into question the supposed safety benefits
of random drug testing,&quot; said California NORML coordinator
Dale Gieringer.&nbsp; Unlike alcohol tests, drug urinalysis tests
cannot detect actual impairment, but only whether a drug was used
in the past.&nbsp; In the case of marijuana -- the drug detected
in the overwhelming majority of positive tests -- urine tests can
register positive for days or weeks after last use, long after
the euphoric affects of the drug have faded. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Random drug testing was imposed on the nation's railway workers
in the wake of a highly publicized 1987 Amtrak-Conrail collision
in which the crew were determined to have smoked marijuana.&nbsp;
The responsibility of marijuana for the accident was never
clearly determined, however.&nbsp; An investigation by the
National Transportation Safety Board determined that better equipment
and personnel management would have prevented the accident, but
did not recommend drug testing.&nbsp; Nonetheless, Congress
promptly rushed to require drug testing for all of the nation's transportation
workers following the accident. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The effectiveness of this regulation has never been
scientifically proven,&quot; states Gieringer.&nbsp; &quot;While
proponents say that testing has reduced the number of
transportation workers testing positive for drugs, there is no
indication this has had any [significant] safety benefits.&nbsp;
Poblems include: substitution of alcohol and other untested drugs
for tested drugs such as marijuana; unreliability of tests in
discriminating drug abuse; cheating and evasion by drug abusing
workers; and lack of relation between test result and job
performance.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Critical Of Amount Of Money Spent
Fighting Drugs: Calls Record<br>
Setting FY 1997 Budget Lean</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 8, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Responding to criticism that the federal government isn't spending
enough money to fight drugs, Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey admitted
that he believed President Clinton's record high $15.1 billion
budget proposal for Fiscal Year 1997 to be &quot;a lean ... request.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Could more money be used on international and interdiction
programs?&nbsp; There is no question,&quot; McCaffrey told a
House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.&nbsp;
McCaffrey's remarks were made despite the fact that Clinton's
budget request allocates nearly $10 billion to be used in 1997
solely for law enforcement here and abroad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;How much is enough,&quot; questioned <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Twenty billion, 30
billion, when will it end?&nbsp; Despite claims that this new,
anti-drug strategy focuses on youth prevention and education, the
Office of National Drug Control Policy will spend a record high
$10 billion dollars on law enforcement -- a figure that the Drug
Czar now claims to be too little. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since 1988, federal spending on anti-drug programs has
increased more than 300 percent, yet according to government
statistics illicit drug use has remained virtually unchanged
among adults and has actually increased among adolescents.&nbsp;
We cannot continue to keep throwing money at the problem and
expect any sort of positive results.&quot; <br>

Stiffer Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 7, 1996, Springfield, IL:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that will stiffen penalties for those convicted of selling
marijuana or other illicit drugs within 1,000 feet of a place of
religious worship will take effect in 1997 under a measure signed
by Gov. Jim Edgar. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This legislation takes our efforts to take drug dealers off
the street a step further by creating another safe zone where
those dealers know they will pay an even bigger price for their
crimes,&quot; Edgar said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The measure, sponsored by Rep. John Jones (R-Mount Vernon) and
Sen. William O'Daniel (D-Mount Vernon), increases the penalty by
one level for selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a place of
religious worship.&nbsp; The legislation is similar to current
laws providing enhanced penalties for those convicted of selling
drugs on the grounds of schools, public parks, and public
housing, or within 1,000 feet of them.</p>

battle,&quot; Chief Judge Juan Torruella of the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals proposed that America seriously rethink its

prosecutions might be a first step in the right direction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At minimum, &quot;a shift has to be made in the funding for drug

said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella, who went on the federal bench in 1975 and joined the
appeals court in 1984, called for a national debate on the drug
issue.&nbsp; In addition, he said that an independent national commission
should be empaneled to analyze alternative approaches to curbing
drug use.&nbsp; Currently, any legitimate debate on the issue is
clouded by political &quot;rhetoric&quot; and anti-drug &quot;hysteria,&quot;
he claimed.&nbsp; Torruella likened this attitude to the zealotry
exhibited by anti-communists during the McCarthy era. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella was also critical of the ways in which he felt drug

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; Three more
members of Congress, including one Republican and the House's
only Independent, have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R.
2618) that would permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a
therapeutic agent for seriously ill patients.&nbsp; With the addition
of the recent signees, U.S. Reps. Bernard Sanders (I-VT), George
Brown (D-Calif.), and Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), the total number
of co-sponsors now stands at sixteen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Slowly but surely, more and more members of Congress are
coming forward to show their support for medical marijuana
legislation,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.

support and prompt federal action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The inclusion of Bilbray brings the total number of Republican
co-sponsors to three.&nbsp; Republican support of this
legislation is critical if the bill is to move forward in a

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, H.R. 2618 is simultaneously pending before two
subcommittees: the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on
Crime and the House Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Health

himself -- to hold additional hearings regarding medical
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy

Plans for a widescale planting of industrial hemp on American
Indian soil have met opposition from federal officials who argue
that any planting or harvesting of hemp would violate federal
law.&nbsp; Presently, Navajo Nation President Albert Hale is awaiting
a legal opinion from the tribe's Justice Department before going
forward with the project.&nbsp; This past March, a ceremonial
planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition for Hemp Awareness
(CHA) took place on Native American soil following the unanimous
passage of a resolution by the Nation to allow for hemp
cultivation to occur on sovereign soil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species (<i>Cannabis
sativa</i>) that produces marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana,
however, industrial hemp contains only minute traces of THC, the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medicinal and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Regardless, DEA spokeswoman Dana
Seeley still maintains that federal laws forbidding the
cultivation of marijuana also apply to hemp.&nbsp; &quot;We are
hopeful that they will not [go forward with their plans],&quot;
she said.&nbsp; Seeley noted that the DEA will continue to
monitor the situation closely and may take action if any
large-scale test plots of hemp are planted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After decades of unemployment, leaders of the Navajo Nation feel
that hemp cultivation will invigorate the local economy.&nbsp;
The Navajo Nation Hemp Project &quot;is formulated to provide [a] bio-regional
local industry that will create jobs and enhance the agricultural
base,&quot; stated CHA spokeswoman Christie Bohling.&nbsp;
&quot;With the many attributes and by-products of this natural renewable
resource, the Navajo Nation will become self-sufficient in [its]
ability to provide many of its own necessities.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 29, 1996, Cora Gables, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Amidst a wave of media fanfare, President Clinton and Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey unveiled a new 10-year anti-drug strategy this
past Monday in Miami.&nbsp; The program asks for a record high
$15.1 billion budget to initiate a &quot;decade-long commitment&quot;
to reduce drug use in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both the President and the Drug Czar emphasized that the
new strategy is chiefly focused on &quot;motivat[ing] America's
youth to reject illegal drugs and substance abuse,&quot; a comprehensive
breakdown of the 1997 budget request illustrates that the plan's
largest component remains domestic law enforcement.&nbsp;
According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP),

anti-drug strategy is essentially the same as those of previous

McCaffrey added that he sees the new approach as a
&quot;permanent commitment to young people&quot; and was
optimistic that &quot;there is no reason why we can't return
America to a ... pre-Vietnam era level of drug use.&quot;&nbsp;
When asked by the moderator what he felt about the idea of legalization,
McCaffrey called the notion &quot;nonsense.&quot; <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot has been a rocky one for marijuana

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Heads For
California Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 23, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a state-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for
medical use report that they have collected over 750,000
signatures, well over the number necessary to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Supporters were elated by the success of the signature-gathering
drive and noted that a last week blitz of over 140,000 signatures
virtually guaranteed that Californians will have an opportunity
to vote on the issue this year.&nbsp; A final validation of the
estimated 750,000 signatures is expected in five to eight
weeks.&nbsp; The number of signatures required to qualify the
initiative for the 1996 ballot is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed
by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; The 1996 initiative maintains
that any patient who possesses a valid doctor's recommendation
should be allowed to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent without
fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed by
California voters this fall, the measure will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The issue here is simple; sick people should not be
arrested for using medicine that their physicians recommend to
them,&quot; said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Vermont Senate Approves Hemp Legislation: <br>
However, State Still A Long Ways Away From Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; An
amended version of legislation that had been previously approved
by the House to permit the development of a domestic hemp
industry in Vermont was passed by the Senate by a 15-10
vote.&nbsp; The amended measure reportedly &quot;narrows the
focus&quot; of the bill (H.783) and now must be re-approved by
the Rouse before being sent to the governor.&nbsp; Because the
measure failed to receive two-thirds majority support in the
Senate, it is expected be vetoed by Gov. Howard Dean who remains
opposed to any efforts to legalize industrial hemp.&nbsp;
&quot;It is a terrible message to send to children,&quot; wrote
Dean in an April 8 letter to hemp-activist, Colorado Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D- Northglenn). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), a chief proponent of the
legislation, told <b>NORML</b> that the House is going to take
its time and &quot;let things develop&quot; before rushing to
approve the amended legislation.&nbsp; Maslack stated that House
backers are considering several options at this time, including
trying to override Dean's expected veto of the bill and/or
tacking the controversial legislation onto an economic
development bill considered sacred to the governor.&nbsp;
&quot;It's not over 'til it's over,&quot; Maslack told the <i>Associated
Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kathleen Keenan, chairwoman of the House Commerce Committee, told
the AP that she sees hemp as an &quot;economic development
issue,&quot; but noted that &quot;it has enough merit to stand
alone.&quot;&nbsp; Keenan further added that she was uncertain
how committed Dean was to the economic development bill and
cautioned that he may, in fact, veto it with the hemp provision
included. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keenan's warning has little affect on the bill's proponents,
however, who consider the latest round of political one-upmanship
a &quot;positive&quot; note.&nbsp; The approval from the Senate
was &quot;one more step in the process,&quot; said Maslack.&nbsp;
&quot;[It's] not the first step [and it's certainly] not the last
step,&quot; but it's definitely a step in the right direction. <br>

Industrial Hemp Prohibition</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp; Appalled
at the recent defeat of a bill that would have allowed Colorado
to become the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since
World War II, Hollywood actor and hemp activist Woody Harrelson
has withheld $10,000 of his taxes to protest the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I know I'm only a pampered actor with no room to complain,
... but the fact is I care,&quot; Harrelson wrote in a two page
proclamation.&nbsp; Previously Harrelson, who has commercial
interests in a hemp clothing company, had pledged his support for
the Colorado hemp bill by affirming that he &quot;will personally
guarantee that all hemp produced in Colorado will be purchased at
fair market prices.&quot;&nbsp; The legislation was recently
killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a 8-5 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to a story that ran in <em>USA Today</em>, Harrelson
said that he's been quietly fighting on behalf of industrial hemp
and other environmental causes for years.&nbsp; He even slipped
president Clinton a letter regarding hemp cultivation while they
both attended actor Ted Danson's wedding, the feature noted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Harrelson's action and to commemorate his efforts

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEAth In Colorado</b></font><b> <br>
Hemp Cultivation Killed By House Agriculture Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 11,1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would have allowed Colorado to become
the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since World War
II was killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a stunning
8-5 vote.&nbsp; The vote came as a surprise to many who had watched
support for domestic hemp legislation grow in recent weeks,
including gaining approval from the full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many witnesses attribute the outcome to a collective show of
force from law and drug enforcement officials.&nbsp; During the
four hour hearing, twelve law enforcement officials testified against
the bill, including regional DEA representative Greg Williams and
Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director Carl Whiteside.&nbsp;
Among their arguments, law enforcement testified that there is no
difference between industrial hemp and marijuana and that passing
the Hemp Industrial Production Act would send the wrong message
to young people.&nbsp; &quot;In the minds of many, ... [support
for] this will be perceived as a weakening of our anti-marijuana
message in our society,&quot; stated Special Agent Williams. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Fear and intimidation&quot; scared off support for this
bill in the Committee, said the bill's sponsor, Senator Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn).&nbsp; Hemp activist Laura Kriho of the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) agrees.&nbsp; The
emotional pressure and scare tactics used by these law enforcement
agencies effectively strong-armed the state legislature, forcing
them to vote for the police and against the farmers of
Colorado.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One legislator who voted against the measure, Rep. Russell George
(R-Rifle), explained in an interview immediately after the
hearing how the testimony of law enforcement influenced his decision.&nbsp;
&quot;The key factor in making up my vote was when the ... DEA
... testified and said that under no circumstances would [they]
issue any kind of registration or permit,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;That meant anything else we did with this bill was a waste
of time and was moot because the bill itself said that ...
farmer[s] couldn't go forward without a DEA registration.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The presence of the DEA at the hearing was especially troubling
to both Casey and hemp proponents who noted that, prior to the
April 11 hearing, representatives from the agency had been
cooperative with the bill's backers.&nbsp; In the past, the DEA
in Colorado had &quot;appeared helpful,&quot; noted Kriho.&nbsp;
&quot;We had even been told that ... the DEA in Washington, D.C.
[was] in the process of reviewing policies related to industrial
hemp production.&nbsp; ... [However,] after the DEA testimony at
the hearing, I believe it is safe to say that the DEA is not
working with hemp proponents.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite this setback, activists remain positive that domestic
hemp cultivation in Colorado remains a tangible goal.&nbsp;
&quot;We [still] have a lot of momentum and a lot of
support,&quot; Kriho stated.&nbsp; &quot;We are now in the
process of evaluating our strategies and determining our courses
of action.&nbsp; We have several interesting options and are
excited to be able to pursue them.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately,
though, any future efforts to legalize industrial hemp in
Colorado will be without the efforts of either Lloyd Casey or
Reps. Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-
Lasalle), all of whom are stepping down after this year's
session.&nbsp; When asked by <b>NORML</b> if Casey foresees any legislators
in Colorado willing to carry the torch after he leaves, the
Senator's only response was: &quot;I hope so.&quot; <br>

Forfeiture</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court in a case that
may determine whether seizing property from criminally prosecuted
drug dealers constitutes double jeopardy under the United States
Constitution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Civil forfeiture has never been deemed so punitive ... as
to constitute a prosecution or punishment under the
[Constitution's] double jeopardy clause,&quot; contended Justice
Department lawyer Michael Dreeben on behalf of the Clinton
administration.&nbsp; The attorney urged the Court to overturn
two double-jeopardy decisions in which federal appeals courts in
Michigan and California found civil forfeiture following a
criminal prosecution to be unconstitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This] is, in my mind, the single most important case
involving the government's forfeiture authority in the area of
narcotics, and possibly other areas,&quot; said Attorney Lawrence
Robbins of Washington, D.C., one of two attorneys arguing against
the government's controversial, double-barreled anti-drug
strategy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If this looks like a punishment ... what then is the reason
for not treating it like punishment,&quot; asked Justice William
H. Rehnquist during the procedures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, no
one may be &quot;subject for the same offense to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb.&quot;&nbsp; The Supreme Court has
interpreted this provision to prohibit multiple punishments for
the same crime. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Court is expected to rule on this issue sometime in June. <br>

Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Cannabis Buyers

admits to having had two marijuana seedlings growing at the

the plants or issue a warrant for his arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans anticipates that the state's latest action is an attempt to

<p align="center"><b>California Assembly Committee Votes For
Tougher Pot Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 16, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Assembly Public Safety Committee slammed the door on
drug reformers by soundly defeating a bill to lessen penalties
for medical marijuana and approving another measure to increase
marijuana prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee, whose complexion has shifted sharply to the right
with the Republican takeover of the Assembly this year, turned a
deaf ear to the pleas of medical marijuana patients, physicians and
AIDS support groups by rejecting a medical marijuana bill
sponsored by Rep. John Burton (D-San Francisco).&nbsp; The Burton
bill (AB 2120) was a heavily watered-down version of legislation introduced
last year by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the
prescribed use of marijuana for the sick and terminally ill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the bill's concessions, Burton's proposed legislation was
defeated handily by a vote of 7-1, signifying a major reversal in
the committee's attitude regarding medical marijuana.&nbsp; In
the past, the committee had been receptive toward the medical
marijuana issue and had approved legislation allowing for it's
use three years in a row.&nbsp; This year, Burton's measure was
actively opposed by the California Narcotics Officers
Association, the Governor's Department of Health, and Attorney
General Lungren, who argued that the legislation undercut the
established system of drug regulation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the committee eagerly approved a measure introduced by
Assemblyman Charles Poochigan (R-Fresno) to enhance prison
sentences by three years and up for marijuana convictions
involving a kilogram or more. Two Democrats joined Republicans in
approving the bill, which was strongly backed by the Narcotics
Officers and District Attorney's associations.&nbsp; &quot;The committee
appeared indifferent to the costs of imprisoning more offenders
for non-violent crime,&quot; stated California NORML State
Coordinator Dale Gieringer, who had opposed the measure.&nbsp; &quot;Throughout
the day, it routinely approved all other penalty enhancement
bills with no regard as to whether the offenses were violent,
serious, or victimless. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Drug-law reformers hope to derail AB 2764 in the
Democratic-controlled State Senate, Gieringer noted. <br>

California Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, who last year introduced

<p align="center"><b>Missouri Hemp Bill Heard Before Senate
Agriculture Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp; A
bill (SB 972) to allow for the legal cultivation of industrial
hemp in Missouri was heard before the Senate Agriculture
Committee.&nbsp; Introduced by Sen. Jerry Howard (D-Dexter), the
legislation permits licensed growers to cultivate industrial hemp for
a variety of commercial uses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although no vote was taken by the committee, those attending
report that the hearing was positive and signified a step in the
right direction.&nbsp; In all, four witnesses testified in favor
of the bill and no witnesses opposed it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Because the legislation was introduced late in this year's
legislative session, there is little hope of it being approved in
1996.&nbsp; Nevertheless, hemp proponents are encouraged that
this hearing will provide a &quot;running start&quot; for the
introduction of a similar bill in 1997. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We are &quot;laying the groundwork for next year,&quot; said
Missouri NORML President Dan Viets, Esq., whose office provided
Sen. Howard with background materials regarding the uses of industrial
hemp.&nbsp; Viets added that Howard has been
&quot;encouraged&quot; by the favorable response his bill has
received. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP), one
Missouri farmer has already applied for a DEA permit to grow hemp
and is hopeful that the legislature will at least pass a
resolution supporting industrial hemp research before the
completion of this year's session. <br>

Legislation that had been previously approved overwhelmingly by
the House to permit development of a domestic hemp industry in
Vermont has been temporarily derailed by the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee, the bill
(H.783) was passed by a 4-2 vote.&nbsp; However, the bill was
passed with an &quot;adverse report&quot; and is now
&quot;ordered to lie&quot; in Senate.&nbsp; According to a
spokesman for the Vermont Legislative Council, bills
&quot;ordered to lie&quot; are in limbo, but may be called back
to the floor for further debate at any time if the bill receives
a majority vote from the full Senate to do so. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Approving legislation with an adverse report is &quot;hardly ever
done,&quot; said Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), one of the
initial proponents of the hemp cultivation bill.&nbsp; Maslack
further added that law enforcement officials, the bill's chief
opponents, recently testified at informal hearings before the Senate
Judiciary Committee against the legislation. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Tax Stamp Legislation Under Fire In Arizona</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; A 1983 law
allowing individuals to attain licenses from the state to deal in
and pay taxes on cannabis is under fire from state officials who
argue that the legislation is tantamount to legalizing
marijuana.&nbsp; Recently, a bill introduced by Rep. Scott
Bungaard (R-Glendale) calling for the repeal of Arizona's tax
stamp legislation was approved in the Senate Government Reform
Committee by a 6-1 vote.&nbsp; The bill (H2367) now moves to the
full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Committee Chairman Stan Barnes, 55 people signed up
to testify in opposition to Bungaard's amendment, including
Arizona NORML President Peter Wilson.&nbsp; Wilson ignited the stamp
tax controversy this past November when Northwest Phoenix Justice
Court Judge John Barclay dismissed marijuana possession charges
against him because of evidence that he is licensed by the state
to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Basing his decision on constitutional
prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded
that Wilson could not be prosecuted because of (punitive) taxes
he had previously paid to the Arizona department of revenue to
sell and possess cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think by possessing a license and paying the tax, you
show an attitude that is different than a criminal
attitude,&quot; said Wilson's attorney and <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee member, Michael Walz, speaking in favor of maintaining
the current legislation.&nbsp; &quot;What you have is a county
attorney saying on the record he is 100 percent confident [Mr.
Wilson's case] will be reversed on appeal.&nbsp; If that is really
true, then there is no reason for this legislation.&nbsp; And in
fact, what it does is deprive the state of Arizona of
potentially, millions of dollars in revenue.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The license and tax requirements were never intended to
decriminalize the sale of marijuana,&quot; countered Rep.
Bungaard.&nbsp; &quot;I want to send a clear message that drug
use of any kind in this state is illegal and unacceptable.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the recent momentum to repeal the tax stamp legislation,
AZ4NORML member Bill Green doubts Bungaard's measure will pass
this year.&nbsp; &quot;If by some chance it gets passed without
us noticing, we plan to file a referendum with the Secretary of
State.&nbsp; We will bill it as a protest vote for legal
marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Teacher To Sue After Losing His Job Over 20
Year Old Pot Charge</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 10, 1996, Chicago IL:</b>&nbsp; A
substitute teacher who was recently dismissed from work after a
background check revealed a misdemeanor for marijuana possession
in 1974 is suing school officials to get his job back, according
to an <em>Associated Press</em> report. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">High school substitute Michael Maynard, 42, argues that the
school's policy of firing teachers guilty of crimes including
drug misdemeanors -- but not murder -- is arbitrary and does not
give teachers a chance to defend themselves.&nbsp; Maynard
pleaded no contest in 1974 when a traffic stop revealed a small
amount of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If they're not going to disqualify Bill Clinton from being

being a teacher,&quot; said employment lawyer Lynne Bernabel to

<p align="center"><b>Health Committee's Recommendations To
Decriminalize Marijuana Scrapped After Political Backlash</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 10, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp;
Controversial proposals made by a state health-planning group to
decriminalize small amounts of marijuana and create
needle-exchange programs as ways to &quot;reduce costs associated
with criminality and transmittable diseases associated with
illicit drug use&quot; have been abandoned because of the threat
of political fallout. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The two recommendations were included in a report released by the
Denver Human Services Planning Committee, a 32-member
organization formed by the 1994 legislature to help improve the delivery
of health services in Colorado. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The proposals came under fire in recent weeks after a news
feature in the <em>Rocky Mountain Times</em> outlining the
proposals incited a wave of controversy.&nbsp; Consequently, the
committee voted to abrogate the recommendations late last month. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We decided ... that this is not worth the
controversy,&quot; said committee member Phil Hernandez.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Colorado Senate Gives Green Light To
Domestic Hemp Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 30, 1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would allow Colorado to become the first
state to legalize the growing of industrial hemp was approved by
the full Senate by a 18-15 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The move surprised many who felt that the controversial
legislation would likely fall three or five votes shy of a
majority.&nbsp; &quot;I feel like I've been through a wringer,
but I'm very happy,&quot; said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn), in an interview with the <i>Rocky Mountain
News</i>.&nbsp; A similar bill was introduced by Casey in 1995,
but only received one vote of support in its first committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting
of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill
as marijuana containing no more than 0.5% THC) in Colorado in
1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale hemp production to begin in
1998 and has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado
State Grange, and the National Federation of Farm Bureaus.&nbsp;
The bill has also received support from Hollywood actor and hemp
businessman Woody Harrelson. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill now moves to the more conservative House where Reps.
Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-Lasalle) have
agreed to help carry the legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medical and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown
legally through much of Europe, Asia, and parts of Canada to
produce a variety of products such as textiles, paper, composites,
paints, cosmetics, and animal feed. <br>

<p align="center"><b>District Attorney To Take No Further Action
In Medical Marijuana Distribution Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
Manhattan District Attorney has agreed to take no further action
in its prosecution of Johann Moore for distributing marijuana for
medical purposes and to dismiss all charges against him in six
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge William Mogulescu explained in open court that this
decision by the District Attorney's office constituted an extreme
deviation from their internal policies which require that all
defendants must plead to the indictment in all cases of marijuana
sales.&nbsp; Judge Mogulescu further added that he believed the
District Attorney's action to be tantamount to an acknowledgment
by that office of the legitimacy of medicinal marijuana and of
the validity of Moore's claim that his distribution of marijuana
as medicine constituted a justification for his actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Immediately after the court proceeding where Moore consented to
the six month deferred prosecution, he informed reporters that he
intends to continue to provide marijuana to those with a legitimate
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore's attorney and President of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Robert Fogelnest said, &quot;I
applaud the District Attorney's office for their ultimately making
an intelligent and humane judgment in the disposition of this
case.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that this will pave the way for a more enlightened
policy regarding the distribution of marijuana for medical
use,&quot; added Moore's other attorney, Ruth Liebesman.&nbsp;
Both Liebesman and Fogelnest are members of the <b>NORML</b>
Legal Committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore is a longtime New York City drug reform activist and is the
founder of the city's underground cannabis buyer's club -- one of
an estimated 30 clubs that currently operate and distribute
medical marijuana to seriously ill patients who possess a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He was arrested last August for
distributing marijuana and was charged with criminal sales in the
fourth degree. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statement made by the District Attorney in this case is
a strong one,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It appears that they -- like the D.A.'s
offices in San Francisco, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have done
previously -- wish to make the prosecution of buyer's clubs and
those involved in the distribution of marijuana for medicinal use
the state's lowest priority.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 1, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
The number of marijuana offenders in California state prisons has
increased to its highest level in history, according to the
latest statistics from the Department of Corrections.&nbsp; As of
December 31, 1995, 1,572 prisoners were serving time for marijuana
felonies, up 18 percent from one year previously. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The new figures appear to belie recent claims that the war on
marijuana in California has let up.&nbsp; California now has two
and a half times more marijuana prisoners than in the early
l970s, before possession was decriminalized from a felony to a
misdemeanor, and 15 times as many marijuana prisoners as at the
record low in 1980.&nbsp; An unknown number of additional
prisoners are serving time in county jails.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
recent surveys indicate that marijuana usage is rising --
especially among adolescents -- suggesting strongly that harsh
penalties are not an effective deterrent in marijuana
consumption. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Prosecutors Seek To Seize Frequent-Flier
Miles Of Man Convicted Of Marijuana Trafficking</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, Baltimore, MD:</b>&nbsp; In an
action that appears to be a first for the nation, federal prosecutors
are attempting to seize 117,705 frequent-flier miles of a
convicted marijuana trafficker. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think it's ingenious,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Lynne A.
Battaglia, whose office recently filed the forfeiture
claim.&nbsp; Prosecutors maintain that the miles should be
converted into plain tickets and given to law enforcement
agencies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A federal judge will decide whether the miles should be
considered as assets and confiscated under forfeiture laws.&nbsp;
Recently, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan ruling that allows prosecutors
to seize property used in a crime even when the owner was not a
participant.</p>

<p align="center"><b>USA WEEKEND QuickPoll Indicates Majority Of
Americans Favor Marijuana Decriminalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 31, 1996:</b>&nbsp; Seventy-four percent
of the more than 6,200 individuals who responded to a USA WEEKEND
poll said they favored decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The
outcome came as a surprise to many who felt that the USA WEEKEND
feature: <em>Why more kids are into pot</em> greatly sensationalized
the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The results of this poll indicates that a clear majority of
Americans favor marijuana decriminalization,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The results of the
USA WEEKEND QuickPoll mimics the outcomes of similar polls
conducted recently by <i>Parade Magazine</i> and America
Online.&nbsp; A significant number of Americans are fed-up with
the government's war on marijuana consumers.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Medical Marijuana Attracts
Bi-Partisan Support<br>
First Two Republicans Sign On To Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 29, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; Four
additional members of Congress, including one member of the House
Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Crime, and two Republicans,
have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R. 2618) that would
permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for seriously ill patients.&nbsp; The recent signees, U.S Reps.
Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), Steven Gunderson (R-Wis.), Zoe Lofgren
(D-Calif.), and Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) bring the total number of
co-sponsors to thirteen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The support of the recent co-sponsors is critical for a variety
of reasons.&nbsp; The addition of Reps. Gunderson and Campbell
gives the bill its first taste of bi-partisan support and could
potentially persuade several other Republicans -- including House
Speaker and former co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) -- to sign on to H.R. 2618.&nbsp; In
addition, the support of Republicans is necessary if the bill is
to move forward in a Republican controlled Congress. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Lofgren's support is also crucial.&nbsp; Currently, H.R.
2618 is pending before the Subcommittee on Crime.&nbsp; As a
member of this committee, Lofgren can encourage Chairman and former
two-time co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation, Bill
McCollum (R-Fla.), to hold additional hearings on medical
marijuana and possibly bring the bill to a vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders, including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Currently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive medical marijuana legally from the federal
government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information about H.R. 2618 or medical marijuana,

<p align="center"><b>Funding For Study On Medical Marijuana
Allocated In Washington State Budget</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March, 1996, Olympia, WA:</b>&nbsp; Washington
State University and the state Department of Health will start
looking for ways to make medicinal marijuana available to the
seriously ill, under strict controls, though two appropriations
provided in this year's operating budget. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The funding for the study came through the efforts of state
Senators Jeanne Kohl (D-Seattle) and Bob McCaslin
(R-Spokane).&nbsp; The two senators co-sponsored a bill (SB-6744)
that was used as a model for the appropriations provided in this
year's budget. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The funds will be used by Washington State University, in
conjunction with the state Board of Pharmacy, and the state
Department of Health to conduct research on cultivating marijuana
in a tamper-free environment.&nbsp; The study will also determine
the appropriate organization to manufacture and distribute the
drug for medical use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The second appropriation will be used to fund a clinical study
administered by the state Department of Health under the
controlled substance abuse therapeutic program, in statute since 1979. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study will be limited to patients under a physician's
care.&nbsp; Only patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation
treatments, or suffering from glaucoma, AIDS or HIV related illnesses,
multiple sclerosis, or other life threatening illnesses would
qualify for the study. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results of a statewide public-opinion poll directed by local
political consultant Sharon Gilpin the weekend of March 2nd-3rd
indicated that the public supports the use of marijuana for
medicinal purposes.&nbsp; The statewide survey of 400 voters
found that 75 percent favored making marijuana available for
patients if prescribed by a doctor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gilpin said the results were a complete surprise.&nbsp; &quot;I
know the people in the Northwest tend to be compassionate, but
the high number was totally unexpected,&quot; she said.&nbsp;
Gilpin said people who are concerned about the rising cost of
health care are willing to look at alternatives to the high cost of
fighting diseases such as AIDS and cancer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is a great start that will lead to what we hope is a
promising finish,&quot; said Dr. David Edwards, an Olympia
physician and medical coordinator for the Washington Hemp
Education Network (WHEN), an agency working on informing the
public of the potential benefits of medicinal marijuana.&nbsp;
&quot;I expect the results to have a positive effect in our
effort to provide organic marijuana to patients under strict
medical guidelines.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana activist and founder of the Green Cross
Cannabis Buyers Club, Joanna McKee, said she is confident the
study will confirm what other tests have shown: the positive effects
of medicinal marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;The medical community is so
focused on using chemicals to combat illness, they ignore a
simple, organic solution that's readily available,&quot; she
said.&nbsp; &quot;This test will provide the answer to those who
still question the effectiveness of THC.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. McCaslin said if the results of the state study on THC is
similar to others conducted, organic marijuana could be a boon
for the seriously ill.&nbsp; &quot;It will not only aid them in
their physical recovery, it could prove to be a psychological
boost as well,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kohl said the study is the first step towards getting needed
medicine to those who desperately need it.&nbsp; &quot;If the
synthetic drug is not working for a patient, it only makes sense
they should be able to have access to organic marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists should be advised that the medicinal marijuana
appropriations could potentially fall victim to a section-item
veto by the governor. However, Sen. Kohl's office tells <b>NORML</b>
that she has been assured by the governor's staff that he will
not take such action. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information or for the latest status on the
Washington state medical marijuana appropriations, please contact

<p align="center"><b>Domestic Hemp Cultivation Bill Heads To
Colorado Senate</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 22, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) introduced by Sen. Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn)
to allow Colorado to become the first state to grow industrial
hemp in almost 40 years is heading for the Senate floor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a move that stunned both proponents and opponents alike, the
Senate Appropriations Committee voted 5-4 to send the bill to the
full Senate for debate.&nbsp; A similar bill was introduced by Casey
in 1995, but only received one vote of support in its first
committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We're talking about not just growing, but about the textile
mills, the paper mills, [and] the food-processing products.&nbsp;
We're talking about all the value-added things that can result
from this,&quot; explained Casey. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting
of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill
as marijuana containing no more than 0.5% THC) in Colorado in
1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale hemp production to begin in
1998 and has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado
State Grange, and the National Federation of Farm Bureaus.&nbsp;
The bill has also received support from Hollywood actor and hemp
businessman Woody Harrelson. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Working diligently over the past year to gather support for this
bill is the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP), a
grassroots organization of activists who have donated their time
to volunteer on this campaign.&nbsp; CO-HIP notes that the bill
currently has support in the Senate, but is probably three to
five votes shy of a majority.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the group
remains confident that the bill will pass the Senate and is
actively pursuing the help of farm organizations and professional lobbyists
to drum up support among legislators. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Colorado's legislative session ends on May 8, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this bill, please contact the office
of Senator Lloyd Casey @ (303) 866-4865 or CO-HIP @ (303)

<p align="center"><b>Washington State Medical Marijuana User
Found Guilty Of Drug Possession And Manufacture Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March, 1996, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp; A Pierce
County resident who used marijuana to alleviate pain and seizures
stemming from head injuries he suffered in a 1988 motorcycle
accident was found guilty of charges that he possessed and
manufactured marijuana.&nbsp; His sentencing is set for April 10. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jess Williams, aka Fat Freddy, claims that he grew marijuana to
combat the symptoms of his injury after discovering that cannabis
worked more effectively than any conventional prescription drugs.&nbsp;
Law enforcement agents who raided Williams home maintained that
Williams possessed more plants than necessary for personal
use.&nbsp; Williams attorney, <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member
Jeffrey Steinborn, asserts that he will appeal the
decision.&nbsp; &quot;This case is a long way from over,&quot; he
says. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">William's case had risen to the forefront of the battle for
medical access to marijuana in Washington State.&nbsp; While
Steinborn admits that an acquittal would not have invalidated the
law, he maintains that a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict might
have made prosecutors wary of bringing similar cases to trial.&nbsp;
Previously, medical marijuana user Ralph Seeley won a declaratory
judgment from Pierce County Superior Court Judge Rosanne Buckner
affirming that a cancer patient's need to use marijuana as a
medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing its
prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some activists who attended William's trial noted that they felt
the jury might have ruled differently had the defendant suffered
from cancer or glaucoma.&nbsp; Williams was the &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;
of the month for the May issue of <em>High Times</em> magazine. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Industrial Hemp Planted On American Indian
Soil</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 17, 1996, Navajo Nation, Arizona:</b>&nbsp;
A scheduled planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition
for Hemp Awareness (CHA) took place on test plots of American
Indian soil.&nbsp; The initial planting came about following a
resolution passed unanimously by the Navajo Nation to allow for
hemp cultivation to occur on sovereign soil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following meetings with both the Vice President and the Director
of Agriculture of the Navajo Nation, CHA spokesman Christie
Bohling told <b>NORML</b> that support for the hemp cultivation project
is &quot;overwhelming beyond our wildest dreams.&quot;&nbsp;
Bohling notes that adverse weather and a lack of seeds limited
CHA's spring planting to a small &quot;ceremonial
celebration,&quot; but adds that a widescale planting is
scheduled for the end of April. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navajo Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson
and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the
purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;
Currently, well over 30,000 acres of Navajo nation land has been
allocated for hemp cultivation.&nbsp; In addition, CHA states
that the organization is close to securing approval for similar cultivation
projects from ten other tribes located across the United
States.&nbsp; This will enable CHA the opportunity to grow hemp
in a variety of &quot;different [climates and]
environments,&quot; Bohling explains. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite
the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural crop.&nbsp;
CHA is a political advocacy network group that assimilates and disseminates
hemp information to both politicians and the public. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 19, 1996, Crewe, VA:</b>&nbsp; A
dazzling array of tough new anti-drug proposals failed to pass
the Virginia General Assembly this week.&nbsp; The measures were
opposed by a drug-law reform coalition that included members of
DC NORML, Virginians Against Drug Violence, and Virginia's Cannabis
Action Network.&nbsp; The measures would have increased marijuana
penalties, permitted drug testing of high-school students, and
given courts the broad authority to continue cases despite improper
procedures or incomplete lab results. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This year we had a real show of force,&quot; said activist
Lennice Werth of Virginians Against Drug Violence.&nbsp;
&quot;[We had] lots of anti-prohibitionists showing up at the
state house to voice their dissatisfaction with this kind of
legislation.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among bills defeated outright were measures to include marijuana
seeds and stems as evidence to increase marijuana penalties
(SB34, SB58, HB96, HB169); allow courts to continue cases that have
been dismissed due to improper procedures (HB646, SB53); add a
$1,000 additional fine for possession or distribution charges to
go to local authorities (HB1002), and permit the drug testing of
high school students (HB949, HB950, HB579). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A measure that was not killed, but amended, was legislation that
would have greatly expanded the use of military for drug law
enforcement, particularly for searching private property.&nbsp;
Werth notes that the amended bill limits use of the military to
aerial surveillance only and called the revision &quot;a
substantial victory&quot; for the drug reform movement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some measures that passed the General Assembly despite the
efforts of drug-law reformers include legislation to legalize
double jeopardy (SB435, SJR73) and deny bail to drug offenders (HB504).&nbsp;
Altogether, reformers monitored a total of 48 bills. <br>

the trial of Johann Moore. Moore is the coordinator of the New

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana User, Quadriplegic Found
Guilty Of Trafficking Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 15, 1996, Oregon, Ohio:</b>&nbsp; Daniel
Asbury, a quadriplegic who grew his own marijuana to alleviate
reoccurring pain and muscle spasms, was found guilty of
trafficking in marijuana over three times the bulk amount and
could face a sentence of up to five years in prison.&nbsp;
Asbury's sentencing will occur on April 18. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The guilty verdict was a setback for marijuana reform advocates
who had hoped to set a legal precedent in Ohio for the medical
use of marijuana.&nbsp; John Hartman, President of Northcoast NORML,
notes that the organization flew in <b>NORML</b> Board member and
CUNY Medical School Professor Dr. John Morgan to testify as an
expert witness on the use of marijuana and pain management.&nbsp;
&quot;For whatever reason, the jury [who found Asbury innocent on
charges of cultivation] didn't find Daniel's medical necessity
case strong enough to nullify [the trafficking charge,]&quot;
Hartman notes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hartman adds that Asbury's defense was made more difficult
because Ohio currently provides no medical marijuana defense in
its body of established state law.&nbsp; Therefore, Asbury's
defense was basically asking the jury to &quot;find the
compassion to rule over the law,&quot; Hartman said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use
marijuana as a therapeutic after prescription drugs proved

<p align="center"><b>Oakland City Council Issues Resolution
Supporting Medical Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 12, Oakland, CA:</b>&nbsp; The Oakland
City Council has unanimously passed a resolution (#72516)
endorsing Rep. Barney Frank's (D-Mass.) federal medical marijuana legislation, supporting
the activities of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club, and declaring
the arrest of individuals involved with the medical use of
marijuana to be a low priority for the city of Oakland. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The main points of the resolution are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Marijuana has been shown to help pain and discomfort in
        people suffering from a variety of illnesses including
        AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and chronic
        pain when no other medications have been effective. </li>
    <li>The illegal purchase of marijuana by people already suffering
        with chronic illnesses subjects them to further suffering
        in the form of potential arrest and prosecution. </li>
    <li>The Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Club provides a way for patients
        needing to purchase marijuana for medical use to do so
        with greater ease and less risk of arrest and prosecution. </li>
    <li>The City of Oakland wishes to declare its desire not to
        expend City resources in any investigation, detention,
        arrest, or prosecution arising out of alleged violations
        of state and federal law regarding the possession,
        cultivation, and/or distribution of marijuana for medical use. </li>
    <li>The Oakland City Council authorizes the City Manager to
        instruct the City's federal lobbyist to work in support
        of H.R. 2618 -- a bill in Congress that would amend the
        federal law to allow a physician to legally prescribe
        marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill
        patients. </li>

<p align="center"><b>Twice As Many Defendants Imprisoned For
Marijuana Possession<br>
Under Tough &quot;Three Strikes&quot; Law Than For Violent
Crimes, Study Indicates</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 6, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
More than twice as many defendants have been sentenced to stiff
prison sentences under California's &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; law than have murderers, rapists, and kidnappers
combined, according to a recent study by the Center on Juvenile
and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Overall, the report concluded that 85 percent of those sentenced
under the law had been convicted most recently of a non-violent
offense.&nbsp; Of those 85 percent, 192 individuals were sentenced
under the law after being convicted of marijuana possession while
in custody (a felony offense in California) as compared to only
40 who were convicted of murder, 25 of rape, and 24 of
kidnapping. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To be prosecuted under the stringent California law, a defendant
must have been convicted of at least one or more serious violent
crimes in the past.&nbsp; However, the most recent offense need
not be a violent crime -- only a felony.&nbsp; The law mandates
double the normal sentence for anyone convicted of a second
felony and life sentence for any individual convicted of a third
felony. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;People are going to jail in America for possessing
marijuana,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;As this report clearly illustrates, the
sentences can potentially be for life.&nbsp; This sort of
illogical and fiscally irresponsible mandatory sentencing must
end.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Vocal Medical Marijuana Activist, User
Busted Following Television Appearance</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March, 1996, Sunny View, NC:</b>&nbsp; A
medical marijuana activist who had received extensive media
coverage for her vocal support of the medicinal use of marijuana
was recently arrested by law enforcement officials and charged
with various drug charges including possession with intent to manufacture
a controlled substance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jean Marlowe, president of the Marijuana Relegalization Movement,
told local newscasters in a television interview that she smoked
marijuana at least three times a day to obtain therapeutic relief from
three orthopedic conditions she suffers from: degenerative disc
disease, reflect sympathetic dystrophy, and osteoarthritis.&nbsp;
Days later, local law enforcement officials raided the Marlowe residence
and found approximately 50 marijuana seedlings.&nbsp; Marlowe
maintains that the seized seedlings were being grown for her own
medical use and intends to sue both the state and federal government
for legal medical access to marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;No one sick or suffering should have to endure the added
stress of living in fear of being searched, jailed, or
prosecuted,&quot; Marlowe said.&nbsp; &quot;I want this medicine
available for every American citizen that needs it!&nbsp; Nobody
should have to perform a criminal act to obtain a safe, natural medicine.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To support her argument, Marlowe notes that she has letters from
two separate physicians confirming her use of medical
marijuana.&nbsp; In addition, Marlowe has an official notice from
the Social Security Administration stating that &quot;she ...
relies on marijuana to relieve her symptoms and smokes three
grams per day.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I will get medical access or an exemption to grow my own
[cannabis] before I'm though,&quot; Marlowe affirmed.&nbsp;
&quot;How dare our legislators sit up there in Washington and
bicker among themselves and treat the very citizens who put them
[there] so very heartlessly. <br>

Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 1996, Olympia, WA:</b>&nbsp; A final
version of the 1996 Washington Hemp Initiative has been approved
by the Washington state Attorney General.&nbsp; If successful,
the initiative, now known officially as Initiative 663, would
require the state to replace existing policies prohibiting
cannabis with a system of regulation and taxation similar to that
of alcohol.&nbsp; The initiative has until July 8th to gather the
189,000 signatures from registered Washington voters necessary to
place the bill on the upcoming ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 Hemp Initiative is a comprehensive initiative dealing
with industrial, medicinal, and recreational hemp.&nbsp;
Industrial hemp is defined by the initiative as having less than
.5 percent THC and is to be regulated as a non-intoxicating
agricultural commodity.&nbsp; Medicinal cannabis is allowed to be
distributed by prescription from drug stores and
pharmacies.&nbsp; Regulations regarding the use of recreational
and/or intoxicating hemp (read: marijuana) are modeled after the
laws regulating alcohol and permits adults over 21 to consume
cannabis as long as they do so responsibly.&nbsp; In addition,
minors will not be allowed where marijuana is grown, sold, or
consumed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Tom Rohan, state coordinator for the initiative drive, notes that
petition organizers have over 3,000 volunteers to help gather
signatures. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Bill To Eliminate Arizona Tax Stamp
Legislation Pulled For Time Being</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 12, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; An
amendment that would delete Arizona's cannabis tax and licensing
program was pulled by the bill's sponsor, Rep. Scott Bungaard
(R-Glendale).&nbsp; Bungaard plans to reintroduce the amendment
next week. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bungaard's move to repeal Arizona's tax stamp legislation stems
from a November 1995 ruling by Northwest Phoenix Court Justice
Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges against Arizona NORML
Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence that he was licensed by
the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing his decision on
constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay
concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted for possession of
marijuana because of taxes he had already paid the Arizona
Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; The state is currently
appealing the decision. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Having this law gives the appearance that we have
decriminalized [marijuana] use in this state,&quot; Rep. Bungaard
said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If the legislature allows Rep. Bungaard to submit a new
bill, it will open this issue up to public debate within both the
House and Senate,&quot; said Bill Green of Arizona <b>NORML</b>.&nbsp;
&quot;Our goal is to be well organized so that we [can] actively
[lobby the legislature] at that time.&quot; <br>

<p align="center">March 7, 1996</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>NORML Testifies Before
Congress</b></font> <br>
<b>Executive Director Keith Stroup Tells Subcommittee That
&quot;Far More Harm Is Caused By Marijuana Prohibition Than By
Marijuana Itself&quot;</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 6,1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; In a
step forward for the marijuana reform movement, Congress invited <b>NORML</b>
Executive Director Keith Stroup and two other reform advocates to testify
on the subject of marijuana policy.&nbsp; Wednesday's
congressional hearing marked the first time that Congress has
made such overtures in more than six years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee: Congressional
Subcommittee on Crime, Stroup urged the committee to put an end
to federal policies that continue to arrest hundreds of thousands
of adult marijuana users every year while, at the same time,
maintaining <b>NORML</b>'s opposition to adolescent drug
use.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana smokers in this country are no
different from their non-smoking peers, except for their
marijuana use.&nbsp; Like most Americans, they are responsible citizens
who work hard, raise families, contribute to their communities,
and want a safe, crime-free neighborhood in which to live,&quot;
he stated.&nbsp; &quot;It's time we ended marijuana prohibition
and stopped arresting and jailing hundreds of thousands of
average Americans whose only 'crime' is that they smoke
marijuana.&nbsp; This is a tragic and senseless war against our
own citizens; it must be ended. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stroup also spoke in favor of amending federal law to allow
patients access to medical marijuana with a doctor's prescription
and urged the members of the crime subcommittee to promptly
approve HR 2618 -- a federal bill currently before the
subcommittee that would permit the medical use of cannabis.&nbsp;
&quot;Whatever you may feel about the war on drugs,&quot; Stroup summarized,
&quot;denying medical marijuana to seriously ill people should
not be a part of it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also appearing before the subcommittee to attest to marijuana's
medical utility was Richard Brookhiser, Senior Editor for the
National Review.&nbsp; In impassioned testimony, Brookhiser told
of his own use of marijuana, with the full knowledge of his
physicians, as a way to alleviate the violent nausea he suffered
as the result of cancer chemotherapy treatments.&nbsp;
&quot;Because of ... marijuana, my last two courses of
chemotherapy were almost nausea-free,&quot; Brookhiser
recounted.&nbsp; &quot;There was only one problem -- I had to
become a criminal to do this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representing the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
(NACDL) was Attorney Jeralyn E. Merritt of Denver,
Colorado.&nbsp; Merritt testified in favor of changes recently
enacted by the U.S. Sentencing Commission and approved by
Congress adopting a universal plant/weight ratio of 100 grams be
used in marijuana sentencing.&nbsp; Merritt argued that efforts
by some members of Congress to re-enact a 1000 gram per plant
ratio for marijuana plants were not justified.&nbsp; &quot;For Congress
to step in now,&quot; she testified, &quot;in the absence of new
and compelling evidence that the [current law] is scientifically
unsound or otherwise irrational, flies in the face of the
authority granted to the [U.S.] Sentencing Commission.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Appearing before the committee on an opposing panel were
Stephanie Haynes, President of Drug Watch International, Dr. Eric
A. Voth of the International Drug Strategy Institute, D.A.R.E. officer
Donald Hayes of the Alexandria Virginia Police Department, and
Tom Hedrick, Vice Chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free
America.&nbsp; All four speakers testified in favor of continuing
to maintain strict penalties for the use of marijuana and
encouraged Congress to strengthen their anti-drug efforts.&nbsp;
In addition, both Ms. Haynes and Dr. Voth voiced their disapproval
over the efficacy of medical marijuana and the introduction of HR
2618.&nbsp; Ignoring the fact that thousands of seriously ill
patients risk arrest daily to acquire marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for a variety of serious illnesses including glaucoma, cancer,
and the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS, Voth testified
that only &quot;the pro-marijuana forces [continue to] drive the medical
marijuana issue.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although <b>NORML</b> was encouraged by the opportunity to
testify before the congressional subcommittee, the organization
expressed concern that Subcommittee Chairman, Bill McCollum -- a
former two-time co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation
himself -- refused to hear testimony from Harvard Medical School
Professor and international authority on medical marijuana, Dr. Lester
Grinspoon, M.D.&nbsp; &quot;Because of the importance [<b>NORML</b>]
place[s] on the need for medical marijuana, we had asked if we
might have ... [Dr.] Lester Grinspoon ... present our testimony
here today, but [we] were told by the committee that would not be
possible,&quot; Stroup explained.&nbsp; &quot;[However,] Dr.
Grinspoon remains available should this committee elect to hear
from him at some point.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the subcommittee allowed a medical doctor
testify to the purported dangers of marijuana, but denied <b>NORML</b>
the opportunity to present expert medical testimony on the therapeutic
effectiveness of cannabis is truly unfortunate, said <b>NORML</b>'s
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Since the
Subcommittee on Crime may be voting on proposed medical marijuana legislation
in the near future, one can only hope that they will hold
additional hearings at which time expert medical testimony on
both sides of the issue will be accepted.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>New Drug Czar Sworn In; Clinton Proposes
Massive Expansion Of White House Anti-Drug Efforts</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 6, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; In a
move that signifies a 180 degree departure from the President's
previous decisions to downsize the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, President Clinton recently asked Congress for
$3.4 million in supplemental spending to expand the staff of the
ONDCP from 25 to 150 individuals.&nbsp; This money would be in
addition to the extra $250 million dollars already appropriated
by the White House to beef up anti-drug efforts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The general wants some troops to command,&quot; explained
one White House official to the Washington Post on Clinton's
sudden move to increase the ONDCP staff, &quot;and Clinton wanted
the general.&quot;&nbsp; Newly appointed drug czar, retired
General Barry R. McCaffrey was sworn in to office yesterday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to his title as drug czar, McCaffrey was granted a
slot on the National Security Council.&nbsp; The former general
was also given approval from the White House to carry over 30 former
Pentagon staffers to his new operation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;According to the most recent FBI statistics, the federal
government's war on drugs is primarily a war against marijuana
users,&quot; explained <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Clinton's latest effort to drastically
increase the 'war' effort is yet another step in the wrong
direction and a wasteful expenditure of valuable taxpayers
dollars.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Issues Principles Of Responsible
Cannabis Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 29, 1995, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the nation's
oldest and largest interest group dedicated solely to marijuana
law reform, has adopted a set of Principles of Responsible
Cannabis Use.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> maintains that when marijuana is
enjoyed responsibly, subjecting users to harsh criminal and civil
penalties provides no public health benefit and causes terrible
injustices.&nbsp; For reasons of public safety, public health,
economics, and justice, the prohibition laws should be repealed
to the extent that they criminalize responsible marijuana
use.&nbsp; The key points to the Principles of Responsible Use
are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Cannabis consumption is for adults only.</b>&nbsp;
        Many things and activities are suitable for young people,
        but others absolutely are not.&nbsp; Children do not
        drive cars, enter into contracts or marry, and they must
        not use drugs. </li>
    <li><b>The responsible cannabis user does not operate a motor vehicle
        or other dangerous machinery impaired by cannabis.</b>&nbsp;
        Although cannabis is said by most experts to be safer than
        alcohol and many prescription drugs with motorists,
        public safety demands that impaired drivers be taken off
        the road and that objective measures of impairment be developed
        and used, rather than chemical testing. </li>
    <li><b>The responsible cannabis user will carefully consider his/her
        setting and regulate use accordingly.</b>&nbsp; The responsible
        cannabis consumer will be vigilant as to conditions -- time,
        place, mood, etc. -- and does not hesitate to say
        &quot;no&quot; when those conditions are not conducive to
        a safe, pleasant and/or productive experience. </li>
    <li><b>Use of cannabis, to the extent that it impairs health, personal
        development or achievement, is abuse and should be
        resisted by responsible cannabis users.</b>&nbsp; Abuse means
        harm.&nbsp; Some cannabis use is harmful; most is
        not.&nbsp; That which is harmful should be discouraged; that
        which is not need not be. </li>
    <li><b>The responsible cannabis user does not violate the rights
        of others, observes accepted standards of courtesy and
        public propriety, and respects the preferences of those
        who wish to avoid cannabis entirely.</b>&nbsp; Regardless
        of the legal status of cannabis, responsible users will
        adhere to emerging tobacco smoking protocols in public
        and private places. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><b>Vermont House Of Representatives Approves
Hemp Cultivation Legislation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 29, 1996, Montpelier, Vermont:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that proposes to permit development of a domestic
hemp industry in Vermont (H.783) was approved by the House of
Representatives by a voice vote today.&nbsp; The bill had
received wide-scale bi-partisan support one day earlier when the
second reading was approved by a 108-33 vote.&nbsp; The
overwhelming number of votes in favor of the legislation would
override the Governor's veto if he chooses to oppose it.&nbsp; In
the past, Gov. Howard B. Dean has spoken out against hemp
cultivation claiming that it would be tantamount to legalizing
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Vermont legislation is similar to a pending Colorado hemp
bill introduced by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn) and would
authorize the University of Vermont to undertake research of industrial
hemp production in the state.&nbsp; A key aspect of this research
would include growing test plots of industrial hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill is expected to go to the Senate after session tomorrow
barring any last minute calls for reconsideration.&nbsp;
Legislators note that there appears to be little opposition for
the proposal in the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. Thomas Bahre (R-Addison), chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee told the <em>Vermont Times</em> that he hopes to begin
taking testimony on the bill as soon as March 18.&nbsp; &quot;We want
to seriously look at whether there is anybody out there to buy
this fiber, and what its potential is to create manufacturing
jobs,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;If it doesn't then I don't see a
need to go any further.&nbsp; But, I do think this fiber has the
potential to have land produce something that isn't producing
milk.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric
properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown legally
throughout much of Europe and Asia and can be used to produce a
variety of products such as cosmetics, textiles, paper, paints, plastics,
and animal feed. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Hemp To Be Planted On American Indian Soil</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 17, 1996, Chandler Heights, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
The Coalition for Hemp Awareness (CHA) announced that the Navajo
Nation has issued a resolution allowing for hemp cultivation to
take place on American Indian soil.&nbsp; CHA has scheduled a
spring planting to take place on March 17, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navaho Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson
and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the
purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;
The trio were so successful in their education campaign that the
resolution was passed by the Navajo Nation with a unanimous vote
of 30-0. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although over 30,000 acres of the Navajo Nation have been
allocated for hemp cultivation, CHA's initial planting will be
limited to a small seed bank crop.&nbsp; In addition, CHA states
that the organization is close to securing approval for similar
cultivation projects from ten other tribes located across the
United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite
the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural base
crop.&nbsp; CHA is a political advocacy network group that
assimilates and disseminates hemp information to both politicians
and the public. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the Coalition for Hemp Awareness or
the Navajo Hemp Project, please contact CHA @ (602) 988-9355 or

<p align="center"><b>Illinois Supreme Court Finds Cannabis Tax
Stamps Unconstitutional</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 15, 1996, Illinois:</b>&nbsp; The
Illinois Supreme Court has declared that the application of the
state's Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act in the case a
defendant who had previously plead guilty to drug possession
charges constitutes double jeopardy under the United States
Constitution.&nbsp; This decision follows closely on the heels of
similar rulings reached by both an Arizona trial court and the
Indiana Supreme Court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion of the court, Justice Harrison rejected the
state's argument that the application of the Illinois act is not
contingent upon commission of a crime.&nbsp; &quot;Under the Act,
the only persons liable for the tax are 'dealers,'&quot; the
justice writes.&nbsp; &quot;[T]o be a 'dealer' within the meaning
of the statute, one must have carried out certain enumerated acts
'in violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or the
Cannabis Control Act,' both of which are criminal statutes.&nbsp; [Hence,]
by the terms of the Act, criminal conduct is a prerequisite to
tax liability. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Consequently,] because the Department of Revenue cannot
determine whether a person is a 'dealer' subject to the tax
unless and until that person had been found guilty of the
underlying criminal offense, the Cannabis and Controlled
Substances Tax Act not only assumes that a crime has been
committed, it also presupposes that the offending party has been
arrested, charged and convicted.&nbsp; In this regard, the act
... [is] a form of punishment for double jeopardy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this case, please refer to Docket No.
77708 (Keith Robert Wilson v. The Department Of Revenue), filed
February 15, 1996.&nbsp; For more information on cannabis tax
stamps, please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>

<p align="center"><b>California Medical Marijuana Initiative
Heads Toward November State Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 26, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b> An
initiative to legalize the medical use of marijuana appears
headed for the November 1996 California ballot thanks to crucial
last-minute financial support from a group of major donors.&nbsp;
The new donations make it likely that supporters will garner the
necessary number of signatures by the April 20 deadline to place
the initiative on the ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Initiative organizers were elated by the gift and expressed
confidence that voters would approve the measure.&nbsp; Polls
indicate that a solid majority of Californians support the
medicinal legalization of marijuana.&nbsp; The current medical
marijuana initiative would guarantee the right of patients to use marijuana
for medicinal purposes if they possess a physician's
recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana has remained illegal despite growing acceptance
in the health care community of its efficacy in the treatment of
cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and
muscle spasticity.&nbsp; Under current state law, Californians
who cultivate marijuana for medicinal use may be subject to up to
three years in state prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 medical marijuana initiative has been endorsed by the
cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa
Cruz and Marin Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses
Association; the Los Angeles AIDS Commission, the California
Multiple Sclerosis Society, the California Seniors' Legislature,
and many other organizations and public leaders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to statements made to the <em>New York Times</em> by
Dennis Peron, Director of the California Medical Marijuana
Initiative, the all-volunteer signature drive has gathered
approximately 200,000 signatures to date.&nbsp; The coalition
must collect 600,000 signatures by April 20 to place the initiative
on the November ballot. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Cincinnati Buyers Club Founder Takes
Offensive Following Police Raid</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 29, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Cannabis Buyers
Club -- one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across
the country that supplies marijuana as a therapeutic to seriously
ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation -- has
taken the offensive since his home was raided by police on
February 16.&nbsp; Evans' home served as the headquarters for the
club which distributed marijuana to approximately 30 patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans and his attorney, marijuana activist Gatewood Galbraith,
held a press conference on the Covington courthouse steps at the
Kenton County Municipal Building to protest the police
action.&nbsp; &quot;If they want to make this the battle [for
medical marijuana clubs,] then we're ready to do battle,&quot; Galbraith
told the press.&nbsp; &quot;Only a fascist nation would keep this
premiere medicine from the hands of seriously ill patients ...
for whom it is the best therapy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even though Evans' house was raided over one week ago and
marijuana was confiscated, law enforcement officials have yet to
produce a warrant for Evans' arrest.&nbsp; Even so, Evans' case
and subsequent press conference have drawn an exceptional amount
of favorable press coverage including features in the <em>Kentucky
Post</em>, <em>Cincinnati Post</em>, <em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>,
and at least two television news stations.&nbsp; Covington police
have refused to comment on the situation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am sick of living in a country where I can't be
free,&quot; summarized Evans.&nbsp; &quot;Give me liberty or give
me death.&nbsp; We are going to have a cannabis buyers
club.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 16, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
The home of activist and medical marijuana user Richard Evans has
been raided by law enforcement officials.&nbsp; Evans' house
served as the home base for the 9-year-old Cincinnati Cannabis
Buyers Club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans, who was not home at the time of the raid, subsequently
checked himself into a local hospital to combat onsetting
symptoms of manic depression -- a medical condition which he is treated
for.&nbsp; Evans stayed at the hospital throughout the weekend
and intends to turn himself over to local authorities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans informed <b>NORML</b> that he still has &quot;no idea&quot;
what charges may be pending against him, but speculated that he
may be facing felony offenses for two marijuana seedlings that
were present in his home.&nbsp; Ironically, witnesses report that
law enforcement officers failed to seize the seedlings. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 15, 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp;
A medical marijuana bill (Senate Bill 573) introduced by State
Senator Joe Mosley has unanimously passed the Senate Public

whole-smoked cannabis to that of the synthetic-THC drug Marinol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope this doesn't bog the bill down and undermine the

Years In Prison</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 15, 1996, Minneapolis, MN:</b>&nbsp;
Hemp activist and founder of the U.S. Hemp Company, Arlin Trout,
was sentenced to more than eight years in prison after being
found guilty of conspiring to possess more than 100 kilograms of
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Trout accused the prosecution of utilizing paid informers and
snitches to frame him and labeled himself a political prisoner
who is being targeted for his beliefs.&nbsp; Arlin's wife, Cathy,
will now be left to run the successful clothing business and
raise the Trout's six children on her own. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to his sentencing, Trout gave an impassioned speech to U.S.
District Judge James Rosenbaum.&nbsp; &quot;I was charged and
convicted of conspiring to sell a plant that grows wild in this region
and [that] once provided legal jobs for Minnesota.&nbsp; This
plant is the oldest, safest source of food, fuel, fiber and
medicine on Earth and has infinite industrial and medicinal value
to society. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... Fear and ignorance guided by greed and blind ambition
created the prohibition of hemp.&nbsp; I am morally and
intellectually compelled to resist these forces.&nbsp; When the
American people find out what hemp is and why it's really
illegal, may they deal with this government as harshly as it has
dealt with me. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although Trout's supporters applauded Arlin's bold speech, Judge
Rosenbaum was unmoved and sentenced Trout to the maximum sentence
recommended under the U.S. sentencing guidelines. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked if she felt that her husband's speech may have
increased the length of his sentence, Cathy Trout responded,
&quot;Why not stand up for your rights?&nbsp; One day in jail is
too long.&nbsp; You can't be expected to admit you're wrong when
you don't believe you are.&nbsp; You've got to live with yourself.&nbsp;
Besides, the extra time isn't going to destroy the fact that I
love him and his children love him, and no matter how long he's
in [prison], that won't change.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite Trout's incarceration, he is reportedly planning to run

Residents</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 21, 1996, Norman, OK:</b>&nbsp; A
month long hemp display arranged by the University of Oklahoma
NORML chapter is under fire from parents and local officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The three case exhibit, currently on display at The Norman Public
Library, advocates the legalization of the hemp plant for
industrial and agricultural purposes.&nbsp; On display are
various products made from hemp such as hats, shoes, and
backpacks as well as a caption next to a picture of former
President George Washington encouraging farmers to: &quot;Grow
hemp.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">School patron Robert Coffman, who said he was representing other
parents, recently criticized the display at a City Council
meeting and argued that such an exhibit was inappropriate for children.&nbsp;
In addition, Mayor Bill Nations reports that he has had at least
a dozen calls from people opposed to the exhibit.&nbsp; Nations
admits that both city and library officials had tried to prevent
UO NORML from running the exhibit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Tony Smith, a member of UO NORML, states that the library has
received an equal number of compliments as well as complaints
from patrons regarding the controversial exhibit.&nbsp; He
further argues that children should be allowed to view the
exhibit so they can learn about the historical and industrial
uses of the hemp plant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We teach our children that we have a free country where
dissenting opinions can be expressed,&quot; Smith says.&nbsp;
&quot;Our children are well-informed about the government's
position on marijuana.&nbsp; Our exhibit in a public forum
demonstrates that we ... live in a country where freedom of
expression exists.&quot; <br>

Anderson, a long-time police chief for the town of Fairfax is one
of the latest law enforcement officials to speak out in favor of
California's current medical marijuana initiative. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe there is adequate unbiased and scientific
evidence that marijuana does have medicinal benefit.&nbsp; When
we consider the associated consequences of other prescription
drugs it seems illogical to exclude marijuana as another
alternative available to physicians for prescription. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... Even if there are no other benefits than relief of pain
or stimulation of appetite, there appears to be a legitimate
place for marijuana in the wide array of legally prescribed
drugs.&nbsp; The legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes
seems to strike a reasonable balance between the abuse and illegal
use of the drug and its legitimate medicinal value that could be
available through prescriptive use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;With the increased public attention on my own support of
the medicinal use of marijuana, I find that many other
conservative persons share this belief.&nbsp; ...Marijuana is not
the street degenerate that ravages society.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Anderson has been employed in law enforcement and public safety
since 1964 and has been a police chief for 14 years.&nbsp; He is
also a member of the U.S. Army Reserve with rank of Lieutenant Colonel. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Judge Drops Charges Against Medical
Marijuana User Todd McCormick</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 13, 1996, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Judge
Anthony Gretick has dismissed drug charges against medical
marijuana user and activist Todd McCormick.&nbsp; McCormick, who
has a prescription from a physician in Holland to use cannabis as
a medicine, was arrested this past summer when Ohio State
Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in
his van. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Gretick ruled that state troopers had illegally searched
McCormick's vehicle and ordered that the evidence be
suppressed.&nbsp; It is expected that the state will appeal
Gretick's verdict. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the beginning of this case, McCormick has maintained that
the search had been illegal and that the marijuana seized was
intended solely for medical use and not for sale.&nbsp;
McCormick, 25, is the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use
Club in California and was driving to his home state of Rhode
Island to establish a similar club when he was arrested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case garnered national headlines this past fall when
it was revealed that Judge Gretick was considering allowing
McCormick to have legal access to cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;
For much of his life, McCormick has used marijuana as a
therapeutic to alleviate pain associated with a rare strain of
cancer he suffers from known as histiocytosis X.&nbsp; While in
Holland, McCormick received a prescription for the use of 1 to 10
grams of marijuana daily from Dr. R. T. Trossel of the Preventive
Medicine Center in Rotterdam. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I'm sure he can't live without it,&quot; Trossel notes,
&quot;because he becomes completely paralyzed.&nbsp; ...I am
convinced [that] there are no other drugs that would give him the
same relief.&nbsp; He's tried them all ... [and] ... this seems
to have the best effect on him.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick, who had recently been residing in the Netherlands,
states that he is pleased with Gretick's ruling and plans on
returning to Rhode Island shortly.&nbsp; He notes that he is
considering filing charges against the state of Ohio. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Sentence Reduction Bill
Introduced in California</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
State Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) has introduced
legislation (AB 2120) that would provide some relief for patients
who choose to cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp;
The bill (AB 2120) would reclassify such personal cultivation and
use of medical marijuana as a misdemeanor, thereby allowing
judges to grant a wide variety of sentencing alternatives.&nbsp;
Currently, marijuana cultivation in California is categorized as
a felony offense and those found guilty may be subject to up to
three years in state prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical sentence reduction bill is scheduled to be heard
before the Public Safety Committee of the State Assembly in
March.&nbsp; Burton's bill represents the fourth year in a row
that the state legislature has attempted to reconcile the
continuing demand from the medical community for access to
medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This bill is a real ... effort to relieve the suffering of
thousands of seriously ill people,&quot; says Dennis Peron,
Director of Californians for Compassionate Use.&nbsp; &quot;This
is surely the least we can do.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Californians for Compassionate Use coalition is currently
attempting to place a medical marijuana initiative on the 1996
general election ballot by collecting 600,000 signatures by April 20,

<p align="center"><b>Hemp Legislation Gathers Steam With Vermont
Legislators</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 9, 1996, Montpelier, Vermont:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that proposes to permit development of a domestic
hemp industry in Vermont was passed by the House Agriculture
Committee in a 7-3 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Modeled closely after a Colorado hemp bill, Vermont's legislation
(H.783) would allow limited test cultivation of industrial hemp
to take place at the University of Vermont for the next two
years.&nbsp; The bill will go before the house floor for a second
reading on February 20. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There is nothing on the radar screen that has nearly the
magnitude of economic benefit that hemp has for our
farmers,&quot; states Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), one of The
bill's primary supporters.&nbsp; &quot;The federal government has
no business interfering with state legislation.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Maslack notes that the hemp issue is a bi-partisan issue with
&quot;momentum in the house.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Wait Till Next Year: Hawaii House
Agriculture Committee<br>
Postpones Voting On Hemp Cultivation Bill Until 1997</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 12, 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp;
The House Agriculture Committee has voted to postpone deciding on
a bill that would allow Hawaii to cultivate industrial hemp until
&quot;more scientific information&quot; can be gathered. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Legislation introduced by state Rep. David Tarnas would amend the
state law to authorize the production, possession, and commerce
of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii.&nbsp; Tarnas maintains
that the cultivation of industrial hemp in Hawaii could provide
local farmers with a prosperous economic and environmental
future.&nbsp; &quot;Hawaii has the opportunity to capture a significant
market share as the first hemp production in the U.S.A.,&quot; he
wrote this past November. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Less enthusiastic were the members of the House Agriculture
Committee who decided to hold off acting on Tarnas' bill until
the 1997 legislative session.&nbsp; The committee's main concern
appeared to be over the question of cross-pollination, stated an
aid of Rep. Tarnas who attended the hearings.&nbsp; Law
enforcement officials testified that marijuana growers would be
able to grow psychoactive strains of cannabis alongside of
non-psychoactive hemp.&nbsp; Hemp proponents denied this claim
and argued that the growth of high grade marijuana was not
possible in such close proximity to industrial hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An aid of Rep. Tarnas maintains that he will
&quot;absolutely&quot; reintroduce hemp cultivation legislation next
year.&nbsp; In the meantime, the House of Representatives has
released a concurrent resolution (H.C.R. 28) requesting the
establishment of a &quot;state licensing program for the
agricultural production of industrial cannabis hemp for food,
fuel, and fiber, and the establishment of a pilot project to
conduct agronomic research on industrial cannabis hemp.&quot; <br>

Hemp<br>
Hearings For Colorado Cultivation Bill Begin Today</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 8, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp;
Hearings begin today before the Colorado State Senate Agriculture
Committee to determine the fate of a bill that would allow
Colorado to become the first state to grow industrial hemp in
almost 40 years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
permits the planting of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp
in Colorado in 1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale commercial production of
hemp to begin in 1998. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Appearing before the Committee today are a wide assortment of
hemp activists, businessmen, farmers, and lobbyists.&nbsp;
However, Casey speculates that the bill's most influential
endorsement may come from Hollywood actor and businessman, Woody
Harrelson.&nbsp; In a fax to the Agriculture Committee, Harrelson
stated that he &quot;will personally guarantee that all hemp
produced in Colorado will be purchased at fair market
prices.&quot;&nbsp; Harrelson is a hemp proponent who has
commercial interests in both the clothing and paper industry. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;That [endorsement] might do the best for us,&quot; notes
Casey.&nbsp; In the past, a major concern for the committee was
whether there is a legitimate market for industrial hemp.&nbsp;
Harrelson's announcement demonstrates that there are buyers
willing and waiting, the senator states. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Casey's legislation is approved by the 7-member Senate
Agriculture Committee, the bill will then move on to the Senate
floor for a vote. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Circuit Court Ruling Allows For Religious
Defense In Marijuana Cases</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 2, 1995, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Rastafarians can defend themselves against charges of marijuana
possession on religious grounds, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals has ruled. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the three
judge appeals panel overturned the lower court convictions of
three individuals charged with possessing marijuana.&nbsp; The
Circuit Court ruled that a Montana District Court Judge had
violated the act by failing to allow the Rastafarian defendants
to present evidence demonstrating marijuana's sacred role in
their religion.&nbsp; However, the Court upheld additional drug
convictions against the defendants. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The court's decision to negate the marijuana possession
charges against these defendants is a significant ruling,&quot;
stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;To the best of <b>NORML</b>'s knowledge, this decision is
the first time that a marijuana conviction has been overturned on
the basis of freedom of religion.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 strengthened
protections for religious groups and was intended to curb
criminal prosecutions that interfere with religious
beliefs.&nbsp; The act requires the government to show a
compelling interest for any prosecution that significantly
hinders the exercise of religious freedom. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Under RFRA, ... the government had the obligation, first,
to show that the application of the marijuana laws to the
defendants was in furtherance of a compelling governmental
interest and, second, to show that the application of these laws
to these defendants was the least restrictive means of furthering
that compelling governmental interest,&quot; Judge John Noonan
wrote for the court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the court maintained that the government could
challenge the defendant's claims that they were, in fact,
Rastafarians. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The government should be free to cross-examine [the defendants]
on whether they ... are Rastafarians and to introduce evidence
negating their assented claims,&quot; added Judge Noonan.&nbsp;
&quot;It is not enough in order to enjoy the protections of the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act to claim the name of religion
as a protective cloak.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>
@ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp; A copy of the decision is currently

<p align="center"><b>Iowa Supreme Court &quot;Just Says No&quot;
To Controversial License Suspension Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 1996, Des Moines, IA:</b>&nbsp;
Iowa's federally mandated &quot;smoke a joint, lose your license
law&quot; has been ruled unconstitutional by the State Supreme
Court.&nbsp; As a result, hundreds of convicted drug offenders,
many found guilty of simple marijuana possession, will have their
driving privileges restored.&nbsp; In addition, the state stands
to lose more than $16 million annually in federal highway aid. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With its recent <a href="../LAWS/dressler.html">decision</a>, the
court nullified a 1993 state law that imposes an automatic six-month
driver's license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related.&nbsp;
According to the court, the license suspension constituted
&quot;double jeopardy&quot; because it was a second punishment
for a single criminal action.&nbsp; &quot;There [is] no direct connection
between possession of controlled substances, driving, and public
safety,&quot; wrote the court.&nbsp; &quot;The amended statute
authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at
enhancing punishment for controlled substance possession.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Iowa Department of Transportation estimates that nearly 8,500
people had been subject to license suspension since the law took
effect two years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's the first step in the right direction of common
sense,&quot; said Attorney Jeff Crispin of Des Moines.&nbsp;
&quot;There's no logical connection between these drug offenses
and driving privileges.&nbsp; It doesn't make sense to have these
penalties.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the recent decision, transportation officials have

Persons who are living with AIDS and cancer from the Sacramento
County area and beyond will be rallying on the West Steps of the
California State Capitol Building Saturday, February 17 at 2:00
to show their support for medical marijuana.&nbsp; Sacramento
County Director of Californians for Compassionate Use, Ryan
Landers, will present state lawmakers with signatures gathered in
Sacramento during the first half of the statewide effort to
qualify the &quot;Compassionate Use Act of 1996&quot; for
inclusion in the 1996 election ballot and demonstrators will be
conducting an all day sign-up drive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana proponents need to gather 600,000 signatures
from registered voters by April 20 in order to put the Initiative
on the ballot for the 1996 election.&nbsp; To date, the all
volunteer drive has amassed approximately 125,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's Medical Marijuana Initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation that would
allow for the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; If the initiative
is passed by California voters this fall, the bill will become
law immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The [Medical Marijuana] Initiative will simply set the

<p align="center"><b>NORML Targets Republican Task Force: Urges
Panel To Lift Ban On Medical Cannabis, Reconsider
Decriminalization Of Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 1, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
has sent a formal letter and 50-page informative booklet to each
member of the new Republican task force on drugs.&nbsp; The
letter urges the committee to lift the federal government's ban
on medical cannabis and re-examine the decriminalization of
marijuana as a public policy.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> also asks the
task force to include testimony from medical experts on these
subjects when the committee holds public hearings on drug use
later this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Enclosures to the letter include endorsements of the potential of
medical marijuana from such well respected organizations as the
National Academy of Sciences, American Public Health Association
and others.&nbsp; Also included in the booklet is a summary of
the 1981 Monitoring the Future briefing paper that stated,
&quot;decriminalization [of marijuana] has had virtually no
effect either on the marijuana use or related attitudes and
belief about marijuana use among American young people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This compendium makes a strong argument for a federal
re-evaluation of our current marijuana policies,&quot; says <b>NORML</b>
Deputy National Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It is
intended to persuade as well as inform the newly established
Republican drug task force.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter and booklet are two of <b>NORML</b>'s latest efforts
to garner political attention and support for U.S. Representative
Barney Frank's federal medical marijuana bill (H.R. 2618).&nbsp; Frank's
legislation would amend the federal law to permit doctor's to
prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill
patients.&nbsp; The bill has been referred to the Commerce Subcommittee
on Health and the Environment and the Judiciary Subcommittee on
Crime where it is presently awaiting a vote. <br>

Washington State Senator Jeanne Kohl, D-36th District, along with
Sens. Bob McCaslin, R-4th District; Darlene Fairley, D-32nd
District; and Pat Thibaudeau, D-43rd District, has introduced a
bill (S.B. 6744) that would allow further research to be
conducted regarding the medical uses of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation, known as the Controlled Substances Therapeutic
Research Act, finds that there is a need for research regarding
the cultivation, processing, and distribution of medicinal
marijuana under strictly controlled circumstances.&nbsp;
Therefore, S.B. 6744 amends current state statutes, creates new
sections, and allows for appropriations to achieve those ends. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill has been referred to the 25-member Committee on Ways and
Means and must be brought to an initial vote by February 6. <br>

Dismissed</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 31, 1996, Ft. Lauderdale, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Attorney Norman Elliot Kent announced today that all charges
against Elvy Musikka, a 56-year old glaucoma patient from
Hollywood, Florida, and one of only eight people in the country
allowed by the federal government to use marijuana for medical
treatment, have been dropped by the Alachua County State's
Attorney's Office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Musikka was arrested by Gainesville police on December 9, 1995
while performing on stage at the sixth annual Florida
Hempfest.&nbsp; Despite having a prescription for marijuana
issued to her by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),
Mussika was arrested after she took out one of her marijuana
cigarettes and began smoking.&nbsp; She was dragged off the stage
arm-and-arm by two police officers and was later charged with
possession of marijuana and disorderly conduct.&nbsp; &quot;The police
just attacked the stage, reached up and grabbed me, and knocked
me down,&quot; Musikka said.&nbsp; &quot;I was in total
shock.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The State Attorney honorably entered a nolle prosequi
[decision not to prosecute] all charges after we presented them
with the medical and legal documentation that supported our

A trial date has been set for April 3, 1996, in the case of
Johann Moore, the longtime marijuana activist who was arrested
last August when law enforcement officials busted New York City's
underground cannabis buyers club.&nbsp; Moore is the coordinator
of the club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At a preliminary hearing, Judge Stolz of Manhattan's Criminal
Court chose not to dismiss felony sales charges against
Moore.&nbsp; Stolz refused the defense's motion to dismiss on the
grounds that the sale took place in a public space and because
Moore has no formal training in medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore has stated that he has no intention of ceasing operation of
the club. <br>

The Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) released the
following statements concerning President Clinton's nomination of
Army General Barry R. McCaffrey as the nation's new &quot;Drug
Czar.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;General McCaffrey has an impressive record of service to
this country,&quot; says George R. Vickers, Executive Director of
WOLA.&nbsp; &quot;But what is needed is a fundamental shift in
U.S. anti-narcotic policies, away from failed military strategies
that have had little impact on the supply of illicit drugs coming
to the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Regardless of his personal qualities, McCaffrey's
nomination symbolizes the misguided militarization of U.S. drug
policy,&quot; adds WOLA Senior Associate Colleta Younger,
&quot;and suggests a continued erosion of civilian control over
law enforcement efforts in this field.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As Commander in Chief of the United States Southern Command,
General McCaffrey has overseen the U.S. military's anti-narcotics
operations in Latin America.&nbsp; The WOLA has monitored human

has produced numerous reports on U.S. anti-narcotics policy in

<p align="center"><b>Circuit Judge's Dissent In Urinalysis Case
Could Spur Supreme Court Review</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 24, 1996, Atlanta, GA:</b>&nbsp; The
11th Circuit Court has ruled that a Georgia law requiring all
political candidates running for state office to undergo drug
screening urinalysis is constitutional, but it is the dissent
that has attorney Walker Chandler talking. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a great decision,&quot; Walker said.&nbsp; &quot;Have
you read the dissent.&nbsp; It hits the nail right on the head.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a scathing 11 page dissent, Circuit Judge Rosemary Barkett
writes, &quot;I do not believe that the suspicionless search in
these circumstances serves any special governmental need beyond
the normal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe
that the candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmental
interests. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">...We are not merely dealing with the denial of a job
opportunity, but with the denial of opportunity to participate in
our democratic form of government.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barkett's dissent also calls into question apparent First
Amendment violations posed by the controversial Georgia
law.&nbsp; &quot;The majority maintains that the government's
purpose [in passing this legislation] is not suppression of free
expression.&nbsp; Yet, it supports its holding by citing the importance
of ensuring that elected officials are 'persons appreciative of
the perils of drug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction
efforts.' <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holding
public office appears to be a content-based restriction on free
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Chandler, who filed the action against the Georgia statute and
served as his own legal counsel maintains that he will forgo an
&quot;en banc&quot; review of his case and will attempt to take
his appeal directly to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He intends to
argue that the law violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp; Referring to the Court's
decision last year to uphold the constitutionality of a
Washington state law mandating random and warrantless searches of
high school athletes partly on the notion that school children
live under fewer constitutional protections than adults, Chandler
fires, &quot;The only way the Supreme Court could [then] approve
of Georgia's law is by affirming that all Georgians are
[children.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s recently reformed Amicus Curiae Committee is
currently reviewing the 11th Circuit Court decision and will
consider filing an amicus brief if the Supreme Court decides to
hear the case. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Activists Intending To Sell Marijuana At The
Super Bowl Gain National Exposure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 14, 1995, Tempe, AZ:</b>&nbsp; The
rumor that marijuana will be sold openly during this year's Super
Bowl has garnered the attention of the national media in recent
weeks and has even made it to the pages of Time Magazine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representatives from the Richard M. Davis Cannabis Hemp Co. plan
to be on hand selling marijuana, states the magazine.&nbsp;
&quot;I plan to have a press conference in the parking lot,&quot;
says longtime marijuana activist and R.M. Davis spokesman Ron
Kiczenski, &quot;[I will] tell people where they can buy
[marijuana] in the vicinity of the Super Bowl.&nbsp; Not within
the secured zone you have to get a special venue license for, but
outside of that zone.&nbsp; They'll be able to buy legal
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Kiczenski and Davis have openly sold marijuana in Arizona
before.&nbsp; Ironically, on one occasion, the activists boldly
set up shop in front of the Arizona State Capitol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The activists latest plan stems from a ruling by Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges
against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence
that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing
his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted
for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the
Arizona Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Under Title
42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license
and tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. <br>

scheduled to begin February 26 at the Lucas County Court House. <br>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Supreme Court To Review Double Jeopardy
Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 12, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The United States Supreme Court has agreed to review the case
that has virtually halted civil forfeitures across the country
and resulted in thousands of convicted individuals asking courts
to vacate their convictions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In <a href="http://www.fear.org/405kpg.html">United States v.
$405,089.23 in U.S. Currency</a>, the Court of Appeals for the
9th Circuit ruled that civil forfeitures constitute punishment
for the purpose of double jeopardy.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, courts
across the country were flooded with petitions from inmates
claiming that they had been punished by civil forfeiture and
demanding that their convictions must be vacated.&nbsp; Consequently,
prosecutors throughout the nation have been besieged with
litigation which requires that they defend cases they thought
they had already won. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Criminal forfeiture statutes allow the government to simply
combine the forfeiture and the criminal prosecution in the same
case.&nbsp; However, civil forfeitures are preferred by the
government because the property owner is presumed guilty and
because prosecutors have the added benefit of impoverishing the
property owner as he or she faces a criminal prosecution.&nbsp;
Should the Supreme Court affirm the 9th Circuit's decision, even
in part, many convictions and civil forfeitures will have to be
undone. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both the government and the property owners urged the Supreme
Court to take this case to resolve a host of issues which have
arisen in the 6 years since the Court ruled in 1989 that civil forfeiture
could be considered punishment for double jeopardy purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on civil forfeiture, please contact
counsel for the property owners: Jeffrey Steinborn (206)

<p align="center"><b>Exiting Drug Czar Takes &quot;Pot&quot; Shot
At New Hemp Shoe</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 13, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The name of Adidas' new hemp-based sneaker has fallen under
staunch criticism from exiting drug czar, Lee Brown.&nbsp; In a
January 5 letter addressed to Adidas America President Steven
Wynne, Brown asserts that the product's brand name -- &quot;The Hemp&quot;
-- was specifically chosen to glorify and capitalize on the drug
culture.&nbsp; &quot;On behalf of the children of
America...,&quot; Brown writes, &quot;I call upon you not to
market [this] shoe.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to the drug czar's sharp reproach, Wynne answers that
the shoe's brand name was chosen simply as a way to call
attention to the industrial material used to construct the
shoe.&nbsp; &quot;Adidas ... is working to produce products that
are environmentally responsible,&quot; responds Wynne.&nbsp;
&quot;One such material is hemp.&nbsp; ...Consistent with this
direction, we have produced a shoe using hemp.&nbsp; ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Furthermore,] products made from fiber hemp, including our
shoes have no drug qualities.&nbsp; I don't believe you will
encounter anyone smoking our shoes anytime soon.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This past Friday, Brown shot off a second letter to Wynne,
chastising the &quot;sarcastic&quot; tone of his previous
response and again repeating his demand that Adidas find another
name for its shoe.&nbsp; &quot;What the shoe is made of is not
the problem,&quot; Brown counters.&nbsp; &quot;The problem is
what you call it.&nbsp; ...I do not think it is in the goal of
curbing drug abuse to imply that drugs are cool.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Adidas spokesman John Fread says the company has not yet decided
whether it will respond to Brown's latest letter.&nbsp; The
controversial Adidas shoe hit stores in December, but has not yet been
publicly advertised. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Florida Schools To Consider Drug Testing
Students</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 12, 1996, Fort Myers, FL:</b>&nbsp;
The Lee County school board is considering whether to impose
random drug tests on its entire upper level student body as a way
to deter teen drug use.&nbsp; The proposed tests would be given
regardless of reasonable suspicion and would extend to all students
in middle and high school.&nbsp; School board members intend to
decide on the issue before the next school year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think there is a [drug] problem,&quot; board member Pat
Riley told the Fort Myers News Press.&nbsp; &quot;When I mention
it to students, they jokingly say: 'There goes the whole
basketball team, or the whole football team.'&nbsp; I don't think
that's funny. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lee County school officials note that the schools already undergo
random searches by drug dogs of students' lockers, although few
drugs have been found.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Superintendent Bobbie
D'Alessandro states that results of a survey of 5,000 Lee County
high school students demonstrate that there is a drug problem. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Clinton Administration Close To Naming New
Drug Czar</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 17, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Army Lt. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey is a leading contender to be the
nation's next drug czar, reports a recent story in The Washington
Post. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Post article quotes an unnamed senior administration official
who said McCaffrey is &quot;looking good&quot; for the
position.&nbsp; McCaffrey is one of the country's most decorated
generals and in the past has taken a hard-line stance against
drugs.&nbsp; He recently criticized the United States' current drug
interdiction efforts during a public forum at the Heritage
Foundation, a Washington DC Republican think-tank. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many political analysts speculate that appointing a tough,
no-nonsense military figure to head the federal &quot;war on
drugs&quot; would be a wise strategic move for the Clinton
administration, which has often been criticized for appearing
&quot;soft&quot; on the illegal drug issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If McCaffrey is selected for the position, he would be the
nation's fourth drug czar, after William Bennett, former Florida
governor Bob Martinez, and Lee Brown.</p>

University of Oklahoma NORML will be running a month long hemp

challenged this decision and contacted the <a

<p align="center"><b>Canadian Hemp Activist, Businessman Busted
By Vancouver Police</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 4, Vancouver, Canada:</b>&nbsp; Police
have raided the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp
BC</a> store in Vancouver, British Columbia, and are charging the
store's owner, vocal hemp activist Marc Emery, and three employees
with selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp; Emery had been selling
marijuana seeds, along with hemp products and literature, from
his retail store for the last 19 months in open defiance of the
law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emery was recently featured in a front page article of the Wall
Street Journal where he boasted to have sold &quot;130,000
seeds&quot; this year alone. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The raid took place at approximately 1 p.m. and law enforcement
officials seized seeds and drug paraphernalia such as pipes,
bongs, and mushroom grow kits.&nbsp; A large Budget Rent-a-truck was
parked outside to help the police move Hemp BC's wide assortment
of products.&nbsp; Emery and three employees were taken away in
handcuffs and all four activists are being charged with trafficking
marijuana seeds and selling instruments and paraphernalia for
illicit drug use.&nbsp; If found guilty of both charges, all four
could face each life imprisonment and fines of $100,000. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Police Constable Anne Drennan states that the <a
href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> bust is
the first time in Vancouver history that trafficking charges have
been filed against individuals for selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp; Drennan
further added that she expects Emery -- a self-proclaimed
libertarian who has previously served time in jail for opening
his bookstore on Sunday in disobedience of Ontario's blue laws --
to conduct a very public court challenge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Emery and the three <a
href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> employees
were released Friday on their own recognizance.&nbsp; A
preliminary hearing has been set for February 8, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dana Larsen, editor of the magazine <i>Cannabis Canada</i>,
reports that the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp
BC</a> retail storefront continues to remain open for business in
spite of last Thursday's raid.&nbsp; &quot;We will be selling pipes,
bongs, and seeds as per usual, although we might be understocked
for a day or two,&quot; he says. <br>

<p align="center"><b>American Farm Bureau Supports Industrial
Hemp Research</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 11, 1995, Reno, Nevada:</b>&nbsp; The
American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest farming organization
in the United States, passed a resolution at its annual
convention calling for research that could lead to the
re-introduction of hemp into the American farm economy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The resolution, adopted by a unanimous vote of the 51 state
presidents and all 300 voting delegates, reads: &quot;We
recommend that [the] American Farm Bureau Federation encourage research
into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp
production in the United States.&nbsp; We further recommend that
such research includes planting test plots in the United States using
modern agricultural techniques.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric
properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown legally
throughout much of Europe and Asia and is being cultivated in
test plots in Australia and Canada. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Andrew Graves, incoming president of the Fayette County chapter
of the Kentucky Farm Bureau and vice-president of the Kentucky
Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, introduced the resolution
at the convention.&nbsp; &quot;What we are asking for is research
to determine whether industrial hemp can once again become a
profitable agricultural commodity for American farmers just as it
is for farmers around the world,&quot; Graves said in his
presentation.&nbsp; &quot;Where would agriculture be without
research?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a separate resolution, the AFB also voted to affirm its policy
in support of government efforts to eradicate illegal drugs,
including marijuana. <br>

Protest Rally</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 3, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to the protest the airplay of the NORML

U.S. Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has issued a letter to
Attorney General Janet Reno both condemning the actions of rally
organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting
an inquiry into whether federal law enforcement officials were

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Like many others who have voiced their disapproval over the
actions of the G.A.A.D. (i.e., National Writers Union, Boston
Coalition for Freedom of Expression, Mass/Cann, etc.), Frank is highly
critical of the actions of a Drug Enforcement Administration
official who allegedly took an active role in the protest.&nbsp;
&quot;It does not seem to me at all appropriate for a federal law
enforcement agent to accompany an individual [G.A.A.D. Executive
Director Georgette Watson] who is making a demand that a media
outlet cease broadcasting a particular album, no matter how ...
ill-advised you, I and the DEA might find it to be,&quot; Frank
writes.&nbsp; &quot;This [sort of conduct] puts the federal government
in the position of lending official support to an interference
with freedom of expression. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Therefore,] if in fact a DEA agent accompanied Ms. Watson
and lent support by his ... presence to her demand that the radio
station stop playing [the <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>] CD,
[then] that is a wholly inappropriate action for a federal law
enforcement official ... and I ask that you look into it and make
clear that this is not the sort of thing that should
happen.&quot; <br>

Drug Czar William Bennett and former U.S. Attorney General

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee's first report is &quot;descriptive&quot; rather

America,&quot; says Bennett. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Future reports and conferences will be aimed at addressing
potential solutions to America's violent crime problem, the
bipartisan task force announced.&nbsp; One of the problems that
the bipartisan commission intends to address is the notion that
America's current criminal justice system is simply a

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Activists Sue Prosecutors:&nbsp;
Hemp Proponents Claim Unlawful, Selective Prosecution In Hemp
Seed Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 28, Hilo, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp; Longtime
hemp activists Roger Christie and Aaron Anderson have filed a
civil lawsuit against Hawaii County prosecutor Jay Kimura and
Deputy Prosecutor Kay Iopa alleging that they were unlawfully and
selectively prosecuted for expressing their opinions regarding
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Christie and Anderson's suit maintains that the two were
selectively prosecuted by Iopa in 1992 for possessing apparently
sterile hemp seeds.&nbsp; The seeds had been imported from China
as birdseed in compliance with both state and federal laws.&nbsp;
Charges of &quot;commercial promotion of marijuana&quot; against Christie
were dismissed earlier this year, but the case against Anderson
is still pending. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The duo's lawsuit asserts that they were singled out primarily
for their outspoken beliefs regarding the positive uses for
hemp.&nbsp; Christie and Anderson note that while similar hemp
seeds are available and commonly sold in stores in Hawaii, they
were the only individuals targeted by prosecutors. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, the suit alleges that prosecutors violated
Christie's and Anderson's constitutional rights to &quot;freely
speak, petition their government, and be free from unjust
government oppression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The suit also alleges that Iopa misrepresented the facts against
Christie and Anderson.&nbsp; In 1992, police sent 800 seeds to
the state Department of Agriculture for germination tests.&nbsp;
According to Christie and Anderson, the report said that there
was zero germination.&nbsp; However, the activists maintain that
Iopa told the county grand jury, the Circuit Court, and the
Hawaii Supreme Court that 6 to 9 percent of the seeds germinated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Our lawsuit underscores the new energy in the hemp
movement,&quot; states Christie.&nbsp; &quot;We seek to make this
the last marijuana trial in Hawaii.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Christie and Anderson are seeking $3 million in damages. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on Christie and Anderson's lawsuit,

<p align="center"><b>Canada Set To Lessen Pot Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 1, Toronto, Canada:</b>&nbsp; A bill
that will revamp the way Canada deals with marijuana has passed
Parliament and is now in its final stages of becoming law.&nbsp;
Among the reforms included in the bill are a relaxing of the penalties
associated with the possession of small amounts of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;People charged with possession of less than 30 grams of
marijuana or one gram of hash or hash oil will no longer be
fingerprinted and they will have no criminal record,&quot; says
Steve Jeffrey, a spokesman for Canada's Health Ministry.&nbsp;
&quot;[However,] possession of the drug [will still] remain a crime,&quot;
he warns. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">That aspect of bill C-7 troubles <a
href="http://www.calyx.com/~normlca/">NORML Canada</a> President
Umberto Iorfida. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[The law] almost doesn't mean anything to me if you still
have to appear in court,&quot; he says.&nbsp; Other less critical
proponents of the bill view C-7 as striking a necessary balance
between a liberalizing public attitude toward the drug and the
fears of anti-drug groups and law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among the new marijuana sanctions proposed by the pending
legislation are community service or payment of a fine.&nbsp;
Revenue raised through marijuana possession fines will be used to
support marijuana related medical treatment programs and/or
rehabilitation programs, notes Iorfida. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The new law is expected to take effect this spring. <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Establishes Amicus Curiae Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an effort to establish <b>NORML</b> as a more
serious participant in the national debate over drug policy, <b>NORML</b>
has re-established an amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the
court&quot;) committee to offer legal assistance in important marijuana
related legal issues.&nbsp; The committee will be co-chaired by <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee members Michael D. Cutler, Esq. of Boston,
Massachusetts and C. Rabon Martin, Esq. of Tulsa, Oklahoma. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;An active <b>NORML</b> Amicus Committee will provide an
avenue for <b>NORML</b> to once again add its organizational
voice to some of the important legal issues of the day,&quot;
says <b>NORML</b> Executive Director Keith Stroup, Esq.&nbsp; &quot;The
committee will review requests that come into the national office
for amicus assistance and will file an amicus brief with the
court in the appropriate cases.&quot;&nbsp; Many policy groups
file amicus briefs in important and controversial legal cases as
way to assist the court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The first case before the new committee is a marijuana
cultivation case involving the question of whether dead marijuana
plants count as plants (with an assigned weight) or as actual
marijuana (measured by actual weight).&nbsp; The case (U.S. v
Shields) is currently on appeal before the 11th Circuit.&nbsp;
The committee further intends on filing a second brief in the
case of Seeley v Washington.&nbsp; Defendant Ralph Seeley earlier
won a declaratory judgment ruling that the state's ban on medical marijuana
was unconstitutional.&nbsp; The case is now going before the
Washington State Supreme Court. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Indiana Supreme Court Rules On
Constitutionality Of Illegal Drug Excise Tax</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 27, Indianapolis, Indiana:</b>&nbsp;
The Indiana Supreme Court has ruled that the state cannot tax
illegal drugs and prosecute their owners too.&nbsp; In the
written opinion of the court, Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard
maintained that to apply both civil and criminal penalties to
drug cases would be a violation of the constitutional protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, the high court also added that the assessment of the tax
is a valid punishment when it is the &quot;first jeopardy&quot;
-- that is, if it precedes criminal proceedings. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responses to the ruling are widespread and some legal scholars
are critical that the ruling will allow certain defendants to
&quot;buy&quot; their way out of criminal sanctions.&nbsp; Citing
the court's suggestion that Revenue Department officials could
consult with prosecutors to determine which action to take,
Attorney Andrew Maternowski of Indianapolis worries that the
state's particular punishment could depend on the defendant's
financial standing.&nbsp; &quot;If you don't have money, you go
to prison,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Others feel that the ruling will encourage the state legislature
to abolish the excise tax. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A similar &quot;double jeopardy&quot; ruling was recently issued
in an Arizona trial court.&nbsp; In that decision, a Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge dismissed marijuana charges against <a
href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">Arizona NORML</a> Chairman
Peter Wilson because he had previously paid the state tax on
cannabis.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Despite &quot;Colorful&quot; Side Effects<br>
FDA Panel Gives Thumbs Up To New Anti-Glaucoma Drug</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A Food and Drug Administration panel has approved
a new type of anti-glaucoma drug even though it has the startling
side effect of turning blue eyes brown.&nbsp; &quot;This could
turn out to be a major public health hazard for glaucoma
patients,&quot; noted Dr. Alexander Buckner of the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;
The panel voted 4-2 to approve the new drug. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">National statistics indicate that glaucoma effects some 980,000
Americans a year.&nbsp; Standard therapy in the treatment of
glaucoma is the drug Timolol; however, physicians state that the
drug has numerous side effects ranging from breathing problems to
irregular heartbeats. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana proponents argue that the use of cannabis is an
effective treatment in lowering inter-ocular pressure in
individuals who suffer from open-angle glaucoma.&nbsp; Advocates state
that cannabis is both more effective and safer than other
conventional treatments. <br>

<p align="center"><b>USDA Issues &quot;White&quot; Paper On
Industrial Hemp: Report Concedes That American Hemp Cultivation
Isn't Likely Any Time Soon</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A recently released USDA &quot;white&quot; paper
indicates that the federal agency is currently exploring the
possibility of domestic hemp cultivation.&nbsp; The report notes
that a number of U.S. states reliant on the revenue raised
through tobacco farming have shown an interest in the possibility
of cultivating hemp as a way to compensate for slumping tobacco
sales.&nbsp; However, the report's conclusions demonstrate that
in spite of worldwide trends and renewed domestic interest in
hemp production, large-scale hemp cultivation will not begin in
the United States any time soon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the report, the USDA insists that, &quot;Production
and processing trials [are] needed to establish the economic
viability of industrial hemp production [within the United
States.]&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the report further notes that
neither can be permitted because &quot;legal issues currently preclude
[this] research&quot; from taking place.&nbsp; In sum the USDA
maintains that they cannot endorse the domestic production of
industrial hemp until field tests are conducted while
simultaneously noting that the DEA refuses to allow any actual
tests to take place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the report states that the DEA remains &quot;opposed to
any consideration of hemp as a legitimate fiber or pulp
product.&quot;&nbsp; The DEA justifies this position, not on the
basis of any agricultural or economic evidence, but on &quot;the
perception that industrial hemp advocates have a hidden agenda of
favoring the legalization of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; The report
further notes that current policy dictates &quot;that the White
House Drug Enforcement Office should be contact[ed] before USDA
staff attend meetings on industrial hemp or get involved with
research programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In essence, the federal government is allowing our nation's
policy toward an agricultural endeavor be determined -- not by an
agricultural agency -- but rather, by an anti-narcotics agency that
bases its reasoning upon the preconceived notion that any
advocacy of industrial hemp is also an endorsement of the
legalization of marijuana,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;For the American farmers
and businessmen who could potentially benefit from this growing
worldwide industry, the U.S. government's bias is unsupported and
truly shameful.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>An in depth look at the USDA report will be featured in the
forthcoming issue of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>'s Ongoing
Briefing.&nbsp; Copies of the 7 page report entitled
&quot;Industrial Hemp and other Alternative Crops for small-scale
Tobacco Producers,&quot; are presently available from </i><a

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Colorado Senator Set To
Introduce Legislation Allowing For Hemp Cultivation In Colorado</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A Colorado bill that would allow for the
regulated cultivation of industrial hemp by Colorado farmers is
expected to be submitted to the state legislature in 1996.&nbsp;
The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
permits the planting of no more than forty acres of industrial
hemp in Colorado for agricultural, commercial, and scientific
research. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A similar bill was introduced by Sen. Casey in 1995 but was
defeated.&nbsp; (A complete story of the hearings surrounding
Casey's previous hemp bill appeared in the Spring 1995 issue of <b>NORML</b>'s

Legal Marijuana Smoker Arrested For Pot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 9, 1995, Gainesville, FL:</b>&nbsp;
The sixth annual Florida Hempfest was marred by a greater police
presence than ever before and a record number of arrests --
including that of marijuana activist and legal medical marijuana
user, Elvy Musikka.&nbsp; Musikka, who is supplied by the federal
government with a monthly prescription of marijuana cigarettes to
treat her glaucoma, was dragged off the stage arm-and-arm by two
police officers after lighting one of her prescription &quot;joints&quot;
on stage. <br>

announced that the rally's organizers would take legal action

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the NORML benefit CD <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>, the
National Writers Union and the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression have issued statements condemning the actions of rally
organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both groups are highly critical of the overall nature of the
protest and specifically of the alleged use of state power and
finances to help institute the rally.&nbsp; Reports from the
December 1 gathering note that protesters arrived in state
vehicles, attendees were encouraged to &quot;bring their squad cars,&quot;
and an individual identified as a Boston liaison to the DEA
accompanied Georgette Wilson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D.,
as she entered the station.&nbsp; &quot;These sort of actions,
when performed [and sponsored] by government agents, are
specifically [prohibited] by law,&quot; charges <a
href="mailto:billdown@usa1.com">Bill Downing</a>, president of <b>NORML</b>'s
Massachusetts chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a letter to Governor William Weld from the National Writers
Union, Political Issues Chairman Robert B. Chatelle urges the
governor to demand Ms. Watson issue a formal apology for her
actions.&nbsp; The letter further urges Watson to &quot;pledge in
the future to abide by the laws [and] the U.S.
Constitution.&quot; If the executive director is unwilling to do
this, the National Writers Union suggests that Gov. Weld request
her resignation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are concerned ... that you have not yet spoken out
against this abuse of power committed in your name,&quot;
Chatelle writes.&nbsp; &quot;The voters of the Commonwealth have
the right to hear from you about this disturbing event.&nbsp; I'm
sure you have no wish to advance your political career by trampling
on the inalienable rights of the people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A press release issued by the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression also casts stern consternation on the event and calls
the protest an &quot;astonishing example of the power of the
state riding roughshod over the Bill of Rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The news blackout on this matter, which should at the very
least result in the resignation of Ms. Watson and the
disciplining of the DEA agent who accompanied her into WBCN, is
almost as scandalous as the incident itself,&quot; concludes
James D'Entremont, Director of the Boston coalition. <br>

State Senator John Moseley has pre-filed a bill (Senate Bill 573)

provide certain marijuana users with a medical necessity
defense.&nbsp; Sen Moseley is the former President of the
Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill states that &quot;no criminal or civil penalty shall
apply to any person for the act of possessing marijuana provided
that ... a [physician] certifies in writing that the person is
under professional care ... [and] ... needs marijuana as part of
a therapeutic regimen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Dan Viets, President of Missiouri NORML, views Moseley's
bill as a step in right direction and does not forsee significant
political opposition.&nbsp; &quot;Given the fact our legislature overwhelming
supported a resolution to end the federal prohibition of
marijuana as a medicine in 1994, we feel that Moseley's bill has
an excellent chance of passing in the Missouri General Assembly,&quot;
he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is appalling that in some states, juries are forbidden

says <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;It is even more appalling that individuals who consume
marijuana for its therapeutic effects are prosecuted under our

Shirts That Parodied DARE Logo</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 8, 1995, Pomona, California:</b>&nbsp;
The Los Angeles County District AttorneyÍs office dropped
charges against store-owner Mark Hornaday for selling T-shirts
parodying the DARE logo.&nbsp; Hornaday had been cited on a
complaint by DARE America for selling shirts bearing the DARE
logo with the statement: &quot;I turned in my parents and all I
got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;&nbsp; He was charged under a
rarely used criminal law forbidding the counterfeiting of
copyrighted logos.&nbsp; Hornaday's T-shirts were also
confiscated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday was defended by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member
William Panzer, who argued that the law was unconstitutionally
broad in failing to distinguish between legitimate free speech
and intentionally deceptive marketing practices intending to
mislead customers.&nbsp; &quot;No one was going to think those
were really DARE T-shirts,&quot; argued Panzer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pomona assistant district attorney Richard Jenkins said that he
chose to dismiss the case because &quot;the people from DARE
would prefer that the [trade]mark be protected by a civil
action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since when does DARE call the shots at the DA's
office?&quot; Panzer replied sarcastically. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Republican Task Force Organized To Analyze,
&quot;Get Tough&quot; On Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Pronouncing the current administration's anti-drug policy to be
&quot;in utter disarray&quot; and citing recent findings that
indicate 48 percent of the high school class of 1995 has tried an
illegal drug, House and Senate Republicans have organized an
eighteen man task force to examine the drug issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's time to get tough with this stuff,&quot; said task
force co-chair, Orrin Hatch (R-UT).&nbsp; Hatch criticized the
nation's current anti-drug strategies as not focusing enough on
interdiction and law enforcement.&nbsp; The task force announced
that it will issue a report in March. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recent studies demonstrate that drug use among high school
seniors is steadily climbing upward.&nbsp; The annual University
of Michigan study discovered that teen drug use rose for the
third year in a row, but cautioned that America's current
adolescent use rates still remain far below the peak period of
the late 1970s and early 1980s. <br>

<p align="center">December 14, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Missouri Senator Pre-files Medical Marijuana
Necessity Defense Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 14, 1995, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp;
State Senator John Moseley has pre-filed a bill (Senate Bill 573)
for the 1996 session of the Missouri General Assembly that would
provide certain marijuana users with a medical necessity
defense.&nbsp; Sen. Moseley is the former President of the
Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill states that &quot;no criminal or civil penalty shall
apply to any person for the act of possessing marijuana provided
that ... a [physician] certifies in writing that the person is
under professional care ... [and] ... needs marijuana as part of
a therapeutic regimen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Dan Viets, President of Missiouri NORML, views Moseley's
bill as a step in right direction and does not forsee significant
political opposition.&nbsp; &quot;Given the fact our legislature overwhelmingly
supported a resolution to end the federal prohibition of
marijuana as a medicine in 1994, we feel that Moseley's bill has
an excellent chance of passing in the Missouri General Assembly,&quot;
he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is appalling that in some states, juries are forbidden
to hear testimony regarding the medical uses of marijuana,&quot;
says <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;It is even more appalling that individuals who consume
marijuana for its therapeutic effects are prosecuted under our
nation's policy of 'zero tolerance.'&nbsp; Senator Moseley's
legislation would allow for some needed compassion in America's
war on marijuana consumers.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Anti-Drug Group's Attack On </b><a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html"><b>Hempilation</b></a><b>,
WBCN, Draws Fire From National Writers Union, Boston Coalition
For Freedom Of Expression</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>,
the National Writers Union and the Boston Coalition for Freedom
of Expression have issued statements condemning the actions of
rally organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both groups are highly critical of the overall nature of the
protest and specifically of the alleged use of state power and
finances to help institute the rally.&nbsp; Reports from the
December 1 gathering note that protesters arrived in state
vehicles, attendees were encouraged to &quot;bring their squad cars,&quot;
and an individual identified as a Boston liaison to the DEA
accompanied Georgette Wilson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D.,
as she entered the station.&nbsp; &quot;These sort of actions,
when performed [and sponsored] by government agents, are
specifically [prohibited] by law,&quot; charges Bill Downing,
president of <b>NORML</b>'s Massachusetts chapter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a letter to Governor William Weld from the National Writers
Union, Political Issues Chairman Robert B. Chatelle urges the
governor to demand Ms. Watson issue a formal apology for her
actions.&nbsp; The letter further urges Watson to &quot;pledge in
the future to abide by the laws [and] the U.S.
Constitution.&quot;&nbsp; If the executive director is unwilling
to do this, the National Writers Union suggests that Gov. Weld
request her resignation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are concerned ... that you have not yet spoken out
against this abuse of power committed in your name,&quot;
Chatelle writes.&nbsp; &quot;The voters of the Commonwealth have
the right to hear from you about this disturbing event.&nbsp; I'm
sure you have no wish to advance your political career by trampling
on the inalienable rights of the people.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A press release issued by the Boston Coalition for Freedom of
Expression also criticizes the event and calls the protest an
&quot;astonishing example of the power of the state riding
roughshod over the Bill of Rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The news blackout on this matter, which should at the very
least result in the resignation of Ms. Watson and the
disciplining of the DEA agent who accompanied her into WBCN, is
almost as scandalous as the incident itself,&quot; concludes
James D'Entremont, Director of the Boston coalition. <br>

Searches Of Bus Passengers To Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp; Civil
liberties proponents are claiming victory following an Illinois
Supreme Court decision to uphold a Champaign County Judge's
ruling that the police acted illegally by searching the bag of a
Greyhound Bus passenger. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Harold Jensen granted a motion to suppress in the case of
Greyhound passenger Tim Besser.&nbsp; Besser was faced with drug
charges after a police search of bus passengers and their luggage
revealed Besser's suitcase to contain marijuana.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the hearing, officers testified that they boarded the bus as
it pulled into the Urbana Station at 2:50 a.m.&nbsp; One officer
and his dog searched the luggage compartment and two other
officers questioned the bus passengers, ordering each to identify
their luggage.&nbsp; During the course of the trial, police
conceded that there was nothing suspicious about the bus or any
of its passengers.&nbsp; One officer further testified that he
knew the bus schedule by heart and added that such suspicionless
searches of busses were routine police procedure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, by boarding the bus and detaining the passengers
without probable cause, the court ruled that Besser had been
unlawfully seized and searched.&nbsp; &quot;That kind of random
police work is a little offensive to me,&quot; Judge Jensen
remarked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Besser was represented by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member,

Penalties Faces Opposition, Resolution From City Officials</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 1995, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp; A <b>NORML</b>
chapter hoping to reduce marijuana penalties in Traverse City was
recently met with heavy opposition by local officials.&nbsp;
Following the announcement that the group plans to collect the
330 signatures necessary to put a new pot ordinance on the
ballot, city commission officials unanimously passed a resolution
asking residents not to sign the petition.&nbsp; The Traverse
City NORML petition sends the wrong message to teenagers,
Commissioner Shelly Kester said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Regardless of the resolution, area NORML President Bill Bustance
says he will have no problem gathering the necessary number of
signatures to bring the new marijuana ordinance to a public
vote.&nbsp; Last year, Bustance reportedly amassed more than
twice the needed amount of signatures on a similar
petition.&nbsp; However, the prior petition was rejected by the
commission because it allegedly conflicted with state law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bustance says that his current petition avoids last years legal
problems.&nbsp; His revised ordinance would make marijuana
possession in Traverse City punishable by a fine of $100 and 10
hours of community service for the first offense. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Reverses Drug Convictions
Involving Firearms: Justices Rule Possessing A Weapon Not Enough
To Warrant Longer Sentences</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In a unanimous decision that may open the door for the appeals of
hundreds of firearm convictions, the Supreme Court unanimously
ruled that a federal law mandating drug traffickers to receive an
additional five years in prison for using a firearm can only be
invoked when the defendant actively employs the weapon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision struck down the convictions in two District cases in
which firearms were present but locked away during drug
dealing.&nbsp; In one incident, police discovered a pistol inside
a bag in a car trunk following a traffic stop that revealed 27
bags of cocaine.&nbsp; In the second case, an unloaded derringer
was discovered locked in a trunk of the defendant's bedroom
closet.&nbsp; The defendant had earlier sold crack cocaine to an
undercover officer in her apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to the Court's ruling, many circuits courts had been
divided on how much &quot;use&quot; of a firearm is necessary to
invoke the additional mandatory minimum.&nbsp; A prior D.C.
Circuit of Appeals ruling stated that as long as the weapon is in
close proximity to the drugs or drug proceeds and is accessible,
the stiffer punishment could apply. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, after reviewing the law's language, the Supreme court
concluded that prosecutors must show active employment of the
firearm.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The definition of &quot;use&quot; said Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor &quot;is of such breadth that no role remains
for 'carry,&quot; which is also included in the statute.&nbsp;
&quot;Use&quot; does not include the mere placement of a gun
nearby for protection, she concluded.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Leaves Post</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton accepted &quot;with regret&quot; the resignation
of Dr. Lee Brown as head of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.&nbsp; A spokesman for the administration
says that a search for a successor is underway and maintained that
the President is as committed as ever to the battle against drug
abuse.&nbsp; &quot;[The war on drugs] will never be over until
every child in America knows that drug use is dangerous, illegal
and wrong,&quot; the President said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown is leaving his post as Drug Czar to take a teaching job at
Rice University in Houston.</p>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Gallup Poll Indicates That
Americans Are Very Concerned About Illegal Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Miami, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Americans rate the use of illegal drugs as one of the nation's
greatest crises, second only to violent crime, indicates a Gallup
poll released this past Tuesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to results from the 1995 poll, 88 percent of the
nation's adults view illegal drugs as a serious problem --
ranking it ahead of such issues as the federal budget deficit and
health care costs.&nbsp; The survey also indicated that 93
percent of respondents favored more anti-drug education in public
schools and 85 percent opposed the idea of legalizing drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">White House Drug Czar Lee Brown, speaking at a conference in
Miami, commented that the results of the poll further
re-emphasize the need for a high-profile, well-funded national
drug control strategy.</p>

Mark: FBI Data Confirms Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Tougher
Than Bush's</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">An estimated 481,098 total marijuana arrests were
made by state and local law enforcement during the year 1994,
according to the latest edition of the FBI's Uniform Crime
Report.&nbsp; This figure is a 26 percent increase over last
year's total and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests
under the Clinton administration to a staggering 861,788. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Of the 481,098 arrests made for marijuana in 1994, approximately
83.7 percent (402,717) were for simple
&quot;possession.&quot;&nbsp; The remaining 16.3 percent (78,381
arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot; a category that
includes all cultivation offenses -- even those where the marijuana
was being grown for personal use. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;This data confirms that the federal government's war on
marijuana consumers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These new FBI statistics
indicate that one marijuana user is arrested eveiy 65 seconds in America.&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, those individuals who possess marijuana are
being hardest hit.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's two year
average of total marijuana arrests (430,894 arrests per year) is
27 percent higher than the average number of yearly arrests under
the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp; &quot;The fact that
studies indicate adolescent use rates for marijuana are rising at
the same time that law enforcement is arresting record numbers of
users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s long-held belief that marijuana
prohibition is not an effective deterrent to marijuana
consumption,&quot; remarks St. Pierre. <br>

The nation's prison population experienced its largest 1 year
increase ever bringing America's inmate population to a record

<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Since 1980, America's prison population has risen by over 300
percent.&nbsp; This dramatic increase is due mainly to the impact

href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">AZ4NORML</a>, some
activists have even taken to openly selling marijuana in front of
the Arizona State Capital.&nbsp; Rich Davis, longtime hemp
activist and curator of the mobile USA Hemp Museum, recently sold
one gram bags of marijuana out in front of the Department of
Revenue in plain view of both capital and state police
officers.&nbsp; No arrests were made. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">A second well known activist, Ron Kiczenski, reports that he
intends to open America's first ever marijuana store.&nbsp;
&quot;This will be the first legal marijuana cigarette
company,&quot; he told <i>The Associated Press</i>.&nbsp;
&quot;It's legal to buy marijuana from anyone in the state.&nbsp;
You just have to pay the state tax within 24 hours of the
sale.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The recent goings-on in Arizona stem from a ruling by Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges
against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence
that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing
his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted
for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the
Arizona Depantnient of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Under
Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license
and tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">State lawmakers contend that the legislation was intended solely
as a way to punish drug traffickers, not to legalize cannabis in
the state of Arizona.&nbsp; &quot;We're confident that [Judge
Barclay's] decision will be overturned,&quot; states Barnett
Lotstein, a special assistant with the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.&nbsp; &quot;In the event it isn't, I'm sure the
Legislature would remedy that post haste.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;We know that the Legislature is going to vote on this issue
[when it convenes in January,]&quot; responds Bill Green of <a

CD Escalates: Massachusetts Anti-Drug Group Organizes Rally
Against Radio Station WBCN Boston</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>Boston, Massachusetts, December 1, 1995:</b>&nbsp;
The Massachusetts based anti-drug group, Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA
and local law-enforcement, organized a protest outside the
offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of the station
&quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Alleging that <b>NORML</b> is poised to make &quot;millions&quot;
from the sale of the CD and further stating that &quot;WBCN is an
active participant of the pro-marijuana legalization effort in
Massachusetts,&quot; the G.A.A.D. issued a fax release
encouraging local law enforcement to attend the rally and
&quot;bring [their] squad car[s.]&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to representatives from Mass/Cann NORML, about 15
protesters showed up at the gathering and a report of the event
was broadcast on WCVB-TV Channel 3 News.&nbsp; Attendees were
shown carrying signs with slogans such as &quot;WBCN is bringing
the country to its knees&quot; and &quot;WBCN: Broadcasting
Capitalists for NORML.&quot;&nbsp; G.A.A.D. Executive Director
Georgette Wilson and Boston liaison for the Drug Enforcemant
Administration, Steve Morreale, were filmed entering WBCN's
offices as &quot;they went in to make their case to station
officials.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">WBCN reported to WCVB-TV that the station will continue to play
music off the <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
CD.&nbsp; Later, in an MTV NEWS interview which aired December 6
and 7, WBCN's program director commented that: &quot;Music
shouldn't be blamed for social phenomena.&nbsp; Musicians have
the same right to free expression as other Americans.&quot;&nbsp;
The radio station offered Wilson an opportunity to air her
concerns over <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
on WBCN's public forum show, but Wilson refused their invitation. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In response to the action taken by the Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs against WBCN, Mass/Cann NORML is considering taking
legal action against the federal prohibitionist groups involved
in the protest.&nbsp; &quot;These government sponsored and
organized activities are designed to coerce, threaten,
intimidate, and damage WBCN-FM so that they [will] abandon their
association with Mass/Cann NORML,&quot; alleges President <a

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 19, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
An estimated 481,098 total arrests were made by state and local
law enforcement during the year 1994, according to the the latest
edition of the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.&nbsp; This figure
pushes the total number of marijuana arrests under the Clinton administration
to a staggering 861,788. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of the 481,098 arrests made for marijuana in 1994, approximately
83.7 percent (402,717) were for simple
&quot;possession.&quot;&nbsp; The remaining 16.3 percent (78,381
arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot; a category that
includes all cultivation offenses -- even those intended for personal
use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data affirms that the federal govemment's war on
marijuana consumers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime,&quot; says NORML'S Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Not surprisingly, those individuals who possess
marijuana for personal use are being the hardest hit.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">USA Today noted that total drug possession arrests reached a
record 1 million in 1994.&nbsp; This figure is nearly a 43
percent increase from just three years earlier when the number of
Americans arrested for possession of controlled substances stood
at less than 700,000.&nbsp; The FBI report further reveals that
the number of individuals arrested for marijuana possession in
1994 virtually equaled the combined total number of individuals
arrested for possessing heroin, cocaine, and/or their
derivatives. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">State Senator Joseph L. Galiber, a Bronx New York
Democrat who took unpopular stands on crime and drug policy and
remained a power in New York City and state politics for three decades,
died recently of a heart attack. He was 71. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. Galiber was first elected to the state senate in 1968.&nbsp;
He was an early supporter of methadone-maintenance programs and
an early and vocal opponent of mandatory sentencing laws.&nbsp;
He favored the legalization of marijuana and joined the <b>NORML</b>
board of directors in September of 1994.&nbsp; His essay,
&quot;Marijuana Prohibition: A Mistaken View Of Reality,&quot;
recently appeared in the June issue of <b>NORML</b>'s monthly
publication, Ongoing Briefing. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harvard professor and fellow NORML board member Lester Grinspoon, M.D.,
said: &quot;Sen. Galiber will be sorely missed by all who work in
drug reform.&nbsp; He was a wise and compassionate man and one of
the few elected public officials courageous enough to speak out
against the 'war on drugs.'&nbsp; His valuable counsel will be
sorely missed at <b>NORML</b>.&quot;</p>

Illinois Lieutenant Governor Purports Today's Marijuana To Be<br>
One Thousand Percent More Potent</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 19, 1995, Illinois:</b>&nbsp; In a
press release condemning the release of HEMPILATION: Freedom Is
NORML -- a benefit CD for the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws -- Illinois Lieutenant Governor Bob
Kustra claims that, &quot;According to research conducted by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the marijuana sold
on the streets today is 1,000 percent more potent ... than what
many parents experimented with in the l960s and 1970s.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Contrary to Kustra's allegations, annual marijuana potency
figures supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse indicate
that marijuana today is essentially no stronger than in the
past.&nbsp; NIDA data taken from a 1994 report monitoring yearly
cannabis potency demonstrates that ordinary marijuana has contained
approximately 3 to 4 percent THC for at least the last 13
years.&nbsp; NIDA only began measuring marijuana potency in the
mid-l970s. <br>

an <a href="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/MEDICAL/lancet.html">editorial</a>

regulation of cannabis similar to the Dutch model.&nbsp; The
November <a

-- entitled &quot;Deglamorising cannabis&quot; -- asks the question:
&quot;Where is the harm in decriminalizing cannabis?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After weighing the evidence, the <a

concludes that: &quot;The smoking of cannabis, even long term, is
not harmfal to health.&nbsp; ...[Yet] cannabis has become
political football, and one that governments continually
duck.&nbsp; Like footballs, however, it bounces back.&nbsp;
Sooner or later politicians will have to stop running scared and

<p align="center"><strong>Judge Dismisses Drug Charges Against
State &quot;Licensed&quot; Marijuana Dealer:<br>
Court Rules Marijuana Tax Stamps To Be Double Jeopardy</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 1, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</strong>&nbsp; In a
ruling whose implications have been described as &quot;staggering,&quot;
a Phoenix court has dismissed charges against Arizona NORML
Chairman, Peter Wilson, because of evidence that he is licensed
by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Wilson was charged with
possession of marijuana after police confiscated a bag of
marijuana at his home on August 22. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Basing his ruling on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge John Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be
prosecuted for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has
paid to the Arizona Department of Review to sell cannabis.&nbsp;
Under Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both
a license and tax stamps ($10 per ounce) to legally possess and
sell marijuana.&nbsp; Wilson possessed both a license and over
$200 dollars worth of stamps at the time of his arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Noting that the creation of Title 42 creates a &quot;confusing
paradox,&quot; Judge Barclay ruled that &quot;the facts in this
case prohibit prosecution for the possession of marijuana because
the tax imposed prior to the prosecution served a punitive
purpose.&quot;&nbsp; The Fifth Amendment strictly prohibits
citizens from being punished more than once for the same offense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office, says that the state intends to appeal the ruling. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, Wilson is encouraging the Arizona cannabis
community to contact the Department of Revenue and -- as quickly
as possible -- acquire the &quot;trinity:&quot; a marijuana
license, stamps, and a copy of Judge Barclay's decision.&nbsp;
&quot;The police should then say to you something like, 'Well,
sir, I see [that] you are lawfully in possession of
marijuana.&nbsp; Have a good day.'&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><strong>Massachusetts Governor Refuses To Sign
Medical Marijuana Necessity Defense Act</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 10, 1995, Massachusetts:</strong>&nbsp;
Governor William Weld has refused to sign legislation that would
allow for defendants facing charges of marijuana possession to
argue that they use the drug as a medicine.&nbsp; Weld returned
the bill (H 2170 aka the Joe Hutchins Act) back to the Legislature
requesting that lawmakers tighten the bill's language. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to press reports, Weld balked at the bill because he
felt that, as written, the legislation &quot;would in all
likelihood lead to inappropriate assertions of the
defense.&quot;&nbsp; Weld also notes that the bill would allow a
defendant to take a &quot;self-diagnosis approach.&quot;&nbsp;
Weld suggested amending the bill to require that the defendant
must be certified to participate in a therapeutic research
program and possess the marijuana for personal use as a result of
that program. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Patricia D. Jehlen (D-Somerville), the bill's sponsor, was
shocked by the governor's actions.&nbsp; Jehlen claimed that
House members have worked closely with Weld's staff and did not anticipate
the governor's recent concerns over defendants misusing the
defense.&nbsp; &quot;We [already] have language to address that
[problem,]&quot; Jehlen said.&nbsp; &quot;All my original bill
would've done is let people who are suffering tell the jury why
they were smoking marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, backers of H 2170 claim that Weld's amended language
for the bill is nothing more than an empty gesture.&nbsp; There
exists no such state research program, proponents for the bill
note, and even if there was, the government no longer makes the
drug available for medical research.&nbsp; In short,
&quot;[Weld's] amendment means that there is no bill,&quot;
Jehlen said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, eight Americans receive marijuana from the federal
government as part of the Compassionate Investigative New Drug
(IND) program.&nbsp; This program was closed to new applicants in
1992 and it remains in operation only for the eight surviving
previously-approved recipients. <br>

<p align="center"><strong>ACLU Poll Demonstrates That Americans
Clearly Support Medical Marijuana</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 9, 1995:</strong>&nbsp; Preliminary findings
from a recent study conducted by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) demonstrate that the legalization of marijuana for
medical use is favored by a clear majority of American voters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The poll notes that 79 percent of Americans thought it would be a
&quot;good idea&quot; to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for
medical purposes.&nbsp; Eighty five percent of the respondents
said that they would &quot;favor&quot; making marijuana legally
available for medical uses where it has been proven effective for
treating a problem. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ACLU study also reports that Americans tend to separate their
opinions regarding marijuana for medical use and marijuana for
recreational use.&nbsp; While the study demonstrates that a &quot;clear
majority&quot; of respondents favor changes in the federal law
that would allow for the medical use of marijuana, only a
&quot;near majority&quot; support the decriminalization of
marijuana for social use. <br>

<p align="center"><strong>Germany To Begin Cultivating Industrial
Hemp</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 1995, Germany:</strong> The New York Times
News Service reports that the German government is repealing its
ban on the cultivation of industrial hemp.&nbsp; The hemp
plant--also known as marijuana--can be used to make various
products such as clothes, textiles, foodstuffs, cosmetics, paper,
and plastics. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hemp has been stigmatized in Germany because it can also produce
marijuana, noted Health Minister Horst Seehofer.&nbsp; However,
Seehofer stated that farmers now possess the technology to grow
strains of hemp that contain less than 0.3 percent THC--the
substance that gives marijuana and hashish their psychoactive
qualities.&nbsp; Therefore, &quot;the principle argument against
a continuing ban on hemp cultivation is ... no longer
valid,&quot; Seehofer said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hemp production is rapidly becoming a booming industry throughout
Europe and is already permitted in Spain, Britain, France, and
the majority of Eastern Europe.&nbsp; Recently, worldwide clothing
manufacturers such as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Adidas have
all introduced hemp to their product lines. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;German farmers should be able to take advantage of the
market potential for the hemp plant,&quot; Seehofer concluded. <br>

Adolescents Using Drugs, Marijuana</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 2, 1995, Atlanta, Georgia:</strong>&nbsp; A
recent survey from the National Parents' Resource Institute for
Drug Education (PRIDE) reports &quot;significant increases&quot;
in the use of cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogens
among adolescents.&nbsp; These findings come shortly after data from
the 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also noted an
increase in adolescent marijuana use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The PRIDE report states that: &quot;Marijuana use [has] increased
more dramatically than any drug in the study.&nbsp; One third of
high school seniors (33 percent) have smoked marijuana in the
past year, and one fifth (21 percent) smoked monthly.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The report further notes that monthly marijuana use among high
school students rose 2.9 percent over the past year and now
stands at 18.5 percent.&nbsp; By comparison, the Household Survey
data reported that 7.3 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 17 used
marijuana on a regular basis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">PRIDE announced that the rising figures should serve as a warning
to baby boomers with children.&nbsp; &quot;More of your teenagers
are using drug than last year,&quot; the parents organization
warns, &quot;and too few of you are doing what you can to prevent
it.&quot; <br>

With Brown's Statements Regarding Marijuana Related Emergency
Room Episodes</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 8, 1995, Washington, DC:</strong>&nbsp;
Recent figures released from an upcoming report that tracks the
number of Americans admitted to hospital emergency rooms with
drug-related problems conflict with statements made earlier this
summer by Drug Czar Lee Brown.&nbsp; The complete 1994 report
will be released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration later this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The report's press release states that just over a half-million
Americans wound up in hospital emergency rooms with drug related
problems in 1994, including a record number 142,000 with cocaine-related
episodes.&nbsp; The release additionally states that some 40,000
episodes were related to marijuana and hashish, although it notes
that almost half of these patients also used alcohol and cocaine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This data directly conflicts with statements made by Drug Czar
Lee Brown this past July regarding the supposed dangers of
marijuana.&nbsp; At that time, Brown told the national media
that, &quot;[Marijuana] now sends nearly as many people to the
hospital as cocaine.&quot;&nbsp; (<i>Washington Post</i>, July
28, 1995)&nbsp; Yet, the figures released by SAMHSA demonstrate
that more than seven times as many individuals went to the
emergency room because of cocaine related episodes in 1994 as did those
who consumed marijuana alone.&nbsp; The newly released figures
indicate that Brown grossly exaggerated his previous statements
regarding marijuana-related emergency room admissions to incorrectly
imply that marijuana is as dangerous as cocaine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some marijuana users are admitted to emergency rooms after
suffering panic attacks from consuming cannabis.&nbsp; These
attacks are relatively harmless and subside within a few
hours.&nbsp; National data estimates that approximately 10
million Americans use marijuana monthly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The SAMHSA release concluded that &quot;cocaine ... appears to be
the primary cause for the increase in total drug-related
emergency department episodes since the mid 1980s.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><strong>Clinton, Brown Speak At Community
Anti-Drug Coalition Of America Forum</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 2, 1995, Alexandria, VA:</strong>&nbsp; Both
President Clinton and Drug Czar Lee Brown were among those
federal officials speaking at the Community Anti-Drug Coalition
of America's (CADCA) annual National Leadership Forum.&nbsp; This
year's forum signified the kick-off of the CADCA's &quot;Working
Together to Save Lives&quot; drug-awareness campaign,
memorializing the men, women, and children who have died in
drug-related deaths.&nbsp; The campaign is handing out &quot;Memorial
Bracelets&quot; to symbolize the many victims of drug-related
deaths.&nbsp; The CADCA estimates that 35,000 people died in
drug-related incidents in 1992 alone; however, the organization
does not distinguish between deaths due to the use of illegal
drugs themselves (i.e., Tish Smith, an eighteen year old victim
of an accidental heroin and cocaine overdose) and deaths due to
the federal prohibition of drugs (i.e., Edward Plank, a 28 year
old police officer who was killed by drug runners this past
October). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">President Clinton, who was presented with the first
&quot;Memorial Bracelet,&quot; spoke broadly about drug use in
general and specifically about concerns he held regarding a
recent increase in casual marijuana use among teenagers.&nbsp;
Clinton claimed that the recreational use of marijuana was &quot;dangerous&quot;
because marijuana &quot;is more toxic than ever before&quot; and
is a gateway to other drugs.&nbsp; The president later added that
he would &quot;convene a White House leadership conference on adolescent
drug use and violence in January.&quot;&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> knows
of no evidence indicating that today's marijuana is either more
toxic than marijuana of the past or that it is a causal link to
hard drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing figures from a new survey conducted by the Parents
Resource and Information on Drug Education (PRIDE), Drug Czar Lee
Brown once again reiterated his beliefs that marijuana is a highly
dangerous drug.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana fuel[s] a culture of
violence which is destroying the lives of thousands of our young
people,&quot; Brown stated. <br>

Cultivation Of Industrial Hemp In Hawaii</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 1995, Hawaii:</strong>&nbsp; State
Representative David Tarnas voiced his support for establishing a
legal, domestic hemp industry in Hawaii in the November issue of
Ka'u Landing magazine.&nbsp; In an article written by Tarnas and
entitled The Politics of Hemp: An Emerging Public Policy Issue,
he states that: &quot;The government must do its best to open up
commerce in industrial hemp.&nbsp; ... My goal is to remove
barriers to allow commerce to prove itself.&nbsp; Get government
out of the way, and let a legitimate hemp business support a
diversified, well integrated local economy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Tarnas also used the feature article to state his stern
consternation for the prosecution of Roger Christie and Aaron
Anderson for possessing sterilized hemp seeds.&nbsp; Tarnas noted
that state statutes &quot;explicitly allow commerce in sterilized
hemp seed&quot; and further added that &quot;the prosecutor has
made public statements that the defendants are being targeted
because they are hemp advocates.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;As a state representative, I say this [prosecution] is

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">November 13, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Congressman Barney Frank Introduces Federal
Legislation To Make Marijuana Available By Prescription</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; U.S. Representative
Barney Frank (D-MA) introduced a federal medical marijuana bill
in Congress on November 10 that would permit physicians to
prescribe marijuana to patients for a number of serious
illnesses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Frank medical use bill is modeled closely after a 1981
federal medical marijuana proposal co-sponsored at that time by
Rep. Newt Gingrich, now Speaker of the House, and three other Republicans.&nbsp;
The bill would reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule
II and would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services
to provide for controlled domestic cultivation to provide a legal
supply of medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although much more research is needed, it is clear from both
limited scientific data and rapidly accumulating anecdotal
evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and
suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and
that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines
for which it may be substituted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming the nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy as well as the nausea and
loss of appetite associated with the wasting syndrome of AIDS.&nbsp;
It is useful for various spastic conditions including multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia.&nbsp; It lowers
interocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle
glaucoma.&nbsp; For some people with epilepsy, it is the only
anticonvulsant that works.&nbsp; It has been used for centuries as
an analgesic and its medical potential has been endorsed by both
the National Academy of Sciences and the Australian Commonwealth
Department of Human Services and Health.&nbsp; In 1988, DEA Chief
Administrative Law Judge Francis J. Young declared that marijuana
fulfilled the legal requirements for currently accepted medical
use in the United States, finding marijuana to be &quot;one of
the safest therapeutically active substances known to
man.&quot;&nbsp; His order was overruled, not by any medical
authority, but by the DEA itself. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results from a recent poll conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union demonstrate that 85 percent of the voting public
favor the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; Thirty-six states have
adopted legislation facilitating the medical use of marijuana,
but none of these state measures can be implemented until
Congress amends the law.&nbsp; The introduction of Rep. Frank's
legislation provides Congress with that opportunity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using
marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they
must risk arrest to obtain and use it.&nbsp; As a result,
informal &quot;buyer's clubs&quot; have formed in many cities to
supply marijuana to the seriously ill.&nbsp; Some of these clubs
are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San
Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a
regular basis.&nbsp; The fact that thousands of seriously ill
Americans would risk arrest to obtain marijuana as a medicine
attests to the need for medical marijuana legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harvard Professor Lester Grinspoon M.D., co-author of Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine (Yale University Press, 1993) says the
Frank medical marijuana bill &quot;is a compassionate and humane
proposal which would provide relief from pain and suffering to
thousands of seriously ill Americans.&nbsp; These are people with
life-threatening illnesses who cannot obtain relief with
available medication.&nbsp; It is both unscientific and
unconscionable for the federal government to continue to deny an
effective medication to these patients.&nbsp; Rep. Frank's
proposal would allow this decision to be made by the patient and
the treating physician.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Sentencing Commission's Recommendations
Regarding Marijuana Weight Disparity Enacted Into Law: New
Legislation Could Affect Approximately 950 Imprisoned Marijuana
Growers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 1, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Recommendations made by the U.S. Sentencing Commission this past
spring mandating a universal plant-weight ratio for marijuana was
enacted into law on November 1.&nbsp; The recommendation will be
retroactive and will affect an estimated 950 cases across the
nation dating back to 1989.&nbsp; Many of these prisoners will be
eligible for early release due to the amended guidelines;
however, Families Against Mandatory Minimum's (FAMM) spokesman
Jeff Stewart cautions that the decision to release an inmate
early still remains up to the discretion of each individual
judge.&nbsp; While it's true that nearly 1000 inmates will be affected
by the change, it does not necessarily follow that all of those
inmates will be immediately released, FAMM warns. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the newly amended guidelines, each marijuana plant
cultivated will now be given a weight equivalent to 100 grams
regardless of the number of plants involved.&nbsp; In the past,
the 100 grams per plant measure was only mandated when a
defendant was convicted of possessing 49 plants or fewer. For
those convicted of harboring 50 plants or more, the weight
equivalent for each plant jumped to 1000 grams.&nbsp;
Consequently, defendants convicted for possessing 50 plants or
more faced sentences almost 3 times as long as those convicted
for 49 plants. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts
the equivalency of 100 grams per marijuana plant for all
guidelines determinations,&quot; the commission stated.&nbsp; The
commission voted 7-0 in favor of the change. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A bill blocking the commission's recommendations was introduced
by U.S. Representative Jim Bunn (R-OR) in October, but Congress
failed to act on it. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Buchanan Flip-Flop-Flips On Medical
Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Storm Lake, IA:</b>&nbsp;
When it comes to the issue of medical marijuana, presidential
hopeful Pat Buchanan just can't seem to make up his mind. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While fund-raising in Charlotte, NC this past summer, Buchanan
responded to a question posed by MAPS (Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies) President Rick Doblin about
whether he would &quot;support the use of medical
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, Buchanan stated that:
&quot;If a doctor indicated to his patient that this was the only
way to alleviate certain painful symptoms ... I would defer to
the doctor's judgment.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, when confronted with a similar question at a recent
gathering in Storm Lake, Iowa, Buchanan began singing a different
tune.&nbsp; When approached by a citizen and publicly asked about his
views on the medicinal use of marijuana, Buchanan said that he
felt that doctors should not be permitted to prescribe smoking
marijuana because of its destructive effect.&nbsp; Buchanan then
asked the man if he was with NORML.&nbsp; When the citizen
responded that he wasn't, but rather that he was &quot;terminally
ill patient ... [with] no hope and no treatment,&quot;&nbsp;
Buchanan suddenly flipped yet again on the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If everything you say is true, and I choose to believe
you,&quot; Buchanan said, &quot;[then] I would support [your
decision to use marijuana as a medicine] in a second.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Idaho Supreme Court Rules That Employee Let
Go For Failing Drug Test<br>
Should Be Awarded Unemployment Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Idaho:</b>&nbsp; In a
surprising 3-2 decision, the Idaho Supreme Court has ruled that
an employee who was fired after having tested positive for THC
should be eligible for unemployment benefits.&nbsp; In it's
written opinion, the Court concluded that: &quot;The record
presents substantial and competent evidence to support the
Commission's conclusion that Shearer [Lumber Products] failed to
communicate its expectations to [its employee, Steven]
Merriott.&nbsp; Shearer therefore could not require Merriott to
comply with uncommunicated expectations.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;uncommunicated expectations&quot; in this case had to
do with whether or not it was clear that Merriott's conduct while
off-duty could be construed as appropriate grounds for
dismissal.&nbsp; After testing positive for THC on a February 9,
1993, drug test, Merriott admitted that he had smoked marijuana
during his day off two days earlier.&nbsp; Merriott maintained
that he had not been intoxicated while on the job.&nbsp; He was
later fired on February 16, 1993, for violating Shearer Lumber
Products' substance abuse policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon analysis, the Court decided that although the company's
substance abuse policy prohibited employees &quot;from being
under the influence of any chemical substance or alcohol during working
hours,&quot; it did not make reference to what employees may or
may not do during non-working hours.&nbsp; &quot;The Commission
noted that Shearer presented no evidence that Merriott was impaired
while at work, nor was Merriott informed that use of controlled
substances during non-working hours would violate Shearer's
policy.&nbsp; Because there was no evidence that Merriott did not
comply with Shearer's communicated substance abuse policy, the
Commission concluded that Merriott was not discharged for
employment-related misconduct.&nbsp; ... [Therefore,] the Commission's
conclusion that Merriott is eligible for unemployment benefits is
affirmed.&quot; <br>

To Kill Proposed Ohio Bill That Allows Police To Sell Drugs</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 30, 1995, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Northcoast NORML has launched an educational campaign to inform
citizens about a proposed House Bill that would change Ohio's
long standing policy prohibiting law enforcement personnel from
selling less than the bulk amount of an illegal drug in reverse
sting operations.&nbsp; The bill (H.B. 125) is titled
&quot;Violations of the Drug Laws&quot; and is being sponsored by
State representative Jeff Jacobson (R-Dayton) by the request of
Montgomery County law enforcement officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML is concerned about this proposed legislation for
various reasons.&nbsp; Most of all, NORML is worried that this
bill, if enacted into law, would shift the focus of Ohio's drug
war away from traffickers and onto small time users.&nbsp;
&quot;If the Senate passes House Bill 125, it will be open season
in Ohio for drug users,&quot; stated Northcoast NORML President
John Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;With the State prison system [already
operating] at over 170 percent capacity and many county jails bursting
at the seams, ... [it's clear that] we just don't need more drug
users in prison.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML also notes that a change in the law could cause
law enforcement personnel to unintentionally add to the drug
problem in Ohio. Hartman notes that an October 25, 1994, Orange
County Register article (Defense Wants Crack Cases Killed, Peter
M. Gollner) reported that 42 percent of the people who bought
drugs from undercover officers got away with the police
manufactured drugs. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Smoke Study Demonstrates
Waterpipes To Be Ineffective</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1995, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Preliminary findings from a recent study on marijuana smoke
indicate that waterpipes offer smokers little protection against
the harmful tars found in cannabis. The study was sponsored by
California NORML and MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies) and its findings were released in a
California NORML press release. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the release, &quot;The reason [for this startling
result] appears to be that waterpipes filter out more of
marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than they do other,
non-psychoactive, harmful tars.&nbsp; [Hence] users [of
waterpipes are required] to consume more noxious smoke in order
to reach their desired high.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study, which was supported by the Drug Policy Foundation and
private donors, carefully analyzed the solid tar and THC content
of marijuana smoke from six separate devices.&nbsp; These devices
included a regular joint, a cigarette filter, three different
waterpipes, and two vaporizers (devices designed to evaporate the
THC from the marijuana with minimal smoke.)&nbsp; The performance
of each device was rated according to how effectively it reduced
the concentration of tar relative to THC.&nbsp; (THC, unlike the
tars in marijuana, is not carcinogenic.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Surprisingly, the unfiltered joint yielded less tar per THC than
did either the cigarette filter or any of the waterpipes that
were tested.&nbsp; Results regarding the performance of the
vaporizers were mixed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While the study results suggest waterpipes may be
counterproductive, sponsors caution that it is still premature to
conclude that they are actually harmful to health,&quot;
California NORML summarizes.&nbsp; &quot;This is because the
study did not analyze the non-solid vapor phase of marijuana smoke,
which contains a number of gasses known to be harmful to
health.&nbsp; If waterpipes help screen out these gasses, they
might be beneficial to health.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Urges High School Coaches To Drug
Test Student Athletes</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 20, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking before both national and DC area middle and high school
coaches, Drug Czar Lee Brown once again called for the drug
testing of high school athletes.&nbsp; Proclaiming that school
athletes are both &quot;role models&quot; and &quot;trend
setters&quot; for the student body, Brown encouraged schools and
coaches across the country to institute programs that would
subject athletes to random drug testing.&nbsp; &quot;If we can
make real headway in turning student athletes away from drugs, I
believe we can succeed with the entire population of young people,&quot;
Brown explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Brown admitted during Friday's speech that,
&quot;There is no reason to think that drug use is any more
prevalent among student athletes than among young people
generally.&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Brown wholeheartedly spoke
out in favor of policies that encourage student athletes to be
tested.&nbsp; &quot;My message for coaches and all school
administrators and teachers is this,&quot; Brown concluded,
&quot;You have important tools available to you, but first you've
got to get off the sidelines and into the game.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a decision advocated and publicly embraced by the Clinton
Administration, the Supreme Court this past June upheld a
Washington state middle school policy that authorized the random testing
of student athletes, without cause or suspicion of drug
use.&nbsp; At that time, Brown called the Court's ruling a
&quot;victory for kids.&quot; <br>

card magazine has refused to allow <b>NORML</b> to advertise its
calling card, but has agreed to publish a press release for a
card honoring former LAPD police officer Mark Fuhrman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The press release, featured in the October edition of TeleCard
World, states that: &quot;The Mark Fuhrman 'Justice' Fund is
using prepaid calling cards to raise money to cover the
detective's legal expenses for the O.J. Simpson murder
trial.&quot;&nbsp; The limited edition cards are being produced
by HT Technologies Inc. of San Francisco.&nbsp; During the
Simpson trial, transcripts surfaced of Fuhrman proudly admitting
that he often planted evidence, used excessive force, and
repeatedly uttered racial epithets while serving on the LAPD
police force. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">TeleCard World is believed to have rejected <b>NORML</b>'s

Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1995:</b>&nbsp; <em>Great Events
Monthly</em>, a bi-monthly newspaper edited by Jack Anderson, has
devoted its September/October edition to analyzing the pros and
cons of the &quot;War On Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Posing the question of whether to &quot;legalize&quot; drugs or
&quot;escalate&quot; enforcement, the special issue explores both
sides of the drug issue and features articles by a variety of
authors including syndicated columnist Doug Bandow and DEA
Administrator Thomas Constantine.&nbsp; The issue also includes
two feature articles on the subject of medical marijuana.&nbsp;
The first, written by the Oklahoma City chapter of NORML
describes the plight of Jimmy Montgomery, the paraplegic medical
marijuana user who was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison for
less than two ounces of cannabis.&nbsp; (Thanks in large part to
hundreds of phone calls and letters from the media and <b>NORML</b>
activists, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating signed for
Montgomery's medical release in late July.)&nbsp; The second
article focuses on both medical marijuana user Todd McCormick and
the ongoing legal battle for federal rescheduling reforms. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s contribution to the publication includes a full
page chart outlining the responses of two widely respected
doctors when asked to rank drugs on the basis of five problem
areas.&nbsp; (These areas are withdrawal, reinforcement,
tolerance, dependence, and intoxication.)&nbsp; Both Dr. Jack E.
Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal
L. Benowitz of The University of California at San Francisco
ranked marijuana as the least serious drug.&nbsp; Both doctors determined
marijuana to be less serious than caffeine. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Pierce County Superior Court Judge Rules<br>
That Cancer Patient Should Be Allowed To Use Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 13, 1995, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that may be a first for the nation, Superior Court Judge
Rosanne Buckner has ruled that a cancer patient's need to use
marijuana as medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing
its prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendant Ralph Seeley--a former journalist, lawyer, and cancer
patient--accomplished what no one else has done in a quarter
century of attempts.&nbsp; Seeley filed a declaratory judgment
action in Pierce County Superior Court, asking for a ruling that
the State's Constitution's reliance on &quot;fundamental
principles&quot; requires that marijuana be available as a
prescription substance.&nbsp; This past Friday, the Honorable
Judge Buckner agreed.&nbsp; A final order is being prepared. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think, practically speaking, the effect [of this ruling]
is to put prosecutions for medical marijuana use on hold,&quot;
Seeley said.&nbsp; During the court proceedings, Seeley's moving
argument contained numerous references to his own experiences as
a cancer patient, forced to choose between breaking the law or
enduring unbearable suffering.&nbsp; Seeley has undergone eight
surgeries on his spine, two lung surgeries--including the removal
of one lung--radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.&nbsp;
He faces another surgery next month. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jeffrey Steinborn, a Seattle lawyer who has represented a number
of clients in medical marijuana cases, called the ruling
significant.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's going to open the door to a
new wave of attempts to make this a legitimate medicine,&quot;
commented Steinborn, who is a friend of Seeley's.&nbsp; &quot;There's
a crack in the door now, a crack in the shell and I think it's
going to spread.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is monstrous to say [that] this substance cannot be used
as a medicine by people who are dying,&quot; Steinborn
concluded.&nbsp; &quot;I challenge any federal official to come
and debate the wisdom of this.&quot; <br>

Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1995, Sacramento CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill (A.B. 1529) by
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the prescribed medical
use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp; The
legislation would have provided for the controlled compassionate use
of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be
suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; This is the third consecutive time that
Wilson has vetoed a medical marijuana proposal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In reaction to Wilson's veto, a coalition of AIDS activists,
cancer survivors, seniors, nurses, and medical experts have filed
a medical marijuana initiative with the California Attorney
General's Office.&nbsp; Marijuana activist and head of
Californians for Compassionate Use, Dennis Peron, will be directing
the initiative drive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that any patients who possess a valid
doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a
therapeutic agent without fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; The initiative
also allows citizens to cultivate their own marijuana for
personal use and encourages state and federal governments to
establish a program that will provide for a safe and affordable
method of distribution.&nbsp; This coalition has 150 days to
collect 600,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Using patients as pawns is not right,&quot; declared Anna
Boyce, RN, in response to the governor's action.&nbsp; Boyce is

people who are suffering; it is being denied to them for purely political
reasons and that must change.&quot; <br>

In a ruling that could cast doubt upon the legality of many

the officer's phrase: &quot;hand it over&quot; was not a choice,

York Times Editorial Lashes Out At The Drug War</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1995, New York, NY:</b> Citing
statistics from a recently released Sentencing Project report,
The New York Times denounced the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; in a
Saturday editorial. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Noting that current data indicates that one in three black men
between the ages of 20 and 29 are involved somewhere in the
criminal justice system (either prison, pre-trial detention, on probation
or on parole), the Op-ed argues that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;
is rounding up a &quot;disproportionate&quot; number of black
Americans.&nbsp; In support of this notion, the editorial noted
that &quot;during the early 1990's, at a time when
African-Americans accounted for only 13 percent of monthly drug
users, African-Americans were involved in 35 percent of the
arrests for drug possession, 55 percent of the convictions and 74
percent of the prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although the editorial never spoke out in favor of legalization,
it did assert that America &quot;need[s] to rethink both drug and
punishment policies.&quot;&nbsp; These latest figures, the Times
concluded, &quot;should set off alarm bells from the White House
to city halls--and help reverse the notion that we can
incarcerate our way out of fundamental social problems. <br>

<p align="center"><b>County Sheriff, Undercover Agents Threaten
Sandusky County NORML<br>
With Indictments</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 30, 1995, Fremont, OH:</b> A
September 22 weekend rally put on by the Sandusky County Chapter
of NORML has stirred up more than just controversy following an
announcement by Sheriff David Gangwer that he had undercover
agents infiltrate the event. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am disappointed with the actions of this sheriff,&quot;
said Sandusky County NORML Chapter President, Tomas
Salazar.&nbsp; &quot;This is a direct attack on NORML and we are
being targeted for our beliefs.&nbsp; This is a violation of our
Constitutional right to assemble.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gangwer claims that the information and evidence gathered by his
agents will eventually be turned over to the Sandusky County
Prosecutor and state officials.&nbsp; The evidence could warrant the
need for a special grand jury to seek criminal indictments
against NORML, he added.&nbsp; Gangwer would not discuss what
charges were being considered. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;At the very least we hope the information we gathered will
prevent this from ever happening in this county or in this state
again,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Don't bet on it, claims Salazar, who is already preparing to
organize another Harvest Festival next year.&nbsp; &quot;I can't
see anything that they can charge NORML with,&quot; he
contends.&nbsp; &quot;NORML has always acted responsibly in all
of their events ... and I expect there will be no
indictments.&nbsp; This is harassment.&quot;&nbsp; Salazar added
that organizers required all attendees to sign a release
affirming that they would not engage in any illegal activities
during the course of the festival.&nbsp; The release also required
attendees to indicate that they were not an undercover law
enforcement official. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We have a right to socialize and that's what we did,&quot;
Salazar concluded. &quot;We never expected the big brouhaha that
was made out of it.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibition Establishment Attacks NORML
&amp; Capricorn Records<br>
For The Debut Of The Long-Awaited HEMPILATION Release</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN &amp; Washington,
D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Last week marked the first time ever that a major
recording label has released a benefit compilation of popular
musicians that will benefit the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).&nbsp; Available in music stores around
the nation, Capricorn Records' HEMPILATION contains major music
recording stars: Blues Traveler, The Black Crowes, Cypress Hill,
Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, Gov.'t Mule and twelve other
musical acts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We want people to think about freedom,&quot; explains Allen
St. Pierre of NORML.&nbsp; &quot;This is why the CD's subtitle is
'Freedom is NORML'.&nbsp; Participating artists view HEMPILATION
as a permanent, musical means of expressing their joint concerns
about the unfair restriction on Americans' civil liberties posed
by long standing government anti-marijuana efforts and a public statement
of their support for NORML. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On September 29, the Associated Press (AP) reported that
extremist anti-marijuana groups have already vowed to protest
HEMPILATION'S release.&nbsp; Devout prohibitionist Joseph
Califano, head of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA) at Columbia University, told AP, &quot;Why anyone would
want to take something that's dangerous and damaging and
encourage children to use it is beyond me.&quot;&nbsp; NORML's
Allen St. Pierre responds: &quot;I wish that Mr. Califano would
stop misrepresenting NORML's mission statement.&nbsp; For 25
years NORML has never advocated that anyone, especially children,
should use marijuana.&nbsp; NORML advocates that adults should
not face criminal or civil penalties for the use and possession
of marijuana in their homes.&nbsp; If Mr. Califano is truly
concerned about the welfare of today's children and 'pro-drug'
messages in our society, I strongly suggest that Mr. Califano
should begin by loudly advocating the prohibition of the
semi-pornographic beer commercials that litter professional and
collegiate sporting events aired on television.&nbsp; It's clear
that alcohol and tobacco are, by any measure, the two drugs that
Mr. Califano and his group should be focusing on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other prohibition groups such as the Atlanta-based Parents
Resources and Information on Drug Education (PRIDE) and the
Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council have indicated
that they would like to force this music off the market in a way
similar to their attempts to ban explicit rap music. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Freedom Of Speech Is Affirmed In Canada<br>
NORML Canada Wins Significant Court Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 28, King City, Ontario:</b>&nbsp; A
three-year legal struggle to allow citizens of Canada to have the
freedom to purchase and read literature that describes or depicts
&quot;illicit drug use&quot; has been won by Umberto Iorfida of
Canada NORML.&nbsp; In a letter to Iorfida's attorney, The
Attorney General (Ministry of Justice) indicates that the
Canadian government has decided not to appeal the decision handed
down on October 4, 1994 by the then Ontario Supreme Court [now
called the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division].&nbsp;
That decision removed from the Criminal Code offensive language
that made &quot;literature&quot; such as: NORML publications,
High Times magazine, HEMP BC catalogs, Jack Herer's &quot;The
Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot; and a myriad of other popular
published works illegal in Canada. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Madame Justice Ellen McDonald determined the inclusion of
&quot;literature&quot; in the Criminal Code to be inconsistent
with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms [The equivalent to the
United States' Bill of Rights--ed.] and unjustifiable in a free
and democratic society. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With this case finally put to rest, Iorfida and NORML Canada are
now going to focus all of their attention on defeating Bill
C-7.&nbsp; This legislation seeks to enhance the criminal
penalties in marijuana-related cases. <br>

800 Pounds Of Marijuana</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 20, Columbia, MO:</b>&nbsp; The
State of Missouri recently purchased 800 pounds of hemp,
otherwise known as marijuana through the Missouri affiliate of
NORML.&nbsp; The hemp is in the form of four 200 pound bales
which are being used as part of an exhibit at the Visitors'
Center of the Battle of Lexington State Historic Site.&nbsp; The
bales were made to the specifications of the Historic Site. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Battle of Lexington (also known as the Battle of the Hemp
Bales) took place in September of 1861.&nbsp; Approximately 3000
federal soldiers from Chicago looted the bank and created a makeshift
earthwork fort.&nbsp; Twenty thousand Missouri volunteers engaged
the federal troops.&nbsp; A three day siege of the fort led to a
stand-off until the Missourians had the idea of using the
recently harvested hemp bales as a moving defense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With water soaked hemp bales (to prevent the fire red hot

<p align="center"><b>School Board In Pennsylvania Votes To
Include &quot;Publications&quot; As Drug Paraphernalia</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, Octorara, PA:</b>&nbsp; By a 6-2
vote, the Octorara Area School Board adopted a policy that
enables school officials to suspend students for 10 days and
notify local police if student is caught on school grounds with &quot;publications
about drugs&quot; wrote a report in The Intelligencer Journal
(IJ). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to school administrators, the policy is needed because
&quot;publications ... brought to school have dealt with how to
grow marijuana and manufacture hallucinogenic drugs,&quot;
reported The New Era newspaper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While the vote to adopt the policy prevailed, strong opposition
was voiced by School Board Member John Addyman who was quoted in
the IJ as saying, &quot;I have a real problem saying a publication
should be banned.&quot;&nbsp; Addyman said when he took a seat on
the school board he swore to uphold the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;
&quot;That Constitution guarantees the right of free
speech,&quot; Addyman said.&nbsp; William Iacone, director of
special services, said administrators hope to target publications which
promote drugs by telling how to cultivate, buy, sell, use or
manufacture illegal drugs --and in some case, where to get
them.&nbsp; &quot;This is not freedom of speech,&quot; Iacone
said to the IJ. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also opposing the new policy was school board attorney, Alan
Jarvis.&nbsp; He told the IJ that publications are &quot;a tender
area&quot; of the law and cautioned the board on calling publications
drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; He said the policy might be
challenged.&nbsp; Despite Mr. Jarvis' reservations of the legality
of the board's actions, other board members chimed in: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - &quot;Leave it in [the policy change] and be
    challenged,&quot; said board member Sam Gasnow.&nbsp;
    &quot;That's what's right.&quot;&nbsp; Gasnow also asserted
    that students &quot;have no First Amendment rights in the
    classroom.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Board member Lawrence Gibbs [who supports the change in
    policy]: &quot;Why don't we stop by the library after the
    meeting.&nbsp; There may be a few books I want to get out of
    here.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Also, Superintendent Tom Sholvin commented, &quot;Today the
    right thing and the legal thing aren't always the same
    things.&nbsp; Our intent is not to take away anybody's rights.&quot;

Drugs: 'We're Losing The War On Drugs'</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN:</b>&nbsp; Joining
more than 60 other Federal judges, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Wiseman spoke up in opposition to this country's &quot;war on
drugs&quot; in an interview with The Tennessean.&nbsp; Judge
Wiseman said that &quot;We've spent $100 billion on the war on
drugs and we're losing it.&quot;&nbsp; Wiseman recommends that
the U.S. should legalize drugs.&nbsp; That, he says, is the only
real way to win the war.&nbsp; &quot;If you take the profit out
of it, nobody will be pushing it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wiseman, a 17 year veteran of the federal bench, said that when
President Bush escalated the war on drugs in 1989 [Omnibus Crime
Bill, Asset Forfeiture, DARE educational programs, Partnership
for a Drug Free (sic) America, Mandatory minimum prison
sentences, etc. ... -ed.], the country not only lost the battle,
but also, &quot;We've just about lost a generation of young

Patient Co-op Court Case Is Dropped</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Bainbridge Island, WA:</b>&nbsp;
The Seattle Times reports: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There is good news and bad news for Joanna McKee and her Green
Cross Patient Coop, busted earlier this year for supplying what
McKee says is 'medicinal marijuana' to people she describes as
patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The good news is that Kitsap County Superior Court Judge Leonard
Kruse threw out the search warrant used in a May raid when police
seized 162 marijuana plants from McKee's home.&nbsp; &quot;If the
warrant's no good, then all the evidence is out.&nbsp; If the
evidence is out, then we have no case to prosecute,&quot; said
Deputy Prosecutor Kevin Kelly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bad news for McKee is that it doesn't look like the county
plans to return her marijuana, estimated by drug enforcement
officials to be worth $300,000.&nbsp; McKee -- the first
medicinal marijuana supplier [Cannabis Buyer's Club--ed.] in the
country to be busted, according to NORML -- said she's going to
take Kitsap County to court.&nbsp; About 70 patients with AIDS, multiple
sclerosis, cancer and other illnesses ... depended on Green Cross
for marijuana ... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We were not convicted of a crime, and they have no right to
take our medicine away.&nbsp; They said they took $300,000 worth
of medicine away from us.&nbsp; I think they owe us
$300,000,&quot; said McKee.</p>

<p align="center"><b>The Dutch Government Modifies Its Drug
Policy<br>
Pressure Felt From Neighboring Countries</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 25, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
Dutch government announced some revisions of their progressive
drug policy at a news conference held at the National Press
Club.&nbsp; State-Secretary for the Interior, Jacob Kohnstamm, presented
to the U.S. press (what little there was assembled! -ed.] a list
of changes that the Dutch government are seeking to implement in
the coming years.&nbsp; While some of these changes may be viewed
by some as an abdication by the Dutch of the progressive drug
policies established in the 1970's, Secretary Kohnstamm was quick to
point out that The Netherlands is not abandoning its defacto
legalization of small amounts of cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Due to strong pressure from its neighboring countries (especially
France), The Netherlands seek to compromise with its neighbors
while still championing the social, public health, and criminal justice
benefits that it believes its drug policy presents. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Secretary Kohnstamm indicated that policy changes concerning
cannabis are: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The sale of cannabis products in &quot;coffee shops&quot;
    will be reduced from 30 grams per purchase to 5 grams, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -There will be a 50% reduction of the number of &quot;coffee
    shops&quot;, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The state will begin to combat the large-scale production of
    cannabis in the Netherlands, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Netherlands will also seek to establish a more active
    policy on the deportation of &quot;drug tourists&quot; and
    addicts residing illegally in the Netherlands. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Kohnstamm reiterated that the citizens and the government of
the Netherlands strongly support their drug policy.&nbsp; When
asked by an American reporter, &quot;Why don't the Dutch adopt a drug
policy similar to America's war on drugs approach?&quot; Mr.
Kohnstamm said that such a policy is considered a complete
failure in the minds of the Dutch.&nbsp; He cited the latest
statistics from both the U.S. and the Netherlands concerning the
prevalence of cannabis use amongst teens to make his case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Netherlands (where cannabis sales are tolerated) the rate
of teens admitting to using cannabis is: 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 13% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Last 30 days = 6% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    As compared to the United States (where there is a total
    prohibition on cannabis): <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 28% <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Legislature &quot;Just Says
No&quot; To Unpopular Marijuana Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 15, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor and possible Presidential nominee Pete Wilson
suffered a major defeat when the Republican controlled California
Assembly rejected his last ditch effort to renew the state's
&quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp; The controversial
legislation requires that the state impose a six-month drivers
license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related.&nbsp; The
law will expire on the 2nd of December. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Looming heavy over the head of the California Assembly's decision
to dissolve the &quot;Smoke a Joint&quot; legislation is the
issue of federal mandates.&nbsp; Because Wilson initially pushed
for the license suspension law by co-sponsoring a 1990 federal
mandate requiring the state to either enact the legislation or
pass an &quot;opt-out&quot; resolution explicitly rejecting the
policy, California now stands at risk of losing nearly $100
million in federal highway aid.&nbsp; Ironically, in recent
years, Wilson has been an outspoken proponent against the
legitimacy of federal mandates. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Governor Pete Wilson Expects To
Veto Medical Marijuana Bill<br>
For Third Consecutive Year</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
For the third time in as many years, the California State
Assembly has voted in favor of a bill that would allow for the
medical use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp;
However, sources close to the governor claim that Wilson will
once again veto the proposed legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, AB 1529, would provide for the controlled compassionate
use of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician
to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; In addition, this revised version of
the bill is worded in such a way so that it expressly avoids
conflicting with current federal policies prohibiting use of the
drug.&nbsp; (Wilson cited these policies as the basis for last
year's veto.)&nbsp; Despite the revision, however, a spokesman
for Wilson told the <em>San Diego Union Tribune</em> that the
governor &quot;hates&quot; the bill.&nbsp; AB 1529 is supported by
both the California Nurses Association and the California Senior
Legislature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to claims that Wilson will veto the measure, the
bill's author, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), has
blasted the governor as being more concerned with politics than with
human suffering.&nbsp; &quot;In a free society, people who are
ill shouldn't be made criminals to alleviate their pain,&quot;
said Vasconcellos.&nbsp; &quot;Wilson is engaging in politics of
pain.&nbsp; That's pathetic.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on bill AB 1529, please contact Dale
Gieringer of California NORML @ (415) 563-5858 or contact Dennis
Peron of Californians for Compassionate Use @ (415)
864-1961.&nbsp; In the coming months, the CCU intends to collect
the 600,000 signatures necessary to place this measure on the
1996 statewide ballot.&nbsp; This initiative is set to be filed
with the Attorney General's Office for title and summary on
Friday, September 29.</i></p>

<p align="center"><em><b>New York Times</b></em><b> Runs Feature
On Todd McCormick Bust</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 17, 1995, Bryan, 0H:</b>&nbsp; The <i>New
York Times</i> featured a major story on the case of medical
marijuana user Todd McCormick in the national edition of this
week's Sunday paper.&nbsp; The Times is the second nationally
syndicated paper to publicize McCormick's legal battle since his arrest
on July 18.&nbsp; USA Today referred to McCormick in an August 21
editorial supporting the use of medicinal marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick was arrested this past July when Ohio State Patrolmen
discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his
van.&nbsp; He is currently free on bail and staying with Don
Wirtshafter at the Ohio Hempery since having his bail dropped at
a September 7 bail reduction bearing.&nbsp; McCormick maintains
that the cannabis found in his vehicle, all of which was visibly
marked &quot;for medicinal use only,&quot; was intended to be
used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in Rhode Island and
was not meant for sale.&nbsp; He is charged with four felony drug
counts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked to comment on the McCormick case, John A. Mutter,
president of the 3000 member American Judge's Association, told
the <i>New York Times</i> that: &quot;It strikes me as being incongruous
that a doctor can prescribe for the well being of his patients
narcotic drugs like morphine that are habit forming, but they
can't prescribe marijuana.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Landmark State Decision Could
Spell Victory<br>
For McCormick's Upcoming Trial</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 10, 1995, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Civil liberty and personal privacy proponents achieved a major
victory last week when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled to severely
limit the rights of police to question citizens or search their
property after misdemeanor roadside traffic stops.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML President John Hartman applauded the court's ruling.&nbsp;
&quot;People in the cannabis community will be driving a little
easier [now] in the state of Ohio,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 4-3 decision, the court struck down the drug arrest of a man
whose car was searched following a routine traffic stop.&nbsp;
The court maintained that the evidence seized during the search was
invalid because the search itself was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; According to the AP,
&quot;The court said that although the driver gave his consent,
the search was improper because the deputy never told the driver
[that] he was free to go after the traffic stop and before the
drug search began.&quot;&nbsp; The law states that police cannot
automatically search a car based upon a traffic misdemeanor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Harry R. Reinhart praised the ruling.&nbsp; He
explained that hundreds of innocent Ohio motorists are stopped
each year by police and intimidated into having their automobiles searched
because law enforcement officials purposely neglect to inform
citizens of their legal right to say no. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One can only wait and see what potential ramifications this
decision may have on Todd McCormick's upcoming trial.&nbsp;
McCormick had his van searched after Ohio State Patrolmen pulled him
over &quot;because the curtains in [his] van were
closed.&quot;&nbsp; McCormick maintains that he did not give
police permission to search his vehicle. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 18, 1995, Tucson, AZ:</b>&nbsp; The
plight of medical marijuana user Richard Martinez looks to have
finally come to an end.&nbsp; Martinez was released from jail at
12 pm on September 18 and the charges against him have been
dismissed under rule 11 for incompetence.&nbsp; Martinez suffered
for over four months in Arizona jails while the state conducted
tests to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand
trial.&nbsp; He was shot through the right eye in 1991 and now
has brain damage.&nbsp; Martinez was charged with drug possession
when local authorities discovered that he was using marijuana in
place of his prescribed medication, Marinol. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Latest National Household Survey Results
Sound Marijuana Alarm (Again)</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking at a formal press conference, both Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Drug Czar Lee Brown took
time out to once again urge Americans to denounce the use of
marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana use is illegal, dangerous,
unhealthy, and wrong,&quot; Shalala reaffirmed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Armed with preliminary estimates from the 1994 National Survey on
Drug Abuse, the duo remarked that while overall illicit drug use
(defined as once in the past month) among the population as a
whole rose only marginally in the past year, the number of
teenagers using marijuana has nearly doubled since 1992.&nbsp;
&quot;Anyone who thinks we've licked the drug problem in this
country is living in a fantasy land,&quot; the Secretary remarked
at the press conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the study's preliminary findings, teens using
marijuana at least once a month rose from 4% in 1992 to 7.3% in
1994.&nbsp; Shalala called the findings &quot;a wake-up call for
America.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Put in historical context, however, the latest adolescent use
statistics still remain far below the peak reached in 1980.&nbsp;
According to annual studies conducted by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, the number of high school seniors ever having
admitted to experimenting with marijuana dropped significantly
from 50.9 percent in 1980 to 38.2 percent in 1994.&nbsp; Although
neither Brown nor Shalala mentioned this data during the
conference, the Office of National Drug Control Policy did
specify that even with the recent increase in the number of
teenagers admitting to having used marijuana regularly, current
adolescent rates of marijuana use still rank well below what they
were fifteen years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown speculated that the latest increase in teen marijuana
consumption might be due to pot's glamorization by the
entertainment industry. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the 1994 Household Survey preliminary
estimates, please contact </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>.&nbsp;

<p align="center"><b>Distinguished Chicago Judge Advocates
Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 14, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Posner, Chicago's chief federal appeals judge and one of
America's most prominent legal scholars, recommends that
marijuana use should be legalized as a way of reducing crime and
unclogging the courts.&nbsp; Posner, a Reagan administration appointee
once heralded by American Lawyer magazine as &quot;the most
brilliant judge in the country,&quot; is the highest ranking
judge to ever publicly advocate the repeal of marijuana
laws.&nbsp; His endorsement of marijuana reform was the focus of
a feature article in both <i>USA Today</i> and <i>The Times
Literary Supplement</i>, a British publication. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>USA Today</i> article, Posner stated that: &quot;It is
nonsense that we should be devoting so many law enforcement
resources to marijuana.&nbsp; I am skeptical that a society that
is so tolerant of alcohol and cigarettes should come down so hard
on marijuana use and send people to prison for life without
parole.&quot;&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>'s Senior Policy Advisor, Richard
Cowan, was also quoted in the story. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>USA Today</i> also ran an editorial endorsing the use of
marijuana as a medicine last month.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Secret Service Threatens Couple For Stamping
One Dollar Bills</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 11, 1995, Woodstock, New York:</b>&nbsp;
A couple who habitually brand their one dollar bills with a
marijuana leaf and the quote: &quot;I grew hemp,&quot; were
recently contacted by Woodstock police acting on behalf of the
Secret Service.&nbsp; Joy Beckerman and James Horn, owners of the
Heaven On Earth Hemp Store, report that the police came to them
with Xerox copies of stamped dollar bills and a written warning
from the secret service specifying that the practice of defacing
United States currency was a federal crime.&nbsp; Although Horn
admits that the local officers were laid back about the whole
issue, he claims that the notice stated that the U.S. Attorney
General would be contacted and charges would be pressed if the
couple didn't immediately stop the stamping. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While Horn fully admits to stamping many of his dollar bills with
the pro-hemp message, he is alarmed that the federal government
seems to be targeting him alone.&nbsp; Since Heaven On Earth
sells the &quot;I grew hemp&quot; stampers, the couple argues
that the government has no way of proving that the bills in
question were defaced by them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Horn says that he will continue to both sell stampers and stamp
some of his one dollar bills despite the warning.&nbsp; The
couple see their action as a way of informing the community of
hemp's industrial uses and its historical background as an
integral American crop. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Jury Rules That Hemp Seed Demonstration Is A
Protest, Not Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Madera, CA:</b>&nbsp; A jury
has acquitted three marijuana activists who challenged
authorities to prosecute them for publicly planting 20,000 hemp
seeds in me Sierra foothills.&nbsp; Hemp proponents Ron
Kiczenski, Doug Weissman, and Craig Steffens were all found not
guilty of felony cultivation.&nbsp; The trio, collectively known
as the Three Hawk Stand, were arrested by sheriffs deputies
following a July 4 public protest during which the defendants
planted hemp seeds in front of both media and local
authorities.&nbsp; Had they been found guilty, the three activists
each faced up to three years in jail and a $10,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The men were found innocent in spite of the court's efforts to
disallow the defense from presenting evidence that hemp can be
utilized as an industrial crop and that the defendants' action was
done strictly as a political protest.&nbsp; Earlier in the trial,
Judge John W. DeGroot had ruled that the only relevant issue in
the trial was whether or not the trio planted an illegal

[cultivation] charge,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Kiczenski believes that the Court's hardline approach
may have actually helped Three Hawk Stand's defense.&nbsp;
&quot;The prosecutor and the judge worked too hard,&quot; said
Steffens' attorney, Nancy Lord.&nbsp; &quot;The jury thought the
whole thing was rigged.&quot;&nbsp; The defendants were successful
in arguing that the seeds they had planted were legally
sterilized hemp seeds which were incapable of producing actual
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to reaching the three not guilty verdicts, the jury
also presented a prepared statement to the court regarding the
reasons behind and the potential impact of their decision.&nbsp;
Jury foreman Dean Mitchell read the following: &quot;Some jurors
agree with the cause in which you believe; some jurors are
totally opposed.&nbsp; Our verdict went outside of your
cause.&nbsp; The evidence left reasonable doubt in our
minds.&nbsp; Our admonishment to you three defendants is that we
are not sending you on a seed planting mission, but rather we
suggest you pursue your cause through alternative methods.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now that he's been acquitted, Kiczenski maintains that he will do
just that.&nbsp; Kiczenski plans to file a civil lawsuit
challenging the DEA's assumed control and jurisdiction over the
production of hemp. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Cannabis Patient Continues To Be
Denied Prescription<br>
Allegations of Civil Rights Abuses Prompt NORML Lawyers To Take
Action</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 2, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Recent
events have discouraged hopes that medical cannabis user Todd
McCormick will be legally permitted to use his prescribed
medicine -- marijuana -- while in jail.&nbsp; According to
McCormick, Judge Anthony Gretich is now requiring that an
American physician who has physically examined McCormick must
additionally submit a written statement supporting his
prescription for cannabis.&nbsp; McCormick must also secure a
local Ohio doctor to oversee the administration of his
prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick already has letters from three prominent American
doctors (<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.)
supporting his prescription.&nbsp; Inexplicably however, although
McCormick received these supportive statements on August 18, he
maintains that his public defender, John Schaffer, failed to file
any motions on his client's behalf until September 1.&nbsp;
McCormick had initially believed that the Court needed written
support from only one physician. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more alarming were recent reports of civil and
constitutional rights violations taking place against
McCormick.&nbsp; Following McCormick's live-from-prison telephone
interview with a local Ohio radio station, Warden Jim Dennis
reportedly forbade McCormick any further press contact.&nbsp; He
was also denied access to phone calls and visitors.&nbsp; In
response to these allegations, Cleveland attorneys Gordon S.
Friedman and Terry H. Gilbert of <b>NORML</b>'s Legal Committee
faxed a letter on September 1 to Warden Dennis informing him that
they bad been requested to investigate the abuse charges.&nbsp;
As a result of their letter, the Todd McCormick Alliance reports
that the warden has renewed McCormick's phone privileges and is
once again permitting him to speak to the media.&nbsp; The warden
is also allowing McCormick to use muscle relaxers to help
alleviate the pain and limited lateral head movement he suffers
as a result of acute nerve damage in his neck. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick is presently awaiting trial on four felony drug charges
following the discovery of 31 pounds of marijuana in his vehicle
by Ohio State Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the
cannabis, which was clearly marked &quot;for medicinal use
only,&quot; was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate
Use Club in Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp;
McCormick had previously founded a Compassionate Use Club in San
Diego. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A hearing to determine whether or not McCormick's $50,000 bail
should be lowered will be held on September 7, 1995. <br>

Czuprynski, the Bay City attorney who in 1992 was sentenced to 14
months in federal prison for possessing 1.6 grams of marijuana,
has had his conviction reversed by the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.&nbsp; Concluding that Federal Judge Robert Cleland
&quot;abused [his] discretion&quot; in his evidentiary rulings
during Czuprynski's trial, the higher court determined that the
prosecution lacked sufficient relevant evidence to show that Czuprynski
knowingly possessed marijuana.&nbsp; Czuprynski had maintained
throughout both his trial and conviction that the marijuana found
in his office had been planted and that his prosecution was political. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a written statement affirming the higher court's decision to
reverse, two of the judges admit that &quot;the [Czuprynski]
case...has occupied untold judicial resources.&quot;&nbsp; The
document also specifies that the amount of marijuana involved in
the case was &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;meager.&quot;&nbsp;
Federal sentencing guidelines for minor amounts of marijuana do
not recommend that a prison sentence should exceed more than 6
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski's September 1 victory is actually the second time that

<p align="center"><b>Update: Judge Considers Permitting Medical
Marijuana User To Smoke Cannabis<br>
While In Jail</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; In what
may end up being a precedent-setting decision, a Williams County
Judge is considering allowing marijuana activist Todd McCormick
to have legal access to medical cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;
McCormick is a medical marijuana user and co-founder of the San
Diego Compassionate Use Club--a facility in California that
supplies free marijuana to seriously ill patients based upon a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He is currently awaiting trial in
Ohio where he faces four felony charges resulting from the
discovery of 31 pounds of cannabis in his vehicle by Ohio State
Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; The marijuana was marked &quot;for
medicinal use only&quot; and McCormick maintains that it was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in his
hometown of Providence, Rhode Island. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At an arraignment last Thursday, Williams County Court of Common
Pleas Judge Anthony L. Gretick suggested that he might order the
Sheriff to allow McCormick to use cannabis while in jail if
McCormick could provide the court with written support by an
American physician.&nbsp; McCormick possesses a prescription from
a physician in the Netherlands that advises for the consumption
of ten grams of cannabis per day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to Gretick's suggestion, three prominent U.S. doctors
(<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.) wrote
letters supporting McCormick's need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
However, according to a Toledo Blade reporter covering the court
proceedings, the judge is now also requesting that a local doctor
be summoned to endorse and administer the prescription to
McCormick.&nbsp; As this report goes to press, no official action
has yet to be taken by Gretick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case gained national exposure this week when it was
mentioned in an August 21 <i>USA Today</i> editorial endorsing
the use of marijuana as a medicine for seriously sick
patients.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> had a letter supporting marijuana's
medical utility printed in <i>USA Today</i> the following day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on Todd McCormick's case, please contact
the Todd McCormick Alliance @ (619) 582-7303.&nbsp; For more

<p align="center"><b>California Residents Favor Access To Medical
Marijuana<br>
According To Recent Health Poll</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
recent poll by Mervin Field for the California Center for Health
Improvement indicates that although many Californians still
remain concerned about illicit drug use, the majority of the
state still support the medicinal use of marijuana.&nbsp; This
conclusion directly contradicts earlier statements made by Dr.
Andy Mecca, director of the state Department on Alcohol and Drug
Programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the California Health Poll, 57 percent of the
respondents stated that they favored granting doctors the ability
to legally prescribe marijuana to their patients.&nbsp; By
comparison, only 22 percent favored similar prescriptions for
cocaine.&nbsp; Ironically, cocaine is currently classified as a Schedule
II drug which allows for its medical use in certain instances
while marijuana remains classified by the federal government as
having &quot;no medical use.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>New York City Buyers Club Busted<br>
Apparent Nationwide Crackdown On Medical Marijuana Clubs
Continues</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1995, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; New
York City activists have reported that law enforcement officials
recently busted New York City's underground cannabis buyers
club.&nbsp; The New York club was one of over thirty such clubs
that currently operate and distribute medical marijuana to
seriously ill patients.&nbsp; Longtime AIDS and drug reform
activist Johann Moore was arrested at the scene and held
overnight.&nbsp; He is reportedly charged with one count of
felony sales. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bust of the New York City Medical Buyers Club--a small buyers
club that had consciously maintained a relatively low
profile--seems to support the notion that law enforcement
agencies across the country are beginning a concerted effort to
crackdown on medical marijuana clubs.&nbsp; In the past few
months, both Todd McCormick (San Diego Compassionate Use Club)
and Joanna McCkee (Green Cross Patient Co-op of Washington) have
been arrested and had their marijuana seized by law enforcement
officials. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Two NORML Chapters Fight For Their Rights...
And Win!</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Two NORML chapters recently emerged victorious in
their fights against local censorship restrictions.&nbsp; In two
separate incidents, Northcoast NORML (OH) and University of
Oklahoma NORML were initially denied access to public forums
because of their organization's marijuana-tolerant beliefs.&nbsp;
However, after threatening to take legal action in order to
defend their First Amendment rights, both chapters subsequently
prevailed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Northcoast NORML president, John Hartman, the local
chapter will now be allowed to display public service
announcements on the rear and/or side of Cuyahoga city
busses.&nbsp; Regional Transit Authority officials had originally
refused to post the organization's PSA's.&nbsp; However, upon
learning that an ACLU lawyer had accepted the case, the RTA
quickly reversed its opinion.&nbsp; The RTA has informed
Northcoast NORML that the group's displays must meet the same
requirements as do political advertisements and must bear the
organization's name and address.&nbsp; Hartman says that adhering
to these standards should not be a problem and hopes to use the
ads to raise awareness of the fact there have been over ten
million marijuana arrests since 1965. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a similar scenario, University of Oklahoma NORML will now be
permitted to run a month-long hemp exhibit in the display case of
the Norman (OK) Municipal Public Library.&nbsp; Originally, the
chapter's request to gain access to the display case was denied
by library management.&nbsp; OU NORML challenged this decision
and charged that the library was engaging in discrimination.&nbsp;
OU NORML further argued that the library's denial of their
request violated the written anti-censorship policy of the
National Library Association.&nbsp; Following this assertion, the library
promptly rewrote their own policy in order to justify their
previous decision.&nbsp; OU NORML then had an ACLU lawyer send
the library a letter requesting them to change their new policy
and grant the NORML chapter access to the public display
case.&nbsp; Library officials finally consented following the
ACLU's letter.&nbsp; The OU NORML hemp exhibit is slated to be on
display this upcoming February. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information regarding these cases, please contact

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 17, 1995, Marblehead, MA:</b>&nbsp;
Mass Cann: NORML has announced that it must cancel its scheduled
weekend Hempfest (Aug. 26-27) because of an abrupt change of
heart by the Royalston Board of Selectmen.&nbsp; Plans are
already underway to hold a protest on the green outside Royalston
Town Hall.&nbsp; The demonstration is slated to take place at
noon on August 26. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Steve Epstein, an attorney and Chairman of Mass Cann: NORML,
explained that the Royalston Board of Selectmen suddenly
&quot;changed its position and determined that the club did not have
the necessary permits [required] under state law to host the
event.&quot;&nbsp; Epstein further states that Mass Cann: NORML
had &quot;met [previously] with them on August 6 and were told
that no additional permits were required.&quot;&nbsp; Mass Cann:
NORML wasn't alerted to the fact that the group would need an
additional permit until August 11. The board refuses to allow the
event without the necessary authorizations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">William Downing, President of Mass Cann: NORML maintains that:
&quot;The decision of the board was motivated by an illegal
desire to prevent [our organization] from expressing [its]
opinions on marijuana prohibition.&quot;&nbsp; He additionally
states that: &quot;They could stop Hempfest because of [a permit
requirement, but] they cannot stop 'HEMP-PROTEST' because of the
First Amendment.&quot;&nbsp; Mass Cann: NORML had been hosting
events similar to Hempfest for approximately the past six years. <br>

Following directly on the heels of this past June's U.S. Supreme

urine tests for all athletes regardless of probable cause, a
Fishers school board is attempting to force high school students
to submit to drug tests before they are issued parking permits. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Principle Gary Wiersema was asked by the board to adopt the new
policy before school opens August 23.&nbsp; Wiesema maintains
that such a proposal should not be instituted so swifty and has advised
the board to move slowly on the issue.&nbsp; &quot;Kids still
have rights,&quot; he told the Palladium-Item after an initial
meeting with the board. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An attorney for the school has stated that he believes such a
measure would stand up in a court of law based upon the U.S.
Supreme Court's previous rulings regarding drug testing.&nbsp;
&quot;If the rationale to randomly test athletes is because of
safety,&quot; he told the Palladium-Item, &quot;[then] the school
has the ability to control who drives.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Resolution To Be Unveiled
At Upcoming Conference</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 9, 1995, San Diego, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
resolution calling for governments everywhere to &quot;immediately
rescind their policies of arresting ... marijuana consumers who
currently possess and/or cultivate cannabis for their own medical
use&quot; will be introduced by Dr. Erik Fromberg at the 37th
International Congress on Drugs and Alcohol Dependency.&nbsp; The
resolution further demands that governments start separating the
medical issue &quot;from the recreational drug issue and begin actively
studying cannabis' use as a therapeutic agent.&quot;&nbsp; Dr.
Fromberg is a representative from the Netherlands Institute on
Alcohol and Drugs (NIAD).&nbsp; The international conference is
scheduled to be held August 20-25 in San Diego, California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also attending the Congress will be the Todd McCormick
Alliance.&nbsp; The Alliance has declared an &quot;international
state of emergency on medical cannabis&quot; and is embarking on
an &quot;information blitz&quot; to raise public awareness.&nbsp;
The organization will be holding a round table discussion on the
medical use of cannabis on August 22 and is planning to hold a
public rally on August 25.&nbsp; The group is named after San
Diego Compassionate Use Club founder and medical marijuana user,
Todd McCormick.&nbsp; McCormick was arrested in Ohio on July 18
when State Highway Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty
pounds of marijuana in his van.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the cannabis was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate
Use Club in his home state of Rhode Island. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information about the medical marijuana resolution,

<p align="center"><b>Registered Nurse Contacts NORML In An Appeal
To Save The Life Of Her Patient</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 4, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; In an
attempt to stimulate national attention and awareness to the
plight of her patient, Richard G. Martinez, neuro-rehabilitation
nurse and Martinez's legal guardian, Constance Theis, has
contacted <b>NORML</b> with a story of unparalleled injustice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After having been shot through the left eye in 1991, Richard
Martinez was left with an excruciatingly painful nerve disorder
known as trigeminal neuralgia.&nbsp; In addition, many fragments from
the bullet could not be removed during surgery and still remain
lodged in Martinez's brain.&nbsp; The presence of these fragments
induces cognitive deficits and seizure disorders and also gives
rise to frequent bouts of intense nausea and severe
depression.&nbsp; To help alleviate Martinez's daily pain, he was
granted a legal prescription for Marinol -- a federally approved
THC synthetic drug.&nbsp; The Marinol, however, ended up being
far too expensive ($636.00 per month) for Martinez to afford on
his social security disability-based income.&nbsp; As a result,
Martinez turned to the next logical substitute, natural cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez was turned in to authorities for possessing marijuana by
a relative in exchange for a small financial reward.&nbsp; He now
sits in Durango County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona, where he is
forced to sleep on a dirty floor and is prevented from taking his
proper medication.&nbsp; While in jail, Martinez has suffered
numerous staph infections in the eye socket and ear.&nbsp; Staph
infections put tremendous pressure on the heart and, if left
untreated, can be fatal.&nbsp; The tremendous swelling from these infections
is causing green pus to flow from Martinez's right nostril.&nbsp;
In addition, Martinez's serious infections are destroying
valuable tissue and bone in his face.&nbsp; This deterioration
has gotten so extreme that Martinez now believes that his eye may
actually be &quot;rotting.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez is also experiencing critically high blood pressure and
is now at risk of suffering a stroke.&nbsp; This occurrence is a
natural physical result of untreated pain and infection.&nbsp;
The threat of a severe stroke -- in addition to his constant
fevers, infections, tissue deterioration, and ear aches -- makes
Martinez's incarceration highly life threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the reports of three separate physicians, Martinez's
head wound seriously damaged his right frontal lobe and has
rendered him mentally incompetent.&nbsp; Therefore, he can not legally
stand trial.&nbsp; The state, however, wants Martinez to appear
in court regardless.&nbsp; Consequently, psychologists at the
Durango County Jail are working round the clock to have Martinez
declared mentally competent.&nbsp; Ms. Theis maintains that this
process can last as long a seven or eight months -- a time frame
that she believes Martinez will not survive.&nbsp; The bitter
irony is that the state is trying to legally rehabilitate a man
with braln damage solely for the purpose of throwing him back in
jail.&nbsp; All this because Martinez was trying to alleviate
daily pain, nausea, and seizures with the only effective
therapeutic agent he could financially afford -- marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Constance Theis maintains that her patient's life is in danger
every additional day he stays in the Durango County Jail.&nbsp;
She can be contacted at the following numbers: (602) 790-1595
(home) or (602) 325-1300 EXT 4435 (work).</p>

Jail For Contempt of Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 2, 1995, Seattle, WA:</b>&nbsp; Joanna
McKee, activist, medicinal marijuana advocate, and co-founder of
Washington's Green Cross Patient Co-op turned herself in to local
authorities to begin serving a two day sentence for leaving the
state against a judge's orders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mckee, 52, was arrested on May 3 when regional task force agents
raided her medical marijuana cooperative in Brainbridge
Island.&nbsp; According to authorities, approximately 130 marijuana
plants were seized during the raid. McKee's Green Cross Patient
Co-op is believed to have been the first &quot;Cannabis Buyers
Club&quot; in the nation aggressively targeted by the law enforcement
community.&nbsp; Over 30 such &quot;Clubs&quot; currently operate
throughout the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following her May arrest, McKee was released on her own
recognizance pending trial in September.&nbsp; However, a Kitsap
County Superior Court judge ordered her not to leave the
state.&nbsp; McKee recently defied this court order when she flew
to Washington DC to attend the National Institute on Drug Abuse's
first ever conference on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McKee's arrest and subsequent legal problems have garnered both
considerable local and national media attention.&nbsp; USA Today
mentioned her probable return to jail in its July 20 issue and all
three local network affiliates were on hand to cover McKee's
surrender to police on August 2. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, McKee's return to jail comes less than three weeks
after San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder, Todd McCormick,
was arrested by authorities while on route to Rhode Island.&nbsp; McCormick
faces felony drug charges. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 27, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; A
proposal to eliminate the position of White House drug policy
advisor (currentiy held by Lee Brown) has been approved by the
Senate House Appropriations Committee. President Clinton has
stated that he will veto any legislation that intends to abolish
the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown's office has recentiy come under fire from both Republicans
and Democrats alike for a &quot;lack of visibility&quot; in
fighting illegal drug use and trafficking.&nbsp; ONDCP proponents
have countered by arguing that since the creation of a national
&quot;drug czar&quot; seven years ago, the Office has significantly
reduced the power of Colombian drug cartels and has helped lead
the campaign against adolescent marijuana use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">National studies indicate that marijuana use among American teens
has been on the rise since 1991.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Compassionate Use Club Founder
Arrested On Route To Rhode Island</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Longtime
activist and medical marijuana user Todd McCormick was arrested
and charged with two felony drug counts when Ohio State Highway
Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in
his van.&nbsp; McCormick's passenger, Natalie Byrd, was also
taken into custody and faces similar felony drug charges.&nbsp;
Both activists are currently being held at the Correction Center
of Northwest Ohio where bail has been set, without bond, at
$150,000 each. McCormick's preliminary hearing is scheduled to
take place today.&nbsp; Byrd's scheduled hearing has been
postponed to take place at a later date.&nbsp; McCormick, age 25, is
the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use Club.&nbsp; The
San Diego Club is one of approximately thirty Cannabis Buyers
Clubs located across the country.&nbsp; The purpose of the Clubs,
many of which have recently received favorable media coverage and
have been grudgingly tolerated by local law enforcement, is to
supply cannabis to seriously ill patients based upon a doctor's
recommendation.&nbsp; Typically, these patients are suffering
from the effects of AIDS, cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS),
glaucoma, and spinal disorders.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that
the marijuana found in his van was intended to be used to
establish a Compassionate Use Club in his home state of Rhode
Island.&nbsp; He told police that it was not for sale.&nbsp; All
of the cannabis dispensed at McCormick's San Diego Club was
donated and was available to patients on a &quot;no charge&quot;
basis.&nbsp; The 30+ pounds of cannabis was visibly labeled
&quot;for medical use.&quot;&nbsp; Based on the evidence seized during
McCormick's arrest in Ohio on the 18th, DEA agents subsequently
raided his Rolando, California house three days later.&nbsp; None
of the four residents staying at the house at the time of the raid
were arrested; however, a small quantity of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; Also confiscated by federal agents were videotapes,
books on the subject of legalizing marijuana, various computer
disks, film, and smoking paraphernalia.&nbsp; In addition,
numerous petition signatures calling for a California marijuana
legalization initiative were also seized, but have since been
returned.&nbsp; All four residents have said that they are
committed to making marijuana medically available to chronically
ill patients.&nbsp; Although the significant amount of marijuana
present and the rural venue do not make McCormick's case ideal
for a medical necessity defense, he feels that a number of Fourth Amendment
violations make his case winnable.&nbsp; Most importantly,
McCormick contends that law enforcement officials searched his
vehicle without his consent or a warrant.&nbsp; McCormick
maintains that one officer claimed to &quot;smell pot,&quot; at
which time McCormick voluntarily showed the trooper his
prescription for medical cannabis.&nbsp; At this point, his van
was searched and the bundles of marijuana were found.&nbsp;
McCormick acquired his prescription from a doctor in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Aside from being an activist on the front lines of the medical
marijuana issue, McCormick is also a medical marijuana
user.&nbsp; McCormick has battled cancer on ten different
occasions and first started smoking cannabis to alleviate the
significant side effects of radiation and chemotherapy.&nbsp; He now
uses the therapeutic effects of the drug to combat acute nerve
damage in his neck.&nbsp; This damage came about when the first
five vertebrae in his neck fused together as a result of the
cancer and greatly limits McCormick's lateral head
movement.&nbsp; McCormick attributes the regular smoking of
cannabis as the prime reason for the improvement in his condition
and lateral head mobility.&nbsp; He further maintains that the
prescription he acquired in the Netherlands makes it legal for
him to transport cannabis in all United Nations.&nbsp; Recently,
his prescription had enabled him to enter America through U.S.
Customs in Colorado while carrying cannabis.&nbsp; Those wishing
to donate funds to Todd McCormick's defense can send their
financial support to the following address: Don Wirtshafter Law
Trust Account, P. O. Box 18, Guysville, Ohio 45735.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Arrests Hit Ten Million
Mark...&nbsp; Drug Czar Compares Marijuana to Cocaine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from 1993 Justice Department
statistics (FBI Uniform Crime Reports), the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws estimates that the total number
of marijuana arrests since 1965 will pass the ten million mark on
July 20th, 1995.&nbsp; Mounting at the rate of more than <strong>one
thousand per day</strong>, more than 80% of these arrests are
solely for personal possession.&nbsp; The balance are for
cultivation--often for personal use--or for sale, usually a
involving a very small quantity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To put these numbers in context: Marijuana arrests in 1993
(380,690) made up approximately <strong>one third</strong> of the
1.1 million total drug arrests that year.&nbsp; By comparison,
there were approximately 600,000 arrests for violent
crimes.&nbsp; This year, the Clinton Administration sought to
provide 100,000 new police.&nbsp; Now, if an arrest, transporting
the arrestee to jail, paper work, etc. ideally takes only 2
hours, and there is only one officer involved, then marijuana
arrests currently use the time of approximately one hundred
thousand police per year.&nbsp; There are approximately 550,000 state
and local police officers.&nbsp; Thus, approximately 20% of their
total time is consumed by marijuana arrests. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Obviously, this burden on police resources is not the same in all
jurisdictions.&nbsp; In 11 states, marijuana possession has been
decriminalized and the police typically issue citations rather
than arrest an offender.&nbsp; Additionally, in most major cities
marijuana possession is a very low priority.&nbsp; However, in
some smaller towns, it seems to be a major focus for the
police.&nbsp; For example, in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, police
searched Scott Bryant's garbage for marijuana residue for several days
before getting a warrant and shooting him dead on April 17.&nbsp;
He was unarmed and less than an ounce of marijuana was
found.&nbsp; In a small town in Oklahoma, paraplegic and medical
marijuana user Jimmy Montgomery was sentenced to 10 years for
possession of less than two ounces.&nbsp; He is still awaiting
release on a medical parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the prospect of being able to seize valuable property
under civil forfeiture has created an incentive to seek out
marijuana cultivation.&nbsp; This is believed to have been the
reason for the 1992 raid on multimillionaire Donald Scott's
estate near Malibu that resulted in his being killed by
police.&nbsp; No marijuana was found.&nbsp; The effect of these
increasing arrests on marijuana availability, however, seems to
be negligible.&nbsp; According to Joseph Califano, Chairman of
the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, &quot;American
children are telling us they are drenched in drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Clinton Administration is now devoting most of its efforts to
the suppression of marijuana.&nbsp; Drug Czar Lee Brown in a
press release on July 17 cited a survey commissioned by
Califano's group.&nbsp; Brown said that: &quot;91% of the
population blames illegal drug and alcohol abuse for the rate of
violent crime that we have in America today.&nbsp; This fact
alone should tell the media that they need to make the connection
between drug use and violent crime in their news
stories.&quot;&nbsp; However, in a letter to the editor of the
Summer issue of <em>Forbes Media Critic</em>, Califano himself
points out that marijuana &quot;has not been associated with high
levels of violence.&quot; In fact, most of the violence in our society
is associated with alcohol -- <strong>not marijuana</strong>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Perhaps even more misleading is the media advisory from Brown's
office announcing &quot;marijuana sends virtually the same
numbers to emergency rooms as cocaine.&quot;&nbsp; This statement
is supposedly based on numbers from DAWN, the Drug Abuse Warning
Network.&nbsp; In truth, the DAWN statistics say nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; First, they deal with emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>,
not causes of admission established by a doctor.&nbsp; The DAWN
figures further demonstrate that over 80% of marijuana mentions
are in conjunction with problems associated with alcohol,
cocaine, or some other drug.&nbsp; In cases where marijuana is
the only drug <strong>mentioned</strong>, the problem is almost
always a panic attack by inexperienced users.&nbsp; There is no
practical lethal dose of marijuana and the only adverse acute
effects of marijuana are transitory and not life or health
threatening. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, the hospital emergency room <strong>mentions</strong>
of marijuana are neither qualitatively nor quantitatively
comparable to those caused by cocaine.&nbsp; However, the
children of America might get the impression from Brown's
statement that the risks associated with cocaine are no greater
than those associated with marijuana.&nbsp; This conclusion would
seem to be the antithesis of drug education.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
National Director Richard Cowan commented that the Clinton Administration's
drug policy concentrating on marijuana seems to be aimed at
avoiding &quot;inhale&quot; jokes at all costs.&nbsp; Another ten
million arrests is too high a price to pay for that.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Not All Marijuana Law Victims Are Arrested:<br>
Police Officer Who Fatally Shot Suspected Marijuana User Cleared
Of Criminal Charges</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 6, 1995, Beaver Dam, WI</b>:&nbsp;
According to a lengthy article in the <i>Madison Isthmus</i>, Detective
Robert Neuman -- the police officer who on April 28 fatally shot
suspected marijuana user Scott Bryant in his home -- has been
recently cleared of criminal charges by a Sheboygan County
District Attorney. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officer Neuman shot and killed twenty-nine year old Scott Bryant
on April 28 when he and three other police officers barged into
Bryant's mobile home executing a no knock/no announce warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist arrest; his seven year old
son, Colton, was present during the shooting.&nbsp; A total of
less than one ounce of marijuana was found in the apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">District Attorney Wells concluded that, &quot;The shooting of
Scott Bryant was not in any form justified.&quot;&nbsp; However,
he also determined that the shooting was
&quot;unintentional,&quot; and thus, could not file homicide
charges.&nbsp; Wells theorizes that, &quot;[Officer Neuman's]
hand may have clenched either as he jerked his weapon toward the
noise and struck the door, or in 'sympathetic physical reaction'
to his other hand, which was also grasping.&quot;&nbsp; A
gun-maker of the Beretta used by Neuman finds such an occurrence
to be unlikely since the Beretta's double action draw length
&quot;helps reduce the chance of ... inadvertent
discharges.&quot;&nbsp; Neuman claims that he has &quot;no
recollection of pulling the trigger.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wells also ruled out charges of criminal recklessness in the
Neuman shooting, claiming that the detective &quot;could not have
had a 'conscious, subjective awareness' that his gun handling
created a grave risk, since his partner was in the line of
fire.&quot;&nbsp; The <i>Isthmus</i> article further adds that
because of the employment of an &quot;outdated legal
definition,&quot; Wells also cleared Neuman of the charge of criminal
recklessness.&nbsp; As a result, Officer Neuman can return to
regular active duty. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The fatal shooting of Scott Bryant by law enforcement officials
is yet another example of the government's continued war against
marijuana users.&nbsp; In a similar instance, disabled Vietnam veteran
Gary Shepard was shot and killed by police in August of 1992 as
he and his family stood on the front porch of his home in rural
Kentucky.&nbsp; Shepard had been engaged in a day-long standoff
with law enforcement officials after he refused to let police cut
down the marijuana plants growing on his property.&nbsp; Perhaps
even more shocking was the October 2, 1993 fatal shooting of millionaire
rancher Donald Scott.&nbsp; Scott was killed when law enforcement
officials raided his Malibu property searching for 40 pounds of
marijuana.&nbsp; No marijuana was ever found.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Number Of Jail Inmates Experiences Third
Largest Increase Since 1983</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the most recent <i>Census of Jails
and Annual Survey of Jails</i> report, the jail population of the
United States rose by 30,638 inmates between July 1, 1993, and
June 30,1994.&nbsp; This growth marks the third largest annual
increase recorded since 1983. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more striking were the report's findings that: &quot;Since
1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a per
capita basis.&nbsp; During this period the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 96 to 188.&quot;&nbsp;
Consequently, the report estimates that about 1 in every 398
adult residents (and 1 in every 212 men) are in a local jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Not surprisingly, the largest source of growth among inmates in
local jails was drug law violators.&nbsp; Because of increased
law enforcement and stiffer penalties under the &quot;War on
Drugs,&quot; the number of jail inmates charged or convicted of
drug offenses increased from 20,800 in 1983 to 91,000 in
1989.&nbsp; Subsequently, the percentage of inmates serving time
in jail for drug offenses has skyrocketed from 10% in 1983 to
nearly 25% in 1989.&nbsp; This figure accounts for more than 40%
of the total increase in jail population.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Prohibition Subject To New Legal
And Scientific Challenge: Petition Demands U. S. Government
Provide Finding On Marijuana's Abuse Potential As Required By Federal
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling marijuana prohibition a &quot;fraud and a
failure,&quot; longtime activist and former <b>NORML</b> National
Director Jon Gettman filed a rule making petition with the Drug
Enforcement Administration on July 10, 1995 demanding that the
agency immediately initiate proceedings to re-evaluate
marijuana's Schedule I status under the Controlled Substances
Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">By law, the DEA is required to forward such petitions to the
Department of Health and Human Services for a binding medical and
scientific evaluation.&nbsp; The petition is based on a
comprehensive review of recent scientific evidence demonstrating
that marijuana does not have &quot;sufficient abuse potential to
warrant Schedule I or II status under the Controlled Substances
Act.&quot;&nbsp; The CSA mandates that a scientific finding
affirming that a drug has a high potential for abuse is required
to maintain the complete prohibition of any drug or substance
under Schedule I.&nbsp; (21 USC ¤812(b)(1))&nbsp; <u>No such
finding </u><b><u>has ever existed</u></b><u> for marijuana</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DEA Administrator Constantine has claimed in an exchange of
letters that abuse potential is irrelevant to the scheduling of
drugs with no accepted medical use.&nbsp; When Gettman reminded Constantine
that this position was explicitly rejected by the U.S. Court of
Appeals in 1977 (NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 736), Constantine boldly
challenged him to pursue action in an April 21, 1995 letter to
United States Senator John Warner (R-VA).&nbsp; In this letter,
Constantine stated that: &quot;[The DEA is] unaware of any new
scientific studies of marijuana that would lead us to re-evaluate
its classification at this time; therefore no such evaluation is
now in process nor do we feel [that one is] necessary based on
the information available to us.&nbsp; [However,] if Mr. Gettman has
scientific data concerning marijuana which he wishes to bring to
our attention, we will be pleased to consider it, should he care
to share the documentation with us.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Constantine's statements, Gettman has produced a
279 page petition referencing nearly 170 scientific journals and
government reports.&nbsp; Of prime importance to Gettman's arguments
is the recent discovery of a cannabinoid receptor system in the
human body.&nbsp; This discovery has radically altered
contemporary knowledge about marijuana's effects on the body and the
brain.&nbsp; According to Gettman, &quot;These new findings
directly contradict many of the DEA's on-record findings of
'fact' which have been used to block prior reconsideration of
marijuana's scheduling status.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Until 1990, no one knew how marijuana affected the
brain.&nbsp; Marijuana prohibition has assumed that science would
eventually prove marijuana had a high potential for abuse.&nbsp;
Science has demolished that assumption, and established marijuana
prohibition as a cruel fraud upon the American public. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">No scientist has ever established that marijuana has a high
potential for abuse, and now we know that no science can.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Simply put, drugs with a high potential for abuse induce
self-administration in animals, and affect the production of the
neurotransmitter dopamine.&nbsp; Marijuana does neither.&nbsp; To
retain marijuana in Schedule I creates a double standard
forbidden by the 14th Amendment - one set of rules for all other
drugs, and a different set of rules for marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A 78 page booklet entitled <i>The Scientific and Legal Basis for
the End of Marijuana Prohibition</i> reviewing some of the
research cited in Gettman's petition will be forthcoming from <b>NORML</b>
at a cost of $10 plus $2.50 shipping and handling.&nbsp;
Summaries of the scientific and medical evidence supporting the
petition are available from <b>NORML</b> and will soon be
available on the Internet.&nbsp; Jon Gettman has also described
this new research in articles in the March and July 1995 issues
of <i>High Times</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[<i>Jon Gettman can be contacted for further information about
this rule-making petition c/o </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>.&nbsp;
Other activists who wish to file their own similar rule making
petitions with the DEA should refer to sections 21 CFR Ch. II
¤1308.44 of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice manual.</i>]</p>

<p align="center"><b>10 Million Arrests and NIDA; Bad Science
Used to Justify Bad Policies<br>
by Richard Cowan, National Director of NORML</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On July 20th, NORML will mark the 10 millionth
marijuana arrest since 1965.&nbsp; While there is no way to be
certain on what date the actual 10 millionth arrest will take
place, Justice Department records indicate that it will occur
around this time.&nbsp; Our choice of this particular date was
spurred by the fact that it will be the last day of a two day
conference on marijuana sponsored by NIDA, the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NIDA is supposed to be a scientific organization dedicated to
finding the truth about &quot;drug abuse&quot; and effective ways
to deal with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, NIDA long ago became a
politicized propaganda mill dedicated to justifying the continued
arrest of marijuana users.&nbsp; This problem is well illustrated
by an article by former NIDA head (and former Drug Czar) Robert
DuPont being run on newspaper op-ed pages as &quot;The Case
Against Legalizing Drugs.&quot;&nbsp; In it, DuPont exploits two
frightening sounding factoids about marijuana use in the
Netherlands. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, he says that from 1984 to 1992 adolescent marijuana use
increased by 250% in the Netherlands while it decreased by two
thirds in the US during that time.&nbsp; Even if one takes the dubious
American numbers at face value (They have been criticized by the
GAO and probably greatly understate real usage rates.), these
numbers hide more than thay reveal.&nbsp; DuPont fails to say that
-- even after 20 years of having marijuana readily available --
the rate of &quot;regular&quot; use (one or more times in the
last month) by Dutch adolescents in 1992 was <u>still below the
lowest use by American adolescents in the last 20 years</u>.&nbsp;
He also fails to say that regular use by American high school
seniors soared 40% in two years to 19% in 1994.&nbsp; All this
was while American marijuana users were being arrested at the
rate of 1,000 per day.&nbsp; Moreover, from 1984 to 1992 there
were almost 3 million Americans arrested on marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This is hardly a minor cost or a sign of a
successful policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Then he states that there has been a &quot;30% increase in
registered marijuana addicts&quot; in Holland.&nbsp; This is also
very misleading.&nbsp; The Dutch use the term &quot;addicts&quot;
very broadly to include both compulsive gamblers as well as
people who think that their marijuana use has become a
problem.&nbsp; Such persons are not registered as
&quot;addicts&quot; for any purpose other than being enrolled in
an out-patient therapy program.&nbsp; This is not the equivalent
of a methadone maintenance program. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1993, there were only 1,700 people enrolled in this program
out of a regular Dutch cannabis user population of approximately
650,000.&nbsp; This enrollment represents roughly one regular marijuana
user in 400.&nbsp; In the US we arrest the equivalent of one
regular marijuana user in 40 every year.&nbsp; Is that somehow a
better policy?&nbsp; Is being arrested harmless? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DuPont next uses these numbers out of context to project what he
says would happen if the US followed the Dutch model.&nbsp; He
claims that, &quot;The evidence from the Netherlands suggest that
if the United States were to legalize currently illicit drugs,
the numbers would probably increase from the present 12 million
to something like the 50 million who use tobacco or even the 103
million who use alcohol.&quot;&nbsp; DuPont had to dig through
and ignore all of the facts that I have cited in order to support
his predetermined conclusion.&nbsp; Why would someone do
this?&nbsp; What a bizarre view of the American people this
reflects. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, even the carefully selected numbers that DuPont cites
out of context do not support his conclusions.&nbsp; Indeed, why
-- after 20 years of having marijuana readily available -- hasn't
Dutch marijuana use increased to the level of tobacco or alcohol
use there?&nbsp; In any case, whatever the level of marijuana use
in the future, Dutch statistics on marijuana &quot;addicts&quot;
do not indicate that it would be a major social or public health
problem. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch consider their cannabis policies successful because
they have effectively separated cannabis from hard drugs.&nbsp;
Consequently, <u>their hard drug addiction rate remained stable
and they escaped the crack cocaine epidemic</u> that began in
America during the time of the decline in marijuana use that
DuPont cites as a triumph of American policy over the
Dutch.&nbsp; 'Twas a famous victory.&nbsp; I hope that America
does not have to suffer through any more of them.</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Major Announcement</u></b><b>: Capricorn
Records To Issue HEMPILATION CD In Fall Supporting NORML And
Protesting Marijuana Prohibition</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Capricorn Records and NORML, the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, are collaborating
to put out a CD album this fall that will be a vocal protest
against the injustice of marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; <i>High
Times</i> Magazine, which covers the music scene in addition to
reporting on marijuana, helped assemble the talent.&nbsp;
Capricorn issued a press release from Nashville announcing the CD
and NORML issued the following statement from Washington. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Statement by NORML</b>:&nbsp; Since even before the days of
Harry Anslinger's aborted plans to arrest jazz musicians in the
1930s, there has been a connection between music, musicians, and marijuana;
however, it has been very hard to find connections between the
music business and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; <u>No
more</u>.&nbsp; Capricorn Records has broken down the closet door
by assembling an extraordinary group of today's hottest bands for
the first-ever benefit CD for NORML.&nbsp; It is appropriately
called HEMPILATION.&nbsp; The bands include the Black Crowes, Blues
Traveler, Cypress Hill, Drivin-N-Cryin, Gov't Mule (featuring
Warren Haynes), 311, Widespread Panic, Ziggy &amp; The Melody
Makers, and others.&nbsp; The artists are contributing &quot;HEMP&quot;
classics or original pieces. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The connection between NORML and Capricorn actually dates back to
the 1970's when Phil Walden, the President of Capricorn, served
on the NORML Board of Directors.&nbsp; When the HEMPILATION was
announced, Walden said he hoped that &quot;this project will not
only be a great source of entertainment, but will also help
spread the word about the many positive actions of NORML and the
benefits of hemp as more than a drug.&quot;&nbsp; Walden made
clear that the HEMPILATION wasn't an endorsement of using
marijuana but rather the belief that the criminal prosecution of
marijuana users was unjust and unfair.&nbsp; This, of course, is
NORML's position.&nbsp; We are not trying to get people to smoke
marijuana, but rather to get the government to stop arresting those
who do.&nbsp; &quot;HEMPILATION is a testament to these bands'
support of NORML's efforts to reform these laws,&quot; Walden
explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The liner notes for the CD will include more information about
hemp and marijuana prohibition and will contain a membership
application for joining NORML.&nbsp; This -- along with the
royalties donated by Capricorn and the artists -- will make an
enormous difference in the ability of NORML to work to end the
arrests of marijuana users.&nbsp; NORML naturally hopes that
everyone who buys the CD will become better informed and more
motivated to get involved in the defense of freedom, whether they
smoke marijuana or not.&nbsp; The HEMPILATION offers a way for
both music lovers and musicians to stand up for freedom. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We also hope that more people in the music business will be moved
by the example of Capricorn and the HEMPILATION artists to
support NORML and the marijuana reform movement.&nbsp; It takes
courage for a businessman like Phil Walden to take the lead in
supporting NORML, but when others see the public support for
Capricorn and the HEMPILATION, they may find that standing up for
one's beliefs is a very satisfying experience.&nbsp; In fact, the
music business has the power to change America.&nbsp; It remains
to be seen how many other musicians and music industry executives
will be inspired by the example of Walden and the artists on the HEMPILATION
and will come forward. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Almost ten million Americans have been arrested on marijuana
charges since 1965.&nbsp; If the music business really got behind
the marijuana reform movement, these arrests would stop.&nbsp; A
lot of musicians like to sing about pot probably even more like
to smoke it and they may think that this makes them look
&quot;cool.&quot;&nbsp; However, what is really &quot;cool&quot;
is standing up for freedom.&nbsp; Freedom Is NORML. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Ruling On Student Drug Testing
Expected To Decrease Pot Use And Increase Alcohol And Hard Drug
Use By Students</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 26, Washington, D.C.</b>:&nbsp; Comments
on the Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of
random drug testing of student athletes generally overlook the
fact that such tests do not detect alcohol use and are far less
effective in detecting the use of cocaine and other hard drugs
than marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana metabolites (not the drug itself)
are detectable in urine far longer than residues of cocaine,
etc.&nbsp; This will have the effect of encouraging the use of
hard drugs and alcohol which are far more dangerous than
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his opinion supporting the ruling, Justice Scalia wrote that
the &quot;Fourth Amendment does not protect all subjective
expectations of privacy, but only those which society recognizes
as legitimate.&quot;&nbsp; After decades of hate propaganda to
justify arresting millions of marijuana users, the American
people have now been conditioned to believe that forcing someone
to urinate on command does not violate their legitimate&quot;
rights.&nbsp; What the Fourth Amendment <b><i><u>actually</u></i></b>
says:&nbsp; <b>&quot;The right of the people to be secure in
their persons, houses and effects against unreasonable searches
and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall Issue, but
upon probable cause supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized.&quot;</b>&nbsp; Thomas Jefferson had intended
to put in the part about &quot;only those which society
recognizes as legitimate,&quot; but he forgot.&nbsp; He was
probably suffering from short term memory loss because he grew
hemp at Monticello.&nbsp; We are not going to be drug-free, just
unfree.</p>

Drug Offenders From Parks</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 27, Anaheim, CA</b>:&nbsp; In response to
a lawsuit brought by NORML and the Southern California ACLU, the
city of Anaheim has repealed an ordinance that would have kept
persons convicted of marijuana charges out of the city's
parks.&nbsp; A medical marijuana patient convicted of growing
cannabis for his own use would have been barred from attending a
rally in favor of medical access to cannabis had the ordinance
not been enjoined by the courts prior to its repeal. <br>

<p align="center">June 22, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical
Association</i></b><b> Prints Article By NORML Board Chairman
Calling For Medical Access To Marijuana</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical doctors should be legally permitted to
prescribe marijuana for their patients according to a commentary
in the June 21 issue of the internationally respected <i>Journal
of the American Medical Association</i>.&nbsp; The article is
written by NORML Board Chairman, Lester Grinspoon, MD of Harvard
Medical School and James B. Bakalar, also of Harvard, and does
not reflect the official position of the AMA.&nbsp; However, it
was printed after months of review by the JAMA editorial
board.&nbsp; The two page commentary gives a brief history of the
thousands of years of medical use of cannabis, including the
first part of this century in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Grinspoon and Bakalar argue that cannabis is much safer than most
of the drugs regularly prescribed by physicians (a lethal
overdose is virtually impossible) and that it is currently being used,
albeit illegally, by many thousands of people who have found that
no legally available pharmaceuticals work as well.&nbsp; (Eight
Americans receive free marijuana from the federal government
under a program closed to new patients in 1992.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The authors point out that in 1988 the Drug Enforcement
Administration's own chief administrative law judge, the late
Francis L. Young, called cannabis &quot;one of the safest
therapeutic agents known to man.&quot;&nbsp; He added that it met
the legal requirement of currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States.&nbsp; Young then ordered that
cannabis be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II, so that,
as with morphine and cocaine, it could be prescribed by a doctor.&nbsp;
Regrettably, the politically appointed head of the DEA rejected
this order and continued the DEA's policy of blocking medical
research with cannabis while claiming that there is no medical research
to support its use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commentary goes on to remind physicians that the AMA
originally opposed the federal Marihuana Tax Act in 1937 (passed
after testimony falsely claiming that cannabis caused violent crimes),
because it would interfere with cannabis' medical use.&nbsp;
Grinspoon and Bakalar conclude by saying that they are &quot;not
asking readers for immediate agreement&quot; that cannabis is
medically useful, but rather, they hope that physicians
&quot;will do more to encourage open and legal exploration of its
potential.&nbsp; The ostensible indifference of physicians should
no longer be used as a justification for keeping this medicine in
the shadows.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It remains to be seen if the extensive media coverage of the <i>JAMA</i>
commentary will lead to more attention to the book, <i>Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine</i>, (Yale University Press) by Grinspoon
and Bakalar.&nbsp; This book, published in 1993 and now available
in paperback, has been printed in Germany and France and will
soon be published in Italy.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it has not been reviewed
by a single major newspaper or magazine in the United
States.&nbsp; This blackout persists even though it has been
favorably reviewed by the <i>JAMA</i>, the <i>New England Journal
of Medicine</i>, and even by the conservative <i>National Review</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, the American mass media continue to give over
$800,000 per day in free advertising to the so-called Partnership
for a Drug-Free (sic) America, founded by the former CEO of a
major pharmaceutical company.&nbsp; The Partnership opposes
medical access to cannabis as a part of its campaigning for the
arrest of sick, dying and disabled Americans who use cannabis rather
than the pharmaceuticals, and the alcohol and tobacco sold by its
funders.&nbsp; How much longer will American physicians be
comfortable supporting the arrest of their patients in company with
the pushers of drugs that kill 500,000 Americans annually?</p>

<p align="center"><b>The Story Of Jimmy Montgomery And Other
American Victims Of Cannabis Prohibition Told At London Human
Rights Conference</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17,</b> London, U.K.:&nbsp; The violation
of the basic human rights of American cannabis users was the
subject of a panel discussion at the London Human Rights
Conference organized by Liberty, a British rights advocacy
group.&nbsp; For the first time, cannabis users were recognized
along with more familiar victims of government oppression.&nbsp;
Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director spoke on the human
rights violations committed against marijuana users in
America.&nbsp; Cowan told the conference about the shooting of
Scott Bryant and other suspected marijuana users.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Conference attendees were especially shaken by
the plight of Jimmy Montgomery, the paraplegic sentenced to 10
years in Oklahoma prison for less than two ounces of
marijuana.&nbsp; Montgomery remains in prison despite hundreds of
calls from around the world to the Oklahoma governor's office by
readers of NORML's weekly faxes.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is believed that Montgomery may be released
soon -- not because his arrest was unjust or that his sentence
was outrageous or because his life is in danger -- but simply
because Oklahoma prisons are so overcrowded that they must
release someone.&nbsp; While Montgomery's release, for whatever
reason, will be welcomed, the fact that the narcocracy can get
away with such an outrageous injustice, unreported by the
American media, clearly demonstrates that they can effectively
get away with anything.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Walter Cronkite Calls For Bipartisan
Commission To Study Alternatives To Drug War</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 20:</b>&nbsp; On the <i>Discovery Channel</i>
Special, &quot;The Cronkite Report: The Drug Dilemma&quot; Walter
Cronkite [former CBS news anchorman and regarded internationally
as one of the most trusted figures in America---ed.] called the
drug war a failure.&nbsp; Cronkite called for a bipartisan commission
to study the alternatives to prohibition.&nbsp; He concluded by
saying &quot;We cannot go into tomorrow with the same formulas
that are failing today.&quot;&nbsp; [&quot;And that's the way it
is.&quot;---ed.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Counting Down</u></b><b>: The Ten
Millionth Marijuana Arrest Will Take Place On July 20, The Last
Day Of A NIDA Anti-Marijuana Propaganda Fest</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Based on projections from the U.S. Justice
Department arrest statistics, NORML has calculated that the ten
millionth marijuana arrest will take place on July 20.&nbsp;
While there is obviously no way of knowing the precise date of
such an event, the July date is a far more reasonable estimate
than most made in Washington.&nbsp; This particular date was
chosen to emphasize the role that government sponsored hate
propaganda, especially the politicized pseudo-science put out by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plays in maintaining
marijuana prohibition.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>On </u><b><u>July 19</u></b><u> and </u><b><u>20</u></b>,
NIDA is holding a &quot;National Conference on Marijuana Use:
Prevention, Treatment, and Research.&quot;&nbsp; The reference to
research is particularly ironic given NIDA's role in blocking
research on the medical uses of marijuana.&nbsp; According to
NIDA, the conference is a part of their &quot;Marijuana
Prevention Initiative.&quot;&nbsp; This is aimed at getting the
media to carry more propaganda to support the next ten million
arrests.&nbsp; NORML will be responding to what will undoubtedly
be billed as &quot;the latest research&quot; on marijuana.&nbsp;
This will probably include statements on how pot is far more
potent than it was in the past, even though NIDA's own numbers
show no increase in over ten years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the weeks ahead, NORML will be attempting to get the media to
report the astronomical arrest statistics. These numbers and the
politicization of science in service to prohibition will be the only
real stories.&nbsp; The ten millionth arrest will be a human
tragedy.&nbsp; If it is ignored, it will be a national disgrace.</p>

Separate Cannabis From &quot;Hard&quot; Drugs!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 10,</b> Amsterdam, The Netherlands:&nbsp;
A major daily newspaper reports that the Dutch chiefs of police
unanimously advise the Dutch government to make every possible
effort to promote the further decriminalization of
&quot;soft&quot; drugs [cannabis products---ed.] internationally. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>De Telegraaf</i>, Dutch policy makers have agreed
to postpone plans to overhaul Holland's drug policies until
September.&nbsp; In the mean time, all main political parties
(government and opposition) have all agreed to maintain the
following policies: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">1.) The &quot;classic element&quot; of Dutch drug policy,

<p align="center"><b>More News From The Netherlands: Univ. Of
Amsterdam Study Concludes That &quot;Tolerant&quot; Cannabis Laws
Do Not Lead To More Use</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 10,</b> Amsterdam, The Netherlands:&nbsp;
Contrary to what many people assume about the citizens of
Amsterdam, where the sale of cannabis in coffeeshops is allowed,
the majority of the population does not indulge in cannabis or
hashish. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Department of Social Geography of the Univ. of Amsterdam has
monitored the cannabis use of the Amsterdam population (ages 12
years-old and up) since 1987 by means of three large scale
household surveys.&nbsp; According to researcher Dr. Peter Cohen,
observing the period 1987-1994, the average age for first time
cannabis use in The Netherlands is a remarkably high twenty years
of age [as compared to 14 years-old in the U.S.---ed.]!&nbsp; The
research also indicates that despite the high numbers of
&quot;coffeeshops&quot; in The Netherlands, only 25% of the
population have ever used cannabis.&nbsp; In addition, only 6%
admit to using it daily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">From these extensive surveys, Dr. Cohen has been able to develop
a profile of the &quot;average&quot; cannabis consumer: well
educated, single, outgoing, around thirty years-old, and of Dutch
descent.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Prosecutors' Choice: Jail Or Taxes For Drug
Offenders</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 9,</b> Houston, TX:&nbsp; The Houston
Chronicle reports: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An appellate court ruled...that prosecutors must choose which
they want more: a drug dealer's [users---ed.] back taxes or their
time in jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 14th Court of Appeals was asked to decide whether Mark
Stennett was punished sufficiently when, after his indictment for
marijuana possession, he was billed $49,070 by the State Comptrollers
Office.&nbsp; Since January 1990, the office has been allowed to
pursue such taxes known as the Texas Controlled Substances
Tax.&nbsp; It sells tax stamps to be purchased when a person obtains
contraband. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court ruling regarding Montana's tax
stamp, the court decided that since Stennett was paying the tax,
pursuing criminal punishment would constitute double jeopardy.&nbsp;
Defense attorneys have long made such a claim.&nbsp;
&quot;Anybody who has a drug case and also got hit with a drug
tax is entitled to have their case dismissed,&quot; said one of
Stennett's attorneys, Tom Moran, &quot;Any lawyer worth his salt,
when they hear about this case, will file (the proper paperwork)
to get the case dismissed.&quot;&nbsp; It could mean hundreds of
cases could be dismissed.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Plight Of Oklahoma Paraplegic Pot Prisoner
To Be Topic<br>
At Major London Human Rights Convention</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">London: The continued imprisonment of Oklahoma
paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery will be addressed at a three day
Human Rights Convention to be held in London from June 15 to
17.&nbsp; The Convention, billed as &quot;A Festival of
Rights,&quot; is being sponsored by Liberty, the London based human
rights organization.&nbsp; It is expected that more than 5,000
people from around the world will attend the convention.&nbsp;
This will be the first time that the excesses of America's war on
marijuana users will be recognized as a violation of human rights
comparable to other forms of political persecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director, Richard Cowan, will be speaking at one
of the convention sessions about the inhumane treatment of Jimmy
Montgomery.&nbsp; Montgomery is a paraplegic who has almost died
several times while serving a ten year sentence in Oklahoma
prisons for less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; Despite
months of calling the Oklahoma Governor's office by hundreds of
concerned Americans, Montgomery is still being held in Oklahoma's
severely overcrowded prisons. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cowan will also speak about the killings by Wisconsin police of
two suspected cannabis users.&nbsp; One victim was a 15 year-old
boy allegedly shot by a drunken narc.&nbsp; &quot;I hope that the
international media and human rights community will focus on the
rising tide of violence and hatred being inflicted on American
cannabis users, which is being ignored by the American
media,&quot; said Cowan.&nbsp; He added, &quot;having the
persecution of cannabis users recognized at this convention is a historic
breakthrough in our efforts to get the world to count the cost of
cannabis prohibition.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">There will be more than 100 speakers at the convention, including
Pierre Sane, the Secretary General of Amnesty International;
Kader Asmal, a Minister in the South African government; and Lord
Lester, QC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Back in America, Jimmy Montgomery's parole hearing has been
delayed to July 12, supposedly because the June 21 schedule is
full.&nbsp; NORML urges that concerned citizens continue calling Oklahoma
Governor Keating and other state opinion leaders to urge that
Montgomery's case be dealt with immediately.&nbsp; It is
unfortunate that Oklahoma is to be subjected to international opprobrium
because it cannot find a way to free a man who did not belong in
prison in the first place.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[To reach Governor Frank Keating, call (405)
521-2342 or fax (405) 521-3353.&nbsp; To reach the editors of the
two major newspapers in Oklahoma call 1.) <i>The Daily Oklahoman</i>,

<p align="center"><b>Oregon House Votes To Re-criminalize
Marijuana Possession</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6,</b> Salem, Oregon:&nbsp; In a surprise
move under new rules that allow for only one hour's notice to be
given before legislative hearings, the Oregon House of
Representatives voted 47 to 13 to re-criminalize the possession
of less than one ounce of marijuana.&nbsp; The bill would raise
the maximum fine for possession from $1,000 to $5,000 and the
minimum fine from $100 to $500 per gram.&nbsp; This would mean a
minimum fine of $2,800 per ounce.&nbsp; Although there is no
direct jail penalty, persons unable to pay the higher fines could
be jailed.&nbsp; The bill also makes it a crime to be &quot;under
the influence&quot; of marijuana without defining just what that
means. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1973, Oregon was the first state to decriminalize marijuana,
but it does not have a higher rate of marijuana use than other
states.&nbsp; The sponsor of the bill cited the usual reasons,
the supposed &quot;increase&quot; in potency of marijuana, the
claim that it is the &quot;gateway&quot; to hard drugs (in 1973
it was the &quot;stepping stone&quot;), and the claim that 9 and
10 year-olds are smoking -- so adults mast be arrested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Critics point out that the bill would cost the state at least one
million dollars per year by requiring the appointment of public
defenders for indigent defendants, plus the cost of imprisoning those
who cannot afford the much higher fines.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This bill demonstrates that Oregon is not immune
to the massive hate campaign against cannabis users being waged
by the prohibitionist establishment and the mass media.&nbsp;
This week, Gannett News Service carried a three-part series
claiming that teenagers who use marijuana just once in a year are
ten times more likely to be involved in violent crimes than
non-users.&nbsp; Of course, no comparable numbers were given for
alcohol use.&nbsp; This is the sort of &quot;reporting&quot; that
leads to the shooting of a 15 year-old by a drunken narc, which
-- of course -- was not mentioned in the Gannett articles.&nbsp;
So much for their concern for teenage violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b><u>Update</u></b>:&nbsp; The U.S. Sentencing
Commission is considering an amendment that impacts cannabis consumers.&nbsp;
The following is from the Drug Reform Coordination Network
(DRCNet):</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier this spring, the U.S. Sentencing
Commission passed some amendments to the federal sentencing
guidelines that would reform the penalty structure for certain
drug offenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>One amendment</u>, passed 7-0, would change the plant-weight
ratio use for marijuana to 1 plant = 100 grams.&nbsp; (Currently
1 plant is considered 100 grams for 49 plants or fewer, but
becomes 1 kilo [1000 grams] for 50 plants or more, with the
effect that defendants convicted for 50 plants spend almost 3
times as long in prison as those convicted for 49 plants.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>A second amendment</u>, would provide a two point reduction in
offense level for certain non-violent, first time offenders who
qualify for the &quot;safety-valve&quot; exemption included in
last year's Crime Bill.&nbsp; This Amendment essentially matches
the exemption the law now grants from the mandatory minimum
statutes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendments will become law if Congress doesn't act by
November 1 to overturn them.&nbsp; <b><i>Clarification</i></b><i>:&nbsp;
What the Sentencing Commission </i><i><u>has not decided</u></i><i>
yet is whether the amendments will apply retroactively to current
inmates.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Please write the commission and ask them to make the following
amendments retroactive: </p>

<p align="center"><b>Jimmy Montgomery Now Suffering In Solitary
Confinement<br>
Medical Neglect Threatens Life</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 24,</b> Isolated in a cell with no way
even to call for help, paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery endures the
stench of his untreated infections, suffers the pain of having to
tear off soiled bandages without any salve or ointments, and runs
the risk of life-threatening kidney and bladder infections because
guards cannot find the urine bag that his mother sent him.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Governor Keating's office claims to be doing
everything possible. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Governor Keating may be reluctant to look closely at the facts of
the Montgomery case.&nbsp; His office keeps telling callers that
Montgomery must have done something far worse than the trial records
indicate, because they do not want to believe that good people in
a small town, serving as jurors, could have done something so
terrible.&nbsp; He may be reluctant to recognize that the hate propaganda
fostered by the prohibitionist ideology that he espouses could
result in such a great injustice.&nbsp; Governor Keating should
spend a few minutes reviewing the record and then go and visit Jimmy's
prison cell and see and smell the stench of his lesions.&nbsp;
Then he might find the power and the courage to face the
consequences of hatred.&nbsp; The good people of Oklahoma have
been the victims of a crime of unspeakable evil, but it is
necessary to say that we are not damned by the evil done to us,
but rather by the evil done by us.</p>

<p align="center">&quot;The world is a dangerous place to live --
not because of the people who are evil but because of the people
who don't do anything about it.&quot;&nbsp; --Albert Einstein</p>

cancer, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis patients felt last year
when both houses of the state Legislature passed a bill allowing
them to use marijuana to ease their pain and nausea.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But their victory was short-lived.&nbsp; Despite its legislative
approval after substantive hearings, Gov. Wilson vetoed the
bill.&nbsp; Let us hope that in this non-election year,

is signed by Wilson.&quot; <br>

an accomplice to murder.&quot;&nbsp; (Page 5 of the Final Report
of <i>THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE FOR A DRUG FREE AMERICA</i>.
-June 1988)&nbsp; Perhaps this is just as well considering that
page 6 of the report says &quot;Each time we do not get outraged
over senseless death and violence we are guilty.&quot;&nbsp; This
might suggest that they are guilty for their indifference to the
suffering of Jimmy Montgomery and the recent law enforcement
killings of marijuana users in Wisconsin.&nbsp; These do not seem
to be matters for concern -- much less -- outrage for anyone in
Washington or the national media.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Cause and Effect: Imprisoning Non-violent

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In May, the Associated Press reported, &quot;The
number of inmates in local jails across the nation reached a
record 490,442 last year...&nbsp; <u>The rising number of drug

more than 105,800 of the 1993 jail inmates were charged or

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Brown Escalates Potent Pot Follies<br>
Claims 40 Fold Increase In THC Levels!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 21,</b> In an interview with the <i>Dallas
Morning News</i>, Drug Czar Lee Brown was asked, &quot;Why is it
more dangerous for a kid to be experimenting with drugs now than
when the baby boomers were in high school or college?&quot;&nbsp;
Brown responded, &quot;The major illegal drug they're experimenting
with is marijuana.&nbsp; Marijuana is 40 times more potent today
than was the case 10, 15, 20 years ago...&nbsp; I don't think
that young people know that.&nbsp; It is really not getting
covered very well.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In other recent statements Brown has claimed that
potency has increased only 6 to 10 fold.&nbsp; He did not offer
any explanation for this escalation, nor did he offer any
explanation for why he is contradicting Alan Leshner, the head of
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) who says that potency
is only 3 times higher than in the past.&nbsp; Brown also did not
explain why the only large scale testing of contraband marijuana,
sponsored by NIDA, shows no increase in potency since the early
1980's.&nbsp; As for it not being reported, the potent pot myth
has been repeated in almost every major publication in
America.&nbsp; It has become the single most accepted lie about
marijuana in the mainstream media.&nbsp; Recently, both <i>NEW
YORK</i> magazine and syndicated columnist George Will have
claimed that potency is 15 times higher than in the past.&nbsp;
Ironically, the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> cut that one sentence
from the Will column.&nbsp; NORML finds no valid evidence of any increase
in average potency.</p>

AS GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DOES &quot;SPIN CONTROL&quot;</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 18,</b> Oklahoma City, OK.&nbsp;
Paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery remains in prison, and he is still not
receiving adequate medical care to properly treat his anti-biotic
resistant infections.&nbsp; As a result, his life remains in
danger.&nbsp; However, he is now receiving showers, a change of
clothes, clean bandages (from his mother), and is now able to
wash his clothes separately from the other prisoners.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The office of Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating is telling callers
that they are doing everything possible to get Montgomery
released to house arrest and they are actually urging people to
call and complain to the prosecutor, Richard Dugger, who blocked
his release.&nbsp; Callers have also received various versions of
spin control, depending on whom they talked to.&nbsp; One caller
was told that Montgomery had been selling marijuana to
children.&nbsp; Another was informed that since he was convicted
by a jury, he must have done something much more serious than
what &quot;the propaganda [NORML] is saying,&quot; but that the
state wanted him out of prison because he was costing them too much
money.&nbsp; A third caller was told that the Governor's staff
couldn't understand why this case was getting so much attention,
because they had not read anything about the case in the local media. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery will eventually be released, <b><i><u>if he doesn't
die first, and if you keep calling the governor's office.</u></i></b>&nbsp;
Your calls have clearly made the difference in the way he is
being treated.&nbsp; The State of Oklahoma may eventually free
him to house arrest, but they will not free the people of Oklahoma
from the chains of a lifetime of hate propaganda.&nbsp; NORML
would be interested in hearing any novel efforts at spin control
callers may have encountered from the governor's office.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 15,</b> Atlanta, GA.&nbsp; Prohibitionists
at a sparsely attended mayors conference were disappointed to
find organized opposition and minimal media coverage, which they
had to share with anti-prohibitionists.&nbsp; Bob Keizer, the
Dutch Minister who heads the Department of Alcohol, Drug and
Tobacco Policy of the Dutch Ministry of Health joined a group of
prominent American anti-prohibitionists--including the former
mayor of Hartford--to object to the misrepresentation of European
drug policies at a Press Conference on Monday, May 15th.&nbsp;
The day before the summit, reform activists demonstrated against
the conference from 1 to 4 PM. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference, billed as &quot;American Cities Against
Drugs,&quot; was held at tax-payers expense and had promised that
attendees would &quot;Hear from key European mayors about the
devastation Legalization is bringing to their cities.&quot;&nbsp;
Instead, attendees heard the former mayor of Stockholm warn
against flying KLM out of Amsterdam because the pilots may be
stoned on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference was more notable for announcing the formation of a
new prohibitionist propaganda effort by Hollywood known as the
National Drug Prevention League.&nbsp; This was founded by the
Entertainment Industries Council (EIC), which is sponsored by
such great moral leaders as Frank Sinatra, Aaron Spelling, and
Fred Silverman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now the wonderful folks who brought us <i>Reefer Madness, Mary
Jane</i>, and other film classics are pushing a new music video,
&quot;Will you be there tomorrow?&quot;&nbsp; The video purports
to present &quot;the legalization issue [as seen] through the
eyes of children.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps they will also make other
videos giving us their view -- &quot;as seen through the eyes of
children&quot; -- of other complex issues such as health care
reform, nuclear waste disposal, and flat rate versus progressive
taxation.&nbsp; &quot;Will you be taxed tomorrow?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">EIC says that it will be sponsoring an industry briefing session
on drugs and violence for Orlando-based entertainment executives
in July and is now organizing the industry's &quot;Drugs, Violence
and Youth, Truth or Tragedy Conference&quot; in October.&nbsp; Is
hypocrisy too complex a subject for a music video?</p>

In a letter to the Dutch Ambassador, NORML saluted the Dutch for
their cannabis policies.&nbsp; By making cannabis available in
almost 2,000 coffee shops around Holland, the Dutch have broken
the connection between hard drugs and cannabis.&nbsp; Instead of

Kill Another Marijuana Suspect<br>
15 Year Old Shot By Narc Who Had Been Drinking</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 9,</b> Janesville, WI.&nbsp; Following the
fatal shooting of a marijuana suspect in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin
last week, 15 year-old Leon Kelly was shot to death by an
undercover officer who had been drinking.&nbsp; Kelly had
marijuana in his blood, according to police reports.&nbsp;
Shooting people is not considered the best way to test for
marijuana use, but a drug-free America comes first.&nbsp; There is
still no media coverage of these deaths, although most major
American newspapers have reported on the murder of a North
African immigrant in Paris.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Permissible Murders Happen Because Of
Permissible Hate Speech</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 6, 1990,</b> <i>The Los Angeles
Times</i> reported on the testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee
of then Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates in which Gates said
that casual drug users &quot;ought to be taken out and
shot.&quot;&nbsp; Gates made clear that he was talking about
marijuana smokers, &quot;who blast (sic, apparently one of
Gates's favorite words) some pot on a casual basis.&quot;&nbsp; Gates
went on to say that even casual use is &quot;treason.&quot;&nbsp;
If he had advocated genocide against any group other than
marijuana users, he would have been immediately removed from
office and Los Angeles might have been spared the terrible riots
that followed the acquittal of the police accused of beating
Rodney King.&nbsp; Gates was finally fired for incompetence after
that tragedy.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>1990,</b> Appearing on the television show, <i>Larry
King Live</i>, then drug czar William Bennett said beheading drug
dealers would be &quot;morally plausible&quot;.&nbsp; (He added,
&quot;There's no moral problem there.&nbsp; I used to teach
ethics---trust me.&quot;)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7, 1995,</b> <i>Boston Herald</i>
conservative columnist Don Feder calls for &quot;the Dresden
option&quot; to deal with illegal drugs.&nbsp; The reference to
the fire bombing of Dresden should be frightening to the citizens
of Los Angeles.&nbsp; As mentioned above, Chief Gates brought
them their own little Dresden.&nbsp; Hatred kills not just the
hated, but the haters and their silent allies.</p>

Ministry of Health is scheduled to join a group of prominent
American anti-prohibitionists, including the former mayor of

release of paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery from life threatening
imprisonment was blocked at the last minute by an objection filed
by Richard Dugger, the prosecutor for the five county area where
Montgomery resides.&nbsp; After weeks of efforts by Oklahoma
NORML and numerous calls to Governor Frank Keating's office by
concerned citizens from around the country, Jimmy was finally
scheduled for release to house arrest this week.&nbsp; It was originally
planned that Montgomery would be hospitalized for the treatment
of anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower body.&nbsp; Now
he will remain confined to the prison where he does not even have
access to a shower or adequate clean bandages.&nbsp; He can only
bathe in the whirlpool shared by other prisoner patients,

items related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">May 4, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>PERMISSIBLE MURDERS IN AMERICA: ANOTHER
SUSPECTED MARIJUANA USER KILLED IN HIS HOME BY WISCONSIN POLICE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, Scott W.
Bryant, 29, was shot dead by police as they charged through the
door of his home with a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed and did not resist the police in any
way.&nbsp; His seven year old son, who was sleeping in the next
room, had to watch his father die while an ambulance took 35
minutes to respond.&nbsp; Police later reported finding less than
3 grams of marijuana (one tenth of an ounce, enough for 2 or 3
&quot;cigarettes.&quot;) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This fatal shooting of a suspected marijuana user is just the
latest in a series of killings that have occurred over the last
several years.&nbsp; These incidents have generally been ignored
because the victims are accused of belonging to the one group in
America -- <i>suspected</i> marijuana users -- whom it is
apparently permissible to murder.&nbsp; These victims range from
the multimillionaire Donald Scott, shot dead in 1992 at his
estate near Malibu, to the disabled veteran Gary Shepard in the
hills of Kentucky in 1994.&nbsp; In all three cases the children
of the victims were present.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was killed by a
small army as he stood next to his wife, who was grazed by a
bullet, and his blood splattered on his four year old son.&nbsp;
None of these victims were in any way a threat to anyone.&nbsp; Donald
Scott did not even have any marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Media attention to these killings has ranged from slow to
non-existent.&nbsp; Even the Donald Scott case, which seemed to
have all the ingredients of a major news story -- money, intrigue
and beautiful scenery -- was not covered for more than 90 days
after the killing and was then quickly forgotten.&nbsp; The
police involved were never disciplined.&nbsp; Gary Shepard was a
poor man, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was crippled in Nixon's
war in Asia and killed in Clinton's war in America.&nbsp; His
killers are still on the job.&nbsp; It is unlikely that any
action will be taken against whomever shot Bryant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The media are looking for an action story with good pictures, so
they find a bunch of &quot;good ol' boys&quot; playing soldier
who say things ranging from the bizarre to the basic.&nbsp;
Somehow it is considered dangerous rhetoric -- and therefore news
-- when militia leaders say that they will defend
themselves.&nbsp; However, NORML has been trying to get the media
to look into the role of the National Guard in marijuana
prohibition for over a year and a half.&nbsp; Our report quotes
the head of the National Guard saying that their job is to make
America drug-free <b><i><u>&quot;using any means necessary, no
matter what the cost.&quot;</u></i></b> (emphasis added) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, as the militias and their conservative allies focus on
the shooting of the wife and son of the heavily armed white
supremacist Randy Weaver in Idaho, they ignore the shootings of citizens
who have been accused of having marijuana -- even when they did
not have any pot at all.&nbsp; Of course, indifference to the
killing of marijuana users is precisely what the mass media have
in common with the militias and politicians.&nbsp; While the
militias prepare for an invasion by the UN, the media are running
around the country looking for heavily armed groups that are a
threat to the rule of law.&nbsp; Both are missing the real
danger: the involvement of the U. S. military in domestic law enforcement
and the extension of unlimited power to the police under the
guise of the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">President Clinton has denounced the supposedly inflammatory
rhetoric of his critics, but he ignored the statement last year
by Thomas Constantine, the Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
that the &quot;non-violent drug user is a myth.&quot;&nbsp; This
is a blood libel that leads directly to the type of shooting that
occurred in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Former Bush Administration drug
policy advisor John Walters even mocked the suffering of
imprisoned Oklahoma paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery when his case was
reported by ABC television, saying, &quot;Apparently ABC couldn't
find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach clip in her
purse.&quot;&nbsp; Apparently, the minor technicality of a trial
has been by-passed, execution first, verdict later.&nbsp; Could
all of this be a clue as to why the people no longer trust their
government and the media? <br>

Governor, Tommy Thompson, at (608) 266-1212.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>GOOD NEWS! JIMMY MONTGOMERY TO BE FREED ON
TUESDAY!</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thanks to the calls by the readers of these
weekly reports, Jimmy Montgomery is expected to be released to
&quot;house arrest&quot; next Tuesday.&nbsp; NORML will issue a
special bulletin as soon as he is free.&nbsp; NORML salutes

all who have worked to end this injustice.</p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML And ACLU Attack Legitimacy Of Anaheim
Law</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 28,</b> Anaheim, In an well publicized
press conference, NORML and the Southern California American
Civil Liberties Union jointly announced that they have filed a
civil rights lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles to
actively challenge Anaheim Ordinance No. 5396. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The controversial ordinance adds Sections 13.08.100.010 and
13.08.100.020 to the Anaheim Municipal Code and prohibits certain
prior drug offenders from the right to use public parks <b>for lawful
purposes</b>.&nbsp; This discriminatory legislation singles out
specific individuals from the general public based solely upon
their &quot;criminal&quot; history and forbids them from
participating in the many recreational, aesthetic, cultural,
associational, and other law abiding activities that generally
take place in city parks.&nbsp; Moreover, the restrictive Anaheim
ordinance remains in effect for three years <b>after</b> the
sentence has been served.&nbsp; Consequently, an individual
released from prison for marijuana cultivation in 1995 would be
effectively denied access from entering and/or participating in
any function taking place at a public park until the year
1998.&nbsp; Persons convicted of violating the ordinance face a
maximum six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both NORML and the ACLU charge that the Anaheim ordinance is
unconstitutional.&nbsp; Specifically, the lawsuit, <i>National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) v. City of
Anaheim</i> (95-2813 AAH), asserts that the legislation directly
violates NORML's right to free speech and assembly by precluding
members and speakers with prior drug convictions from both
attending and participating in a public rally for medical
marijuana that is scheduled to take place in La Palma Park.&nbsp;
The May 25th rally is being sponsored by NORML.&nbsp; The lawsuit contends
that, &quot;The absence of these NORML members from the rally
will, [in turn,] deprive the NORML members who can attend of
their right to associate with and exchange views with the absent
members.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML maintains that the Anaheim ordinance will greatly diminish
the force of NORML's message by disallowing several speakers from
voicing their opinions on the need for medical marijuana.&nbsp;
In addition, because the enforcement of Sections 13.08.100.010
and 13.08.100.020 of the Anaheim Municipal code threatens to
exclude citizens who are non-members as well, NORML charges that
the ordinance &quot;interferes with NORML's ability to recruit
new members and to reach the full audience it would otherwise be
able to reach.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The joint lawsuit also alleges that the Anaheim ordinance
violates the plaintiffs' right to petition the government for
redress of grievances and the right to due process. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit is activist and medical
marijuana patient, Craig McClain.&nbsp; Recently convicted for
growing five cannabis plants at his home, McClain is one of
NORML's scheduled speakers who is forbidden from entering La
Palma Park by the ordinance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In effect, &quot;the Anaheim ordinance makes [McClain's] speech a
crime,&quot; remarked ACLU Staff Attorney Mark Silverstein.&nbsp;
&quot;However well-intentioned, the...ordinance offers a false
hope about combating serious crime.&nbsp; Measures like this let
politicians off the hook, substituting phony rhetoric for
measures that work.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ACLU and NORML are asking for a preliminary injunction so
that McClain and other plaintiffs can legally attend the rally on
May 25. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information regarding the lawsuit, please contact Mark
Silverstein at Southern Cal. ACLU (213) 977-9500 x264 or Allen
St. Pierre at NORML (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>NORML</b> REITERATES ITS
COMMITMENT TO NON-VIOLENCE</font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following the tragedy in Oklahoma City, it has
been suggested that groups that are critical of government
policies are somehow encouraging violence.&nbsp; Since its
inception, NORML has had a commitment to non-violence in the
tradition of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.&nbsp; NORML's principal
message is that marijuana prohibition is unjustified violence
against peaceful marijuana users.&nbsp; There have been almost
ten million marijuana arrests since 1965.&nbsp; Each of these
involves coercion and the threat of state violence.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML
said, &quot;Our message to the government, like that of the
'velvet revolution' that peacefully overthrew Communism in
Czechoslovakia, is that they need not fear us because we are not
like them.&nbsp; We want to end violence, not spread it.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML does not see the proposed anti-terrorist
legislation as a significant new threat to marijuana users, who
have almost no Constitutional rights remaining.&nbsp; It is the
narcocracy, not some &quot;new world order,&quot; that is the
real and present danger to our liberty.&nbsp; For sometime NORML
has been trying to get the media interested in the role of the
National Guard in domestic law enforcement, but to no
avail.&nbsp; As one witty observer complained, &quot;Why is it
that Americans are paranoid about the wrong things?&quot;&nbsp;
The problem with paranoia is that when you are fighting imaginary
devils you cannot see the very real evils.</p>

Cannabis</b></p>

&quot;The number of 15 and 16-year-old British boys who have smoked
cannabis has tripled in the past three years and one third now
say they have used the <u>illegal</u> drug.&quot;&nbsp; [these
figures are the result of a recent poll conducted by Exeter
University for the BBC -ed.]&nbsp; The survey found that 32.9
percent of boys aged 15 and 16 and 27.3 percent of girls admitted

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 24,</b> London, UK, The traditionally
respected, high profile documentary program Panorama presented
some of the most extreme anti-cannabis propaganda that the UK
public has ever seen.&nbsp; The majority of the of the program
was filmed in the USA focused on four main health risks
associated with the use of cannabis, namely: addiction, birth
problems, mental deterioration and cancer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Various parts of the program were split up with excerpts of
groups of teenage age school children suggesting that cannabis:
&quot;isn't all that bad;&quot; &quot;it's just a bit of
fun;&quot; and &quot;it could be bad if you smoke it with
tobacco&quot; as the <i><u>only</u></i> defense against several
professors who were damning cannabis to hell. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Legalize Cannabis Campaign (LCC) is strongly contesting the
content and obvious bias of the program.&nbsp; It appears that
this program has greatly raised the stakes in the UK's ongoing

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">April 20, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>Baltimore Sun</i></b><b>'s Front Page
Afflicted By &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;<br>
DEA Admits Shifting Agents From Cocaine To Marijuana Hunt</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 14,</b> <i>The Baltimore Sun</i> in a
lengthy headline story, &quot;Authorities hit the marijuana
trail, Police see resurgence of '60s drug&quot; pushed most of
the DEA's most successful propaganda lines.&nbsp; <i>The Sun</i>,
once the paper of H.L. Mencken, begins by giving the impression
that marijuana law enforcement has flagged during recent
years.&nbsp; Actually, the number of arrests has been increasing and
the 10 millionth marijuana arrest since 1965 will soon take
place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article by Marcia Myers also parrots the DEA line that
marijuana is &quot;3 to 5 times stronger than it was 20 years
ago,&quot; although even the head of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse claims only a 3-fold increase and there is little
evidence to support any actual increase.&nbsp; The head of Maryland's
marijuana eradication program is quoted as saying that growers
&quot;have been able to cultivate a crop that will literally
knock your socks off.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to citing this purported epidemic in barefootedness,
the article says that what it calls &quot;marijuana related&quot;
emergency room admissions have tripled in the last four
years.&nbsp; Actually, these numbers represent only emergency
room &quot;mentions&quot; of marijuana, and do not indicate that marijuana
was the cause of the visit.&nbsp; Had the reporter bothered to
check with the primary source on this data, she would have
learned that approximately 80% of such &quot;mentions&quot;
involve people who are actually having problems with other drugs,
but also &quot;mention&quot; having used marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article did break new ground in two areas:&nbsp; 1.) It
actually reported that forfeiture encourages police to work on
marijuana cases since the police agencies get to keep the
property they seize.&nbsp; 2.) It also revealed that the
Baltimore office of the DEA has shifted agents away from cocaine
cases to go after marijuana.&nbsp; They call this a &quot;more
balanced approach.&quot;&nbsp; This approach would be more
&quot;balanced&quot; only if one thinks that marijuana is somehow
as much a problem as cocaine, which this article implies.&nbsp;
Perhaps in the future <i>The Sun</i> will take a &quot;more
balanced approach&quot; to journalism and include a few more
facts with its ration of DEA propaganda.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Hair Testing For Marijuana Called
Unreliable, But Proceeds Anyway</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7,</b> In a copyrighted story by C.
Eugene Emery, <i>The Providence Journal</i> reported that even
though the developer of the new hair test for drugs acknowledges
that the test is not a reliable indicator of marijuana use, they
are testing for it anyway. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The test, marketed by Psychemedics of Cambridge, Mass. is
designed to detect trace residues of illicit drugs that may have
been used over the last several months.&nbsp; One advantage of
hair testing over urine testing is that cocaine and heroin are
not detectable in urine after a day or two, while marijuana
metabolites can be detected for weeks.&nbsp; The urine testing
has the effect of encouraging the use of cocaine and other hard
drugs over marijuana.&nbsp; Urine testing is also considered
relatively easy to beat. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>Providence Journal</i> story J. Michael Walsh of the
National Institute for Standards and Technology and former
executive director of President Reagan's Drug Advisory Council
was very critical of the reliability of hair testing in general,
but especially when used for detecting marijuana.&nbsp; Walsh
told the <i>Providence Journal</i> (which uses the hair test)
that, &quot;It is just inappropriate to deny employment or take
adverse action against an employee on the basis of such a
test.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on hair follicle testing, contact Allen St.
Pierre at NORML, (202)483-5500.]</p>

<p align="center"><b><i>National Review</i></b><b> Reports On
Jimmy Montgomery; Paraplegic Now Receiving Better Treatment;
Hopeful Of Release Soon.</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an editorial in its <b>May 1</b> issue,
William F. Buckley, Jr.'s <i>National Review</i> commented on the case
of Jimmy Montgomery, a paraplegic sentenced to 10 years in
Oklahoma prisons for less than 2 ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; <i>NR</i>
noted that former deputy drug czar John P. Walters criticized ABC News
for reporting on the Montgomery case.&nbsp; Walters showed no
concern for Montgomery but rather complained, &quot;Apparently
ABC couldn't find a grandmother on death row for carrying a roach
clip...&quot;&nbsp; NR observes that &quot;something is seriously
wrong with a drug policy that condones such treatment -- a point
that the drug warriors tacitly acknowledge by changing the
subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, Montgomery is now receiving proper medical care
and has been moved to another prison facility.&nbsp; It is hoped
that this move is in preparation for his being released to
&quot;house arrest.&quot;&nbsp; Michael Pearson of Oklahoma NORML
reports that the numerous calls received by the Oklahoma
governor's office helped save Jimmy's life.&nbsp; <i><u>NORML
expresses its gratitude to all who called</u></i>.&nbsp; NORML
also expresses its sympathy to the citizens of Oklahoma City for
the tragic deaths in the Federal Building bombing.&nbsp; Hunting
down these cowardly murderers is the proper use for law
enforcement.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibitionists React Hysterically To ABC
News Program Critical Of Drug Prohibition And Condemn &quot;Drug
Legalization In Europe&quot;</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaints of John Walters about ABC's
reporting on the Jimmy Montgomery case were in a <i>Washington
Times</i> op-ed article published the day before the ABC program
actually ran.&nbsp; Walters also continued the prohibitionist
practice of claiming that &quot;drug legalization in Europe&quot;
has been a failure.&nbsp; He was later joined in the chorus by A.
M. Rosenthal, former managing editor of <i>The New York Times</i>,
who typically cited Zurich's Needle Park as an example of the
failure of &quot;drug legalization.&quot;&nbsp; None of them
offered any analysis of the Dutch policy of tolerating cannabis sale
in &quot;coffee shops.&quot;&nbsp; Instead they tried to paint
Holland as a violent crime-ridden country.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Long Island Student Suspended Just For
Wanting To Write A Paper On The<br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 19,</b> A high school student from Long
Island (NY) called NORML's national office to report that she was
suspended from school briefly for having indicated that she was
going to write her term paper on the economics of hemp.&nbsp; Her
principal relented when she mentioned something about the First
Amendment ... which was also written on hemp (paper).</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>'s two part article (<b>August/September,
1994</b>) on marijuana prohibition by Eric Schlosser won the
National Magazine Award reporting prize.&nbsp; Schlosser wrote
about the extremely high sentences given to people convicted of
marijuana trafficking offenses in contrast to lesser penalties
given to people convicted of violent offenses.&nbsp; <u>NORML

<p align="center"><b>HUNDREDS PROTEST AGAINST DRUG ENFORCEMENT
ADMINISTRATION'S HARASSMENT OF SICK AND DYING AT SAN FRANCISCO
CANNABIS BUYERS CLUB<br>
AGENTS FOLLOW AND VIDEO TAPE PATIENTS AS THEY LEAVE CLUB</b><br>
<b>PREPARING A BUST?</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 11 - Over 500 citizens demonstrated
peacefully in front of the Federal Building in San Francisco
against the harassment by DEA agents of patients leaving the
nations largest Cannabis Buyers Club.&nbsp; Agents of the Drug
Enforcement Administration conspicuously followed and video taped
persons leaving the Club.&nbsp; The Club was originally founded
to provide people with AIDS access to cannabis to overcome the
nausea and loss of appetite associated with the disease and the medications
given for it.&nbsp; The Club now openly provides cannabis to over
4,000 sick, dying, and disabled Americans with a wide range of
medical problems.&nbsp; Patients must bring letters from their doctors
saying that no legally available medications help them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is believed that the DEA's actions may be in preparation for
shutting down the club, which operates in open defiance of the
DEA's suppression of any use or study of cannabis for medical purposes.&nbsp;
A hearing will be held later this month by the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors to determine if the city should declare a
medical emergency to try to forestall any such action by the DEA.&nbsp;
Nothing that the city could do would be legally binding on the
DEA, but it is thought that the DEA might be inhibited by the
fear of adverse publicity.&nbsp; So far the national media have
largely failed to report on the persecution of those who use
cannabis medically, but large scale demonstrations in San
Francisco might draw unwanted attention to this policy.&nbsp;
This is a risk that the DEA may have to take to maintain its
reputation for utter ruthlessness and avoid clear proof of the
need for medical cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When Richard Cowan, NORML's National Director, visited the club
in February a staffer told him that one of the first things they
have to do with their clients is help them get over their fear of their
government.&nbsp; Even in liberal San Francisco, sick, dying, and
disabled Americans have to live in fear of the Federal
government.&nbsp; This harassment of people leaving the Club may
also be intended to reinstall such a fear.&nbsp; The Club will be
open on Good Friday.&nbsp; Will the DEA crucify the helpless? <br>

<p align="center"><b>MEANWHILE IN OKLAHOMA, PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY IS HAND-CUFFED TO A PRISON BED; LIFE IN DANGER; DENIED
PROPER MEDICAL TREATMENT; NO ACCESS TO SHOWER</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 13 - Lexington, OK, Jimmy Montgomery, a
paraplegic who was featured on a recent ABC News Special about
the excesses and failures of the Drug War, spends his days
handcuffed to a prison bed in Oklahoma without adequate medical
treatment for the anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower
body.&nbsp; He is no longer in a cell with 40 other prisoners,
but he has no access to a shower, even though the prison in which
he is confined received Federal funds two years ago for building
such a facility for the disabled. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Friends believe that Montgomery, who is serving 10 years for less
than 2 ounces of marijuana, may die within days if he is not
moved to University Hospital in Oklahoma City.&nbsp; There he
could be properly treated and could be visited by his mother who
is unable to visit him in prison.&nbsp; What a mockery it would
be if he died over Easter weekend while politicians, bureaucrats
and prison guards celebrate their &quot;salvation.&quot;&nbsp;
Jesus wept. <br>

(R. NY) chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee has
introduced a bill (H.R. 1453) to deny tax-exempt status to

respected libertarian think tank, that &quot;advocate the legalization

introduced legislation to prohibit the expenditure of government
funds to study alternatives to drug prohibition.&nbsp;
Representative Solomon's fear of truth is well founded. &nbsp; He
certainly must know that any such study would result in a
condemnation of marijuana prohibition, as have all other large

Sentencing Commission announced it's approval of a proposed
amendment (#37) to federal sentencing guidelines pertaining to
the government's assigned weight of marijuana produced per plant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the late 1980's, the federal guidelines for domestically

Under the current guidelines, 49 plants or fewer are considered
to weigh 100 grams each, but 50 or more plants are considered to
weigh 1,000 grams each. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Commission was persuaded by representatives from NORML, The
Drug Policy Foundation, Families Against Mandatory Minimums
(FAMM) and the Cato Institute who testified that <u>present
guidelines have created a &quot;sentencing cliff&quot; in which
persons convicted of cultivating 50 plants must be incarcerated
up to four times longer than an individual convicted of
cultivating 49 plants</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, a change in the guidelines helps to rectify the
&quot;home cultivation/bulk possession&quot; discrepancy.&nbsp; <i><u>For
example</u></i>: an individual convicted of cultivating marijuana
must serve the same five year sentence as someone who possessed
99 kilograms (218 pounds) of 'packaged' marijuana, despite the
fact that the plants would have produced less than 10 kilograms
(22 pounds) of usable marijuana.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted 7-0 to
approve a 100 gram per plant ratio for all plants, <i>regardless</i>
of the number involved.&nbsp; Unless Congress intervenes, the
Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law on
November 1, 1995. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>NORML salutes the tireless efforts of FAMM for its great work
on this issue!</u> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For further information on the U.S. Sentencing Commission's
recommendations please contact the commission at (202) 273-4590

<p align="center"><b><u>Update</u></b><b>: Jimmy Montgomery
Shares Prison Cell With 40 Prisoners</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 6,</b> Wheelchair-bound Jimmy Montgomery
has been forced to share a cell with <i>forty</i> other prisoners
who risk infection from the chronic anti-biotic resistant
infections afflicting the lower half of his body.&nbsp; On
Monday, Jimmy was picked up by law enforcement officials and sent
back to prison in Lexington, Oklahoma to serve the balance of a
ten year sentence for possession of less than two ounces of
pot.&nbsp; According to Oklahoma NORML Coordinator Michael
Pearson, cannabis reform activists in Oklahoma (and nationwide)
have been calling the Governor and the chief of the Bureau of
Corrections. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pearson says that &quot;Jimmy's case is getting incredible
statewide media exposure.&nbsp; The Montgomery case is seen by
even the most conservative politicians as demonstrating why non-violent
offenders shouldn't be taking up valuable prison space.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be
reached at 405-521-2342.&nbsp; OK NORML, Michael Pearson, can be

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile... Willie Nelson's Pot Charges
Dropped</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 4, Waco, TX</b> About the time that
Oklahoma was re-imprisoning Jimmy Montgomery, an undoubtedly
relieved McLennan County District Attorney decided to drop
marijuana possession charges against Willie Nelson rather than
appeal an adverse cour ruling.&nbsp; The court had ruled that the
enormously popular Texas singer/songwriter had not been properly
advised of his rights and also that there was not probable cause
to search his Mercedes.&nbsp; Police had spotted the remains of an
alleged marijuana cigarette in the ash tray of Nelson's car when
they found Nelson taking a roadside nap.&nbsp; Since many Texans
who drive Mercedes roll their own tobacco cigarettes as an economy
measure, the police were not justified in assuming that the
cigarette was anything other than harmless tobacco, which is
still legal.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nelson is very candid about his marijuana use and
has even talked about having smoked marijuana on the roof of the
White House when Jimmy Carter was President -- a few years after Montgomery
was paralyzed in an industrial accident.&nbsp; Had Nelson been
tried and convicted he could have been sentenced to six months in
jail ... and the District Attorney might have had to leave the
country.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The contrast between the treatment of Nelson
with that of Jimmy Montgomery illustrates the extreme disparity
in consequences for the one thousand Americans who are arrested
everyday on marijuana charges.&nbsp; For some, it is only an
embarrassment.&nbsp; Others find their lives ruined.&nbsp; It is better
to be rich, famous and healthy than to be poor, obscure and
crippled -- especially if you want justice.]</p>

<p align="center"><b>Police Chief Of Hawaii County Suffers From A
Case Of 'Reefer Madness'</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 24,</b> In a letter written to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Hawaii County Police Chief Wayne G.
Carvalbo stated: &quot;We request the reference to

From a local law enforcement standpoint, we view the promotion of
hemp in Executive Order 12919 as a vehicle being utilized by pro
marijuana groups to promote the legalization of marijuana.&nbsp;
The proponents are using the false environmental arguments to
promote the use of a drug that bears substantial health risks to
the user.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>OKLAHOMA RE-IMPRISONS PARAPLEGIC JIMMY
MONTGOMERY ON POT CHARGE; FAMILY FEARS FOR HIS LIFE</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">April 4 - Today the State of Oklahoma
re-imprisoned paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery who has been confined
to a wheelchair for over twenty years and who suffers from
chronic anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower body.&nbsp;
Montgomery was sentenced in 1992 to ten years in prison for
possession of less than two ounces of marijuana.&nbsp; In 1993,
after serving almost a year of his sentence and nearly dying
twice because of the failure of the state of Oklahoma to provide adequate
treatment for the highly communicable infections, Montgomery was
released on an appeals bond arranged by NORML Legal Committee
member C. Rabon Martin.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery was actually convicted of possession
with intent to distribute marijuana, based on the testimony of an
acquaintance who had been arrested -- by a lawman named Lawless
-- for cocaine possession.&nbsp; This man was then given a
lighter sentence in exchange for testifying against Montgomery.&nbsp;
The police then attempted to seize the house in which Montgomery
lived.&nbsp; The house belongs to his elderly mother and there
was never any allegation that she knew of any of the alleged
marijuana use.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is widely -- but illegally -- used by
people with spinal chord injuries for the relief of pain and
spasm in their paralyzed limbs.&nbsp; Presumably the state of
Oklahoma will give Montgomery opiates, tranquilizers and muscle
relaxers instead of marijuana.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the state
previously failed to provide adequate medical care for him, which
endangered not only Montgomery, but also the other prisoners with
whom he was confined.&nbsp; Montgomery's family fears for his
life, not only from the infections, but also from other prisoners
who may fear infection by being confined with him.</p>

<p align="left">(Montgomery was also convicted of possession of
&quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; -- pipes -- and of possession of
two guns in the commission of a drug related felony.&nbsp;
Drive-by shootings by people in wheelchairs are a major problem
in small towns in Oklahoma.&nbsp; The only evidence of intent to distribute
was the testimony of another officer who claimed that he had
never seen anyone with two ounces who was not a major
dealer.&nbsp; This officer was subsequently arrested and charged
with embezzling from the police property room.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction
and sentence based solely on this officer's testimony -- <i>without
issuing a written opinion to explain this action</i>.)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery's appearances at the National Press
Club and at a protest in front of the White House on November 15,
1994, National Medical Marijuana Day, were ignored by the
national media -- although some did complain about the smell of
marijuana smoke at the Press Club.&nbsp; NORML notes that Thomas
Jefferson said &quot;I tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just; that his justice cannot sleep forever.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Montgomery's attorney, C. Rabon Martin will
be seeking a writ of habeas corpus in U.S. District Court in
Oklahoma City.&nbsp; Martin can be reached at 918-587-9000.&nbsp;
The Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating, can be reached at
405-521-2342.&nbsp; An ABC Television News Special &quot;<u>America's
War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions</u>&quot; will feature the
Jimmy Montgomery story on Thursday, April 6 at 10PM Eastern.</p>

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">March 30, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Editor of Arkansas Times Comes out of Her
&quot;Smoky Little Closet&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing in her regular column, Mara Leveritt, the senior
editor of the widely respected weekly <i>Arkansas Times</i>
revealed that she has smoked an average of one &quot;joint&quot;
per day for the last twenty years.&nbsp; Leveritt, who was named
Arkansas Journalist of Year by the University of Arkansas explained
that her purpose was not to encourage the use of marijuana, but
to spur a more rational discussion of marijuana
prohibition.&nbsp; By speaking out she hopes to make it more
difficult to demonize marijuana users. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">She said that &quot;we have come to accept as normal a most
dangerous form of political correctness: a situation in which
those on one side of the issue feel safe to speak, while any would-be
opposition exposes itself to heightened scrutiny.&quot;&nbsp; She
went on to say that &quot;If long term, regular users like myself
felt free to articulate their experiences with marijuana, the
walking, talking evidence that we represent would put our
marijuana laws to shame....&nbsp; And as we get older, our lives
begin to make the lies that have been broadcast about marijuana
look even more ridiculous.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Associated Press story on the article, Leveritt
acknowledged having belonged to NORML. NORML salutes her courage
and urges others who talk about the truth to stop living a lie.&nbsp;
Speaking the truth is a wonderfully liberating experience.&nbsp;
We have it on the highest authority that it will make us free. </p>

<p align="center">[Ms. Leveritt can be reached at 501-375-2985.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alleged white House Shootist Reportedly
Smoked Pot and Listened to Rush Limbaugh<br>
A Dangerous Combination?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the testimony of a friend, Francisco Duran, who
is accused of spraying the White House with bullets, allegedly
smoked marijuana and listened to Rush Limbaugh before setting out for
Washington.&nbsp; His friend who smoked marijuana with him, but
did not listen to Rush Limbaugh, said he tried to talk him out of
his plan to attack the President.&nbsp; Since marijuana -- unlike
alcohol -- is not conimonly associated with acts of violence,
marijuana users who listen to Rush Limbaugh are urged to watch
out for violent impulses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>New Test Allows Parents to Test Their
Children's Rooms for &quot;Drugs&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a major breakthrough in the technology of cementing family
values Barrington Technologies of New Providence, New Jersey, has
introduced a home drug detection kit, &quot;DrugAlert,&quot; that allows
parents to surreptitiously check their children's room and
personal belongings for drug residues. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A March 29 <i>Washington Post</i> story on the test quoted a
staff therapist at the Family Therapy Institute of Alexandria,
Virginia, saying that &quot;It usually takes two or three years
after a child is using before their behavior becomes so deviant
that parents are aware of their drug use, and by that time they
are well into addiction.&quot;&nbsp; He did not suggest at what
age parents might start using these tests, but presumably it
should be up to three years before there is any indication of a
problem.&nbsp; According to the Partnership for a Drug-Free (sic)
America, the median age of first drug use by children is 12 and
half.&nbsp; Therefore regular testing might begin at age 9.&nbsp;
The <i>Washington Post</i> story also reported on home urine
tests that are being sold.&nbsp; Parents can also collect their
children's urine samples from an early age.&nbsp; There are
conflicting opinions on the relative merits of surreptitious and
forced testing as tools to help the child mature in a drug-free
environment. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The DrugAlert kit supplies a small pre-moistened pad which
picks up drug residues when wiped across items that may have come
into contact with illicit drugs.&nbsp; To demonstrate the technology,
company executives spread cocaine over common objects - such as a
baseball trophy which one would expect a drug using child to
bring into contact with drugs.&nbsp; The surfaces were then wiped
with the DrugAlert pad and the pad was tested and demonstrated
the presence of the cocaine.&nbsp; It was not explained <i>where</i>
the company got the cocaine, whether from the DEA, the CIA, or
the Iran/Contra connection. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The company warns that children might pick up drug residues
without actually using drugs, and a company executive also
admitted that the company had not considered the possibility that children
might use the test to check their parents rooms for drugs.&nbsp; <u>Perhaps
the D.A.R.E. program could provide children with the tests so
that more parents could be reported to the police and thereby
saved from drugs</u>.&nbsp; Employers [such as editors or
producers -ed.] might test their employees' personal belongings
to detect drug traces.&nbsp; Presumably the tests will not detect
the residues of alcoholic beverages so that teenage binge
drinking will not be detected and personal liberty will not be
undermined. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Plants Thrive In Downtown Tel Aviv<br>
Is Marijuana Decriminalization Coming To Isreal?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 24, The <em>Jerusalem Post</em> (JP) ran an article
featuring the actions of the country's most evident marijuana
reform organization, The Green Revolution. </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Israel has a growing marijuana-smoking population and many
    of them believe that the drug, being natural rather than
    chemical, should be legalized. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, the drive towards legalized growing and smoking of
cannabis gained new momemtum.&nbsp; While the legalization
movement has been going on here for some time, the movement in
Tel Aviv has exploded.&nbsp; Over the past year, there have been
rallies and smoke-ins at Tel Aviv nightclubs, and organizers have
produced T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons and pamphlets carrying
the familiar shape of the cannabis leaf. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But buttons and signs aren't enought to bring about such a
radical change.&nbsp; [Marijuana reform group] The Green
Revolution has discovered the green thumb.&nbsp; Armed with
seedlings and a smile, about 15 revolutionaries have turned to
gardening.&nbsp; Their mission: to turn Tel Aviv into a marijuana jungle. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On one Friday afternoon in January, members of the group targeted
the Tel Aviv landscape, tilling the soil with about 1,000
seeds.&nbsp; The result: marijuana is growing all over downtown
Tel Aviv. 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [The JP further reports] After the Green Revolution made
    its strategy public, hundreds of others planted seeds, and
    not just in Tel Aviv.&nbsp; Sprouts have been spotted in Or
    Yehuda and Givatayim.&nbsp; Budding cannabis has been spotted
    around Tel Aviv City Hall, in the planters of Carlebach Steet
    office buildings and down other main streets. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [But, there are detractors. -ed.] Dr. Benny Avrahami,
    director of the Tel Aviv Municipal Anti-Drug Authority. He
    admits that marijuana is hardly in the same league as hard
    drugs...though he considers marijuana to be the
    &quot;gate-opener&quot; to harder drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Avrahami thinks that legalizing marijuana could lead to the
    collapse of Isreali society. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;<i><u>If marijuana was to become legalized, in my opinion,
it would be social suicide for Isreal</u></i> [emphasis added
-ed.].&nbsp; So many of our youth would feel free to use it and
the more users, the more addicts.&nbsp; How can we afford to have
this when they are in the army and part of a society that may be
called up at a short notice to serve?&quot; 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * One month after the fast seeds were planted, the group set
    out to see what had become of their gardening
    adventure.&nbsp; The payoff: 5-cm.-high marijuana plants around
    downtown... [Green Revolution members] will continue their
    fight for legalization, planting and campaigning, because
    they really want to be law-abiding citizens.&nbsp; But until
    that happens-- they'll just keep breaking the law.

items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">March 23, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alcohol Industry Association Hires Former
Head Of Drug Enforcement Administration</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">John C. Lawn, the former head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) has been appointed as Chairman and CEO of
the &quot;Century Council,&quot; which is described in the
March/April issue of <i>Healthy Drinking</i> magazine as being
&quot;the most prominent of the hundreds of programs supported by
the licensed beverage industry.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The appointment is seen as an extension of the efforts of the
alcohol industry to separate itself from the illegal drugs.&nbsp; <i>Healthy
Drinking</i>, supported by the alcohol industry, hails the
appointment, &quot;anxiously&quot; hoping that Lawn's connections
in the prohibitionist propaganda industry will help de-couple
alcohol from other drugs in prohibitionist propaganda. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The magazine wrongly states that the DEA has &quot;scrupulously
avoided confusing use with abuse and drinking with drugging, a
stance which seems beyond the ken of other federal agencies like Health
and Human Services.&quot;&nbsp; The alcohol industry seems
unaware that the DEA is now claiming that alcohol prohibition was
a success.&nbsp; For example, an official 1994 DEA publication,
&quot;How to Hold Your Own in A Drug Legalization Debate&quot;
(page 29) cites two prohibitionists who claim that alcohol
prohibition worked because it reduced alcohol consumption.&nbsp;
The Michigan Drug Czar Robert Peterson is quoted as saying that
&quot;Since the repeal of Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot;&nbsp;
This sort of statement is common in prohibitionist
propaganda.&nbsp; Much of the hard core constituency of drug
prohibition <i>also</i> supports alcohol prohibition -- but they
generally keep it low key. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the magazine approvingly quotes Lawn using a standard
DEA line: &quot;Illicit drugs .... are illegal because they are
dangerous.&quot;&nbsp; Does this indicate that the alcohol
industry is betting its future on the assertion that alcohol is <u>not</u>
&quot;dangerous&quot; by the standards of a government that is waging
a war on marijuana, which by every objective measure is far less
dangerous than alcohol? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, said that
&quot;the appointment of Lawn is not only cynical and
hypocritical, but also very misguided.&nbsp; The alcohol industry
is not going to protect itself from the prohibitionists by
pretending that alcohol isn't a drug.&nbsp; Lawn may well be able
to marginally influence some of the prohibitionist propaganda or
legislation passed by alcohol using (and abusing) legislators,
but this is more likely to lull the alcohol industry into
unwarranted complacency rather than to protect them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The alcohol and tobacco industries need to learn that their best
protection from the therapeutic state is to tell the truth about
freedom and stop trying to pretend that their products aren't
'drugs.'&nbsp; Further, does the alcohol industry really want to
declare war on its natural allies in the anti-prohibitionist
movement in order to appease the prohibitionists who have them
next on their lists?&nbsp; Who is advising the alcohol industry
on this, the ghost of Neville Chamberlin?&nbsp; Or perhaps the
ghost of Harry Anslinger?&quot; </p>

Drinking</i> at 206-525-0449.&nbsp; For more information of a
comparison of alcohol and marijuana contact Allen St. Pierre at
NORML 202-483-5500. </p>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a one-hour news special, ABC News correspondent Catherine
Crier [a former Felony Chief Prosecutor and a State Civil
District Judge, 162nd District-Dallas County, TX -ed.] examines some
controversial alternatives to the 'War on Drugs' model: the
decriminalization or legalization of some drugs, and &quot;harm
reduction&quot; -- the treatment of addicts with drugs and
therapy rather than incarceration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The hour takes Crier to cities around the country, and to Europe,
where tactics that to many appear risky and dangerous are
currently employed.&nbsp; Should and could they be successfully
used here?&nbsp; Experts -- and addicts -- offer their thoughts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Execution Delayed For Convicted

Birmingham, Alabama, &quot;A judge yesterday blocked the
execution of a drug kingpin nine days before he was to become the
first person put to death by the U.S. government since 1963. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Natasha Zalkins said new and &quot;very
sensitive&quot; evidence had come to light that proved David

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Chandler, 42,...had been scheduled to die by injection March 30
at the federal prison in Terre Haute, IN. </p>

routine for many Brazilians. Routine, but illegal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now, for the first time, the country is seriously discussing a
proposal to end jail time and fines for the use and possession of
the drug. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>AP</i> reports that Congress is scheduled to vote on
decriminalization by July.&nbsp; Attorney General Nelson Jobim is
lobbying for the bill.&nbsp; &quot;It's absurd,&quot; to put

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under current law, marijuana users can be sentenced to 2 to 3
years in prison for possessing as little as 20 grams of
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>AP</i>, three South American nations --
Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela -- already have systems similar
to the one proposed by Jobim, while the possession of small
amounts of marijuana is completely legal in Columbia and Peru. <br>

<p align="center">March 16, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Testifies Before U.S. Sentencing
Guideline Commission</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 15, Washington, D.C., NORML National Legal Committee
member Marvin Miller, Esq., of Alexandria, VA led a group of
NORML witnesses who testified before the U.S. Sentencing
Commission and urged the adoption of proposed guideline changes
that would benefit marijuana-related defendants in federal court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller, a former member of the NORML Board of Directors and a
nationally prominent criminal defense attorney, urged the
commission to adopt two proposed guideline changes.&nbsp; The first,
proposed amendment #37, would correct an inequity in the current
guidelines regarding the weight assigned to marijuana plants, for
purposes of sentencing.&nbsp; Currenfly, if the offense involves less
than 50 marijuana plants, each plant is presumed to weigh 100
grams.&nbsp; However, if the offense, involves 50 plants or more,
each plant (including the first 49) is presumed to weigh one kilo
(1000 grams).&nbsp; This formula has created a &quot;sentencing
cliff&quot;-- causing an individual convicted of possessing 50
plants to receive a significantly longer sentence than an
individual convicted of possessing 49 or fewer plants; and an
individual convicted of possessing 100 plants (even if they are
seedlings) is sentenced the same as someone convicted of
distributing 100 kilos of bulk marijuana (although the 100
seedlings would not possibly produce anywhere near that amount of usable
marijuana). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller testified that the 100 gram per plant formula reflects
more accurately the actual potential yield from a single
marijuana plant, and urged the Commission to amend the guidelines
accordingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller also testified in favor of proposed guideline amendment
#42, regarding the treatment of wet marijuana (fleshly harvested
marijuana) for sentencing purposes.&nbsp; Currently the wet
marijuana is weighed as is, with the defendant receiving a longer
sentence under the current weight-driven guidelines.&nbsp; Under
the proposed amendment, when marijuana has a moisture content
sufficient to render it unusable without drying it, an
approximation of the weight without such excess moisture content
is to be used.&nbsp; Miller told the Commission they should be
looking at the usable amount of marijuana, rather than the bulk
amount -- for sentencing purposes generally -- and urged them to scale
back the penalties overall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, NORML Board member David Boaz, Executive Vice
President of the Cato Institute, testified on behalf of the
Institute regarding marijuana.&nbsp; Boaz pointed out to the Commission
that there were approximately 784 marijuana offenders convicted
in 1992 for whom the minimum guideline range was greater than the
applicable minimum mandatory sentence.&nbsp; &quot;The cost of
keeping those 784 people in prison for one year is
$16,310,000.&nbsp; If we estimate that they would average four
additional years in prison based on current guidelines, the
taxpayers would be paying more than $65 million in additional
costs for those prisoners...&nbsp; We would be better served by
keeping violent criminals in prison longer by freeing up beds now
used by marijuana offenders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other NORML witnesses included former Board member and
cultivation expert Ed Rosenthal of California, and NORML/BACH
activist Lennice Werth of Virginia (who uses marijuana as a medicine).&nbsp;
Rosenthal focused on the issue of the presumed weight of a
marijuana plant, and Werth urged the Commission to find a way in
the guidelines to accommodate those who cultivate marijuana for
medical use.&nbsp; These standout activists were joined by FAMM
Director Julie Stewart and the Drug Policy Foundation Legislative
Director Cheryl Epps.&nbsp; Also present, but not testifying, was
NORML Board member Keith Stroup. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The U.S. Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law
in 180 days unless the Congress enacts laws otherwise.&nbsp; For
more information on the U.S. Sentencing Commission hearings and
the time frame in which the Commission can act on NORML's
recommendations, contact the U.S. Sentencing Commission's office
of Public Relations at 202-275-4500.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Congressman Seeks To Halt Free-Speech
On Information Superhighway</b><br>
<b>(Or George Orwell Call Home)</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">October 6, Washington, D.C., prohibition fanatic U.S.
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-NY) extended his opposition
to any criticism of prohibition to include the Intemet.&nbsp; The following
are excerpts from an October 6 speech Rep. Solomon delivered on
the House floor: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my attention that
drug legalization advocates are using the electronic information
superhighway to organize the legalization movement and share information
on drug use.&nbsp; The information superhighway was certalnly not
created to propagate such misinformation and the criminal
activity associated with it.&nbsp; This use was brought to my attention
by drug legalization opponents who use the information
superhighway everyday in their vocations.&nbsp;
[Anti-prohibitionists don't use computers in their vocations?
-ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Apparently the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) recently entered remarks which I personally made in
opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an example
of 'rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.'&nbsp; Because I
believe, along with 95 percent of America [myth of consensus
-ed.], that the use of illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as
an enemy of drug users.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Speaker, I am
honored.&nbsp; <b><i>The use of illegal drugs is an anathema to
the social and moral fabric of our Nation</i></b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Pro-drug use and legalization messages on the information
superhighway through Internet are wrong...&nbsp; As more and more
Americans jump onto this latest technological advancement, more
and more citizens will have access to this ill-advised
information.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive Americans.&nbsp; As Congress reviews this very important technology
during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by pro-drug
organizations and individuals for the propagation of this ilk
must be addressed.&nbsp; <b><i>As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs</i></b>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director Richard Cowan comments:
&quot;Representative Solomon continues to demonstrate his fear of
free and open discussion.&nbsp; This is typical of the statist
mind-set.&nbsp; NORML believes that freedom has nothing to fear
from the truth--so it is appropriate that Solomon is running
scared.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>'Drug Peace' In the Middle East?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 14, The <i>Hayward Daily Review</i> reports that &quot;a
panel of experts Monday recommended that Israel's parliament ease
laws agalnst the use of marijuana and hashish.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana &quot;Kingpin&quot; Qualifies For </b><b><u>First</u></b><b>
Federal Execution In 32 Years</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 13, <i>Reuters</i> reports that U.S. authorities have
notified David Chandler, 42, that his death sentence will be
carried out March 30 in the first federal execution in 32 years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>Reuters</i>, Chandler was convicted in 1991 in
Alabama of hiring another individual to kill a member of his
marijuana smuggling ring who had become an informant.&nbsp;
Chandler is the first federal inmate to receive a death sentence
under the 1988 Omnibus Crime Bill.&nbsp; The federal Bureau of
Prisons sald five other inmates are awaiting execution under the
same drug kingpin law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Reuters</i> reports that prison officials acknowledged that
Chandler's execution, which would be carried out by lethal
injection, could be delayed by his filing of a new appeal. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[NORML <b><i><u>strongly</u></i></b> protests the potential
execution of David Chandler.&nbsp; Mr. Chandler should not be
exposed to an ill-conceived death penalty statute solely because
of his alleged role in a marijuana trafficking operation.&nbsp;
Executing this man, in the name of the 'Drug War', will not deter
or hinder a single nanogram's worth of &quot;drugs&quot; from
being cultivated, sold or consumed in the U.S.&nbsp; <u>So why do
it</u>?&nbsp; For more information on Mr. Chandler's dreadful
plight, contact the Alabama ACLU, Olivia Turner, 205-262-0304.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Founder of 'Our Church' Receives 10-Year
Sentence In Marijuana Case</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 11, <i>The Morning News</i> (of Northwest Arkansas)
reported that Tom Brown, the controversial founder and former
leader of Our Church, was sentenced in federal court to 10 years in
prison.&nbsp; Brown was also fined $17,500 and had 39 acres of
land forfeited to the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown asserts that the church uses marijuana as part of its
religious service. <i>The Morning News</i> reported that
&quot;Our Church and its members say they have a constitutional right
under freedom of religion to use [marijuana, as a form of
sacrament,] during their church services. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Brown] attempted to argue his case at the sentencing hearing,
but [U.S. District Judge] Waters wouldn't allow it.&nbsp; Brown,
disregarding Waters...said he would have been found innocent if
he had been allowed to argue that his religious freedom permitted
him to use marijuana in church services. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It was an invalid indictment, an invalid prosecution, an

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;Dangerous Drugs Therapeutic Act&quot; which established
provisions for the disbursal of marijuana for medical purposes

Marijuana Charges<br>
Goes On Hunger Strike To Protest Lack Of Marinol</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 23, The Beaumont Enterprise reported that a former
Jefferson County prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer is
protesting his marijuana-related arrest by refusing to eat solid
foods. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In what can only be described as a bizarre case, Alan D.
McLemore, 43, was arrested at his home February 8 on marijuana
cultivation and gun charges. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Background] McLemore has had a life long battle with clinical
depression.&nbsp; In time, McLemore received a prescription for
Marinol [synthetic marijuana pill -ed.].&nbsp; McLemore found that
Marinol not only stabilized his depression, it also curbed his
craving for alcohol.&nbsp; Due to the high cost and very limited
quantities of Marinol, McLemore supplemented medication with marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Finally able to lead a normal life, McLemore got a law degree,
became an assistant district attorney, and eventually opened his
own law office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon his arrest in February, McLemore, after posting bond,
returned to jail because he felt as though he could not honor the
judges order that he not consume marijuana while out on
bond.&nbsp; McLemore stated that he didn't want to have his
mother lose her home (McLemore's mother put her home up for the
$l00,000 bond) because of his desperate need for an effective
medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">During McLemore's hunger strike, he has lost as much as 25
pounds.&nbsp; McLemore, in an issued statement from jail,
reported by the <i>Beaumont Enterprise</i>, said, &quot;Uncaring
legislatures, that have been totally corrupted by money, have
denied me and millions of others the relief this wonderful plant
provides.&nbsp; I have no liberty; the pursuit of happiness has
been denied me; and life is therefore a burden that I'm anxious
to relinquish. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 6, SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories reported
that there has been a drastic reduction in the number of people
testing positive for drug use -- while at the same time, the rate

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SmithKline found that of more than 3.6 million drug tests

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Associated Press</i> reports that SmithK1ine Beecham said
&quot;a change in the screening threshold for marijuana required
by the Department of Transportation (DOT) could account for the increase
in positive tests for marijuana use.&nbsp; [<b>NORML</b>
agrees.&nbsp; Beginning on January 1, DOT regulations mandate
that the threshold for positive marijuana screen be lowered from

<p align="center">March 2, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Sunday Los Angeles Times Front Page: S.F.
Cannabis Buyers' Club</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 26, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> published a detailed
article on the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Francisco.&nbsp; The
following are selected excerpts; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This is a different kind of drug store...dozens of people sit on
rummage-sale couches and folding chairs, smoking high-grade
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is business as usual at the Cannabis Buyers' Club, a
flourishing illegal marijuana market rooted in civil
disobedience.&nbsp; But this is a club no rational person would
aspire to join.&nbsp; Doing your shopping here means you are sick
or dying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The underground pharmacy is part of a growing movement aimed at
gaining sick people the right to use marijuana.&nbsp; Across the
country thousands of patients with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis and other illnesses defy the law daily to
treat their ailments or ease their pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In San Francisco, long known for its tolerance, authorities have
chosen to ignore the law, saying that sick people who can benefit
from the plant should be able to buy it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">'I have no problem whatsoever with the use of marijuana for
medical purposes,&quot; said [San Francisco] Mayor Frank Jordan,
a former police chief.&nbsp; &quot;I am sensitive and
compassionate to people who have legitimate needs.&nbsp; <u>We
should bend the law and do what's right</u>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[In opposing the use of marijuana as medicine] Mike Heald, Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman, said marijuana is strictly
controlled because the public does not believe that smoking it is
proper behavior.&nbsp; [Mr. Heald is enveloped in the &quot;myth
of consensus&quot; -ed.] He said marijuana, like alcohol and
tobacco, is a &quot;gateway&quot; substance that leads to the use
of hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and LSD -- a contention
disputed by marijuana advocates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The club was founded in 1991, and more than 3,000 people bearing
notes from their doctors have flocked to the...club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Some that have claimed to have benefited from the club] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* AIDS patient Jon Bush gained 30 pounds in the past six months
[with the use of marijuana] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Hazel Rodgers, 75, volunteers her time at the club while at the
same time using marijuana to treat her glaucoma.&nbsp; Rodgers
was referred to the club by [SF] county supervisor Angela Alioto. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am an extremely strong advocate of medicinal
marijuana,&quot; Alioto said, &quot;I saw it work&quot;.&nbsp; [Alioto's
late husband used marijuana to treat the adverse reaction from
his cancer chemotherapy treatments. -ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>California Assemblyman's Bill Could Relieve
The Need For Cannabis Buyer's Club</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 1, Sacramento, CA, California Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) is sponsoring a medical marijuana bill,
AB 1597, which would exempt patients with a physician's recommendation
from laws against personal possession and cultivation of
marijuana.&nbsp; The bill is similar to the medical marijuana
initiative being proposed by Californians for Compassionate Use (CCU)
for the 1996 ballot. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Iowa State Senators Urge Senator Harkin To
Support Medical Marijuana Research</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 21, Three prominent state senators from Iowa sent a
letter to Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) prodding him to pressure the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to allow a long
delayed medical study of the therapeutic effects of marijuana on
patients with AIDS.&nbsp; [This letter is representative of the
numerous letters that have been sent by elected state officials
all over the U.S. to federal representatives and officials within
the government.&nbsp; To date, 36 states have passed legislation
expressing their desire to see marijuana be made more readily
available for patients coping with life and/or sense-threatening
diseases or ailments.&nbsp; The problem is a recalcitrant and
unresponsive federal bureaucracy. -ed.] A selected excerpt of the
IA state senators letter follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are respectfully asking that you consider contacting Dr.
Philip Lee, Asst. Sec. for HHS, and express your support for
allowing the first research project concerning medical marijuana
in over a decade.&nbsp; Our only objective is to find out exactly
how safe and effective marijuana is in treating glaucoma,
multiple sclerosis, AIDS and AIDS-related wasting syndrome, and
cancer.&nbsp; Many patients in Iowa, as well as the rest of the
United States, are eagerly anticipating the results from Dr.
Abrams' study [the long delayed study -ed.], and we ask that you
encourage this to happen.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>Liberty Lovers -- Beware The Ides Of March!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Excerpts from FIJA release] On March 15, wholesale florist
Yvonne Regas of Sparks, NV will be arraigned in U.S. District
Court in Reno, on charges of (1) Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; (2)
Aiding and abetting Obstruction of Justice; and (3) Jury
Tampering. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Before deciding that such dastardly behavior deserves swift, sure
punishment -- such as the three to six years in prison this could
cost Ms. Regas, if convicted -- consider what she actually did:
she and a few friends put brochures published by Fully Informed
Jury Association (FIJA) under the wiper blades of cars parked
near the courthouse, during the trial of her son and ex-husband,
among others, on drug charges.&nbsp; That's it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">These brochures -- which have been distributed similarly by
untold numbers of people at hundreds of court houses around the
country over the past five years -- explain the rights, powers, and
responsibilities of trial jurors.&nbsp; Often, the brochures are
handed to all who enter the court house. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The point of the leafleting has been to advise jurors that they
possess the power to judge the law itself, and not just &quot;the
facts&quot;, as most modern jury instruction insist.&nbsp;
&quot;Jury nullification of law&quot; means that &quot;the
governed -- if informed of their power as jurors -- can
&quot;just say no&quot; to bad laws, and thereby check and
balance the government.&nbsp; [It is for this reason that NORML
supports the efforts of FIJA. Just imagine if every juror in a
marijuana-related case knew that they possess the power and
authority to nullify &quot;bad law&quot;.&nbsp; Is it possible
that there would be a marked reduction in criminal convictions
for marijuana-related &quot;crimes&quot;?&nbsp; Further, would
the government then realize that they've been operating under the
`myth of consensus' and substantively amend the law? -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Regas case has attracted some of the nation's premier
constitutional lawyers: Dr. Nancy Lord, Larry Becraft, and
(possibly) Jonathan Emord.&nbsp; They see this as a watershed
case for both the First and Sixth Amendments, and believe that
conviction of Ms. Regas could result in erosion of the rest of
the Bill of Rights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Regas is convicted, Nancy Lord fears it could also lead to
prosecutions [and certainly intimidation -ed.] of FIJA activists
around the country. </p>

<p>[To find out more about the Regas case, contact <b>LAWYERS FOR
LIBERTY</b>, c/o Nancy Lord, 1718 Peachtree St. NW, ste. 499,
Atlanta, GA 30309 or call 404-963-6932.&nbsp; For further information

<p align="center">February 23, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Watch International And The DEA Combine
Forces To Kill<br>
Colorado Hemp Bill With Two Powerful Weapons: Lies And Threats</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Denver, CO, Colorado's Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Natural Resources and Energy voted down Senate Bill
132, the Colorado Hemp Production Act. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by state senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
sought to 1.) establish a commission to study hemp as a cash crop
and the federal laws governing hemp cultivation [Similar to the
commission recently established by Kentucky's governor. -ed.],
and 2.) create a 'vehicle' for the establishment of a legal hemp
industry in Colorado.&nbsp; The measures were voted down 4-3 and 6-1
respectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While it is unfortunate that the citizens of Colorado are
temporarily unable to enjoy the economic benefits of a legal hemp
industry, the most disturbing aspect of these hearings was the apparent
impact of testimony provided by The Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) and Drug Watch International (DWI)
[prohibitionist organization -ed.]. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, DWI representative Beverly Kinard gave bizarre testimony
that included wild misrepresentations about hemp production, the
health effects associated with marijuana use and the groups and
individuals who advocate changing the laws governing marijuana.
Some of Mrs. Kinard's more notable direct quotes follow: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Dutch National Board of Drug Prevention is extremely
    concerned because even with low THC marijuana, high
    concentrations of THC may be produced in some organs.&nbsp;
    [There is no such office entitled the &quot;Dutch National Board
    of Drug Prevention&quot;. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Legalizing drugs in the Netherlands brought the crime rate
    up 400%.&nbsp; [&quot;Drugs&quot; are not legal in Holland
    and the violent crime rate has declined over The last 12 years.
    -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Hemp oil [derived from marijuana seeds -ed.] causes skin
    cancer overnight on laboratory rats.&nbsp; [Hemp seed oil is
    sold in health food stores. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Marijuana affects every cell, every system and every organ
    in the body. The mental disorders include acute toxic
    psychosis, panic attacks, flashbacks, delusions,
    depersonalization, hallucinations, paranoia, depression and UNCONTROLLABLE
    HOSTILITY.&nbsp; [Emphasis not added!&nbsp; If so, why has violent
    crime declined in Holland? -ed.] 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While NORML contends that nearly all of Mrs. Kinard's testimony
was nonsensical, the DEA proved DWI one better.&nbsp; Special
Agent in Charge of the DEA's Rocky Mountain Field Division, Philip
W. Perry, testified that the DEA strongly opposes any
democratically-inspired challenges to their supreme control of
marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; In his written testimony, Agent
Perry asserts that &quot;In cases where federal and state law are
in opposition, the question of which law would control is well
settled.&quot;&nbsp; Agent Perry felt it necessary to reiterate
for the committee: &quot;Let us be clear that what we are talking
about in this Bill is marijuana.&nbsp; Calling it
&quot;hemp&quot; on the basis of an artificial threshold level of
psychoactive ingredient does not erase the fact that it is
botanically and legally the same plant.&quot;&nbsp; [Yes, that is
exactly the point! -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Agent Perry concluded by forcefully reasserting the federal
government's recalcitrant position regarding hemp and even more
bizarre, his interpretation of the parental-like role of federal
law enforcement: &quot;Although I am not an expert in the
economics of crop production [question: why then are you
testifying in an agriculture committee hearing? -ed.]...With 31
years of service in law enforcement...I can tell you, in my
professional opinion, this legislation is no more than a shallow ruse
being advanced by those who seek to legalize marijuana.&nbsp; The
people of Colorado deserve to be protected from this sort of
subterfuge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The federal criminal law on this subject does provide such
protection and will be enforced with all the vigor at DEA's
command.&quot; [Emphasis added. -ed.] 

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on this legislative debacle, including
copies of the DWI and DEA's tendentious written testimonies,
please contact Allen St. Pierre, NORML, 202-483-5500.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>DEA's Next Target: Hawaii</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 13, Kailua-Kona, In a letter from the mayor of Hawaii
County to the DEA, Mayor Stephen K. Yamashiro's executive
assistant asserted that the Mayor is totally supportive of hemp activist
Roger Christie's efforts to establish a legal hemp industry on
Hawaii. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Executive Assistant R.B. Legaspi writes, in part, that Mr.
Christie has secured the Mayor's endorsement and that &quot;The
Mayor [has] offered the use of county lands for an experimental
project growing low grade hemp for commercial purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In his letter, Mr. Legaspi pointed out to the DEA that this past
June 7, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12919, which
amongst other things, recognizes hemp as a &quot;Food
Resource&quot;. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter concludes with a reiteration, &quot;Mayor Yamashiro
does endorse...the cultivation of hemp and its conversion to
products useful to mankind.&quot;&nbsp; [Editor's note: Despite
the Mayor's pragmatism and support, the County of Hawaii is not
going to be able to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The DEA will
likely employ the same heavy-handed tactics that it successfully
used in the above cited case in Colorado and deny Mr. Christie
his permit needed to legally cultivate hemp.&nbsp; The disproportional
level of influence and power the DEA asserts over
democratically-elected local and state officials is a clear
violation of the 9th and 10th Amendments.] </p>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">AP reports that McCafferey portrayed an insatiable drug market
able to adapt to law enforcement agencies by quickly changing
drug routes and methods of production. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gen. McCafferey acknowledged the difficulty of tackling the drug
problem, but like any true believer he concluded: &quot;I Think
part of the problem has been our decision to call it a war...I
prefer to think of it as a cancer.&nbsp; I don't think about
achieving victory but about dealing with the problem.&quot;&nbsp;
[NORML's National Director Richard Cowan's comment: &quot;With
this kind of mentality, America will always be engaged in a
&quot;drug war&quot; until we die of the cancer of prohibition

<p align="center"><b>Michigan Lawyer Still Being Persecuted By
The Feds<br>
After Serving Eight Months In Prison For </b><b><u>ONE</u></b><b>
Joint!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Bay City, Michigan, in the latest twist in a
federal marijuana case involving attorney Edward Czuprynski, the
full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, all fifteen
judges, ruled <i>en banc</i> that a search of Czuprynski's law
office and home was constitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski was federally indicted in May, 1992 for 1.6 grams of
marijuana [about a joint -ed.].&nbsp; Following a trial, he was
sentenced to serve a whopping 14 months in a federal penitentiary.&nbsp;
After eight months, however, a panel of three judges on the U.S.
Court of Appeals ordered Czuprynski's release from prison in July
of 1993 and ruled in his favor four months later on constitutional
grounds, the first of seven issues Czuprynski raised on appeal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon the government's appeal, the full court's recent decision
examined only one raised constitutional issue and sent the case
back to the original three judge panel to review and rule on the
remaining six issues. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the 11-4 split decision, the dissenting justices commented
that they &quot;can not condone the type of prosecutorial
overkill that has taken place here,&quot; adding that &quot;it
only points out the great expense of this court's time and
resources in hearing a case <i>en banc</i> [which involves] such
an insignificant amount of marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski said he is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court and has secured the commitment from the American Civil
Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild to support his
effort. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski commented that &quot;I may have lost the latest
battle, but I'm confident I'll win this war,&quot; adding that,
&quot;the conviction against me resulted from a real railroading
that trampled all over my rights.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 3, The <i>Topeka Capital-Journal</i> reported on the
conviction of two Douglas County residents suspected of watering
172 marijuana plants.&nbsp; The defendants Nancy Hadley and
Michael Wyman were charged with multiple felonies [including
intent to distribute, conspiracy, etc...] that could have yielded
them more than 40 years in prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wyman's attorney, Pedro Irigonegaray, commented that the
defendant was willing to admit to the possession charge, but not
to the multiple charges for distribution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML National Legal Committee (NLC) member William K. Rork</b>,
Hadley's attorney, asserted that the government erred in
assigning the potential weight of the 172 plants at 840 pounds. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rork and Irigonegaray called upon <i>High Times</i> editor Ed
Rosenthal, an expert on cannabis cultivation, to refute the
government's assertion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rosenthal testified that 1.) the total bud yield from the 172
plants when mature would have been approximately 9.6 pounds and,
2.) the shelf life of marijuana is indefinite if frozen.&nbsp;
Therefore, the defendants were able to effectively claim that the
marijuana they were alleged to possess was compatible with
personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The jury agreed.&nbsp; Hadley and Wyman will likely receive
probation on two misdemeanor charges according to Irigonegaray. <br>

case sets a dangerous precedent [For law enforcement! -ed.]. </p>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Because marijuana is so widely used by so many Americans, the

<p>I.)&nbsp; February 8, <i>USA Today</i> ran an editorial in
response to the Clinton administration's request for an increase
in &quot;drug warring&quot; funds.&nbsp; Selected excerpts from
the editorial follow: </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Something just doesn't make sense about the USA's drug
war.&nbsp; It's like no one wants to win.&nbsp; Tuesday, the
Clinton administration paraded out a new drug fighting plan for
1996.&nbsp; It proposes spending a record $14.6 billion -- $1.3
billion more than this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Federal and state governments have spent $250 billion trying to
&quot;control drugs&quot; in the past 15 years, with the bulk of
the money going to law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-And still, Congress appears dissatisfied.&nbsp; Preening for his
presidential bid, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says the Clinton
administration drug policy &quot;is still based on the
blame-the-society-first approach to crime and punishment.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    <i>That's a great sound bite.&nbsp; But it ignores the facts.</i> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    <i>And as long as politicians continue to do that, the nation
    will continue to lose the war on drugs.</i>&nbsp; [emphasis
    added -ed.] 
</blockquote>

<p>II.)&nbsp; February 20, <i>The National Review</i>'s &quot;The
Week&quot; editorial section observed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    After campaigning as a tough-on-crime conservative, New York
    Governor George Pataki wants to cut sentences for drug
    dealers.&nbsp; There is no contradiction here.&nbsp; To
    fulfill his promise of keeping violent criminals locked up
    longer, Governor Pataki needs to free up prison space
    increasingly occupied by non-violent drug offenders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    ... Resources that could be used to incapacitate robbers,

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 9, The following are selected excerpts from the <i>Baltimore
Sun</i>'s front page article: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -In a report meant to rekindle debate over drug policy, a
    Baltimore grand jury suggests that marijuana be
    &quot;decriminalized&quot;... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -&quot;It is time to take a very serious look at the drug
    problem in Baltimore City.&nbsp; Removing the profit from the
    drug trade maybe the only way to resolve it,&quot; says the report
    from the grand jury, which was assigned by a judge to study
    drug legalization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The grand jury says striking down laws against possessing
    small amounts of marijuana is an &quot;honest response&quot;
    to a finding that authorities seldom enforce such laws. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The report was hailed by Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who since 1988
    has advocated a national debate on alternative approaches to
    fighting drugs.&nbsp; &quot;I was pleased they came down on
    the side of making the war on drugs more of a public health
    war rather than a criminal justice war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -When the grand jury was sworn in for a four-month term on
    Sept. 12, Baltimore Circuit Judge Joseph P. McCurdy Jr. told
    it to look into the issue of drug decriminalization.&nbsp;
    &quot;<u>Many of us feel that the war on drugs has not
    succeeded, that we are losing ground with each passing day,
    that we are wasting resources and that we have to look at
    this problem anew</u>,&quot; he said.&nbsp; [Amen. -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    David C. Condliffe, executive director of the Drug Policy
    Foundation, praised Baltimore as a city on the cutting edge
    of a &quot;sane&quot; drug policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    He noted that the Clinton administration yesterday announced
    a policy that shifts a larger percentage of drug fighting
    money away from treatment and prevention, and toward law
    enforcement.&nbsp; Pointing to the grand jury report, he said,
    &quot;Washington is simply out of step with the
    citizens.&quot;&nbsp; [NORML concurs -ed.]

<p align="center"><b>French Commission Narrowly Votes To
&quot;Decriminalize&quot; Marijuana</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 4, <i>Le Monde</i> reports that members of the
Henrion commission, appointed in March by Simone Veil, Minister
of Social Affairs, Health and Cities, to study a 1970 law
concerning the criminal penalties for drug possession in France,
have made some remarkable observations and recommendations. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The commission was asked whether the distinction between hard and
soft drugs should be upheld.&nbsp; According, to <i>Le Monde</i>
&quot;the commission judged that 'one can simply state that drugs
are more or less dangerous,' cannabis and its derivatives
(marijuana, hash, hash oil) being classified among the least
dangerous.&nbsp; By a close vote (9 out of 17), a majority
favorable to the decriminalization of the use and possession of
small amounts of quantities emerged.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Le Monde</i> reports that there are varying estimates of how
many French citizens consume marijuana.&nbsp; The government
estimates 1 to 3 million users, while Sofres estimates a range of
4 to 5 million marijuana consumers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members supporting marijuana decriminalization purposed: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana prior to the age of
    16. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Prohibiting the consumption of marijuana in public places. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strengthening the laws against driving while intoxicated on
    marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Creating misdemeanor laws dealing with individuals under the
    influence of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -Strictly banning the use of marijuana by public safety
    professionals (e.g.: flight controllers, high speed train
    operators, airline pilots, etc...) 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The nine members of the commission that favor changing the laws
went on to further state &quot;<b><u>If there is no deterioration
in the situation over the next two years, one could then envisage true,
regulated commerce under strict control of the State</u></b>,&quot;

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>European Parliament
Commission Favors Legalization of Cannabis</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recognizing the success of the Dutch policy of separating
marijuana from hard drugs, The European Parliamentary Commission
on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs voted Monday for &quot;cannabis
decriminalization.&quot;&nbsp; The full European Parliament is
expected to vote on this recommendation later in February.&nbsp;
Usually the parliament follows the recommendation of the relevant
commissions, but the United States is expected to bring maximum
pressure to prevent the replication of the Dutch success in
separating cannabis from hard drugs. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Drug Czar and Partnership For
A Drug-Free (sic) America<br>
Hold a Closed -- by Invitation Only -- &quot;Briefing&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Washington -- At the last minute, it was decided that a
&quot;briefing&quot; held this afternoon at the Old Executive
Office Building adjacent to the White House by Drug Czar Lee
Brown and James Burke, Chairman of the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America and the former CEO of pharmaceutical giant
Johnson and Johnson, was &quot;by invitation only.&quot;&nbsp;
This may have been done because of embarrassing questions having
been asked at their New York press conference on January
16.&nbsp; Consequently, the media were excluded from the
Washington version.&nbsp; This is unusual in Washington, where
media attendance at such &quot;briefings&quot; is generally
encouraged. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the New York meeting the Partnership announced a series of new
radio and television and print ads which American media are now
running as a part of their support for the continuing arrest of
millions of Americans for using marijuana.&nbsp; That briefing,
like the ads, warned about the horrifying dangers of the
marijuana crisis now sweeping America and causing terror in our
streets, the main drug concern of both the White House and the
Partnership.&nbsp; The purpose of the briefings -- and the
apparent reason for their being by invitation only -- seems to be
the growing panic among prohibitionists about being asked
critical questions.&nbsp; The media have so seldom been critical of
any claims about marijuana made by the Partnership or the Drug
Czar's office that the prohibitionists have not yet developed a
strategy for answering them.&nbsp; Under the circumstances, it may
have been decided not to risk having anyone present who might
disrupt the meeting by asking questions. </p>

<p>(Please do not call either the Drug Czar's office at
202-395-6618 or especially the Partnership at 212-922-1560 and
ask them any questions.&nbsp; That sort of thing just upsets

Helicopter Marijuana Searches</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On February 1 the Associated Press reported that Maine
Governor Angus King is discontinuing helicopter flights searching
for marijuana growing in rural areas of Maine.&nbsp; Governor King
said the flights were &quot;too expensive for the return.&nbsp; I
think it's intrusive.&quot;&nbsp; The Maine Civil Liberties
Union, which has represented four Maine families who objected to
the invasion of their privacy by flights -- in which no marijuana
was found -- hailed the Governor's action. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The AP story reporting the Governor's action quoted an anonymous
undercover agent as saying that an anonymous &quot;marijuana
trafficker&quot; had told him that anonymous &quot;local growers
had increased their yield substantially in 1994 in response to a
cessation in flights.&quot;&nbsp; Presumably the AP was unable to
find any anonymous supporters of privacy rights to quote
anonymous victims of the overflights. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML has published a special report on the role of the National
Guard in domestic marijuana eradication including the extensive
use of helicopters in both urban and rural areas. </p>

<p>(For copies of this NORML Report contact Allen St. Pierre at
NORML -- 202-483-5500.&nbsp; For more information on Governor
King's decision to cancel helicopter overflights for marijuana cultivation

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>The Vancouver Sun Times</i> reported in a January 21 story
that Vince Cain, the chief coroner of British Columbia, said that
&quot;the so-called war on drugs which is conducted by the
criminal justice system can only be regarded as an expensive
failure.&quot;&nbsp; Cain went on to say that &quot;Police officers
have told me they're wasting their time on this social
issue.&quot;&nbsp; These comments came in a report entitled <i>Illicit
Narcotic Overdose Deaths in B.C.</i> published by the British
Columbia provincial government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, Cain used the
report to urge that the provincial Attorney General consider
legalizing the sale of marijuana.&nbsp; The report was discussed further
Tuesday at a meeting of provincial and federal law enforcement
officials.&nbsp; A senior Royal Canadian Mounted Police rejected
the report saying, &quot;we want a drug free society.&quot;&nbsp;
He then went on to say that the vast majority of Canadians have
used alcohol and tobacco. </p>

&quot;Hemp Fiber Crop Task Force&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kentucky Governor Brereton Jones, reversing his previous
position on hemp cultivation, has created a special task force to
study the restoration of what once was one of Kentucky's most important
legal crops.&nbsp; (Illegal marijuana is currently the most
valuable cash crop in Kentucky.)&nbsp; In the late 19th century,
Kentucky produced more than 90% of the nation's hemp, which is
also the marijuana plant.&nbsp; This action has long been urged
by former NORML Board member and Kentucky Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is possible to grow varieties of hemp that have virtually no
psychoactive ingredients.&nbsp; It is generally recognized as one
of the most versatile agricultural plants, and it is cultivated
for non-drug purposes in China and most of Europe.&nbsp; There is
a strong demand for hemp fiber for clothing in America, but The
Drug Enforcement Administration opposes its cultivation in the
United States because it would send the wrong message: that
American farmers have been kept from growing an agricultural
staple as part of the propaganda campaign for marijuana
prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">January 26, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Dutch Justice Minister Wants
to &quot;Regulate&quot; Marijuana Supply</b></font> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a January 21 interview with the Dutch newspaper <i>De
Volkskrant</i> (The People's Newspaper) published in The Hague,
the capital of The Netherlands, the Dutch Minister of Justice, Mrs.
Winnie Sorgdrager, said she wants to &quot;regulate the supply of
cannabis products&quot; being sold in more than 1,300 coffeeshops
around the country. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article explained that Sorgdrager is following her party's
opinion &quot;that the current policy allowing retail sale of
marijuana and hashish has to have its <u>logical sequel in
arranging the supply of the products...&quot;</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dutch policy is that &quot;the sale of cannabis products at
the 'frontdoor' of the coffeeshops is tolerated by the Justice
ministry but the supply at the 'back door', or even more, large
scale production, are strictly prohibited.&nbsp; Criminals have
therefore taken over that part of the market.&quot;&nbsp; Sorgdrager
said that she believes that &quot;we have to dispose of this
hypocrisy about that back and front door.&quot;&nbsp; She is
working with her colleagues in the Health Ministry on a Drug
Report to be issued this summer. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Most of the hashish sold is still imported (smuggled in), but
most of the marijuana is now grown in the Netherlands.&nbsp; The
smuggling is especially dominated by violence-prone gangs from
North Africa and Lebanon.&nbsp; The article goes on to explain
that &quot;Sorgdrager is seriously considering a division and
regulation of the cannabis market....&quot; separating the
domestic cannabis from imported hashish smuggled in by criminals
from abroad.&nbsp; The objective is to create a means of
supplying the Dutch market while preventing exports. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch have followed the current policy for many years, so
if there were any serious social or individual health problems
associated with cannabis use, it would have become obvious by now.&nbsp;
It is also worth noting that, until recently, most of the
cannabis consumed was imported hashish which is much more potent
than most marijuana.&nbsp; This means that the &quot;new potent marijuana&quot;
line pushed by the DEA has no relevance to the Dutch experience
or to the supposed threat posed to America by the average
marijuana consumed today which -- according to the U.S. National
Institute on Drug Abuse -- is between 3 and 4%, far below the
average for hashish. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The article also explained that Sorgdrager does not want to
use the terms &quot;liberalization&quot; or &quot;legalization&quot;
but prefers to use the term &quot;regulation.&quot;&nbsp; The
Dutch have long been pressured by France, Belgium and the United
States to arrest marijuana users, but the Germans, Swiss and others
in Europe are moving toward the Dutch model.&nbsp; The Dutch
policy generally is to try to reduce the level of violence in
their country, which nationwide has about half as many murders as does
Washington, D.C., alone.&nbsp; Amsterdam is slightly larger than
Washington, but has less than one tenth the number of murders. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On January 12th, NORML carried an exclusive report on the
protests by the Dutch government to the United States concerning
misrepresentations by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
regarding Dutch drug policies and their social
consequences.&nbsp; The DEA has not yet responded.&nbsp; The
statement by the Dutch Justice Minister has also been ignored by
the American media, while <i><u>The Wall Street Journal</u></i>
ran an editorial today entitled &quot;Eighth Grade
Potheads.&quot;&nbsp; If the editorial's hysteria was well
founded The Netherlands should resemble the United States, Bosnia,
or some other violence ridden society and should have a very high
rate of marijuana use and hard drug addiction.&nbsp; <u>Just the
opposite is the case.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While American prohibitionists commonly claim that &quot;the
Dutch legalized drugs and it did not work,&quot; in fact all
drugs remain illegal in The Netherlands.&nbsp; As is the case in
the U.S., most Dutch &quot;drug related&quot; violence is the
result of prohibition, not of the drugs themselves -- except for
alcohol -- again as in the U.S.&nbsp; While it is Dutch policy to
tolerate the small scale sale and possession of cannabis, -- and
no one is arrested for the possession of personal amounts of any
other drug -- the sale of hard drugs is vigorously
prosecuted.&nbsp; Any &quot;cannabis coffeeshop&quot; which is
suspected of selling hard drugs is closed immediately.&nbsp; <u>One
of the primary objectives of the &quot;coffeeshop&quot; policy is
to separate cannabis from the hard drugs.</u> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This policy has been very successful, hence the DEA opposition
to it. Maintaining the connection between marijuana and hard
drugs is a vital component of U.S. drug policy.&nbsp; This is the basis
for the claims that marijuana is a &quot;stepping stone&quot;,
&quot;threshold&quot;, &quot;gateway&quot; to using other drugs.&nbsp;
The success of Dutch policy demonstrates that this is just the
opposite of the truth, so the Dutch policy must be misrepresented
until they can be pressured into merging the drug markets through
blanket prohibition as has been done in the U.S. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In fact, very few marijuana users in America ever become hard
drug users, but the ratio is even lower in The Netherlands.&nbsp;
Ironically, <u>marijuana use by Dutch teenagers is much lower
than in the U.S.&nbsp; Over 30% of U.S. high school seniors have
used marijuana in the last year, while only 12% of Dutch 18 year
olds have ever used cannabis</u>.&nbsp; It is Dutch policy to
strongly discourage teenage cannabis use through honest drug
education that is credible and effective -- because it does not exaggerate
in order to frighten politicians, editorialists and other
impressionable subgroups. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, announced today
that NORML will begin a program to encourage American opinion
leaders -- and ordinary citizens -- to visit The Netherlands to
see for themselves the success of Dutch cannabis policy.&nbsp;
&quot;When Americans ask what would happen if we legalized
marijuana, they don't have to use their imaginations to find
out.&nbsp; They can just use their passports.&nbsp; Americans
certainly don't need to go to Holland to get marijuana, but they
should go to Holland to be reminded of what we all used to know:
FREEDOM WORKS.&quot; </p>

policy, the &quot;gateway&quot; theory, and surveys on American
and Dutch teenage drug use, contact Allen St. Pierre at NORML 202-483-5300). </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">December 25, <i>The Buffalo News</i> reported, &quot;Troubled
with three long-term sentences he felt forced to make in recent
weeks, U.S. District Judge, John T. Curtin says he will stop
hearing drug cases in the coming year rather than continue to be
part of a system of punishment that 'just isn't working.' <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Curtin, citing restrictive sentencing guidelines in federal drug
cases, told The Buffalo News he will join a boycott that was
begun last year by some other judges.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>Judge Curtin also told </u><i><u>The Buffalo News</u></i><u>
that, &quot;He ... feels Congress should take a close look at the

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since May 1993, an estimated 50 senior federal judges (out of 849
federal judges) have begun a boycott of drug cases.&nbsp;
&quot;Boycotting&quot; judges have cited excessive punishment via
mandatory minimum and guideline sentencing as their reasons for
declining to hear drug cases. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Curtin told <i>The Buffalo News</i> that the bigger issue is that
today's anti-drug program isn't working.&nbsp; He said he would
rather see the federal government spend more money on education, counseling,

in prison. <br>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 11, Atlanta, Georgia, In the tradition of Live Aid and

HEMP AID - a Benefit for the Re-legalization of Marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">James Bell (Founder of Georgia NORML) and Theresa Yarbrough,
current Director of GA NORML, hope that the First Annual event
will not only raise consciousness of the impact that marijuana
prohibition has on the lives of millions of Americans, but that
it will also raise much needed cash which will be used to fight
legal battles and help to secure the freedom of marijuana prisoners. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bell knows the impact of the marijuana laws.&nbsp; He's presently
finishing a two year sentence in a Georgia Prison Work Camp (for
the sale of few ounces of marijuana). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Yarbrough learned the peculiar and excessive effects of marijuana
prohibition when she was arrested in 1993 for possession of one
pound of marijuana in her home.&nbsp; Later convicted, she was sentenced
to ten years probation and banished from residing in GA's
District 31 -- <u>removed from her community for possessing
marijuana</u>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both activists have been instrumental in organizing some of the
largest pro-hemp events.&nbsp; The two organizers want it to be
known that 1.) HEMP AID is not intended to be a 'Let's smoke pot event'

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: And then we would save an enormous amount of

When I did the <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>, every guard I talked

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is just like any other thing that might not be good for

like cocaine or heroin or downs or ups or LSD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: Is this an admission that you still smoke pot --

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Robbins</b>: I take the Fifth.&nbsp; Considering the fact that
it's still illegal ... put it this way: Considering the fact that
I've used it in the past, and know what it is, and seen the
results of it, I don't view it as a dangerous drug.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But I don't want to advocate anything like [smoking pot] in
print, because it's a different thing for different people.... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: So what would you say if your kids came to you

And I'd tell them exactly what each drug does to you. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Playboy</b>: You realize that, having admitted these things

Netherlands.&nbsp; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hans van Mierlo
criticized the United States Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) for misrepresenting the commitment of the Dutch government
to enforce drug law violations, for misrepresenting the
prevalence of cocaine consumed by the citizens of the city of
Rotterdam, and for generally misrepresenting Dutch drug policy. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the request of a Member of
the Dutch Parliament, Minister van Mierlo responded to a recently
released DEA briefing paper entitled, &quot;<u>How to Hold Your
Own in a Drug Legalization Debate</u>&quot; [NORML Weekly News
Release, 11/3/94): The entire letter follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;The Minister will point out to
    the American Authorities that Dutch drug policy is falsely
    represented in a manual of the American Drug Battle Agency
    [DEA --ed.].&nbsp; The manual mentions that the police in the Netherlands
    are instructed not to take action against the street trade of any
    drug.&nbsp; That is not true. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In many municipalities in
    the Netherlands, the policing and prosecution of street
    traders of drugs is a high priority.&nbsp; Special cell space
    is reserved for that purpose. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Furthermore, according to
    the DEA manual, a study of the entire Rotterdam population of
    individuals fifteen years and older showed that 3.3% of this
    population uses cocaine.&nbsp; What the research showed was that
    3.3% of the entire population of Rotterdam between fifteen to nineteen
    years old mentioned that they had used cocaine [emphasis added
    - ed.].&nbsp; It is totally irresponsible to state that all
    of these people are cocaine users and ridiculous to relate
    the figures to the total Rotterdam population. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Further, data in the manual
    is not all wrong, but stripped of their context and therefore
    easily misinterpreted. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The mistakes made will be
    discussed with the American Authorities by the Minister of
    Foreign Affairs.&quot; </font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Richard Cowan, NORML National
Director, said that &quot;NORML is proud to have brought this
matter to the attention of the Dutch government.&nbsp; The
Netherlands is one of America's oldest allies.&nbsp; John Paul
Jones refitted his ships with Dutch supplies, including hemp rope
and sails, during the American Revolution and wrote movingly of the
kindness of the Dutch people.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML believes that the DEA lies
about Dutch drug policy to create the impression that Dutch
tolerance of marijuana sales is a failure.&nbsp; In fact it is a
great success.&nbsp; If Americans want to see how freedom works,
they should visit the Netherlands.</font> </p>

Lose Your License&quot; Law<br>
Found To Be Unconstitutional</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On November 29, 1994, in an
important court test of a classic unfunded federal mandate,
Medina County Municipal Court Judge Dale H. Chase ruled that
Ohio's mandated suspension of an individual's driver's license
for minor possession of marijuana is unconstitutional. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An excerpt from Judge Chase's
two-page decision follows: </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"></font><p><font
    face="Arial, Helvetica">&quot;...suspension/revocation of the
    driver's license of an individual convicted of possession of
    drug paraphernalia is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment
    to the Constitution of the United States on the basis that
    there is no 'rational relationship' between a license suspension
    for violating a drug law and the Ohio statutes dealing with legal
    operation of motor vehicles. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision to suspend a
    driver's license for a violation of certain statutes which
    are not related to operation of vehicles would be no different
    than a decision to suspend an individual's vendor's license
    or other license issued by the state to conduct activities
    within the State of Ohio, to the extent that the licensing
    statute is not rationally related to the criminal statute
    involved. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Accordingly, the Court
    finds... mandating license suspension for certain offenses,
    is unconstitutional.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For two-and-a-half years Abrams
has struggled to get marijuana for an FDA approved study to test
whether smoking marijuana can stimulate the appetite and body weight
of people who are wasting because of AIDS.&nbsp; He has gone
through three medical committees and two regulatory agencies,
found a foreign supplier of marijuana and solicited help from the
Dutch government.&nbsp; But he and the Community Consortium on

states that ,&quot;Dr. Philip Lee, Assistant Secretary for Health [and

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 11,1995, will mark
the 50th anniversary of the public release of </b><em><b>The Marihuana
Problem in the City of New York: Sociological, Medical, Psychological
and Pharmacological Studies</b></em><b> (&quot;The LaGuardia
Report&quot;).</b>&nbsp; The study was commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia in 1938 in order to discover the truth about
marijuana, which had been hastily prohibited a year earlier. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study was completed in 1944,
published by Jaques Cattell Press (Lancaster, PA), and released
to the public in early 1945.&nbsp; <b>&quot;Its findings revealed
that marijuana's harmful effects had been greatly
exaggerated,&quot; explained NORML National Director Richard
Cowan.&nbsp; &quot;The report's conclusions demonstrate that the
War Against Marijuana Consumers has been a fraud from its
beginning.&quot;</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The massive research project was
carried out by a team of scientists from the New York Academy of
Medicine and the commissioners of the New York Departments of Correction,
Health, and Hospitals.&nbsp; It was the most thorough, extensive
marijuana fact-finding mission since the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission released its monumental report in 1894. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report was
comprised of a series of studies -- from sociological observations
to controlled, scientific studies involving the consumption of
marijuana by subjects in a laboratory setting.&nbsp; <b>Among the
report's conclusions:</b> </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Mental Illness --</b>
        &quot;Indulgence in marihuana does not appear to result
        in mental deterioration.&nbsp; ... Marihuana does not
        change the basic personality structure of the
        individual.&nbsp; It lessens inhibition and this brings
        out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions but it
        does not evoke responses which would otherwise be totally
        alien to him.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Violence --</b>
        &quot;There was no aggressive or violent behavior
        observed.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Crime --</b>
        &quot;Marihuana is not the determining factor in the
        commission of major crimes.&nbsp; Juvenile delinquency is
        not associated with the practice of smoking marihuana.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Addiction --</b>
        &quot;The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Gateway to Hard Drugs --</b>
        &quot;We have been unable to confirm ... that marihuana smoking
        is the first step in the use of such drugs as cocaine,
        morphine, and heroin.&nbsp; The instances are extremely
        rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
        with addiction to these other narcotics.&quot; </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the report stressed,
&quot;The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana
smoking in New York City is unfounded.&quot;&nbsp; The depth and
thoroughness of the study make these conclusions relevant beyond
1940s New York. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report provided
invaluable descriptive data and dispelled many of the myths which
led to the prohibition of marijuana.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
essentially ignored and had virtually no effect on the burgeoning
national policy of prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The January 12,1945, <i>New York
Times</i> article &quot;Experts Discount Marijuana as Big Factor
In Crime but Drive on It Will Be Pressed&quot; reassured a
frightened public that marijuana would remain outlawed.&nbsp;
Every large-scale study done over the last century has arrived at
the same conclusion; all have been ignored. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of course, prohibitionists have
played an active part in making sure that the reports are
ignored.&nbsp; Today they claim that marijuana is now so much
stronger than it was in the past that it is virtually a different
drug, rendering all previous conclusions useless.&nbsp; For
example, the December 26 <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> blamed
a rap album for promoting marijuana &quot;20 times stronger than
grass of the past&quot; (&quot;Kids and Marijuana: The Glamour is
Back,&quot; p. 12).&nbsp; In actuality, potency has not
substantially increased over the past 20 years.&nbsp; (A report
on marijuana potency is available from NORML.) </font></p>

SPECIAL REPORT</p>

<p align="center">December 16, 1994 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Conservative Columnist
William F. Buckley, Jr.,<br>
Writes of His Sister's Cancer Chemotherapy<br>
and Her Need for Medical Marijuana</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In his syndicated column distributed on December 16, William
F. Buckley, Jr., the conservative author and talk show host,
writes about his younger sister's cancer and her need for medical
access to marijuana &quot;because she is undergoing an agonizing
jolt of chemotherapy.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">To the question, &quot;How does she know cannabis would help
her?&quot; Buckley responds - &quot;Dumb question.&nbsp; A) She
knows, or knows of, people who have had relief from the
wretchedness she suffers from, from a puff or two of marijuana;
and B) so what if it did not work?&nbsp; ... What are we afraid
of, that while recovering from cancer and taking a marijuana
cigarette she will become a crack addict?&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">One of the persons she knows who has written about his use of
cannabis for chemotherapy is Richard Brookhiser, a senior editor
of Buckley's <em>National Review</em> magazine.&nbsp; As Buckley
notes, Brookhiser found that it takes only a one or two puffs on
a marijuana cigarette to stop immediately -- the nausea of
chemotherapy.&nbsp; It usually works, but if it does not, there
are no side effects.&nbsp; In contrast, the very expensive
anti-nausea pharmaceutical Zofran causes headaches in as many as 40%
of those who use it and can cause liver damage, etc. Yet the
narcocracy cites Zofran as the reason that there is no need for
medical marijuana.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Buckley also writes of his frustration in not knowing where to
buy marijuana himself in New York City ... where it is almost
ubiquitous.&nbsp; This reflects one of the sad ironies of people
in his situation: <u>the older a person is, the harder it is to
find marijuana</u>.&nbsp; The prohibition that is justified on the
grounds that it protects children actually makes it most
difficult for adults, and especially for the ill, to find
marijuana when they need it most.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">In any other context it might be amusing to think of someone as
recognizable as Buckley lurking around Washington Square trying
to &quot;score&quot; a few dollars worth of pot.&nbsp; He makes
light of this problem, but it really is not feasible for someone
in his position to do what he otherwise would do.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">One assumes that at least after this column is published - the
Buckleys will eventually get marijuana, but what of the hundreds
of thousands of others? He laments that &quot;thinking on the subject
is so far gone in putrefaction that the simplest questions go
unanswered.&quot; Actually, most of the putrefaction starts here
in Washington.&nbsp; Surveys show that the overwhelming majority
of the American people are in favor of medical access to
marijuana.&nbsp; Newt, please note.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Buckley concludes his column by reporting that researchers in San
Francisco have been ready for two years to do a study of the use
of marijuana &quot;in treating the wasting syndrome associated with
AIDS, but they cannot obtain the necessary marijuana from the
government.&quot; Buckley asks, &quot;If somebody discovered that
marijuana would *cure* AIDS, would the narcs still prowl the
street for vendors?&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Yes.&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; NORML's experience suggests that the
narcs would redouble their efforts.&nbsp; They know that the
survival of the narcocracy depends on the suppression of medical
marijuana.&nbsp; This is no petty crime that the narcs are
covering up ... as anyone who has endured chemotherapy, or AIDS,
or so much other suffering, would tell us, if they did not have
to live and often die in fear.<br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Drug Enforcement
Administration Continues to Block Study on<br>
Use of Marijuana to Alleviate Symptoms of AIDS</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">When the Clinton administration bowed to DEA pressure against
making marijuana medically available, it promised to allow
privately funded research, but it continues to block an FDA-approved
protocol study on the effect of marijuana on the AIDS Wasting
Syndrome by Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Dr. Abrams has been seeking approval for his research for <strong>two
and a half years</strong>.&nbsp; The FDA has already approved Dr.
Abrams' research.&nbsp; The protocol has been supported by the
Physicians Association for AIDS Research, the nation's oldest and
largest association of physicians interested in AIDS treatment
and research, and by the Federation of American Scientists.&nbsp;
The only legal supply of marijuana for the study is from the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).&nbsp; NIDA has the
marijuana in stock and has no other compelling requests for its
use.&nbsp; NIDA has supplied marijuana to every FDA-approved
protocol for several decades, yet it has delayed Dr. Abrams' study

<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">A December 9 meeting that was to decide whether the U.S.
government would permit or prohibit the study was postponed by

<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">At issue are scientific freedom and compassion for patients.
Support for Dr. Abrams' protocol is not necessarily support for
the medical use of marijuana, it is simply support for the
resolution of this controversy through science rather than
ideology.&nbsp; Similarly, the medical use of marijuana is not equivalent
to marijuana legalization.&nbsp; Thousands of AIDS patients are
already risking arrest to use marijuana illegally for the wasting
syndrome.&nbsp; The medical use of marijuana has been rejected by the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) claiming there is not
enough research, yet now it is trying to kill research.&nbsp;

<p align="center">December 9, 1994 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Vermont's Largest City
Supports Medical Marijuana</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">October 24, The City of Burlington, like numerous other
municipalities and states [Note: 36 states, including Vermont,
have passed resolutions in support of medical marijuana], passed
a resolution stating, in part: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Significant scientific and medical studies have
        demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical
        supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural
        form, has important therapeutic actions that are often of
        critical medical importance to persons afflicted with a variety
        of life and sense-threatening illnesses; </li>
    <li>Courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in
        treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of
        &quot;necessity&quot; in the treatment of glaucoma,
        cancer, AIDS, and multiple sclerosis, and conditions of
        permanent pain and/or paralysis; </li>
    <li>The people of the State of Vermont believe that well
        trained medical professionals should be responsible for
        determining a patient's routine of medical care, and; </li>
    <li><u>Seriously ill Vermonters and other Americans are
        suffering unnecessarily </u><em><u>because of federal policies</u></em><u>
        which legally prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use</u> [emphasis
        added]. </li>
</ul>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The resolution resolved, &quot;the Burlington City Council
memorializes the President and the United States Congress to end
federal prohibition against marijuana's legitimate medical use by
creating a rational system of prescriptive medical access to
marijuana.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Senator Bob Kerry
Supports Medical Marijuana --<br>
on the Advice of Willie Nelson</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Oct. 12, <em>The Wayne Stater</em>, student newspaper at Wayne
State College, reports that Sen. Kerry (D-NE) spoke to a group of
students from the Wayne State College NORML chapter and indicated,
&quot;I have no problem with legalizing marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; 
There has only been one other individual who has brought this
topic to my attention.&nbsp;  That was [entertainer] Willie Nelson, and
it seems to work for him.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: Sen. Kerry easily won re-election despite his opponent
trying to link his statements concerning medical marijuana to
drag use in general.&nbsp;  Kerry's opponent, republican Jan Storey even
went so far as to say that Kerry's support for medical marijuana
was an &quot;implicit endorsement&quot; of drug use.&nbsp;  For more
information on the encounter with Sen. Kerry at Wayne State College,

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Traverse City (MI) Seeks
Resolution From State<br>
in Its Ability to Decriminalize Marijuana</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">December 6, <em>The Record Eagle</em> reported: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>City Commissioners will ask the state Legislature to make
    it legal for cities to decriminalize the use of small amounts<br>
    of marijuana. </p>
    <p>Commissioners passed a resolution... addressing the issue
    of William Bustance, president of the Traverse City chapter of 
    the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. </p>
    <p>In the summer, Bustance and other members of NORML had
    circulated petitions asking the commission to put the
    question of decriminalizing the use of less than an ounce of
    marijuana to a public vote. </p>
    <p>On advice of city attorney W. Peter Doren, commissioners
    took no action on the petitions, even though enough signatures had
    been collected to place the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot. </p>
    <p>Doren advised commissioners that it would be illegal for
    them to enact a law contrary to state law. State law prohibits
    cities from decriminalizing controlled substances, including
    marijuana. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">This legal quandary led the Traverse City to pass a resolution
stating in part: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A Resolution Memorializing The Governor And The
    Legislature Of 
    The State Of Michigan To Remedy State Policies In which
    Inhibit And Prevent Local Governments In Creating Ordinances
    That Make Small Amounts Of Marijuana A Civil Infraction </p>
    <p>[The bill which prohibits cities from invoking Home Rule
    privileges regarding controlled substances] ... <em>has
    created a
    inequity in the Home Rule Act by allowing the City of Ann
    Arbor
    to keep in their charter a civil infraction law for small
    amounts of marijuana and by not permitting the citizens of
    Traverse City the opportunity to place a similar ordinance on
    the ballot before the voters</em> [emphasis added]. </p>
    <p>[Ibid.] ... has created the threat and expense of
    litigation to
    the City of Traverse City ... </p>
    <p><em>The National Drug Control Strategy calls for the
    empowerment of
    communities however, the very spirit of the community is
    threatened by the [prohibiting state law], that denied ballot
    access to a Certified Initiatory Petition in Traverse City</em> 
    [emphasis added]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The Commission resolved to &quot;memorialize the State of
Michigan and it's officials ... to investigate and hold public

Marijuana Decrim Law Undone;<br>
&quot;Smoke A Joint, Lose Your License&quot; Takes Effect</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">December 1, California's 18-year-old marijuana
decriminalization era ended today, as Gov. Wilson's new
&quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law took effect.&nbsp; 
Under the old law, possession of marijuana was punishable by a
maximum $100 fine, which was often paid like a traffic ticket.&nbsp;  The
new law requires a mandatory six-month license suspension for any
drug offense, regardless of whether the offense has any relation
to driving.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">California NORML denounced the new law as a costly attack on
California's marijuana decriminalization law, which has saved the
state an estimated $1 billion in court and enforcement costs.&nbsp; 
State officials admit that they made no attempt to figure the
costs of the new law, which is expected to send thousands of
minor marijuana offenders back into court to defend their
privilege to drive.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Apologists have tried to pretend that the new law was needed to
comply with federal law, under which the state would lose $54
million in highway aid if it failed to enact &quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose
Your License.&quot;&nbsp;  In fact, the law specifically allows states
to opt-out of the license suspension requirement and still
receive full highway funding by a joint resolution of the
Governor and legislature.&nbsp;  Every state west of Texas has passed an &quot;opt-out&quot;
resolution.&nbsp;  However, Gov. Wilson vetoed an opt-out that was
passed unanimously by the legislature two years ago.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The new law comes in the face of two new driving safety studies
by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration,
both of which found that marijuana is markedly less hazardous
than alcohol.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Under the new law, drivers face a longer license suspension for
having pot in their home than for speeding with an open liquor
bottle in their car.<br>

marijuana decriminalization law, contact California NORML

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">Australian government officials have convened a task force to

attending the meeting announced the creation of the Ministerial Council
on Drug Strategy (MCDS).<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">According to MCDS's draft resolution, the council will examine
the therapeutic uses of whole smoked cannabis and commission a
study of the social impact of various actual and potential legislative
responses to cannabis and its many uses.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The MCDS media release noted that the impetus for reviewing
Australia's cannabis laws was that recent public opinion polls
indicate Australians do not widely support the blanket
prohibition of cannabis.&nbsp;  Federal Justice Minister Duncan Kerr
said the report will make a significant contribution to the
debate on cannabis in Australia.&nbsp;  &quot;The report shows that 75%
of people surveyed believed the use or possession of small
quantities of cannabis should not be a criminal offense and over
50% of those surveyed felt that such activities should be
legal.&quot;<br>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported on November 22

variety of marijuana known as 'skunk' was being grown in Australia
and had the potential to cause 'intense paranoia' in users.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="25">The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) claimed in

But he said that, as President of Bolivia, he cannot afford to
defend that position because the decision on whether to legalize
drugs must be made in the consuming countries. </p>

Into Creating a Legal Hemp Industry</strong></font></p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">A November 24 story in <em>The Lexington Herald-Leader</em>
reported that Kentucky farmers are looking for a crop to supplant
burley (tobacco), so the state is looking to the past to find
one: cannabis sativa... hemp.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's the same plant some still grow in Kentucky, but
    illegally: Marijuana.</p>
    <p>Governor Brereton Jones yesterday set up a task force to
    study whether a drug-free strain of hemp can again be a
    viable crop in Kentucky.&nbsp;  Fibers from the plant stalk could be
    used in paper and fabric production, he said.</p>
    <p>He said: &quot;If there are crops which can be grown
    legally for a profit in Kentucky, which we currently are not
    growing, then we as public officials have a duty to examine
    these crops and provide answers for the farmers of
    Kentucky.&quot;</p>
    <p>The 17-member task force will study potential markets and
    legal barriers, Jones said in a news conference.</p>
    <p>When the task force makes its recommendations by October
    30, 1995, &quot;we will know whether Kentucky can produce a
    drug-free hemp.&quot;</p>
    <p>Jones took a preemptive strike at potential critics,
    chastising those who might misrepresent his intentions.&nbsp;  While
    he supports the idea of legalizing hemp production, &quot;I am
    opposed to the legalization of marijuana,&quot; he said.</p>
    <p>Gatewood Gaibraith, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate
    who has advocated legalizing marijuana and resurrecting the
    state's hemp industry, was not named to the task force.</p>
    <p>Jones said including him would have made the task force a
    &quot;political<br>
    committee.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="25">[Note: Prior to federal Marijuana Prohibition in 1937,
Kentucky was the leading producer of hemp in the United States.
There were no related social problems reported during the state's 200-year
period of hemp cultivation.] </p>
