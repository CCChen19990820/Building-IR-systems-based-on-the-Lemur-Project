<P><B><I>1. &quot;Returns associated with cash, cash equivalents, and substitute
assets held in the portfolio must be included in the presentation.&quot;
(Section XI. A.4.) Does this require a separate presentation for these
assets? </I></B></P>

<P>No. Cash and cash equivalents and substitute assets (e.g., seller financing,
etc.) must be combined with real estate assets and performance returns
must be computed and presented on a consolidated basis. The disclosure
that accompanies the presentation must affirm that the returns include
interest income from short-term cash investments and other related investments.</P>

<P><B><I>2. Clients commit a certain amount of assets for management, but
not all the assets are available for investment at the onset of the relationship.
Can the manager assume a certain rate of interest on the cash not yet received,
based on the fact that the client is earning interest on that cash?</I></B></P>

<P>It is not permissible under the Standards to assume a certain cash rate
of return for assets committed to but not yet received by the manager.
Under a GIC arrangement, for example, the rate of return guaranteed to
the client is based upon the full amount of assets to be committed. The
client might commit to investing $100 million, and the manager makes a
forward commitment for the full $100 million, even if the client has only
put up $20 million at that point. As the money comes in, it goes to cash.
In this instance, the manager cannot add an assumed interest rate to the
cash balance outstanding. The manager could disclose that returns might
be conservative because the manager engages in forward contracts to protect
the client from price volatility, and does not earn interest on the full
cash amount until received.</P>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>3. AIMR requires the use of a time-weighted, total rate of return
calculation and provides in Appendix A of the 1993 AIMR PPS handbook three
calculation methods, along with formulas for calculating gross-of-fee versus
net-of-fee performance. Are these the required formulas or is there flexibility
in determining a preferred method? </I></B></P>

<P>Appendix A details alternative performance calculations for portfolios
and composites. The intent is not to require revision of existing performance
calculations or associated computer software that conforms to the concepts
of quarterly, time-weighted total returns. Rather, for those who desire
a single guideline, widely used definition, formulas, and methodologies
are included for each area of consideration. The important criteria to
follow is to establish a consistent calculation methodology that incorporates
the time-weighted, total rate of retrun components.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>4. The Standards seem to indicate that a manager should not annualize
standard deviations calculated over shorter time periods. Why is this?
</I></B></P>

<P>The Standards recommend (rather than require) two different standard
deviation measures to accompany the presentation of investment returns.
One is the standard deviation of portfolio returns from the composite average,
i.e., across portfolio returns for a given year. The second risk measure
is the standard deviation of returns over time, i.e., the volatility of
composite returns from one period to the next. On page 40 of the 1993 PPS,
there is the following statement: Unlike rates of return, standard deviation
and the proposed asset-weighted dispersion measure cannot be annualized.
This statement refers to the standard deviation of portfolio returns from
the composite average for a given period of time. There is a practical
example on page 41 which demonstrates why standard deviation cannot be
meaningfully annualized when it is used as an internal measure of risk,
i.e., the risk of individual portfolios returns not achieving the composite
average.</P>

<P>The second type of standard deviation measures the volatility of composite
returns across time. For example, you might calculate the standard deviation
of quarterly returns of a composite. This type of standard deviation can
be annualized as long as the numbers are reasonably random, normally distributed,
and there is a sufficient number of data points. The annualized standard
deviation in this case would be the quarterly standard deviation multiplied
by the square root of four. If monthly returns are used, the monthly standard
deviation would be multiplied by the square root of twelve. </P>

<P>If monthly or quarterly returns are not random (i.e., the returns are
trending or reverting to the mean), the annualized standard deviation may
differ depending on whether monthly or quarterly returns are used. You
may wish to refer to the Mark Kritzman article, What Practitioners Need
to Know . . .About Serial Dependence, in the March-April 1994 issue of
the Financial Analysts Journal, for further discussion.</P>

<P><B><I>5. When a mutual fund is added to a composite of individually
managed accounts because the investment strategy is the same for both the
mutual fund and for the individually managed accounts, can the performance
of the mutual fund be adjusted to show gross-of-management-fee performance?
</I></B></P>

<P>The Securities and Exchange Commission clearly requires that mutual
fund results be presented net of fees and has defined how those net-of-fee
results must be calculated. Compliance with the Standards requires adherence
to all SEC rules and regulations. Therefore, the Standards' recommendation
of gross-of-management fee reporting in one-on-one situations does not
apply to the presentation of mutual fund performance. A mutual fund may
be presented as its own composite or may be included in a composite of
separately managed accounts that represents the same investment strategy
as the mutual fund but the mutual fund performance must be presented net
of fees.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>6. According to the Standards, &quot;AIMR prefers that performance
results be presented gross (before deduction) of management fees.&quot;
What is the treatment of custodial fees and is it permissible for custodial
fees to be deducted as cash flow withdrawals for purposes of presenting
performance results? </I></B></P>

<P>Custodial fees are not charged against performance. In the case of a
brokerage firm's annual charges, the treatment of this as a withdrawal
vs. as a charge against performance will depend on whether this annual
fee is in lieu of separately levied transaction<BR>
costs. If this fee is really a commission, then it would be deducted from
performance. If it is a custodial fee, it would not be charged against
performance and should be treated as a cash flow withdrawal.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>7. The SEC staff requires that investment managers present performance
information net of advisory fees, although it is permissible in one-on-one
presentations to present performance results without the deduction of advisory
fees. AIMR recommends calculation of performance results prior to the deduction
of investment management fees unless net-of-fee calculations are required
to meet SEC advertising requirements. Please clarify these two positions.</I></B></P>

<P>AIMR recommends that performance results be presented gross (before
deduction) of management fees, except where this will conflict with the
SEC's position on advertising performance. This is because manager's fees
are usually scaled resulting in performance information that will not be
representative for a portfolio that is much larger or smaller than the
size of the portfolio represented by the average fee. AIMR feels it is
more representative to show results before the deduction of management
fees and to provide a fee schedule that represents the fee that would actually
be paid by the prospective client. The choice of net versus gross is left
to the manager, as long as the manager discloses which method is used and
includes a fee schedule. When net of fee composite results are shown, the
manager must also disclose the weighted average fee. </P>

<P>The SEC staff allows performance information to be presented gross of
management fees in one-on-one presentations accompanied with disclosures
that (i.) the results do not reflect the deduction of investment management
fees, (ii) the client's return will be reduced by the management fees and
any other expenses incurred in the management of its account, (iii) disclosure
of the investment advisory fees are described in Part II of the advisor's
Form ADV. Also accompanying these disclosures must be &quot; a representative
example&quot; which shows the effect an investment advisory fee, compounded
over a period of years, could have on the total value of a client's portfolio.
The SEC staff defines one-on-one presentations as manager performance presentations
to any client, prospective client, consultant or affiliated group entrusted
to consider manager selection and retention. Communications by managers
can, therefore, be made to multiple representations of a given prospect,
even if there are several portfolios within the group. Any written performance
presentation material distributed to more then one client or prospect,
in other than one-on-one presentations, must present performance results
after deduction of management fees and cannot present gross of fee performance
results.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>8. For the reporting of pre-tax total returns of taxable portfolios
that include both tax-exempt and taxable bonds, is it appropriate to gross
up the income on the tax-exempt portion of portfolios as long as the tax
rate assumption is disclosed? </I></B></P>

<P>It is recommended that income on tax-exempt bonds NOT be grossed up
to a pre-tax basis. On page 7, Section V.B.5. of the 1993 PPS, it is recommended
that:</P>

<P>When composites include both taxable and tax-exempt securities, the
manager should state the percentages of each class and, where possible,
present results for each of the portions separately. Therefore, it is recommended
that a total rate of return for the composite be presented without adjustment
for tax-exempt income to a pre-tax basis. In addition, it is recommended
that the manager present the percentages invested in tax-exempt and taxable
securities, with returns (unadjusted) on each segment reported separately.
As supplemental information, the manager could show an after-tax total
rate of return for the composite by applying the federal tax rates to the
taxable portion, rather than grossing up the tax-exempt portion.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>9. AIMR's Performance Presentation Standards Taxable Portfolios
Subcommittee Report states that &quot;gross-of-tax performance is currently
recommended for the presentation of results to prospective clients&quot;,
yet Appendix C International Investments reads &quot;portfolio returns
should be calculated net of withholding taxes on dividends, interest and
capital gains.&quot; Please clarify. </I></B></P>

<P>The case for reporting international results net of withholding taxes
is based on the concept of reporting performance net of transaction costs.
Just as a manager's performance includes his ability to negotiate transaction
costs, internationally a manager's performance is based on his ability
to choose the countries in which to invest based on tax consequences. Basically,
a manager has control (to some degree) over transaction costs for his clients,
just as a manager has control over which countries are represented in a
portfolio. Country selection is part of the performance process and should
include analysis of tax treaties. Specific country tax impact should be
part of the performance process, just as security selection ( net of transaction
costs) is part of the process.</P>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>10. When calculating an annual asset-weighed composite return
linking quarterly results, will the number of portfolios be constant over
the year, i.e., must portfolios be under management for a full year to
be included in the annual return?</I></B></P>

<P>No. Because the standards require linked quarterly returns at a minimum,
the number of portfolios may change from quarter-to-quarter (or month-
to -month), depending on the frequency of valuation. A new portfolio enters
the composite after the first full measurement period (e.g., quarter or
month) or according to consistently and reasonably applied manager guidelines.
For example, some managers may choose to add portfolios after one month
of management, others may choose a quarter, and yet others may choose six
months. The guideline must be consistently applied. Terminated portfolios
are excluded form the composite for partial periods, i.e., they are included
as of the last full measurement period. When disclosing the number of portfolios
included in the composite's annual return, the manager may choose to report
the number of portfolios as of the beginning of the period or as of the
end of the period. The method must be followed consistently for also disclosing
the amount of composite assets and composite assets as a percentage of
firm assets, and must be followed consistently across time periods. </P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>11. Portfolio returns are calculated on a monthly basis, the monthly
returns are linked, and the quarterly portfolio returns are weighted with
portfolio values as of the beginning of the quarter. Must portfolios be
under management for one month or for one quarter to be included in the
quarterly average?</I></B></P>

<P>Inclusion in the composite depends upon the weighting factor. As noted
in the 1993 Performance Presentation Standards (pp.29-30), there are two
ways to calculate quarterly returns. The preferred and more accurate method
is to calculate monthly portfolio returns, and then weight each of the
portfolio returns in the composite by the asset value of the portfolio
as of the beginning of the month (or beginning value plus weighted cash
flows for the month) to get a weighted monthly composite return. These
weighted monthly composite returns are then linked to get the quarterly
composite return. For this method, portfolios could be added after one
full month. Under the second method, you would calculate monthly portfolio
returns, link the monthly portfolio returns to get quarterly returns, and
then calculate the quarter composite return by weighting each of these
quarterly returns by the portfolio's assets as of the beginning-of-the-quarter
(or beginning of quarter plus weighted cash flows). In this case, the portfolio
would have to be under management for at least one full quarter before
being added to the composite. The same rules apply to terminated portfolios.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>12. When must a total return be calculated for portfolios invested
in more than one commingled fund or mutual fund?</I></B></P>

<P>For portfolios that are invested in more than one fund or unit trust,
when the manager has discretion over the percentages of assets invested
in each, i.e., when the manager is running a total return portfolio using
a combination of commingled funds and/or individual securities, a total
return must be calculated and performance included in a total return, multiple-asset
composite. </P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>13. If an investment, portfolio or composite started mid-month
or mid-quarter, how do you present the partial period of return when presenting
quarterly returns? </I></B></P>

<P>Partial period (e.g., partial month or quarter) investment and portfolio
returns may be disclosed as partial period returns provided that the period
covered is clearly noted. Partial period returns may not be extrapolated
to the full period or included in any composite representing the manager's
performance for the entire period. The Standards require that the calculation
of an investment or portfolio return for inclusion in a composite is required
to commence either at the beginning of the first full reporting period
for which the investment or portfolio is under management, or according
to reasonable and consistently applied manager guidelines. Additionally,
performance must be calculated at least quarterly. As an example, applying
these guidelines, if the manager calculates performance quarterly, investment
or portfolios must be under management as of the beginning of the quarter
to be included in the composite. If the manager calculates performance
monthly, the manager may choose to add new investments or portfolios to
the composite after one full month, three full months or longer, as long
as the guidelines for inclusion are consistently applied. It is acceptable
for the inclusion guideline to be longer than the calculation period. </P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>14. How are partial quarter returns incorporated in the presentation
of annual returns? </I></B></P>

<P>Partial year returns may be disclosed as partial year returns provided
that the period covered is clearly noted. The Standards require the geometric
linking of period returns, quarterly at a minimum, to produce annual returns.
However, partial year returns may not be extrapolated to the full year.
Therefore, if a manager has returns for three full quarter and two months,
the manager may only show an 11 month return.</P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>15. When a firm is managing a market neutral strategy using &quot;phantom
cash&quot; how should performance be presented? In this case, the term
phantom cash refers to the aggregate amount of cash that a client might
have with multiple managers, with responsibility for managing the cash
placed with one manager in particular. Let's also assume that the manager
is allowed to leverage the cash position by a multiple of 2.5 times. </I></B></P>

<P>In the Leverage/Derivative Examples section included in the 1993 Performance
Presentation Standards handbook, Example 5 on pages 55-56 presents a simple
case of going long and short securities to produce a market neutral strategy.
The portfolio is not leveraged in a strict economic sense, because the
return may not differ from a portfolio of cash equivalents, assuming that
the long and short securities are reasonably well correlated with each
other and hedge each other. It is leveraged, however, because the portfolio's
return clearly depends on the returns of the long versus short securities,
and because the strategy can be employed without any outlay of cash (ignoring
the technical details of the use of proceeds from the short sales). The
recommended solution is that the manager must disclose the risk/return
profile of the strategy and the potential impact on portfolio return. Because
it is unclear what all-cash means with regard to short sales, the portfolio
would not be restated to an all-cash position. </P>

<P>The same principles apply to the more complex case now presented, i.e.,
when &quot;phantom cash&quot; is used and when the portfolio may be leveraged
up to a certain multiple times the underlying cash. To illustrate, let's
assume that a client allocates $10 million in cash to a manager who will
then leverage this cash position by 2.5 times. The manager will go long
$25 million in one type of security and go short $25 million in other securities.
The cash may not be in an account that is directly attributable to the
manager, i.e., the client may be allocating cash that is actually held
in accounts being managed by multiple managers, but one manager is assigned
the management of a total amount of cash earmarked for a market neutral
strategy. The return to the market neutral strategy would be based on $10
million, with disclosure of the type of strategy being employed. Restatement
to an all-cash basis would not be possible. The $25 million would be reportedseparately
as part of cash overlay assets; $10 million would be included in firm assets.

<P><B><I>16. Should the real estate returns be presented net of leverage,
after the effects associated with mortgage and similar long term liabilities?
</I></B></P>

<P>Yes, it is required that real estate returns be presented net of leverage
(interest expense related to third-party debt) coupled with appropriate
disclosure on the amount of leverage that is employed in producing the
returns. </P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P><B><I>17. Component returns linked over multiple periods do not equal
the total return. Is there an appropriate methodology to make the component
parts equal to the total return? </I></B></P>

<P>It is recommended that the return components are not forced to equal
the total return. There is no consensus on a methodology to make the component
returns equal to the total return. If a methodology is used to force the
components to add up, the methodology must be disclosed. </P>

<H5><A HREF="#top">Back to Top</A></H5>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B><I>18. If a manager has control over the timing of asset allocations,
that is, the manager times asset class switches based on a timing model,
can the results be presented in accordance with the AIMR standards? </I></B></P>

<P>The AIMR Standards require that performance results be based on actual
assets. If a manager is using a timing model based on an index, and is
calculating the effect of the timing signal as it is applied to the index,
the presentation will not meet the requirement of being based on actual
results. This approach does not deduct any transaction costs, and would
be considered to be model results. Model results may be presented as supplemental
information, but may not be presented as being in compliance with AIMR
Standards, and may not be linked to actual results. </P>

<P>A manager could claim compliance with the AIMR standards if the results
for the actual dollars under management are presented. If the manager does
not have discretion over selection of the underlying funds, the performance
of the timing signal will be differential between the return of the actual
portfolio using the timing signal, and the return of the portfolio minus
the timing signal. As an example, assume that a manager has discretion
to switch client assets out of a particular mutual fund selected by the
client and into cash at points determined by the manager's timing model.
The effectiveness of the timing signal can be measured by comparing the
actual performance of the portfolio ( using the timing signal) against
the return of the mutual fund over that same period. As long as the manager
has discretion to actually switch assets, such a presentation would meet
compliance requirements.</P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. A real estate manager has real estate appraisals
completed either yearly or every three years depending on the client's
agreement. Prior to 1980, the manager allocated the appreciation back over
the previous period. Therefore, for a three-year appraisal, the manager
would restate past performance to recognize the appreciation over each
of the past three years. Post 1980 the manager recognized the gain or loss
in value in the quarter of the appraisal. Is the manager in compliance
with the AIMR guidelines? </I></B></P>

<P>Consistent with industry practice, AIMR requires that changes in valuation,
including unrealized gains and losses, be recognized in the reporting period
that includes the effective date of the appraisal. This requirement is
effective for performance presented for periods subsequent to December
31, 1993. To clarify, before December 1993 either immediate recognition
or an allocationof changes in valuation is acceptable with any change in
methodology disclosed, along with the dates effected. </P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. The AIMR Standards for real estate require
disclosure of &quot;Return formulas and accounting policies for items such
as capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.&quot;
What types of information must be disclosed? </I></B></P>

<P>The disclosure for capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing
commission must, at a minimum, indicate whether the costs are capitalized
or expensed. If costs are capitalized and amortized over some future period(s),
this additional information must be included. </P>

<P>It is acceptable for the required disclosure to appear in the entity'sfinancial
statements (most likely in the Significant Accounting Policies section),
and to be incorporated by reference in the AIMR-related disclosures, as

<P><A NAME="Four"></A><B><I>4. Where do real estate mortgages fit within
the AIMR Standards?</I></B></P>

<P>For the purpose of performance reporting, real estate mortgages with
fixed or variable interest rates are considered fixed-income securities.
Therefore, the core sections of the AIMR Standards are applicable, but
not the real estate section (Section XI, &quot;Treatment of Real Estate&quot;,
pp. 16-17). </P>

<P>Participation and convertible mortgages (i.e., hybrid mortgages) are
considered real estate investments, requiring the additional application
of Section XI, pp. 16-17. In addition, component returns must be allocated
as follows:</P>

<P>Basic cash interest (current receivable) -- allocate to income return
component. </P>

<P>Contingent interest (current receivable) -- allocate to income return
component.</P>

<P>Basic accrued interest (deferred) -- allocate to appreciation return
component.</P>

<P>Additional contingent interest (deferred; payable at maturity, prepayment
or sale) -- allocate to appreciation return component. </P>

<P>Therefore, if the return is currently payable from operations, allocate
to the income return. All other sources of return that are deferred or
realizable in the future should be allocated to the appreciation component.
When presenting returns, it is recommended that separate presentations
be prepared for equity ownership investment strategies pursuant to Section
V, &quot;Composites&quot;, pp. 5-9. </P>

net of leverage, after the effects associated with mortgage and similar
long term liabilities? </I></B></P>

<P>Yes, it is required that real estate returns be presented net of leverage
(interest expense related to third-party debt) coupled with appropriate
disclosure on the amount of leverage that is employed in producing the
returns. </P>

<P>The typical practice of providing quarterly reports satisfies the quarterly
review requirements because the issuance process should include a review
of the real estate portfolio, a review of net asset value for financial
and performance purposes, and review and disclosure of any factors that
may result in a material change to net asset value. An appraisal is not
required every quarter and the minimum requirement is once every three
years, unless client agreements do not require independent appraisals.

in an asset class specific composite? </I></B></P>

<P>The requirements and mandatory disclosures outlined in the 1993 Performance
Presentations Handbook for real estate and international portfolio are
intended for composites of those specific asset classes. Therefore, when
these assets classes are included in a balanced portfolio and composite,
it would not be necessary to provide specific disclosures for the net asset
classes unles in the manager's judgment it is necessary to do so for a
fair presentation. </P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. What is meant by the concept of the recognition
of income at the investor level? (Section XI, A.1.)</I></B></P>

<P>The term investor level is intended to be synonymous with investment
level. This means that all real estate investment program income and expenses
(short-term interest income, appraisal, legal, accounting, cash management
and banking charges, portfolio management fees, asset management fees,
investment management fees, corporate or fund-level expenses and reporting
expenses) are included in the return calculations. The concept of investment
level is distinct from the operating or property level returns which may
exclude some or all of the non-property investment income and expenses.
The disclosure which accompanies the performance return presentation must
describe whether the returns are presented at the investment level or property
level, and must disclose the exclusion of any investment expense that may
be paid by the investors. </P>

<P>Income is equivalent to net investment income (before or after investment
management fees, as applicable) and income is determined pursuant to Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;). Any differences to GAAP
must be disclosed along with the other disclosures required by AIMR. AIMR
recognizes that there exist various alternatives of private real estate
investment forms available to real estate investors, including wholly-owned
real estate, joint venture real estate investments, co-investments, separate
accounts, and commingled funds. Each investment form may offer significant
differences in financial policies and agreements pertaining to the distributing
of earned income to investors and the retention and reinvestment of earned
income. In those situations where income is earned at the investment level
but is not distributed to investors and, therefore, retained at the investment
level, there exists the possibility that the accounting policies of some
investors may not recognize the earned income unless it is distributed.
To promote consistent and comparable reporting practices between real estate
investment managers that are subject to differing cash distributions and
retention policies, AIMR recommends that income earned at the investment
level be included in the computation of the income return, regardless of
the investors' accounting policies for recognizing income from real estate
investments. However, the investment manager is required to disclose the
cash distribution and retention polices with regard to income earned at
the investment level.</P>

a investment partnership holds its initial closing (i.e., fund formation)
in a calendar year other than that year in which its first takedown of
capital occurs? </I></B></P>

<P>Many partnerships hold what is termed as a &quot;dry&quot; closing,
i.e., a closing upon which subscription documents are exchanged without
a capital contribution. For a General Partner presenting performance on
venture fund, the partnership's vintage year is determined to be the year
in which the fund's initial capital contribution occurs regardless of the
fund formation date. For some but-out funds, however, billing sometimes
starts before the first drawdown occurs. In this case, the vintage year
must be based on the date when funds are first remitted, either for the
first takedown or for payment of fees. </P>

<P><A NAME="Five"></A><B><I>5. The AIMR Wrap Fee Subcommittee Report defined
a wrap account as &quot; a program [account] under which any client is
charged a specified fee or fees not based directly upon transactions in
a client's account for investment advisory services (which may include
portfolio management or advice concerning the selection of other investment
advisors) and execution of client transactions&quot; which is the same
definition as that of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please explain
how a wrap account is different from other types of accounts, products
or investment advisory relationships. </I></B></P>

<P>A typical wrap fee account has a contract/contracts (and fee) involving
a broker (sponsor) as the investment advisor, a money manager (as a subcontractor
to the broker investment advisor), other services (custody, consulting,
reporting, performance, selection, monitoring, and execution of trades),
and the client (brokerage customer). It is an all-inclusive &quot;asset
based&quot; brokerage relationship, which may include other services, and
is not a trust account, mutual fund, typical brokerage account, or private
investment advisory relationship. </P>

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Six"></A><B><I>6. Audit, Attest, Verify...What's the difference?
</I></B></P>

<P>The AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) developed
auditing standards to guide CPAs conducting financial statement audits.
The word audit is primarily associated with financial statements. </P>

<P>Even so, auditing standards are also used as guidelines by CPAs expressing
opinions on nonfinancial statement data. These audits are called attestation
engagements. In 1992, the AICPA issued standards for attestation engagements
separate from auditing standards, further differentiating between the two
terms. </P>

<P>In 1993, the AIMR (Association for Investment Management and Research)
issued Performance Presentation Standards, recommending compliance verification
and establishing criteria for Level 1 and Level 2 verifications. The term
belongs to AIMR, not the AICPA. </P>

<P>CPAs must look to AIMR's PPS when conducting verifications and to the
AICPA's attestation standards for guidelines within their own profession.

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Seven"></A><B><I>7. Can AAS clients legally state that their
composites are audited? </I></B></P>

<P>Yes. If a CPA is conducting Level 2 verifications on your composites,
you can legally say your composites are audited. But please don't (unless
asked by a consultant). Verification is the term established by AIMR. It
has specific meaning within the money management industry and among third
parties relying on verifications. For accuracy and consistency, Level 1
or Level 2 verifications should be called verifications. Period. </P>

<P>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><A NAME="Eight"></A><B><I>8. How much does annual verification cost?
</I></B></P>

<P>Fees are determined by Ashland Accounting Services on a client-by-client
basis. Each investment manager is different and requires different levels
of service. Clients who are not sure about their firm's compliance will
probably pay more than firms that are confident of their compliance, due
to the consulting involved. We discuss all aspects of the firm's compliance
before discussing a fee. </P>

<P>On average, Ashland Accounting clients pay $2,500 per year for each
Level 1 composite that is presented to potential investors, and $4,500
per year for each Level 2 composite. The composites which are not marketed
are charged at the rate of $100 per year.</P>

<P><A NAME="One"></A><B><I>1. Is amortized cost an acceptable AIMR PPS
valuation method to compare a time-weighted return for cash and cash equivalents?
</I></B></P>

<P>As stated on page 4, number 4 of the 1993 AIMR Performance Presentation
Standards handbook, &quot;The pricing of all assets must be based on a
reasonable estimate of current value of assets sold on that date to a willing
buyer. In cases of frequency traded securities, standardizing pricing quotations
must be used, and if necessary, verified.&quot; Mark to market is clearly
the preferred valuation. Amortization or accretion are allowable valuation
methods for cash and cash equivalent positions so long as that valuation
method reasonably approximated market value. For example, it is industry
practice to define cash and cash equivalents to be securities with maturities
of one year or less. However, in valuing U.S. mutual funds, the SEC currently
allows for (i) cash and cash equivalents with maturities up to 60 days;
and (ii) U.S. money market instruments with maturities up to 90 days, but
requires that actual market value be determined for maturities longer than
those specified. In addition, there may be industry and regulatory guidelines
to be followed for particular case equivalents securities. </P>

<P><A NAME="Two"></A><B><I>2. How do the standards apply to GIC portfolios?
</I></B></P>

<P>Traditional GIC portfolios provide stable results that are not based
on a mark-to-market valuation. The valuation of the traditional GIC is
based on book value, not on current market, as required by the total return
calculation and reporting requirements on the AIMR Standards. Accordingly,
unless the assets in these portfolios are separately marked to market,
the portfolio results cannot be reported in compliance with the standards.
GIC assets would be reported separately, i.e., not include in the statistic,
&quot;total firm assets&quot; as defined by the standards. </P>

<P>Firms managing both traditional GIC and other assets are exempted from
reporting GIC assets in compliance with the AIMR Standards. These firms
may claim compliance for the remaining assets. Managed GIC's and other
non-traditional GIC strategies that meet the total return and market valuation
requirement are eligible for the claim of compliance. </P>

<P><A NAME="Three"></A><B><I>3. A real estate manager has real estate appraisals
completed either yearly or every three years depending on the client's
agreement. Prior to 1980, the manager allocated the appreciation back over
the previous period. Therefore, for a three-year appraisal, the manager
would restate past performance to recognize the appreciation over each
of the past three years. Post 1980 the manager recognized the gain or loss
in value in the quarter of the appraisal. Is the manager in compliance
with the AIMR guidelines? </I></B></P>

<P>Consistent with industry practice, AIMR requires that changes in valuation,
including unrealized gains and losses, be recognized in the reporting period
that includes the effective date of the appraisal. This requirement is
effective for performance presented for periods subsequent to December
31, 1993. To clarify, before December 1993 either immediate recognition
or an allocationof changes in valuation is acceptable with any change in
methodology disclosed, along with the dates effected. </P>

<P>Many partnerships hold what is termed as a &quot;dry&quot; closing,
i.e., a closing upon which subscription documents are exchanged without
a capital contribution. For a General Partner presenting performance on
venture fund, the partnership's vintage year is determined to be the year
in which the fund's initial capital contribution occurs regardless of the
fund formation date. For some but-out funds, however, billing sometimes
starts before the first drawdown occurs. In this case, the vintage year
must be based on the date when funds are first remitted, either for the
first takedown or for payment of fees. </P>

<P><A NAME="Six"></A><B><I>6. How should vintage year be determined when
an advisor invests in a limited partnership on behalf of clients but the
initial takedowns of capital for those clients occur in different years?
</I></B></P>

<P>This question must be considered from the perspective of both existing
clients and prospective clients. </P>

<P>For an LP (or investment advisor) presenting performance on separately
managed accounts to existing clients, the date on LP's initial capital
contribution for that client will determine the partnership's vintage year.
</P>

<P>For an investment advisor presenting aggregate performance to prospective
clients, the date of the first directed capital contribution will determine
the vintage year. For buy-out funds, vintage year must be based on the
date when funds are first remitted, either for the first takedown or for
when fees are paid. </P>

the compliance issues facing our clients.We have worked with more than
350 different composites in almost every investment style. We work with
each client to create a performance reporting format that is efficient
and accurate. The result: faster production of quarterly performance reporting.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We perform quarterly verifications. Our clients
need to be able to compete in searches requiring independent verification
through the most recent quarter. Quarterly verifications enable the back
office to respond quickly to RFP's, consultant questionnaires and client
review meetings. It ensures compliance reporting is up-to-date and reduces
the risk and embarrassment of having to restate numbers. </FONT></P>

questions on AIMR and/or performance-related issues. We invest as much
time in consulting with our clients as we do in verifying their numbers.

<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH="100%"></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Investment manager searches are increasingly requiring
money managers to not only be in compliance with the AIMR PPS, but also
to be verified. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#8F982C">This is why... Quality of information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The AIMR Performance Presentation Standards were
designed to promote full and fair disclosure of investment managers' performance
results, increase the comparability of evaluating investment managers,
and decrease managers' ability to present only their best performing accounts
and/or time periods.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">In order to claim compliance with the Standards,
adopted on January 1, 1993, investment managers must do two things: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">1) calculate performance according to an acceptable
methodology </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">2) disclose all relevant information on the investment
style(s) being presented.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">When the Performance Presentation Standards were
written, they proposed two possible levels of verification, Level 1 and
Level 2: </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#8F982C"><FONT SIZE=+0>Level 1 Verification
</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Level 1 verification simply ensures that the
manager has included all appropriate accounts for all time periods. This
process audits the performance of the composite and the make-up of each
composite. Each account the firm manages is tracked from period to period
and any account that &quot;disappears&quot; from the manager's records
must be documentable. Accounts are also checked to ensure they are actual
accounts under management, not simulated. Once this process is complete,
the firm verifying the manager's data must then be sure the manager has
all mandatory disclosures in place and is representing these disclosures
accurately. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#8F982C"><FONT SIZE=+0>Level 2 Verification
</FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">A Level II verification includes a Level I verification
and is a detailed audit of the portfolio returns that make up the composite
returns. This level of verification checks security pricing, holdings,
income and performance. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#8F982C"><FONT SIZE=+0>Which Level of Verification
Is Most Appropriate? </FONT></FONT></H3>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The verification process adds its greatest value
at Level I. Our firm requires all strategies currently presented or actively
marketed by a client to undergo a Level I verification. At this level,
we can assist our clients in defining the composites, deciding which accounts
to include or exclude, and providing necessary disclosure information.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Level II verifications turn up very few errors.
The fact is, custodial banks, consultants and many other parties already
&quot;verify&quot; cash flows, portfolio returns, and security pricing.
Ashland Accounting does not engage in Modified Level II verifications because
we believe they undermine the original intent of the AIMR Performance Presentation
Standards. </FONT></P>

If your a pension fund trustee, you are in the position of influence regarding
norms of practice within the industry. The funds &quot;drive&quot; the
marketplace. As an example, when the money management industry adopted
standards for presentation of performance results (AIMR Standards), many
carried the cause to their staff and to their boards. As a result, AIMR
is the standard of standards today. We believe SAS 70 audits are next.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">No one can predict the consequences of the Internet
connecting millions of individuals with one another and to billions of
pieces of information in an unstructured, constantly evolving environment.
One thing is certain, though, commerce and advertising will be changing
at an ever quickening pace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The great commercial value of the Internet is
that Net users &quot;pull&quot; information of value to themselves vs.
having it &quot;pushed&quot; upon them. In our time-starved era, instant
on-demand information is the lubricant for commerce.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The ability for investment firms to interact with
potential and existing customers via the Internet will create marketing
opportunities that will transform the way we do business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">On balance, we think the promises of the Internet
outweigh the threats. For the investment management community, the Internet
seems to be the most likely step in preparing for the future. Having a
presence on the Internet will become essential as business takes an increasingly
global oreintation.</FONT></P>

Note: If segment returns are part of a composite, the segment return, as
well as the cash return, must be provided. Identify which accounts were
revalued due to significant external cash flows. If any, provide the date
of revaluation. Identify which accounts are taxable and which are tax-exempt.
Note: Most firms track this data on spreadsheets. In this case, we prefer
to have an electronic (floppy disk) copy of the spreadsheet. </FONT></P>

The following list of composites is a full disclosure of all composites
managed by Money Management, Inc. and is the representation of management.
<BR>
<BR>
We have examined the following composites beginning start date through
March 31, 1996. Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and
the Performance Presentation Standards as adopted by the Association for
Investment Management and Research. <BR>
<BR>
Our examination verified that all accounts of the firm were properly included
in at least one of the composites and for the appropriate time periods.
In our opinion, Money Management, Inc. has met the requirements for compliance
to the Performance Presentation Standards. <BR>
<BR>
1.Equity Composite <BR>
2.Balanced Composite <BR>
3.Fixed Income Composite <BR>
4.Asset Allocation Restricted Composite <BR>
5.Client-Specific Mandates Composite <BR>
<BR>
In addition, we have verified the presentations of performance results
of composites numbered one (1), two (2) and three (3). Our opinions regarding
these composites and the mandatory disclosures as outlined by the Performance
Presentation Standards are an integral part of this report. We have not
verified the performance results of the remaining composites, as their
performance is not being presented. The inclusion of such composites is
for disclosure purposes only. <BR>

<BR>
We have examined the performance presentation of the Equity Composite of
Money Management, Inc. from start date through March 31, 1996. We conducted
our examination in accordance with standards established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Association for Investment
Management and Research. <BR>
<BR>
Our examination verified that the composite included all appropriate accounts
and time periods. Our examination also verified the calculation of performance
results. We believe our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. <BR>
<BR>
In our opinion, the performance presentation of the Equity Composite presents
results that conform, in all material respects, to the Performance Presentation
Standards as adopted by the Association for Investment Management and Research,
Level 1. <BR>
<BR>
Additional information and other mandates required by the Performance Presentation
Standards are an integral part of this opinion. <BR>

a client by client basis. On average, Level 1 Verifications are $2,500/composite,

are verified.<BR>

how knowledgable the firm is of compliance issues, will affect fees.</FONT></P>

commencement of services, and the remainder is due upon issuance of our
independent accountant's verification report. On going annual fees will

<P>When you let the quiet take over, eventually you will want to explore the 10 acres. Take your pick. Walk in the Cedar forest, rocky marshy shore, or down the winding tree lined lanes. Here you will see endangered wild flowers, wild animals, and befuddled fishermen.</P>
<P>During the coming months we will be featuring the wild flowers and stories of our adventures on the bay. When the ice thaws and we can  pick them up, we will have offer our visitors FREE Actual Fossils from the property. So keep you eyes peeled! <I>(If we get a rush, we may make it a contest.)</I></P>

<B>News from Misery Bay</B></P></CENTER>


<P>For a while there the brave little blue monkey flowers were shaking off the morning frost, some of them still blooming in the sunshine.  Now they -- and all of the wild flower blossoms -- are resting under  a soft blanket of snow.  While the blooms wait for spring, the ice fishermen are just waiting for the ice to be strong enough.  Then they will be hauling their shanties out on the bay.
There is, however, a new energy in the air.  MBIndustries has some new clients, and we look forward to adding a whole new range of options for our clients.  Watch the opening page for the latest information about this exciting new opportunity.</P>

of Alpena, Michigan on a rocky piece of Lake Huron shoreline known
locally as Misery Bay. Legend has it that one winter in the last
century a ship foundered, and its crew barely survived. With the
spring thaw came the realization that the poor wretches had suffered
great privations only five miles from the bustling settlement
of Alpena.</FONT><IMG SRC="map.gif" HSPACE="1" ALIGN="RIGHT"></P>

Misery Bay Publications</A> can help you now!

<TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="60%"><B><B><FONT SIZE="6" COLOR="Purple">Misery Bay can do it!</FONT></B></B>
<P ALIGN="left"><B><B><I>The advent of relatively inexpensive desktop publishing and HTML-writing software for office 
computers has appeared to place professional publishing within the reach of many small 
businesses. At first glance it often seems like Phyllis the Receptionist should be able to whip up a 
<A HREF="web.htm">homepage</A> or the occasional print <A HREF="writing.htm">newsletter</A> in her free time. Still there are a few things the<BR>
employer must consider before setting Phyllis to work.
</I></B></B></P>
<P ALIGN="left">     First you must ask yourself just how much <A HREF="mbay.htm">free time</A> Phyllis really has. Some of these sophisticated new 
     programs can produce professional-quality work, but they also have a relatively long learning curve. </P>
<P>     And if she has the time to do it, does Phyllis know the difference between hypertext and hyperventilation? 
     Who is going to <A HREF="graphic.htm">screen the photos </A>or produce the <A HREF="graphic.htm">graphics</A>? Phyllis has plenty of clip art, but which graphic 
     tells your story best? Is Phyllis doing both the <A HREF="writing.htm">writing and typing</A>? And would she know an emend if she
     tripped over it?</P>
<P>Our <A HREF="staff1.htm">staff </A>at Misery Bay knows because it's our business to know these things. To examine our 
most recent work on-line check out our  <A HREF="http://www.miserybay.com/bay">Cyber Community</A>. </P>
<P ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="4"><FONT SIZE="4"><I><B></B></I></FONT></FONT>And by the way . . . 
if Phyllis really has the time and ability to handle all of the publishing for you, why is she still a receptionist?</P>

Welcome Misery Bay's newest member! He will be handling all the

Last and not least is David. When the time comes for a delivery

very little need for this position. Maybe soon he will be shown
how to push the &quot;send&quot; button. For now, he is the biggest
support. <I>Thank you.</I> <P>

<FORM METHOD="POST">
<H2>  If there's only one Internet - why would it matter how I got there?  Does it make a difference to the end-user &quot;how, when, or with who&quot; he got there?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">It doesn't matter how you got there.  
There are several ways your computer can get to the Internet.
Basically your computer calls a local dial-up server. 
This server in turn gives you an open line to the internet. 
Whether you use AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy...  
or just use the local internet dial-up server-  It doesn't matter.
The different companies like AOL, CompuServe...  have added
features.  I am not too fond of them, BUT they are great for
those wishing to get started on the internet. 
Once you have used them for awhile you may find that the
extra bells and whistles are not needed.  Local Dial-up Servers
get you quick access to the internet and for very reasonable
rates.  They do have a few downfalls, but I'll try to get into
this with your other questions.

</TEXTAREA>
</P>
<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="left">Why is there such a variance in Internet Service Providers fees?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">This is a new market.  There is no regulations, so some 
companies tend to make others feel inept.   So they will price 
by what they feel the market will take.  In this case you do not
necessarily get what you pay for.  We have seen some servers
charge for each link on a site to another web site.  There is no
mystery in the links, but because some don't know better, they 
will charge for it.  Our charges are pretty much figured out by
how much time will be involved with a site.  When we figure
out our Site charges we figure about $25
an hour or $200 a day.   (Please note that our prices on a Web 
Site Account INCLUDE ALL ART charges!)
You will find some that will charge $70
- $500 an hour.  We figure that it isn't any different than an art
charge that you may incur in a project.  A company that will
charge $750 a page for a web site is nuts, but people will pay.
The space on the internet is cheep, it is the design of the site
that costs. </TEXTAREA>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="left">Are there different kinds of Service Providers out there?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">Yes!  There are first the Local Dial-up Servers.  They get you 
out there.  They will also give or sell you Internet web space
for your own homepage.  (They then will charge you to design
your site, if you need it.  This also may not be available because
they themselves are usually far behind in getting all those pages
out!) We dealt with our local dial-up server for a while for our
site.  Let me explain why we went and rented our own space. 
First of all we always supplied our server with pages. 
He would take 2-3 weeks just to load them onto his server. 
Because you weren't sure where in the computer he would
place your file, your own links could be wrong.  Or he just plain
uploaded the wrong pages.  Maybe he had old files hanging
around...  It would take several days to get his attention...  He 
wasn't as worried about them as we were.  He also would be
&quot;down&quot;  when your local server is down... Not only are you
unable to dial out, NO ONE on the internet can access your 
Site!  Now that we are out on our own our traffic count just
soared!!!!  We use to get 1-2 hits a day.  I can't even figure
out the changes!!!  It does make a difference where you site
is located.
So there are also ISP who just rent out space.  We have a
great company that we work with!  I recommend them
whenever someone is looking for just the space.  They are
inexpensive.  I don't like being a &quot;Middle man&quot;.  We would
prefer to design your site for you and let you place it on your
server, or have it on ours.  If it is a place with several changes
(Our client Marytown is constantly changing.  They are located 
       at  http://www.Marytown.org
We have them on our server.  It makes up dates much easier.  
By the way, we can upload our changes IMMEDIATELY!!  We
do not take 2-3 weeks.
</TEXTAREA>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="left">How about speed ---- I hear a lot about it.  What can I ask of the Internet Service Provider when I'm shopping to find if I'm going to get my money's worth?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">If you are fortunate enough to have a choice on which local
 dial-up server they should have a minimum of 14.4 or 28.8 Bds.
 for modem hook-up. (Same goes for your computer modem)
 After you are on the internet cruising around the rest depends
 on several things.
     1.   One of the biggest problems is the local  dial-up server 
           having enough phone lines to handle the traffic!
           We hear (OK, so we grump about it too!) of numerous times
           where you dial-up and the phone lines are busy.
     2.   How many MHZ is your computer. ( A 100mhz is faster than 
            a 75mhz for example)
     3.   How bogged down is the internet itself? Somedays nothing
           loads onto your computer very fast due too the system
           being bogged down. ( Sort of like a traffic jam.)
     4.   And what kind of server is the site you are visiting on?
          If the site is for example Microsoft, this is a very busy site
          and it often takes a longer time for downloads. Even if you
          are looking at the pages instead of downloading software,
          it will take a little while. (Go to McDonalds for a box of fries
          just after a school bus arrived. Even though you may just
          want fries, you will wait like you were waiting to give your
          whole office lunch requests! :&gt;)
     5.  Currently our server is located on a T3 backbone in the 
          MCI building in New York. It is suppose to be the fastest 
          at this time, you STILL have to have #1 &amp; #2 working for you.

<H3 ALIGN="left"><BR>
  <B>How do I know if an ISP is &quot;genuine&quot; or a &quot;middle-man&quot; (value-adder)?</B></H3>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">I don't know if you can really tell. My advice is... Is the price
reasonable? Do they offer what you want? How is their customer 
service? If you feel confident in their service and don't feel like 
you aren't getting ripped off... Go for it. Personally if someone 
wasn't satisfied with our service and we can't make it right, 
WE WILL give someone their money back. We want to be 
around for the long haul.</TEXTAREA>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="left"><BR>
Do all the ISPs provide direct dial-up access to the Internet?</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><BR>
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">Nope.  We are not a local dial-up server.</TEXTAREA>
</H2>
<H2>What should I look out for when shopping for an ISP?  What should I steer away from?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">High prices , hidden costs, ... Another thing that I discovered is 
that if they can't accept Visa/Mastercard that may be a warning. 
Because if you can't get the service you want and they won't
listen, YOUR credit card company will go after them. We now
will not buy software (that we have tried out on the internet) with a
check. We learned a lesson. Once a check is cashed it is pretty
much gone. But Visa/Mastercard will fight for you. (We are one 
of the few ISP's that can accept Visa/Mastercard.   We had 
absolutely no problem. It surprised both the Branch Manager of
the bank and us!)</TEXTAREA>
</P>
<H2 ALIGN="left">How are you connected to Internet?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">The servers are located in New York City, one floor belowMCI's 
International T3 backbone. The connection to this backboneis 
made via a direct 10 Mbp/s ethernet cable. This is 6.5 times
faster than a T1 connection plus there is no &quot;long haul&quot; pointof
failure. Many ISP's have a point of failure in the dedicated telephone
line (often a T1) that runs between their office and their uplink 
provider. The uplink provider is another point of failure.  We 
connect directly to the backbone, eliminating these major points 
of failure.</TEXTAREA>
</P>

<H2>  How can I compare &quot;apples to apples&quot; when comparative shopping for <BR>
an ISP?</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">You will have to do some work. Know exactly what you want, be
specific, and check out the pricing of services. Since this is
unregulated, it will be all over the board. If someone offers more 
than the other as far as services, check with the others if it is a 
service that others have as well. I know that it is hard to keep up
with all that we can offer our own clients. We are constantly 
learning new things to give our customers.</TEXTAREA>
</P>

<H2>Could you please outline your fee schedule for me, including:  <BR>
initiation fee, if any; monthly fees; promotional price structures; 
 additional charges per hour, if applicable; any hidden costs; etc, etc.  Please state local currency in your quotes.</H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">Our currency is US. We don't have any set-up fees.  No hidden
charges.  We would tell you up front if a service that you require
has an added cost.
We would like 1/2 the year up front. But that isn't even absolute.
If you just need a Misery Bay Mall Site, your site doesn't require
a huge layout of time to get it up and running, then the first 
month in advance will be sufficient.
We definitely don't charge the final amount until the customer is
up and running on the site. Then they can pay the rest in 11 
monthly payments, or they will get 2 months off the cost if they
pay the rest at that time. The fees include ALL updates and 
maintenance on the site. If they need a survey, forms, you 
name it we will do it. The charges are based on how much 
work a site will require and how much space that amount of 
work may require for storage.</TEXTAREA>

<H2>Does your service allows you to have your own domain name? </H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">Currently to have your own domain name with us you need the
10M of  server space.  This is the Granite Site that is $3600 for
the year (Or $300 a month).  This includes Misery Bay Publications
doing EVERYTHING for the sites homepages  (ALL graphics, 
lay out, HTML's, scanning, linking, FTP into site...  What ever 
the customer needs.   Also included is the registering and setting
up the domain.We also program various search engines within a

wished to help potential customers easily locate a product. </TEXTAREA>

<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">Misery Bay Publication's standards are our own personal standards.  
We will not place any immoral, illegal, or unethical material, text, 
or photos on our sites.   We have too many clients of whom, we 
do not wish to insult by representing an unconscionable client along
side.  We have turned down clients because of this.  Sorry if that 
offends some, but we have to be able to live with ourselves.  The
internet at this time boasts of anonymity, but we know who we are.      </TEXTAREA>

<H2>What are your Customer Support hours?  Is there an extra fee for Customer Support?  </H2>
<P ALIGN="center">
<TEXTAREA NAME="TextField" COLS="75" ROWS="4">No Charge!  We answer E-mail whenever we download.

Ok, we have recently signed up to be able to submit ALL our

But put 	together with the right advertising and marketing strategy, it is! 	It's great we provide our clients with custom made mailing lists, 	but how many times has a client said to you, &quot;I have this great 	product and I know how to sell, but I don't know where to start 	when it comes to putting words on paper, let alone designing a 	brochure or flyer. Can you help me?&quot; Ashley Rose writer, 
	marketing consultant and owner of Rose Publishing in Interlochen	Michigan, can be of assistance. A small business owner for 17 	years, Ashley offers her clients one-stop shopping including 	including lists/services, while specializing in writing, advertising, 	designing  marketing. Using just the right words, Ashley creates 	success for her clients! &quot;I get to know my clients and what their 	needs are. I keep it very simple. I determine WHO they should 
	reach, WHAT they should say and HOW to say it.&quot; Oftentimes, the 	&quot;first impression&quot; is a company's advertisement. Everyone likes 	to look at a pretty face and because businesses are inundated with 	mail, if your advertisement, does not attract and retain the 	reader's attention in the first three seconds, it will not get 
	read. Oftentimes it may never even get opened! You want to &quot;hook&quot; 	the reader (your potential client,) with the first chapter (your 	advertisement) of the book... and by using colors, graphics and 	creative writing, Rose Publishing does just that! Leave the reader 	wanting to hear more... then they  call  you and say &quot;I want what, 	YOU have!&quot; and won't that be nice? Show an &quot;attitude of 	gratitude&quot; and say -&quot;thank you for being my client&quot; to current 	clients offer a &quot;special&quot; to attract, new business.</B>

<H3> &quot;People say, what is the sense of our small effort.
They cannot see that we must lay one brick at a time, take one
step at a time.&quot; -- Dorothy Day</H3>
<P>
<H3>Your Volunteer Help is needed! With so much activity at the
PEC, there is always lots to be done--especially now! Call to
set up a time to come in (as much or as little as you are comfortable
with); we have a wide variety of projects that will benefit from
your help.</H3>

<STRONG><EM>We have too many guns in schools now already! JROTC teaches
the idea that guns are a legitimate way to gain power and prestige.
Let's stop the violence, and stop the military invasion of our
schools.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
<H1><CENTER>TEACH PEACE!</CENTER></H1>
<HR ALIGN=center SIZE=3>
<H1><CENTER>R.O.T.C</CENTER></H1>
<P>
<H3><EM>So, You're thinking of joining the military --</EM> the JROTC.
You think it's a great way to get a start? Well...maybe. But
first you should know a little of what the program won't tell
you.</H3>

<STRONG><EM><UL>
<LI>The first thing you should know is that it's the military
you're dealing with.
</UL>
</EM></STRONG>
 <STRONG>This is not a pre-college program, a job training program,
or -- despite what the name says -- a program to help you become
a military officer. Many people find our too late that the military's
primary goal is combat -- not job training or college prep.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG><EM><UL>
<LI>They tell you it's a program for future officers.
</UL>
</EM></STRONG>

<STRONG>Not quite. If past JROTC graduates are any indication, you
probably won't become an officer. If you do go on into the military
(as about half of JROTC students do), it will most likely be as
a private -- scrubbing toilets with toothbrushes and doing push-ups
in the rain while somebody calls you a &quot;maggot&quot; This
is NOT a training program -- it's a recruiting program to pull
you into the bottom of the army.</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>&quot;We don't want to be misleading, but too much combat
footage interferes with the long term attributes of army service
we want to portray: money for college, skills training, and relevance
to a civilian career. &quot; Col. John Meyers, director of advertising
for the army recruiting command, New York Times.</EM>
<P>
<STRONG><EM><UL>
<LI>They tell you it's a chance to learn job skills.
</UL>
</EM></STRONG>
<STRONG>Maybe, but the jobs in the military are military jobs, and
the skills are mostly being a soldier. Besides, even though you're
promised training in a field like electronics or mechanics, they
don't have to assign you to a job in that field. You could wind
up in the: infantry or anywhere else the military wants you.</STRONG>
<BR>
<STRONG>When you get our. you may be no better off than you are right
now --just older, poorer, and behind all of your classmates. A
recent study by Ohio State University found that only 12 our of
every hundred men, and 6 out of every hundred women made any use
of their military skills later in civilian jobs (unless you want
a job cleaning toilets). In fact, unemployment among young veterans
is 35% higher than among non-veterans of the same age group.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG><EM><UL>
<LI>They tell you they offer opportunities to minorities.
</UL>
</EM></STRONG>
<STRONG>Actually, many veterans say that racism is worse inside the
military. For example, they don't tell you that 30% of the enlisted
people are minorities, or that, during the Gulf War, the majority
of front-line troops were minorities, while only one of every
ten officers is not white.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG><EM><UL>
<LI>They tell you that women are treated the same as everyone else.
</UL>
</EM></STRONG>
<STRONG>Maybe. But ask people in the program what &quot;Tailhook&quot;
is. (Female officers were physically and sexually assaulted.)
Furthermore, women trained in the same areas as men, such as marksmanship
or combat, are often assigned to do the typing and filing. Why
did 65% of the women in the army say they were being sexually
harassed in 1981? Why is the rate of reported rapes higher in
the military than in civilian life?</STRONG>

<CENTER><H2>Some Facts About JROTC</H2></CENTER>
<STRONG><UL>
<LI> The JROTC curriculum claims to teach subjects like history,
civics, English, and health science, even though the Instructors
do not have credentials to teach these subjects.
</UL>

<UL><LI> JROTC teachers are not required to have a college degree
to receive their special subjects credential. State credential
guidelines do not even require them to take the CBEST!</UL>
<UL><LI>&quot;Fortunately for the Army, the government policy of
pushing the Indians farther west then wiping them out was carried
out successfully. &quot; -3rd year Army JROTC textbook, page 185</I></UL></strong>
<STRONG><UL><LI> The value of JROTC credits is so worthless that they do
not count toward entrance requirements for state colleges and
universities. Students' JROTC grades are excluded in computation
of grade point averages, for student aid eligibility.</UL>
<UL><LI>'Americans generally place a high value on human life.
This may not necessarily be the case in other cultures or countries
<EM>. . . for example certain of the terrorist-sponsoring nations
of the Middle East. &quot;-4th year Navy JROTC textbook, page
141</EM></UL></STRONG>
<STRONG><UL><LI> JROTC has never produced valid data to substantiate its
claim that it helps keep students in  school and out of trouble.
In fact, students with academic or disciplinary problems are excluded
from the Navy JROTC program.</UL>
<UL><LI>&quot;Modern advocates of gun control, registration and
the banning of gun ownership should at least be aware that their
efforts, . . . are probably unconstitutional. &quot;-AFJROTC text,
Careen In Aerospace, page 76</UL></STRONG>
<STRONG><UL><LI> The military-style leadership JROTC teaches is inconsistent
with the goals of our schools. More important to students are
the cooperative, democratic leadership and self-discipline already
taught through other programs like music, student government,
and sports.</UL>
<UL><LI> JROTC is a military recruiting program, plain and simple.
This is reflected in the textbooks and stated in official JROTC
documents. Dept. of Defense statistics indicate that almost 50%
of students who pass through the program join the military, the
vast majority in the bottom ranks.</UL>
<UL><LI>&quot;The mark of a true soldier has always been loyalty
and obedience to leaders. It b the same for NJROTC cadets...&quot;-1st
year Navy JROTC textbook, page 24</UL></STRONG>
<STRONG><UL><LI> JROTC propagandizes students with politically-biased lessons
and historical material that is often distorted and sometimes
false. This conclusion was supported by a District-appointed committee
when it reviewed the Air Force JROTC textbooks a few years ago.</UL>
<UL><LI>JROTC discriminates in hiring: teachers must be 'physically
fit': less than 1% of 3ROTC teachers are women; and gays and lesbians are automatically excluded
from the pool of retired officers who are eligible to teach.</UL>
<UL><LI>&quot;Among the traits of a good follower, loyalty is at
the top of the list. This means loyalty to those above us in the
chain of command, whether or not we agree with them. &quot; -1st
year Navy JROTC textbook, page 24</UL></STRONG>
<STRONG><UL><LI> JROTC teaches students rifle marksmanship and drills them
with mock weapons. This is thewrong message when we are trying to convince young people
to stay away from guns and avoid violence.</UL>

<UL><LI>&quot;Take the religion you know best. for instance. .
. It speaks of one God who is the Father of all mankind. . . the
idea of one Universal Father is stressed. &quot; -2nd year Air
Force JROTC textbook, page 67</UL></STRONG>
<STRONG><UL><LI>The JROTC program is not cost effective. While a partial
federal subsidy is received for staff salaries, extra staff, including
an administrator, must be hired. In 1993, the District discovered
that JROTC teachers were costing $301,000 more than regular classroom
teachers!</UL></STRONG>

<b><FONT SIZE="+3">Michigan Lawyers And Activists Hail International Court Of Justice Ruling:<br><p>
 <i>Threat or use of nuclear weapons illegal</I></FONT></P>
</b>
<p>
<table border align="left"><tr><td><font size="+6"><tt>T</tt></font></td></tr></table>he International Court of Justice ruled Monday, July 8, 1996 that "The threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the principles and rules of humanitarian law" and affirmed the "obligation" of all countries "to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects." <p>
<B>THREAT OR USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS VIOLATES INTERNATIONAL LAW </B><p>
The International Court of Justice has held that "the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law."
<P>
"The International Court has paved the way beyond the nuclear age through law and agreement rather than annihilation," said Anabel Dwyer, a Michigan attorney who was in the Hague during the Court's deliberations as a member of the World Court Project Legal Team for the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms. <P>
The Court reaffirmed the primacy of rules of humanitarian law as fundamental legal limits and found that nuclear weapons violate the principles and rules of humanitarian law because nuclear weapons cannot distinguish between civilians and combatants, cause unnecessary suffering, are uncontrollable, and cause long-term, severe and widespread damage to the environment.
<P>
"This is what we've been saying all along," said Rev. Peter Dougherty of Lansing who has been frequently arrested and jailed for resisting nuclear weapons.
<P>
The historic decision was announced Monday, July 8, 1996, as the International Court of Justice read its opinion at the Peace Palace in the Hague.  The judicial arm of the United Nations rendered its decision on a question brought to it by the United Nations General Assembly.
<P>
<B>LARGE MAJORITY OF THE COURT HOLDS THAT INTERNATIONAL LAW CONTROLS </B><P>
Ten of the fourteen judges of the International Court held that the principles and rules of humanitarian law applied even before a state threatened or used nuclear weapons. This was a resounding defeat for the nuclear states, which had argued that they had the right to decide when to threaten or use nuclear weapons and that the law was only applicable after further threat or use of nuclear weapons.
<P>
In addition, seven of the fourteen judges found that the threat or use of nuclear weapons generally violated binding humanitarian law. Those seven, which made a majority because of the tie-breaking vote cast by the President of the Court, provided one caveat to present illegality of nuclear weapons. The Court's majority could not "conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of selfdefence in which the very survival of a State would be at stake." <P>
Three judges voted against the caveat finding that present law prohibited any threat or use nuclear weapons even in "extreme circumstances."
<P>
Only four of the fourteen judges found that the Court should not have heard the case or that nuclear weapons were presently beyond the reach of the law.
<P>
The majority opinion also carefully reviews the law of self-defense reminding the nuclear powers that any act of self-defense must be proportional to an attack and must also comport with the principles and rules of humanitarian law.
<P>
"Michigan citizens who have been challenging the legality of nuclear weapons have been affirmed by this decision," said Deborah Choly, a Detroit attorney who has for many years defended civil resisters to nuclear weapons using reasoning similar to that of the International Court.
<P>
"In practice these holdings rule out any legal threat or use of nuclear weapons. The evidence presented to the Court showed overwhelmingly that nuclear weapons are so poisonous, indiscriminate and uncontrollable that they cannot meet the requirements of humanitarian law. The Court's majority simply added the caveat because the reality remains that the nuclear states still have the physical capacity to wreck the sort of havoc that negates the rule of law all together," said Dwyer.
<P>
<B>NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT AN OBLIGATION FOR ALL COUNTRIES
</B><P>
Finally and unanimously the Court held: "There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and to bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control."
<P>
"We now have the legal grounding for working out a treaty with the details of eliminating these weapons. The Court obligated all countries to conclude a nuclear disarmament treaty and not only the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty signatories," said Elliot Meyrowitz, Detroit College of Law adjunct professor and author of a major text on Nuclear Weapons and International Law. "Arms control agreements, under this decision, must have the effect of leading to or contributing to achieving nuclear disarmament."
<P>

The Court declined to rule on another question brought by the World Health Organization. But Dr. Victor Seidel, co-president of the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War commented, "The Court still used the World Health Organization data on the impact of nuclear weapons on health, health services and the environment. So, in effect, the decision that nuclear weapons threat or use is generally contrary to humanitarian law answers the World Health Organization question about the legality of nuclear weapons."
<P>
The achievement of this crucial opinion by the world's highest court is a result of the long-term commitment and dedication of many in Michigan, the U.S. and throughout the world. The court proceeding was initiated by international peace and disarmament groups including the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms, the International Peace Bureau and the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
<P>
With the opinion of the International Court of Justice behind them, many local groups are throwing new efforts behind the Abolition 2000 caucus of peace and justice organizations from around the world. Abolition 2000 members work actively on a treaty to abolish all nuclear weapons which can now bring U.S. policy in line with the law.
<P>
"The rapid completion of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and immediate nuclear disarmament negotiations are now not only a good idea but are also called for by the Court's opinion. A nuclear abolition treaty could and should be completed by the year 2000. Our demands that the U.S. end its $33 billion a year expenditure on nuclear annihilation now have the force of law behind them," said Dwyer.

<b><font size="+3">Judgment Day At World Court:
Nuclear Weapon States Brought To Book</font></b>
<p>
<H4><CENTER><EM>By Commander Robert Green RN (Retired), UK Chair World Court Project</EM> </CENTER><p>

<p>
July 8, 1996 may well be remembered as the day when a nuclear weapon-free world became more than a dream.  Fittingly, the event which could decisively shift the image of nuclear weapons from ultimate political virility symbol to shunned pariah occurred in the Peace Palace at The Hague.
<P>
On 15 December 1994, despite desperate countermoves by the NATO nuclear weapon states, a clear majority of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution asking the International Court of Justice (known as the World Court): "Is the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstance permitted under international law?" On 8 July the Court came close to answering with a categoric "no".
<P>
At last November's public hearings, the NATO nuclear states and Russia (China took no part) warned the Court that it would be ruling, in France's words, "not on an innocuous question but on an essential problem...one which is at the core of the national defence systems of a large number of States." The USA and UK added that an advisory opinion from the Court "could seriously disrupt current arms control negotiations" - a clear reference to the stalled Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty negotiations in Geneva. When these resume on 29 July, they will now have to contend with the unanimous demand by the Court's 14 judges that the nuclear weapon states honour their obligation in Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty "to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control."
<P>
More remarkably, the Court declared that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be "contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflict" in almost any imaginable circumstance.  The only exception, in paragraph E of its advisory opinion (of which more later), was that "in view of the current state of international law and of the elements of fact at its disposal, the Court cannot conclude definitively whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very survival of a State would be at stake."
<P>
The vote on these last two findings was 7 to 7, with the President - Algerian judge Bedjaoui - casting a second deciding vote. However, since three of the dissenting judges did so because they wanted no such exception, the vote for general illegality was effectively 10 to 4.
<P>
The British government had advised the Court to use its discretion not to answer this "hypothetical and essentially political" question.  By declining to do so, the Court asserted its function as the UN's judicial organ to uphold the law against the sweeping powers of the five permanent members of the Security Council. <P>
The World Court Project, an international network of lawyers, doctors and peace activists,  evolved the novel idea of using the Court via a General Assembly resolution.  They argued that the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention outlaws any use of these weapons of mass destruction regardless of size, even in self- defence.
Yet there is no such specific prohibition of nuclear weapons, though their effects are more severe, extensive and longlasting. They generate unparalleled blast and heat effects; their radioactive products create terrible health problems; and radioactivity's genetic effect is uniquely cumulative through an unknown number of generations.
<P>
The Project drew upon the anti-nuclear majority of UN member states, and by-passed the declared nuclear weapon states' veto in the Security Council.  Also it mobilised the public conscience in a new way.  Some 3.7 million individual signed Declarations of Public Conscience, mostly from Japan, were presented to the Court stating the belief that nuclear weapons are morally wrong.  They invoke the "de Martens" clause of the 1907 Hague Convention, which requires the Court to take into account the "dictates of the public conscience" when judging the conduct of war.  This was the first time the Court had accepted "citizens' evidence" in support of a case.
<P>
Forty-five governments participated, twice the number in any previous World Court case.  Over two-thirds argued for illegality, and only Germany and Italy testified orally in support of the NATO nuclear trio and Russia at the public hearings.  The Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, allowed to testify by the Japanese government after strong public pressure, were eloquent ambassadors for the victims of their devastated cities.
<P>
The implications of the Court's decision are far-reaching.  For example, NATO's insistence on the option to use nuclear weapons first is now illegal; as is the new UK-France sub-strategic deterrence doctrine of threatening "rogue" states with a low-yield warning shot if British or French "vital interests" are at risk. Moreover, by voting with the President, the Russian and Chinese judges indicated a split among the "Permanent Five".  Chinese judge Shi stated in his opinion that deterrence "...is within the realm of politics, not that of law...", but that it "should be an object of regulation by law..."  The Italian judge supported him, adding that "the concept of deterrence has no legal value." Most significant of all, British judge Dame Rosalyn Higgins effectively outlawed any use of Trident when she argued that " a weapon will be unlawful per se if it is incapable of being targeted at a military objective only... To the extent that a specific nuclear weapon would be incapable of this distinction, its use would be unlawful."
<P>
In my view as a former operator of nuclear weapons in the Fleet Air Arm, this places a duty on all military professionals in the nuclear states to review their whole attitude to nuclear weapons, which are now effectively in the same category as chemical and biological weapons.  They need to know that the Court cited the Nuremberg Principles in the body of customary international law to which nuclear weapons are now confirmed to be subject. Ironically, the Security Council unanimously endorsed these principles when setting up the War Crimes Tribunal on Bosnia. Military leaders who shrug off this Court opinion must be reminded that what distinguishes them from hired killers or terrorists is respect for the law: military, international and domestic law. <P>
In his statement justifyng his casting vote, judge Bedjaoui wrote: "There will be those who will not fail to interpret paragraph E as envisaging the possibility of states having recourse to nuclear arms in exceptional circumstances.  I cannot insist strongly enough that the inability of the Court to go further than the point it actually reached CANNOT IN ANY WAY BE INTERPRETED as itself evidence of a half-open door for the recognition of the legal permissibility of threatening or using nuclear weapons." (emphasis added)
<P>
Paradoxically, this crisis for the declared nuclear weapon states offers an opportunity for Britain to seize a world leadership role.  The moment has come for one of them to break ranks. Britain, with the smallest nuclear arsenal increasingly dependent on the USA, and Trident a growing embarrassment to the Royal Navy and Treasury, is best-placed to do so.  Championing the law, it could lead a powerful new drive for rapid prohibition of nuclear weapons in the same way as other weapons of mass destruction have been.  Such a bold U-turn would be widely welcomed, following global outrage at Chinese and French tests and the current deadlock over the CTBT negotiations.  Opinion polls last October showed that, even in Britain and France, 51% now reject nuclear weapons.  How about that for Britain's contribution to the new millenium?

<P>
<H3>Chris and Sara Theule-Lubienski Report on Guatemala</H3>
<P>
<H4> In Guatemala over Christmas break on a Witness For Peace
delegation, we just happened to run into Jennifer Harbury. It
wasn't a planned part of the trip. In fact, in view of WFP's mission
and non-alignment philosophy, we were asked not to have contact
with her, since she would be the first to admit that she was under
constant surveillance by agents of the Guatemalan military. Any
association with her could impugn WFP's standing in Guatemala
and could get some of the long-term volunteers (there on tourist
visas) kicked out for political activity.
<P>
Still, some of us wanted to speak with her. Jennifer Harbury
is an exciting character. She is a Texas attorney, educated at
Harvard. She was working with Guatemalan refugees fleeing to
the U.S. in the mid-1980s when she decided to go down to Guatemala
to see for herself what was happening. She ended up getting quite
involved in the movement for social justice there and married
Efrain Bamaca, a rebel leader with the ECP (the Guerrilla Army
of the Poor).
<P>
After a short stay in the U.S., they returned to Guatemala
and rejoined the struggle. Bamaca disappeared. Harbury had a miscarriage.
Bamaca was presumed dead until an escapee reported seeing him
alive in a military torture camp. Harbury began her crusade to
find out what happened to her husband. After much frustration,
she launched a hunger strike in front of the Guatemalan National
Palace, during which time armed men in passing cars pointed shotguns
at her, Mike Wallace and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interviewed her,
and the U.S. embassy continued in its insistence that it had no
knowledge of what had happened to her husband.
<P>
 After 32 days, Harbury was persuaded to end the strike and
instead begin discussions with the U.S. government about what
it knew.
<P>
After another four months of frustration, she began a second
hunger strike -- in front of the White House. It was then that
Rep. Torricelli (NJ), from the House Intelligence Committee, disclosed
the fact that the U.S. government knew that her husband had been
taken alive, that he had been tortured and murdered in captivity,
and that this atrocity had been presided over by a Guatemalan
officer -- Colonel Alpirez --who was being paid by the CIA. (Alpirez
was also implicated in the murder of U.S. citizen Michael DeVine.)
<P>
When we saw Harbury, she was in Guatemala to lay the legal
basis for litigation to find and recover her husband's body --
something the military was opposing at every turn. While she was
there, on January 5 of this year, her lawyer's car was bombed
in Washington, D.C. Later, Guotemolon children: Sacrificed to
Corpotrte ProtiC someone opened fire with an automatic weapon
on her residence in Washington.
<P>
In another chance meeting on the street, next to the shelter
for street kids, we asked her about the recent attacks (perhaps
we should have picked a more discreet spot). Apparently, the news
of the attacks had been blown out of the headlines by the big
snowstorm in the U.S. Still, she saw the attacks as a definite
message from the Guatemalan military (not the CIA -- &quot;the
CIA's not stupid&quot;) to silence her. But, after losing a husband
and a pregnancy, she felt that she didn't have anything else to
lose.
<P>
 Her case illuminates the need for a more complete disclosure
of our government's activities and knowledge about the situation
in Guatemala and other parts of Latin America. In another instance,
Sister Diana Ortiz, an Ursuline nun from Texas, was raped and
tortured by the Guatemalan military (by men under the command
of CIA &quot;asset&quot; Gen. Gramajo Furthermore,Sister Ortiz
said that a North American, someone connected to the U.S. Embassy,
presided over her torture before she escaped from his custody.
<P>
 We asked the embassy official in charge of human rights about
her allegations. Of course he denied any embassy involvement,
but U.S. embassy staff and the Guatemalan military have been documented
in a Campaign to discredit Ortiz (part of a bizarre lesbian love
affair, they claim).
<P>
 How can Guatemalans have any hope for democracy if we are
financing the torture and murder of political opponents in their
country? How can we have a democracy if our government is covertly
supporting undemocratic policies - without our consent - and the
torture and mur der of U.S. citizens?
<P>
In addition to a few U.S. citizens (we also saw the blood
stains of Father Stan Rother of Oklahoma, killed by the military
in Santiago Atitlan), hundreds of thousands of Cuatemalans have
been tortured, disappeared, and killed. To what extent has our
government been complicit in this travesty? We do know that some
of the leading architects of the violence in Latin America - including
Guatemala's Manuel Antonio Callejas y Callejas -- have been trained
at the taxpayer funded &quot;School of the Americas&quot; in Fort
Benning, CA. As Jennifer Harbury searches for her husband's body,
we need to know to what extent agents of our government have been
directing this slaughter.
<P>
On the School of the Americas --
<P>
Call your congressional representative and ask him or her
to support HR 2652 or 
<P>

<H2>Government Violence Threatens Merdcan Peace Talks</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<H3>The Peace Talks between the Zapatista National liberation
Front (EZLN) and the Mexican government are threatened by six
violent (and in two cases lethal) evictions by state police from
lands that had been occupied since last year by local peasants.
The evictions have taken place in the last three days while peace
negotiations have been underway.</H3>
<P>
<H3>The sites oflethal violence were in the municipalities of
Nicolas Ruiz and Pichucalco. peace negotiations continue in an
extremely tense atmosphere punctuated by angry denunciations of
the police actions by the EZLN delegation.</H3>
<P>
<H3>The following first hand report is based on a visit to Nicolas
Ruiz on March 22 by Terra Nunez, Global Exchange volunteer; Miguel
Angel de los Santos, human rights lawyer for the Organizations
of Non-governmental Organizations for Peace (CONPAZ); and Marcos
Arana, a physician also from CONPAZ.</H3>
<P>
<H3>On March 21, 1996, sixty campesinos were working on the property
called Gran Poder which they claim legal right to since 1734,
when they officaliy bought it from the Spanish colonizers. Peasants
had occupied Gran Poder (located three kilometers outside the
municipal capital of Nicolas Ruiz) last year. Nicolas Ruiz is
a Tzotzil indigenous municipality located about two hours southeast
of San Cristobal de las Casas.</H3>
<P>
<H3>At ten in the morning, trucks with over 100 police from the
Seguridad Publica (Public Security) arrived at Gran Poder. Police
surrounded the community and began firing tear gas and live ammunition
to drive the peasants off the land. Witnesses from the community
with whom the delegation spoke said the police had come not just
to evict them but &quot;to kill us&quot;.</H3>
<P>
<H3> At three o'clock the same day, the Mexican Federal Army arrived
to assist the Public Security with the continuing eviction.</H3>
<P>
<H3> The eviction at Gran Poder occurred without any prior notice
by the authorities and took the community by surprise. Three men,
Jose Alfonso Lara, Alfonso Moreno Alvarez, and Gilbaldo Ramirez
Reyes, were killed in the confrontation. One of them was shot
to death as he was eating his noon meal. The remaining men who
were working on the land at the time of the attack were d&quot;ested
by the police. In addition to the three dead peasants, one police
officer was killed. Twenty one peasants Were injured and at least
112 of them are currently being held in jail in Tuxtla Gutierrez,
the state capital.</H3>
<P>
<H3>These six violent evictions haw occurred just days after thirty
local campesino groups met with President Zedillo and signed accords
dealing with land tenure and production issues.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Community members ofNicolas Ruiz are demanding an end to
police attacks, freedom for those being detained, and swift punishment
of the police officers who provoked the confrontation.</H3>
<P>
<H3>In addition to the evictions at Gran Poder, there was a similar
violent eviction that resulted in the death of three peasants
in the municipality of Pichucalco at the finca &quot;Platanera
San Luis del Sureste&quot; on the 20th of March.</H3>

<CENTER><H2>Situation in the West Bank Remains Critical</H2>
</CENTER><P>
<H4> Despite the recent easing of the internal closure of the
West Bank on Saturday, 16 March, the human rights situation in
the West Bank remains critical. Hospitals and clinics have been
unable to resume badly needed treatments for lack of medication
and supplies, military checkpoints remain throughout the West
Bank, and several villages remain under curfew. In addition, it
has become clear that settlers have used this period of siege
on Palestinian towns and villages to carry out acts of aggression
against Palestinian land Finally, the witch hunt continues against
Islamic institutions, with two additional charity organizations
shut down by the Israeli army.</H4>
<P>
<H4> In economic terms, the past two weeks have taken a devastating
toll as the siege not only prevented workers and goods from entering
Israel but prevented internal travel as well. Even with the easing
of restrictions inside the West Bank, the sealing off of the West
Bank and Gaza from Israel continues to cripple the Palestinian
economy. President Arafat has stated that this type of total closure
represents a daily loss of about 6 million dollars, and approximately
70,000 workers from the West Bank and Cats are unable to reach
their workplaces in Jerusalem and Israel.</H4>
<P>
<H4> Hospitals and clinics still await badly needed medication
as supplies have still been held up at the military checkpoints
into the West Bank. Advanced treatments like chemotherapy have
had to be suspended due to the lack of supplies. Two days after
the easing of the internal closure this situation remains critical.</H4>
<P>
<H4>On the day after the easing of the internal closure, Israeli
military checkpoints remained in place between Areas A, B and
C, hindering movement between these Areas.</H4>
<P>
<H4> On 16 March, the Israeli army entered Rumana village near
Jenin and arrested three men. The figures for the total arrested
by the Israeli army in the West Bank varies widely, partly because,
due to the internal state of siege, family members were not able
to go to the Red Cross offices and report missing or arrested
family members. Some estimates put the number as high as 1000.</H4>
<P>
<H4> On 17 March, two additional Islamic charity institutions
were closed by the Israeli army. Israeli army and police raided
the Holy Land Fund in Jerusalem, confiscated documents, and ordered
the office closed for 14 days. Even more serious, army and police
forcibly entered the Islamic Relief Committee in Nazareth and
confiscated money, checks, documentation, fax machines, computers,
and other office equipment. The office was then closed and welded
shut.</H4>
<P>
<H4> On 17 March, Israeli Prime Minister Peres again went on record
as supporting the expulsion of HAMAS members.</H4>
<P>
<H4> On 17 March, in Walja village near Bethlehem, curfew was
imposed for the second time since 5 March, 20 men were arrested,
and many houses raided. By 18 March, total curfew remained in
effect for the third straight week in Rafat, Burqa and Qariut
villages, near Nablus, and in al Fawar refugee camp near Hebron.</H4>
<P>
<H4> The Israeli army set up a new military checkpoint at the
entrance to Habla village, near Qalqilya, and soldiers stopped
all cars and residents entering and leaving the village. No reason
for this additional checkpoint was given.</H4>
<P>
<H4> Efrat settlement took advantage of the internal siege of
the West Bank to seize land belonging to El Khader residents.
Settlers have begun excavating the land in preparation for the
building of new housing units on the land. Residents were only
able to seek legal advice after the easing of the internalclosure.</H4>
<P>
<H4> The Jahalin Bedouin tribe continues to receive eviction orders
and house/tent demolition orders from the Israeli government to
make way for the continuing expansion of Ma'aleh Adumim settlement,
located between Jerusalem and Jericho in the West Bank.</H4>
<P>
<H4>Wanted:</H4>
<P>
<H4>On 16 March, a resident of Fardes village, near</H4>
<P>
<H4>Bethlehem, received a warning of demolition against this home.</H4>
<P>
<H4> On 17 March residents of Tamoun village, between Nablus and
Jenin, discovered that during the siege, settlers from Beqa'ot
and Roi settlements had seized and destroyed 1500 dunums (375
acres) of land cultivated with wheat. Residents put the loss of
this land, some of the richest agricultural land in this area,
at approximately one million dollars. This represents a massive
economic loss for this village.</H4>
<P>
<H4> On 18 March, the Israeli army demolished a house in Shoqa,
near Tulkarem, for having no permit. This brings to 62 the total
number of houses demolished since the signing of the Oslo Accord
in September 1993.</H4>
<P>
<H4> Since the Tel Aviv bombing on 4 March, four houses have been
demolished, and another seven have received demolition orders
and have been sealed.</H4>

<P>
<CENTER><H2>Massive Sweep of Birzeit Area Villages</H2>
</CENTER><P>
<H3> The following was received by the Christian Peacemaker Team
in Hebron. Birzeit, the oldest university in the West Bank, has
been a political and cultural center for Palestine since 1967.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Since Birzeit's phone lines were all down at the moment,
a group of international students and faculty, including Carmen
Pauls, former Hebron CPTer, requested that this release be put
out over CPT net.</H3>
<P>
<H3> &quot;Birzeit, Palestine--In the early hours of the morning,
at least 370 Palestinians in the villages of Birzeit, Abu Qash,
and Abu Shukhaydim were roused from their sleep and taken from
their homes in the largest Israeli raid since the signing of the
Oslo Accords.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Many of the detainees are Birzeit University students. Although
Israel Defense Force (IDF) authorities claimed to be targeting
Hamas militants and students from Gaza, the majority of those
taken in for questioning were West Bank residents.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Furthermore, the arrests appeared to be haphazard. Among
those picked up were individuals from a variety of political factions,
including Christians from Bethlehem and elsewhere. The detainees
were held in a playground near the Birzeit campus before being
taken away, blindfolded and in handcuffs. IDF forces imposed house
arrest on the village from 3:30 am to 10 am, forbidding residents
to leave their homes.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Hundreds of Israeli soldiers, aided by helicopter surveillance,
broke down apartment doors and forced residents, including women
and children, into the street while the premises were searched.</H3>
<P>
<H3> As a result of this military operation, classes at Birzeit
were once again disrupted. The university was essentially closed
for several weeks due to restrictions on travel imposed by the
Israeli military, and classes resumed only ten days ago.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Spontaneous demonstrations broke out at the Birzeit-Ramallah
military checkpoint when the students and faculty were prevented
from reaching the University. At least one student was injured
and taken to the hospital. A Swedish choir that was scheduled
to perform at Birzeit today was also held up and, in a gesture
of support, sang several pieces from their repertoire at the checkpoint.</H3>
<P>
<H3>In the afternoon, Birzeit student leaders organized a convocation
at the university, followed by a demonstration near the Israeli
military headquarters in Beit El. Faculty and students expressed
their solidarity with those detained and protested the massive
human rights violations, including the use of collective punishment.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Israeli troops fired into the air, injuring at least one
woman. Faculty and students are concerned that the Israeli roundup
might be a prelude to closing the University.</H3>
<P>
<H3>Submitted by members of the International Community at Birzeit
University</H3><CENTER><CENTER><IMG SRC="snake2.gif"></CENTER>

<H2>Chris and Sara Theule-Lubienski Report on Guatemala</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<H3> In Guatemala over Christmas break on a Witness For Peace
delegation, we just happened to run into Jennifer Harbury. It
wasn't a planned part of the trip. In fact, in view of WFP's mission
and non-alignment philosophy, we were asked not to have contact
with her, since she would be the first to admit that she was under
constant surveillance by agents of the Guatemalan military. Any
association with her could impugn WFP's standing in Guatemala
and could get some of the long-term volunteers (there on tourist
visas) kicked out for political activity.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Still, some of us wanted to speak with her. Jennifer Harbury
is an exciting character. She is a Texas attorney, educated at
tlarvard. She was working with Guatemalan refugees fleeing to
the U.S. in the mid-1980s when she decided to go down to Guatemala
to see for herself what was happening. She ended up getting quite
involved in the movement for social justice there and married
Efrain Bamaca, a rebel leader with the ECP (the Guerrilla Army
of the Poor).</H3>
<P>
<H3>After a short stay in the U.S., they returned to Guatemala
and rejoined the struggle. Bamaca disappeared. Harbury had a miscarriage.
Bamaca was presumed dead until an escapee reported seeing him
alive in a military torture camp. Harbury began her crusade to
find out what happened to her husband. After much frustration,
she launched a hunger strike in front of the Guatemalan National
Palace, during which time armed men in passing cars pointed shotguns
at her, Mike Wallace and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interviewed her,
and the U.S. embassy continued in its insistence that it had no
knowledge of what had happened to her husband.</H3>
<P>
<H3>  After 32 days, Harbury was persuaded to end the strike and
instead begin discussions with the U.S. government about what
it knew.</H3>
<P>
<H3>After another four months of frustration, she began a second
hunger strike -- in front of the White House. It was then that
Rep. Torricelli (NJ), from the House Intelligence Committee, disclosed
the fact that the U.S. government knew that her husband had been
taken alive, that he had been tortured and murdered in captivity,
and that this atrocity had been presided over by a Guatemalan
officer -- Colonel Alpirez --who was being paid by the CIA. (Alpirez
was also implicated in the murder of U.S. citizen Michael DeVine.)</H3>
<P>
<H3> When we saw Harbury, she was in Guatemala to lay the legal
basis for litigation to find and recover her husband's body --
something the military was opposing at every turn. While she was
there, on January 5 of this year, her lawyer's car was bombed
in Washington, D.C. Later, Guotemolon children: Sacrificed to
Corpotrte ProtiC someone opened fire with an automatic weapon
on her residence in Washington.</H3>
<P>
<H3> In another chance meeting on the street, next to the shelter
for street kids, we asked her about the recent attacks (perhaps
we should have picked a more discreet spot). Apparently, the news
of the attacks had been blown out of the headlines by the big
snowstorm in the U.S. Still, she saw the attacks as a definite
message from the Guatemalan military (not the CIA -- &quot;the
CIA's not stupid&quot;) to silence her. But, after losing a husband
and a pregnancy, she felt that she didn't have anything else to
lose.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Her case illuminates the need for a more complete disclosure
of our government's activities and knowledge about the situation
in Guatemala and other parts of Latin America. In another instance,
Sister Diana Ortiz, an Ursuline nun from Texas, was raped and
tortured by the Guatemalan military (by men under the command
of CIA &quot;asset&quot; Gen. Gramajo Furthermore,Sister Ortiz
said that a North American, someone connected to the U.S. Embassy,
presided over her torture before she escaped from his custody.</H3>
<P>
<H3> We asked the embassy official in charge of human rights about
her allegations. Of course he denied any embassy involvement,
but U.S. embassy staff and the Guatemalan military have been documented
in a Campaign to discredit Ortiz (part of a bizarre lesbian love
affair, they claim).</H3>
<P>
<H3>  How can Guatemalans have any hope for democracy if we are
financing the torture and murder of political opponents in their
country? How can we have a democracy if our government is covertly
supporting undemocratic policies - without our consent - and the
torture and mur der of U.S. citizens?</H3>
<P>
<H3>In addition to a few U.S. citizens (we also saw the blood
stains of Father Stan Rother of Oklahoma, killed by the military
in Santiago Atitlan), hundreds of thousands of Cuatemalans have
been tortured, disappeared, and killed. To what extent has our
government been complicit in this travesty? We do know that some
of the leading architects of the violence in Latin America - including
Guatemala's Manuel Antonio Callejas y Callejas -- have been trained
at the taxpayer funded &quot;School of the Americas&quot; in Fort
Benning, CA. As Jennifer Harbury searches for her husband's body,
we need to know to what extent agents of our government have been
directing this slaughter.</H3>

<H2>Support Landmine Ban</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<H3> The Peace Education Center is one of the listed national sponsors supporting an international
ban on landmines.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Given the apparent momentum in the shifting of U.S. government
policy on the landmines issue and the reconvening of the CCW Conference
in Geneva at the end  of April, it is especially important to urge a total ban on
anti-personnel landmines.</H3>
<P>
<H3> Please write or phone these key individuals and if possible,
send copies of your letters to US Campaign to Ban Landmines, c/o

<P>
<H2>Coordinator's Corner</H2>
<P>
<H3>Greetings!</H3>
<P>
<H3> Allow me to introduce myself: my name is Amy Cairns. The
Board welcomed me to the Peace Education Center as coordinator
in mid-January. I am having a wonderful time and have enjoyed
meeting many of you already.</H3>
<P>
<H3> For those of you I haven't met, I'11 tell you a little about
myself and the work I will be doing here at the Center.</H3>
<P>
<H3> I first came to the Lansing Area as a student at MSU, over
five years ago. I was active on campus with many women's organizations,
as well as serving in a series of appointments with the University.</H3>
<P>
<H3> I have also been deeply involved with the Mid-Michigan Clothesline
Project, a project focusing on violence against women. We have
traveled throughout Mid-Michigan, spoken at academic conferences,
to classrooms, and been featured in several local journals and
in the press.</H3>
<P>
<H3> In addition to Clothesline Project programming and publicity,
I have been involved in some freelance projects as well, such
as speak-ins, the Celebration of Audre Lorde evening of poetry
and film and Sexual Assault Awareness Month activities. I bring
with me varied skills and experience from my years as a campus
activist.</H3>
<P>
<H3> I currently work ten hours a week at the PEC. With your help,
I am looking forward to making 1996 a truly great year for peace
and justice in the Lansing area.</H3>
<P>
<H3> My work will concentrate on improving office accessibility
and resource materials as well as working with the membership
and coordinating volunteer efforts.</H3>
<P>
<H3>I believe that the next year will be pivotal to the future
of the Greater Lansing community and I know that working together
we can succeed in creating the type of community in which we all
want to live.</H3>
<P>
<H3> I am generally in the office on Mondays and on Wednesday
afternoons. The rest of my schedule tends to shift based on the
needs of volunteers and other members. I look forward to meeting
you.</H3>
<P>
<H3>In Peace,</H3>
<P>

How These Figures Were Determined</H1>
</center><P>
 <STRONG>All these dollar figures are for fiscal year 1995, as reported
in the Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1995.
The percentages are Federal Funds, calculated after removing Trust
Funds (such as Social Security), which are raised and spent
separately from income taxes. What you pay (or don't pay) on April
15 goes only to the Federal Funds portion of the budget. The government
practice of combining Trust Funds and Federal Funds (the so-called
&quot;Unified Budget&quot;) began in the 1960's during the Vietnam
War, The government presentation makes the human needs portion
of the budget seem larger and the military portion smaller.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG> &quot;Current military&quot; spending adds together money
allocated for the Department of Defense ($259 billion) plus the
&quot;defense&quot; portion from other parts of the budget. Spending
on nuclear weapons (without their delivery systems) amounts to
about 1% of the total budget.</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG> &quot;Past military&quot; is represented by veterans' benefits
plus 80% of the interest on the national debt. If there had been
no military spending, most (if not all) of the national debt would
have been eliminated. Analysts differ on how much of the debt
stems from the military; estimates range from 50% to 100%.</STRONG>
<P>
<CENTER><STRONG>We felt that 80% may even be conservative.</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>
<STRONG>In recent years we have used budget outlays of the fiscal
year we are in and pay (or refuse to pay for on April 15. With
this chart we are shifting to figures of the President's proposed
budget. This allows you to lobby for change before the new budget
begins in Oct, 1994. Therefore, note that the &quot;Where Your
Income Tax Money Really Goes&quot; series skipped fiscal year
1994.</STRONG>

<H1>The Government Deception</H1>
<P>
<IMG SRC="tax02.gif" HSPACE=1.5 ALIGN=right>
<H3>The pie chart  is the Administration's view of the budget
(and similar to the figures you'll see in your IRS booklet or
the media). This is a distortion of how our income tax dollars
are spent because it includes Trust Funds (e.g., Social Security)
and buries the expenses of past military spending in nonmilitary
parts of the pie. For a more accurate representation of how your
Federal income tax dollar is really spent, see the large chart.</H3>

<H1><CENTER>Poll Finds U.S. Citizens Expect Peace Dividend</CENTER></H1>
<P><IMG SRC="tax03.gif" HSPACE=1.5 ALIGN=right>
<H4>&quot;Three out of four Americans say the warming of relations
between the United States and the Soviet Union can open the way
for cuts in military spending; by a wide margin they want this 'peace dividend' spent to fight problems here at home....&quot;</H4>
<P>
<H4> But there is no more &quot;Soviet Union&quot; you say? Right.
The quote above and chart are from 1990.*  President George Bush
was about to present the fiscal year 1991 budget, and the Cold
War between the two world superpowers was melting. The Berlin
Wall had fallen and change was sweeping Eastern Europe.</H4>
<P>
<H4> Flip this sheet over and we're up to date. In February 1994,
President Bill Clinton sent this budget proposal to Congress and
to the American people for comment. The percentages tell all:
change has not swept the U.S. government. We are still waiting
for that &quot;peace dividend,&quot; while homelessness, hunger,
unemployment, pollution, poverty, poor schools, and hopelessness
plague our society and so much of the world. </H4>
<P>
<H4>In the next five years the Pentagon will spend $1.3 trillion
for the so-called &quot;defense&quot; of the U.S. That's $400,000
a minute for guns, missiles, submarines, and soldiers, yet people
do not feel safe in their homes. The 1995 budget includes $28
billion for secret military programs; this &quot;black budget&quot;
is even secret from most of Congress.</H4>
<P>
<STRONG><EM>  <H4> Setting the priorities of the nation is everyone's business.</H4></EM></STRONG>
<P>
<H4>The people have called for a peace dividend, so why are we
still spending our hard-earned tax dollars teaching young people
to kill? Let's give them scholarships to become doctors for rural
communities. Foreign countries would welcome U.S. doctors instead
of U.S. soldiers. With that $400,000 a minute, let's retrain the
workers who build military weapons to build trains and buses,
to fix our roads and bridges, to clean up the environment. Let's
take the billions from &quot;Star Wars&quot; military systems
and create a &quot;Star Wars&quot; to fight AIDS, breast cancer,
and infant mortality. </H4>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="fish2.gif"></CENTER>
<H2><EM>Set your own priorities. How would you finish this sentence:</EM></H2>
<P>
<H3>  Let's take (circle one) $50 billion/$100 billion/$200 billion/ALL
$302 billion from the military and spend it on ______________________________.</H3>

<CENTER><H2>Now tell that to the President and Congress.</H2></CENTER>

<H2>WHAT YOU CAN DO</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><H3> Refuse to pay the 3% federal excise tax on your phone bills.
This tax has been used symbolically as a 
war tax since World War I. Nonpayment of the federal tax is
between you and the IRS and should not 
result in cut-off of phone service. Though illegal, non-payment
of the tax is almost risk-free. The thousands of people now refusing
this tax have made it virtually uncollectible. <EM>Please contact
us for more details.</EM></H3>
<LI><P>
<LI><H3> Refuse to pay all or part of your income tax. Though illegal,
thousands of Americans are openly participating in this form of
protest. You can take control of your paycheck and avoid contributing
to the military. Contact us for information or referral to a war
tax resistance counselor near you.</H3>
<LI><P>
<LI><H3>Contribute resisted tax money to an organization working to
help people (e.g., day care centers, health clinics, food banks,
housing programs, international human rights organizations) or
to an alternative fund which pools tax money from resisters and
gives grants to human needs and peace groups.</H3>
<LI><P>
<LI><H3>Demonstrate and leaflet on April 15 at the IRS or a post office
where returns are mailed at the last minute.</H3>
<LI><P>
<LI><H3>Develop a community of support for those doing or contemplating
war tax resistance. Resistance is Strengthened if people can remove
the sense of iso lation and talk about their fears about resistence.
 Contact us for groups in your area.</H3></UL>

<P><h3>Building the Bement Library</h3></P>
<P><h4><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>
ollowing the crash of 1929, monetary chaos in  the large financial centers crept gradually out to the smaller communities.  In 1933 the banks in Saint Johns reluctantly closed for federally mandated bank holidays.  There was discomfort among the population but no panic.  Thanks to the conservative banking policies of people like John C. Hicks, Coleman C. Vaughn, Arthur E. Wilson, and O.P. DeWitt, banks in Saint Johns were still fiscally sound.</P>
<P>People in Saint Johns were also suspicious of make-work and boondoggling federal programs and generally shied away from PWA projects.  In 1934, however, the City availed itself of a PWA grant to develop the old Emmons Woods land into a modern city park </P>
<P>On September 9, 1938 the City of Saint Johns petitioned the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works for a grant to aid in financing the construction of and equipping of a Library City Hall.  They designated R.V. Gay as the architect.  </P>
<P> The three City Commissioners that year were Harry Bradley, George Brooks and George H. Schoenhals.  Two weeks later they voted to take $20,428.88 from the Bement fund, $6,593.87 from the General Fund, and $477.25 from the Water fund and place the whole $27,500 into the Library City Hall Building account.</P>
<P>Then on October 31, 1938 it was announced that Saint Johns had received federal approval for two grants of $22,500 each to help finance construction of a new Perrin School and a City Hall-Library building.  Actually the Federal government agreed to supply 45% of funding for the buildings, not to exceed $22,500.  All equipment for the City's building, except for the books, was to be purchased with the Federal money.  Work on the new buildings could commence no later than December 31, 1938; and the project was to be completed within 10 months.</P>
<P>On November 9 the Commission voted to purchase Carl Bunge's second hand store and the American Legion Hall, lots 7 and 8 of Block number 7.  The next night they accepted the options given them by the Bunges and Leah Fowler Hunt.</P>
<P>The American Legion was offered $1500 and the building across the street that was then being occupied by the Building and Loan Association, the Royal Neighbors, and the Modern Woodmen.  The City took $5,000 out of the water fund for the Legion to purchase the building from Mrs. Hunt.  Then they contributed $25 to the Royal Neighbors and the Modern Woodmen to help them move.  The Bunge building was purchased for $3,000 that was also taken from the Water fund.</P>
<P>Contracts were awarded on December 24.  Hudson and Howe of Owosso had bid $39,336 for the general contract work.  The Plumbing and Heating contract went to C.G. Brenner of Lansing with a bid of $6,504.  Reed-Tyler Electric of Lansing had bid $2,616.  The first estimate was that the building would cost $50,000.  Now it appeared that it would cost $52,500; so another $2500 was taken out of the Water fund </P>
<P>In the summer of 1939 $3,600 was taken from the general fund and placed into a separate Library Fund.  The Park Commission's budget was set at $1,400.  The City Commission appropriated $3,600 for the Fire Department </P>
<P>On June 27, 1939 an amendatory application to PWA Project Michigan 1816 F was submitted to the Federal government asking for an increase in the grant.  Changes and additions made by the Commission had raised the general contractor's expenses to $43,499.50.  Plumbing and Heating now would cost $7,309.54.  Electrical wiring would amount to $2,604.00.  The Hardware contract, awarded to VanDervoort Hardware in Lansing, stood at $921.60.  Venetian Blinds would cost $700.  The equipment fo for the building would cost another $3,800.  Legal and administrative costs would be $150.  Another $165.36 was written into the grant application for contingencies.  The total cost of everything, except the books, was going to be $63,000.</P>
<P>The City needed another $13,000 and put up their 55% of that amount, $7,150.  The Commission was asking that the Federal government add $5,850 to the original $22,500 grant.  </P>
<P> The Federal government approved the amended application on October 16, 1939.  A few days later the Commission requested an extension of the project completion time from October 28 to December 28, 1939.  This request also was granted.</P>
<P>Architect R.V. Gay attended that same meeting and told the Commissioners that he had purchased brass letters spelling out &quot;Bement Library&quot; and Municipal Building.&quot;  The letters would cost $135.  Due to time constraints, the Commission decided to assume this expense outside the general contract.</P>
<P>A document of completion was issued to the contractors and sent to the PWA on December 19, 1939.  A month later the Commission found that another $7.79 was needed to complete the project.  It was taken from the Water fund.  The final cost of the building and its contents was $63,507.79.</P>
<P>At the December 19, 1940 meeting the City Commissioners appointed a Library Board of five directors for the newly established library pursuant to the provisions of Act 164 of the Public Acts of 1877 as Amended, being sec. 8059 to 8075 inclusive, Compiled Laws of Michigan for 1929, to serve from January 1, 1940 for the following terms:</P>
<P>Frank P. Buck for the term of five (5) years.</P>
<P>Miss Winifred C. Daboll for the term of four (4) years.</P>
<P>Myron E. Ward for the term of three (3) years.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lee A. DeWitt for the term of two (2) years.</P>
<P>Mrs. Robert J. Merrill for the term of one (1) year.</P>
<P>THE CITY OFFICES</P>
<P>The City offices opened first.  City manager Theodore H. Townsend and Miss Ada Cochrane, the city clerk, moved in on Monday February 19, 1940.  The next night the City Commission held its first regular meeting in the new Commission chambers.</P>
<P>Besides the city offices and library, the building contained an auditorium and dining hall which included a stage and kitchen facilities.   There were club rooms and two public toilets in the basement.</P>
<P>Built of buff brick and stone, the City Hall-Library was a 50x80-foot two-story structure which effectively used the basement as a third story.  The front elevation on Walker Street extended east 50 feet from the fire hall with a 16-foot lawn on Spring.  The east elevation, extending north from Walker, had a double entrance to the library on the first floor and the club rooms in the basement.</P>
<P>On the Walker Street side there was a recessed entrance trimmed with stone and three ornamental bronze lights. </P>
<P> Just inside the double doors was a small vestibule, wainscoted in tile, that lead to the main hall.  At the left a wide stairway rose to the second floor. Built into one approach to the stairs was a wall of glass block that concealed electric lights which added to the illumination given off by overhead chandeliers.</P>
<P>The first door at the right of the hall opened into the 14x20 foot Commission chamber.  Beyond this room to the east and north were three smaller offices for the city manager, engineer and assessor.</P>
<P>On down the main hall beyond the Commission room door, the next turn to the right led to a small lobby flanked on the north by the 13x22 foot city clerk's office with public counters for the transaction of business.  At the west end of this office was a 9x14 foot fireproof vault equipped with a heavy steel door.  Adjacent to the lobby were cloak rooms for the use of city officials.</P>
<P>The main hall was terrazzo floor while the lobby and several offices were floored with asphalt tile.  All of the building's windows had Venetian blinds.</P>
<P>At the north end of the first floor hall was a stairway descending to the basement and a narrow hall leading to the library.  Off this latter hall to the west were two small rest rooms.</P>
<P>THE LIBRARY</P>
<P>The main approach to the library was from the Spring Street side of the building, up a few steps from the street level to a small platform with an iron railing. The monumental type brick entrance with its double doors led to the small vestibule and on into the library.</P>
<P>The main library room was 40 feet long by 30 feet wide with  ventilator type windows along the north and east walls.  From the colorful mosaic ceiling hung several white metal chandeliers.  The library and the other rooms on the first and second floors were considered sound-proofed.  Along all sides of the library, and between and under the windows, were book shelves of various heights.  There was space for between 6,000 and 7,000 volumes.</P>
<P>Library equipment included tables and chairs for public use, magazine racks, a special charge desk, and a work room for the librarian.  The woodwork was of birch, as it was throughout the whole building.</P>
<P>THE AUDITORIUM</P>
<P>The combined auditorium and dining hall was equipped with a maple floor suitable for dancing.  Its approximately 48 square feet were built to accommodate 300 persons at a banquet and at least 400 for a play or public meeting.  </P>
<P>The auditorium's colored ceiling was done in Celotex, and there were nine indirect lighting fixtures and four other lights set flush in the ceiling.  Two large radiators along the east wall were equipped with fans and allegedly provided direct radiant heat and air conditioning.</P>
<P>The stage was nearly 27 feet wide by 12 feet deep with fluted pilasters on either side of the proscenium arch.  The curtain was done in wine colored velour with a matching valance trimmed in gold.  Under the stage was storage space for tables and 400 wood and metal folding chairs.</P>
<P>At the top of the stairway leading to the second floor was a 9x30 foot kitchen with electric stove and refrigerator, cupboard space, and two sinks.  Between the kitchen and auditorium was a serving room and a cloak room.</P>
<P><B>THE BASEMENT</B></P>
<P>The organization rooms in the basement were reached by means of the curving stairs on the Spring Street side. This entrance was directly below that of the library and opened into a small lobby serving both the large and small organization rooms.  One had dimensions of 30x40 feet and the other was 22x25 feet.  Adjacent to these was a smaller room used as a kitchen.  These organization rooms were ventilated by means of eight-foot ceilings and were lighted for daytime use by well-type windows.</P>
<P>At the rear of the building on the north side was a small door with stairs leading to all three floors.  This was called the stage entrance because the door at the top connected directly with the auditorium's stage.</P>
<P>The boiler that provided heat for both the Municipal Building and the fire hall also was located in the basement's south side.</P>
<P><B><I>THE </I></B><B>FIRST LIBRARY </B></P>
<P><B>BOARD</B></P>
<P>The first meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bement Library was held on January 25, 1940.  The members were sworn in by City Clerk Ada Cochrane.  Myron Ward, a member of the City Commission, opened the meeting and appointed Mr. Buck temporary chairman.</P>
<P>Officers for that first Library Board included Frank Buck, president; Teresa Merrill, secretary; and Nina DeWitt, treasurer.</P>
<P>Winifred Daboll, Myron Ward, and Teresa Merrill were appointed to a committee to develop rules and regulations for the new library.</P>
<P>City Manager Theodore Townsend spoke briefly about the lack of interest shown in good reading at the present time.  He believed, he said, that this was due at least in part to the general condition of unrest among the people.</P>
<P>Finally a letter was introduced from the Ministerial Association asking that some religious books be included in the selection of new books.</P>
<P>At the next meeting on February 1, 1940 letters of application for the position of Librarian were read.  The Board voted to tender the position to Miss Minnie Barrington.</P>
<P>A Constitution and By-Laws had been approved at the February 1, 1940 meeting.  This document included the following paragraphs:</P>
<P><B>CONSTITUTION</B></P>
<P>The name of this body shall be the Board of Directors of the Municipal Library of St. Johns, or the Bement Public Library. </P>
<P>The Board of Directors shall consist of five members appointed January 1st, 1940 by the Mayor of St. Johns for the terms of five, four, three, two, and one years respectively, as provided by sections 8060-11 of Act 248 of Public Libraries Laws of the State of Michigan.  Thereafter the Mayor shall appoint annually one member for five years.</P>
<P>The Mayor shall have power, with the consent of the City Commission, to remove any director for misconduct or neglect of duty.</P>
<P>No officers except the librarian and assistant shall receive any compensation.</P>
<P>This Constitution may be added to at the annual meeting by the unanimous vote of the Board of Directors.</P>
<P><B>BY LAWS</B></P>
<P>Powers of the Board</P>
<P>of Directors</P>
<P>I.  The Board of Directors shall have power to make and adopt by-laws and rules and regulations not inconsistent with the Act regarding Public Libraries.</P>
<P>II.  To have exclusive control of all moneys collected to the credit of the Library Fund, but to be disbursed only by the officers of the City of St. Johns upon vouchers properly authenticated by the Librarian.</P>
<P>III.  To have supervision, care and custody of the rooms set apart for the purposes of the Library.</P>
<P>IV.  To exclude from the use of the Library any and all persons who shall willfully violate its rules.</P>
<P>V.  To appoint a suitable librarian and assistant and to fix their compensations and also to remove such appointees.</P>
<P>VI.  To purchase books, periodicals, newspapers and other material and supplies and furnishings needful for a library.</P>
<P><B>RULES AND REGULATIONS</B></P>
<P>The Library shall be free to the inhabitants of St. Johns, subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the Board; and to the inhabitants of Clinton County except that persons unknown to the librarian must present a card signed by some responsible resident of St. Johns.  The use of books in the Reading Room shall be free to all persons but, transients shall not take books from the Reading room.</P>
<P>The Library shall be open daily except Sunday and Legal Holidays;</P>
<P>Monday, Wednesday, Thurs-day and Saturday 1 - 5 P.M.</P>
<P>Tuesday and Friday 2 - 4 and 7 - 9 P.M.</P>
<P>No talking or noise shall be permitted that disturbs those engaged in the legitimate use of the Library.</P>
<P>Reference and current newspapers and magazines shall not be taken from the Reading Room.</P>
<P>A fine of two cents a day shall be collected upon books held beyond the allotted time.  Failure to pay the fine shall entail forfeiture of the privilege of drawing books or other materials from the Library until the fine is paid.</P>
<P>The Library shall not be available for meetings of committees, groups of individuals or organizations except those of the Library Board.</P>
<P><B>DUTIES OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS</B></P>
<P>I.   The Board shall make at the close of each and every year a report to the City Commission of their trust, including:</P>
<P><B><I>        </I></B>a)  All sums of mo<B><I>ney</I></B></P>
<P><B><I>        received and their sources.</I></B></P>

<P>d)  Number of books and periodicals added and their sources.</P>
<P>e)  Number of books and periodicals lost and missing.</P>
<P>f)  Number of books and periodicals lent.</P>
<P>g)  General character of book and periodicals lent.</P>
<P>h)  Suggestions of policy in conduct of library.</P>
<P>The Board shall make a report on the receipt and expenditure of money; on the number of books on hand, the number of books lost, the number missing and purchased.</P>
<P>Later the Board voted to inset a paragraph to the effect that full price, less 10%, should be charged for any lost book.</P>
<P>Winifred Daboll suggested that various civic organizations be asked to contribute magazine subscriptions to the library.  These magazines, along with any books, were to be subject to the approval of the Library Board, the Librarian, and ultimately the State Librarian Mrs. McClure.</P>
<P>On February 28 the completed selection of books was put up for bids, and a $16 dictionary and a $2.50 bound .cb</P>
<P>secretary's book were purchased from Parr's Drug Store.</P>
<P>Two weeks later the Board voted to accept the $442.76 bid from Boker and Taylor for the list of books that would be available when the library opened.</P>
<P>Just before the library opened for the first time, the Board agreed to purchase the Bliss library of 170 books for $50.  Miss Eleanor Trask was hired to be the Assistant Librarian. She would be expected to work 5 1/2 days per week at regular compensation.  Finally Board members decided to order the Detroit Free Press as the daily newspaper for the reading room.  Now all was in readiness for the long awaited opening of the Bement Public Library.</P>
<P>OPENING DAY</P>
<P>The Bement Library first opened its doors to the public on Saturday, April 13, 1940.  Miss Minnie Barrington, who most recently had been the librarian at  Rodney B. Wilson High School, was in charge.</P>
<P>The work of cataloging books had been going on for weeks. &quot;There are fifteen separate entries and operations necessary before a book is available to the public,&quot; Miss Barrington had explained.  &quot;This must be done carefully and accurately in order that the patron may find the wanted information with a minimum of delay and to assure that the whereabouts of any book may be known at all times.&quot;</P>
<P>One of the first donations received by the new Bement Library was a gift of $50 from the St. Johns Woman's Club.  The first 500 books were largely works of fiction and biography.  Miss Winifred Daboll, a member of the Library Board, said that the reading tastes and habits of the patrons would be studied and used as a guide for future purchases.  </P>
<P>Because the furniture for the children's corner had not yet arrived, the juvenile books would not be placed in circulation until a week later.</P>
<P>Right from the beginning children were an important part of the Bement Public Library.  Of those first five Library Board members, three had spent their lives in the education of Saint Johns children.</P>
<P>FRANK P. BUCK</P>
<P>Board Chairman, Frank P. Buck, was a home town boy.  His family home was located at 207 Breckenridge Street in Emmonsville.  This would later become 507 W. Baldwin.</P>
<P>Frank Buck graduated from the St. Johns High School in 1892 and returned as principal in 1899.  Later he was made Superintendent of Schools, an office he filled until 1931.  He stayed on as principal of the high school until his retirement in 1939. </P>
<P>On October 8, 1937 the high school athletic field at the new City Park was named the Frank P. Buck Field.  Two high school seniors, James Kelly and Robert Ebert, had first proposed naming the field in his honor.  Phyllis Osgood was the Athletic Queen.</P>
<P>In June, 1944 the Library Board sent a bouquet of flowers to Mr. Buck who was ill.  A month later he was dead; and the Board Secretary, Miss Winifred Daboll, was named Chairman of the Board.</P>
<P>WINIFRED C. DABOLL</P>
<P>Winifred Campbell Daboll was also a long-time Saint Johns resident.  Her father, Judge Sherman B. Daboll, was something of a self-made man.  In his Past and Present of Clinton County, Michigan Daboll recounted how he had made his own way in the world beginning at the age of nine years.  He had served in the Civil War with a regiment from New York.  </P>
<P> After the war, the young Daboll had studied law with various upstate New York law firms.  In 1869 he had married Elizabeth Campbell who was descended from the clan Campbell on one side and Governor William Bradford of Plymouth colony on the other.  Daboll and his wife had come to Saint Johns in 1879 with their only child, six-year-old Winifred, who had been born on September 29, 1873.</P>
<P>The family home was a 206 N. Mead, and Winifred had graduated from St. Johns High School two years after Frank Buck in 1894.  After earning a Master's Degree from the Michigan University in Ann Arbor, Winifred returned to St. Johns High School to teach Latin and English.</P>
<P>Although she spent the rest of her life in her little home town, Miss Daboll was well-respected as an educator outside her own small sphere.  When Gordon Frank and Howard Charles Wickes, the twin sons of foundryman Frank Wickes, tried to enter the University of Michigan in 1909, they were told that their small high school had not qualified them for entrance.  Miss Daboll simply sent a letter to the admissions office stating that she believed the boys were well-prepared and could succeed at the University.  In 1914 both graduated from the University of Michigan with degrees in Civil Engineering.</P>
<P>Like her father, Miss Daboll was passionately interested in history.  In  1937   she wrote a history of her home parish, St. Johns Episcopal Church, which today has become a collector's item.  In 1945 she suggested adding a Department of Local History to the Bement Library.  She offered to work on the collection herself in her leisure time.  A year later the Board commended her for her work in cataloging an unwieldy work, the History of Free Masonry which had been donated by the estate of the late attorney, William Smith.  The Board had been stunned by the magnitude of the work involved and could only thank her for the uncounted hours she had put into this &quot;tremendous task.&quot;</P>
<P>Following her death on June 5, 1952, the Board was at a loss as to how to honor the memory of Winifred C. Daboll.  At first they had hoped to place a photograph of her next to that of the retired Minnie Barrington, but the only known photo of her had been taken at her graduation from the University.  Finally a set of books, The Life of Washington by Freeman was purchased with money donated by her East Walker Street neighbors.  Delbert Clark also donated a set of 12 phonograph records on the subject of democracy in her honor.</P>
<P>TERESA MERRILL</P>
<P>Teresa Merrill served as the Secretary of the Library Board for more than 25 years.  She was married to attorney Robert Merrill and taught in Saint Johns for many years.  In 1958 she retired from teaching after having been the principal of East Ward School for 26 years.  In 1976 the school was named Teresa Merrill School in her honor.</P>
<P>As time went on the next generation began to run for office and take over their fathers' businesses.  After having taught for so many years, Mrs. Merrill began to believe that she actually had taught every younger person in the community.  And whenever she began to speak about them, she inevitably recalled that each had been her special favorite.</P>
<P>Mrs. Merrill was a faithful Catholic.  She attended Mass every Sunday without fail; and every Sunday without fail she would greet the pastor on her way out, pat him on the cheek and say, &quot;That was just wonderful, Darlin'.&quot;</P>
<P>Then one Sunday, when even the pastor himself had not been too pleased with his homily, Mrs. Merrill greeted him at the door, patted him on the cheek and said, &quot;Just couldn't get it together this morning, could you, Darlin'?&quot;</P>
<P>Mrs. Merrill lived alone for some years after the death of her husband.  Finally the day came when she could no longer stay in her own home.  At the local nursing home some of the employees, who had been raised in a different era, were dismayed by her behavior.  At each meal Mrs. Merrill insisted upon presiding at the head of the table with her hair freshly done, dressed for dinner.</P>
<P>MINNIE BARRINGTON</P>
<P>Still another beloved local educator, Librarian Minnie Barrington, was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky.  Her father, William M. Barrington, had died when she was only three months old.  Her mother, Sarah Hulse Barrington, later married Dr. S.M. Post, a physician at Eureka.</P>
<P>Minnie had graduated from Elsie High School and began her teaching career in Saint Johns.  She later attended Michigan State Normal College in Ypsilanti and even taught in Colorado and Pontiac, Michigan.  Soon she returned to Saint Johns and resumed her local teaching career.  Her specialty was junior high school history.  When she retired from teaching, she was the principal of Central School.</P>
<P>In the Library Miss Barrington had the ability to make little children feel like she and the Library were there only to serve them.  There was a child-sized round wooden table with matching chairs in the Children's Corner, the northwest corner of the main room.  Here there were low shelves full of wonderful friends including Snip, Snap, and Snurr; Babar with his little old lady and his elephant family; and poor old Jonathan Bing who just couldn't manage to visit the king.</P>
<P>Once in a while there was an adult, a former student, who still didn't quite feel like a grownup in Miss Barrington's presence.  One such individual was Police Chief Everett Glazier.</P>
<P>&quot;Why you know,&quot; exclaimed a bewildered Minnie.  &quot;He almost acts like he is afraid of me.  Imagine!&quot;</P>
<P>Miss Barrington knew how to make each child feel special.  She always called one little girl her twin because they both had been born on March 16.  As to just how many years apart the two had been born, no one was ungracious enough to inquire.</P>
<P>&quot;Everybody knows how old I am,&quot; Miss Barrington had said at the time of her retirement in July, 1950.  &quot;Just don't describe me as 'the aged librarian.'&quot;</P>
<P>In explaining her retirement Miss Barrington had said, &quot;I'm just tired.&quot;  She died ten years later following a fall at her home.  She was 87 at the time of her death - and it was revealed then that she had been 71 years older than her little &quot;twin.&quot;  City employees purchased a swinging wing bulletin board to be placed in the Library in her memory.</P>
<P>  In her &quot;Book Shelf&quot; column in the Clinton County Republican-News, Elizabeth Millman reminisced about &quot;Aunt Minnie&quot; after her death: </P>
<P>She loved to tell the story of her experience in the Durand railway station.  While waiting for a train there she fell into conversation with two young men.  </P>
<P>Since she was a baseball enthusiast, that was the subject of their conversation.  In its course she mentioned that she was a friend of Van Patrick, sports announcer for many years.</P>
<P>&quot;Why you're Aunt Minnie,&quot; the boys said, greeting her like a long-lost friend.  In the course of some of his broadcasts, Van Patrick had often sent &quot;Greetings to Aunt Minnie!&quot;</P>
<P>Her interest in sports was only one facet of her personality.  She had  a wide range of interests and could answer questions on many subjects, from the most obscure one on history to which horse won the Kentucky derby in any given year.</P>
<P>She will be greatly missed by her many friends in St. Johns.  There never will be another just like &quot;Minnie.&quot;</P>

<P><h3>The Bement Family</h3></P>
<P><h4><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT>
n 1873 Louisa Jane Huston Bement had joined the Ladies Library Association.  Soon her sister, Eliza Ann Hicks, and her children also joined.</P>
<P>The Huston sisters were born in Vermont and were the daughters of Matthew and Arabella Pierce Huston.  In 1850 the Huston family had moved to Michigan with eight children.  Four of the children died that year in DeWitt during an epidemic of black diphtheria.  That year one last child, Henry Boyd Huston, was born in DeWitt.</P>
<P>Eliza had married John Hicks in the Huston home in DeWitt on February 11, 1855.  Immediately following the wedding, the Huston family and their four remaining children moved to Gratiot County, near Ithaca.  </P>
<P>After the county seat was moved to Saint Johns, Eliza and John Hicks established the Hicks dry goods store in Saint Johns.  They lived in the house on the northwest corner of Walker and Brush Streets.  </P>
<P>In the meantime on March 6, 1856 Matthew Huston died.  Soon Arabella and her children, Louisa Jane, Lominda Arabella, and baby Henry Boyd Huston all moved to Saint Johns to live with John and Eliza Hicks.  The remaining son, David Thomas, stayed on the farm near Ithaca.  Later the Huston family moved across the street to 201 Brush Street.</P>
<P>Louisa Jane Huston married Edward Grilley Bement on June 21, 1861.  Their only child, Jennie Louise Bement, was born on April 5, 1868 at her grandmother's Brush Street house.</P>
<P>In 1872 John Hicks purchased property on State Street at Ottawa and built the family's permanent home.  When they moved into their new home, Grandmother Arabella accompanied the family.  By that time John and Eliza had three children, Ida Eliza who had been born in 1866, John Clayton who was born in 1869, and baby Jennie Marinda who had come along in 1871.</P>
<P>Soon Edward Bement established a store in Maple Rapids and moved his family there.  The family gathering place, however, was still at the Hicks home where Grandmother Arabella lived.</P>
<P>According to her niece, Ida Eliza Hicks Bishop, Louisa Jane Bement was a very energetic person and a good businesswoman.  She was graciously considerate of others; and as the years passed, her only daughter became the center of her life's interest.</P>
<P>Jennie Bement was seen by her cousin as gentle and thoughtful.  Her attractive personality, Ida said, was &quot;heartfully beloved by every member of the family.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She was 'at home' at 205 State Street,&quot; Ida continued.  &quot;Thus in speaking of her, I speak as one of our own family.&quot;</P>
<P>Edward Bement was said to have been especially book minded.  Thus it is not strange that his daughter was an unusually good student.  In 1886 Jennie graduated from Maple Rapids School.  At the age of 18 she had attended the University of Michigan.  </P>
<P>In 1889 she graduated from the State Normal School in Ypsilanti.  The next year she became the Preceptress of the high school in Sand Lake, Michigan.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1890 Jennie and her mother traveled in Europe.  Later that fall Jennie reentered the University of Michigan.  She graduated in 1892.  The following summer Jennie spent the months of August and September in Colorado.  </P>
<P>Jennie was engaged to marry.  Then in May, 1893 she contracted spinal meningitis and died.  Jennie died on May 31 and was buried from the Maple Rapids Christian Church on June 2, 1893.  She was later interred at Mount Rest Cemetery in Saint Johns.</P>
<P>It was then that Louisa Bement began planning a suitable memorial for Jennie.  She wanted, said cousin Ida, to think of something beautiful that would be in accord with Jennie's beautiful life.  Soon she settled on the idea of a library.</P>
<P>In 1938 Mrs. Bishop reminisced,  &quot;Frequently talking this consideration over with the members of our family, I recall one day telling Aunt Louise that I could think of nothing more befitting Cousin Jennie's life and character or more needed in Saint Johns.&quot;</P>
<P> Louisa Bement's will, executed in 1904, read in part:</P>
<P>I, Louisa J. Bement of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, being of sound mind and memory, do make, publish and declare this to be my last Will and Testament, in manner following, viz:</P>
<P>Sixth, I give and bequeath to the First Congregational Church of St. Johns, Michigan, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars to purchase a library for said church.  And I also give to the St. Johns Episcopal Church of St. Johns, Michigan the sum of Five Hundred Dollars with which to purchase a library for said church.</P>
<P>Tenth, I give, devise and bequeath all the residue and remainder of my estate to the City of St. Johns, Clinton County, Michigan, to establish a Public Library in said City, in whole or to assist therein.</P>
<P>I hereby appoint Charles M. Merrill, of St. Johns, Michigan Executor of this, My Last Will and testament.</P>
<P>In 1921 after bequests had been distributed to family members and other heirs, there was still $24,166.27 left to be placed in the &quot;Jennie Louise Bement Memorial&quot; fund. This fund was administered by Louisa's nephews, John C. Hicks and  Coleman C. Vaughn, who had married Jennie Marinda Hicks.</P>
<P>Over the years the family members discussed the question of when and where to build the Jennie Louise Bement Library.  Shortly before he died on April 10, 1935 John C. Hicks had visited with his sister, Ida, to consider once again the alternatives.  Both regretted that the government was considering the property at the corner of Brush and State Streets for the new post office.  John C. Hicks and Coleman Vaughn had previously purchased this lot for the erection of the desired Memorial Library.  By this time no one could recall what had happened to Jennie Bement's books which were to have been included in the library.</P>
<P>John C. Hicks was dead and Coleman C. Vaughn was away, so the fund was placed in trust with the National Bank.  Now that the prime site on State Street was no longer available, Ida Bishop hoped that the City of Saint Johns would try to purchase the lot at the corner of Brush and Walker, the site of the old &quot;St. Johns House&quot; hotel.  She wanted the Memorial Library to remain in the old neighborhood where the family had lived and where Jennie had been born.</P>
<P>In November of 1938 Schuyler Marshall, the editor of the &quot;Clinton County Republican-News&quot; wrote to Ida Bishop concerning the proposed new Municipal Building and Library building:</P>
<P>I hardly know how to approach the subject of your letter of November 7th.  It has been one which has caused discussion from time to time, often by people who had little knowledge of its background.  I have heard it discussed in times past by your brother and Mr. Vaughn.</P>
<P>Perhaps the best I can offer is a recital of my own limited knowledge and understanding of the bequest based upon what I have heard from others and my knowledge of present existing conditions.</P>
<P>To begin with, whatever the intentions of Mrs. Bement, the donor, may have been, the actual language of the paragraph in her will which transferred the money to the City of St. Johns for library purposes was very broad.  As I recall it, there were no explicit instructions as to how or where the money was to be spent so long as it was used for &quot;library purposes.&quot;</P>
<P>As time went on a very adequate library was established in the new high school building and a librarian employed.  The public are free to use this library and, if I recall rightly, some of the books of the now defunct Ladies' Library Association were transferred to the high school library.</P>
<P>More recently, increased municipal costs and the depression seemed to make it highly improbable that a separate and distinct building should, or would, be erected exclusively for library purposes as this would entail the cost of maintenance, the salary of a librarian, janitor and heating costs upon the city and would, in a measure, be a duplication of library facilities and expense which would not be warranted in so small a city as St. Johns.</P>
<P>Finally in recent months came consideration of the wisdom of combining in one building the library and much-needed city offices.  Mr. R.V. Gay, architect, whom you must remember as the son of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Gay and a local man, was engaged to submit plans.  Mr. Gay's plans called for a corner location with the entrance of the city offices on one street and a separate and suitable library entrance on the other street.  The plans also included, in addition to a large library room on the first floor, adjoining commodious rooms for women's clubs.</P>
<P>This plan was approved by the City Commission and application was made to the federal government for PWA funds to make such a building possible.  The approval by the government came recently and the matter of a site had to be settled in a relatively short time. </P>
<P>This week the city Commission purchased the site directly across the street from the Republican-News office, formerly known as the Fildew corner, and with it an adjoining building which was once the St. Johns News office, and at the time of purchase owned by the American Legion.  It is the plan to have the city office entrance on Walker street and the library entrance on Spring Street.</P>
<P>Because of its proximity to other city property and with economy of operation and maintenance in mind, it seemed to be the most practical and suitable for several reasons.</P>
<P>The old &quot;St. Johns House&quot; site was considered, but because of absentee ownership, because it involved two parcels of land; be cause of back taxes, mortgages, etc., it was impossible to acquire this property in time to satisfy the demands of the federal government.</P>
<P>After examining the plans for the new building and taking into consideration the ability of the city to carry on whatever they start, I am convinced that the best and most practical use has been made of the fund which was given by your aunt.</P>
<P>I realize that it does not offer the most as a memorial . . . at least, not as much as a building located separately on a plot of ample ground and landscaped . . . yet, it will be very serviceable and furnish library and club room facilities for many civic and cultural groups of women and a practical public library.</P>
<P>At home Eula has expressed gratification and a keen favorable anticipation of the use of the quarters which this money has made possible. I believe she voices the sentiment of a great many St. Johns women who have for years been without these facilities.</P>
<P>It had been 45 years between the time Jennie Bement died and the library her mother had hoped would be built in her memory was finally started.</P>

<P><h3>The Early Years of the Bement Library</h3></P>
<P><h4><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>
he first order of business for Minnie Barrington and the Library Board was the purchase of books.  One night in May, 1940 a Mr. Lindstrom driven by his black chauffeur, Mike, pulled up in front of the Library in his Car Library.  Lindstrom represented the Follette Book Company and was offering to sell anything in the car for 33% off the list price.  That evening the Board added 49 books to the Library's collection.</P>
<P>By July there were 381 patrons registered at the Library.  During that month 987 visitors withdrew 723 books from the Library's stock of 1919 volumes.  Meanwhile the Library Board had granted Miss Barrington two weeks vacation with pay, part of which was to be spent at a Library Convention in Mt. Pleasant.  </P>
<P>The Board also voted in July to purchase an electric fan for the Library.  For many years, summer and winter, that black metal table fan sat on the top of one of the low shelves in the northwest corner of the Library. </P>
<P>Miss Barrington first complained to the Board about the way the Library was overheating in the fall of 1941.  R.G. Benson was called in, and the Board paid to have the problem corrected.</P>
<P>The next winter Myron Ward, the Library Board's liaison with the City Commission, decided that he would see that the problem was taken care of.  This time he went down in person to see to it that the heating plant was repaired correctly.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1945 it was Rex Sirrine, the Library Board liaison with the City Commission, who took the problem in hand.  There was still a problem with the Library room overheating.</P>
<P>By the time Hila Bross had become Librarian the problem had developed a new twist. The old black fan had long since been retired.  Technological advances had made it possible to keep the Library cool summer and winter.  And every winter the Library would get so hot that the air conditioner would come on automatically.</P>
<P>Nearly every year someone new would try his hand at correcting the problem.  By 1972 the Librarian was complaining that the room was overheating - but only in the fall, winter, and spring.  This time Fraser MacKinnon, whose wife Barbara was a long-time member of the Library Board, suggested some corrective measures.  Mrs. Bross reported that the results were encouraging.</P>
<P>Early on the Bement Library Board had made contact with other libraries in the area.  In the spring of 1941 the Board hosted the District Convention in the new Municipal Auditorium.  Nina DeWitt was in charge of the dishes and tea service.  Cora Buck, Frank Buck's wife, was to set out the cookies and help serve coffee.  Teresa Merrill purchased the refreshments and presided over the tea table.  Everyone else was assigned to the reception committee.  Patrolman Reed Hall remained on duty and was reimbursed for his services.</P>
<P>Miss Barrington's first annual report disclosed that there were 2400 books in the library and that there had been a circulation of an average 51 books per day for a year end total of 14,791.  There were 915 registered patrons, and 1136 people had visited the Library during its first year of operation.  </P>
<P>There was a total of $1,450.60 in the treasury, and a bulletin board and new clock had been added to the Library.  A few months later the Board sent a letter to St. Clair Pardee thanking the American Legion for the new flag.</P>
<P>About six weeks after the bombing at Pearl Harbor had dragged the United States into war, the Library Board sponsored a campaign to collect books for the boys in the Service.  Containers were placed at Parr's Drug Store, the Smith Shopping Basket, and City Hall.  When the campaign was completed the City truck was sent out to deliver the books.</P>
<P>Asked by the editor of the Clinton County Republican-News what she thought about the war, Miss Barrington replied:</P>
<P>What do I think about the war?  I wish I could forget it.  It looks to me as if this is the start of a worldwide revolution that cannot be stopped short of its logical conclusion.  Eventually -- I have faith -- the world will reestablish a better civilization.  Oh, the hopeless old men, women and children trudging away from their wrecked homes.  Why hasn't our local Red Cross drive started?</P>
<P>The question arose in June of 1942 as to just what should be done with books which had been taken into homes in which someone was suffering from a contagious disease.  At that time the Board decided that there was nothing to do but ask the users to pay some or all of the cost of the book.  The Librarian was instructed to collect the best way she could.  Miss Barrington solved that problem by sending out  Reed Hall.  She found this also worked pretty well for recovering past due books.</P>
<P>Two years later the Board formalized the policy. The Health Department agreed to notify Miss Barrington of all quarantines, and no books were to be loaned out to homes until the quarantines had been lifted.  </P>
<P>The Library's 1942 share of the State Library Fund, $322.55, was used to purchase more books, increase the number of hours the Library was open, and to provide added services.  The City Commission was still funding the operation of the Library.  For that reason the Board denied a request that 15 or 20 books at a time be sent to Maple Rapids.</P>
<P>A $500 Series GD Bond was donated to the Library in the name of Alice Streeter in July, 1943.  The interest from the bond was to be placed in the Bement Fund, and for many years this money was used to purchase children's books.</P>
<P>Mrs. Edward Earhart donated books and book cases to the Library that September.  That same month the books and book cases from the Frank and Eva Spaulding Estate were also donated to the Library.</P>
<P>Then at the end of September, 1943 Nora Ball Wilson and Leah Fowler Hunt stepped forward.  For many years they had been the Trustees of the late Ladies Library Association.  The Library Board accepted with gratitude the $1335.17 which the women had held in trust for over forty years.</P>
<P>This money was invested in Treasury Bonds and placed in a safety deposit box at the National Bank in the name of the Bement Library.  Winifred Daboll was named custodian of the bonds.</P>
<P>Chinese Book Week was celebrated in April, 1944.  The displays were contributed by Drs. Foo and Ho and Mrs. Donovan Smith.  Miss Barrington reported that 538 adults and children had visited the display.</P>
<P>About that same time Eleanor Trask became ill.  Laurita Allison took over briefly as Assistant Librarian in her absence.  It was Elizabeth Millman, however, who joined Miss Barrington in attending the Library Conference at Higgins Lake that year.  The Library Board paid their expenses of $25.</P>
<P>Early in June the Library Board sent a bouquet of flowers to the ailing Frank Buck.  He died on June 16.  The next month Winifred Daboll was made the new chairman of the Board.  In September the City Commission appointed attorney Edward Fehling to succeed Mr.Buck.</P>
<P>The 1944 annual report indicated that in 1943 Bess Osgood had begun a story hour for the children, and the Library had displayed a creche at Christmas.  The Library was also beginning to cooperate with the local schools on the use of books.  </P>
<P>By the Christmas of 1944 the Library was closed from December 18-23 for its first redecoration.  The wall were being tinted.</P>
<P>Commissioner Rex Sirrine succeeded Myron Ward in January, 1945.  Six years later after Mr. Ward died, Mrs. R.V. Gay donated $10 to the Library.  A book was purchased in his memory.</P>
<P>In 1945 the Rev. Lewis Dion, pastor of St. Joseph Catholic Church, donated a large assortment of the latest Book of the Month Club selections.  The collection was worth $240.</P>
<P>General Spaulding in Washington donated a book entitled Real Soviet Russia by David J. Dallin.  Four other books were donated by Colonel Thomas M. Spaulding.</P>
<P>A picture map of Saint Johns as it had looked in 1868 was presented to the Library by Theodore Townsend.  It had come from a collection of pictures taken from the home of the late John Hicks.  Later Mrs. John Hicks and Ruth Jane LeBaron donated 67 books.</P>
<P>Circulation dipped slightly early in 1945 when libraries opened in each of the town's elementary schools.  Nevertheless the Board granted Miss Barrington a couple of extra vacation days so that she could take her annual blossom time tour of Michigan.</P>
<P>A special meeting of the Board was called on October 8, 1945.  At that time Winifred Daboll stepped down as chairman in favor of Edward Fehling.  It was also at this meeting that Elizabeth Millman was named the new Assistant Librarian.  The Board sent Laurita Allison a book in appreciation of her work at the Library. </P>
<P> A year later Miss Barrington's salary was raised from $800 a year to $1000.  Mrs. Millman was paid $.60 per hour.</P>
<P>The Soldiers Exhibit in the fall of 1945 brought 308 visitors into the Library.  Soon the Librarian warned the Board to choose war books sparingly.  Right then the market was flooded with books on the subject, and the quality of many of them was not up to Miss Barrington's high standards.</P>
<P>Library Board members included Edward Fehling, Winifred Daboll, Teresa Merrill, Nina DeWitt, and Commissioner Joe Matthews in 1947.  That spring the Board hosted a $1.25 per plate District Convention Luncheon at the Steel Hotel.  Mr. Kerns' high school music class entertained at an afternoon Tea held in the Library.</P>
<P>In the fall of 1947 high school principal Bennie Pocuis had asked Miss Barrington to instruct students in the use of the library.  She reported excellent participation on the part of that first group; and the project was continued for many years by her successors.</P>
<P>Minnie Barrington went on the radio in 1948.  She recounted a history of Clinton County over radio station WLS in Chicago.</P>
<P>By January of 1949 the Library's circulation was averaging 82.41 books per day, and $70.43 in fines had been collected.  There had been an excess of money in the budget in 1948, and the Board turned $50 back to the City.  Commissioner Dorr Anderson had replaced Joe Matthews on the Board.</P>
<P>The Morning Musicale donated the first phonograph records to the Library in the spring of 1949.  In order to accommodate the new medium the Board authorized Miss Barrington to spend $30 on the purchase of a display case and record player. </P>
<P>Minnie Barrington retired from the Library on July 1, 1950.  Elizabeth Millman was chosen to replace her as Librarian, and Laurita Allison was back on staff as Assistant Librarian.  </P>
<P>Laurita Murray Allison was a local girl.  Her family lived on South Clinton; and her father's bakery was located on East Walker Street, not far from the place where the Municipal Building would eventually stand.</P>
<P>After graduating from St. Johns High School, Laurita continued to work in the bakery until 1930.  She was married to C.W. Allison.</P>
<P>Mrs. Allison brought a quiet dignity to the Library.  She was restrained, almost shy, around strangers.  She did have, however, thoughts and opinions of her own.  When she did begin to express herself, she said exactly what needed to be said -- nothing more and nothing less.</P>
<P>Laurita was a tiny, dark woman; and she was always chilly.  Summer and winter a sweater hung on the back of her chair at the table next to the office.  The advent of air conditioning in the Library would have brought her agony.  Secretly she probably appreciated the constant overheating to which the Library was subject every winter.</P>
<P>In the fall of 1950 Mrs. Allison's hours were increased from 18 to 21 hours per week at $.68 per hour.  At the same time instead of being open from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays, Library hours were extended from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on those days.  </P>
<P>Board members Buelah Ballantine, who had succeeded Winifred Daboll, and Nina DeWitt were asked to help the Librarian in the selection and purchase of books.  The next January Commissioner Charles Coletta took a seat on the Board, replacing Dorr Anderson.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Millman introduced the concept of a rental library to the Board in the Spring of 1951.  At the time there were 8,000 volumes in the Library, and Mrs. Millman explained that the rental system might be a good way to keep popular books in circulation without a large investment in money or space.  A few months later the Board voted to try out the American Lending Library for a short period of time.  The average cost of the service turned out to be about $.18 per book withdrawn from the local Library.</P>
<P>In June, 1952 Mrs. Millman announced the beginning of the first Summer Reading Club.  There also was a story hour on Tuesday and Thursday mornings from 10-11.  The story hour was sponsored by the Child Study Club.  There were three winners of the book report awards that year.  Brooks Jones received a prize of $2 for first place.  Cathy Jopke and Kay B. Munro each won $1.</P>
<P>In her annual report Mrs. Millman noted that there had been 287 books purchased, 82 donated, and 7944 books in circulation throughout the year 1951.  Of these, 13 had been lost.  Of the 26,552 books which had been withdrawn that year 10% had been non-fiction, 43% were fiction, 39% were children's books; and periodicals represented only 8% of total circulation.  Of the 1952 registered patrons, 1475 were adults and 477 were children.</P>
<P>During that year Mrs. Joseph Gasser had been hired as an assistant.  Rigoletto had been added to the record collection.  And Mrs. Millman's &quot;Book Shelf&quot; column had been appearing almost weekly in the Clinton County Republican-News.</P>
<P>During the years that she wrote her newspaper column Mrs. Millman received personal notes from several authors.  In April, 1964 author David Westheimer wrote: &quot;Many thanks for your kind review of Von Ryan's Express.  I am always especially pleased when a lady reader likes the book.&quot;</P>
<P>A note from Norwalk, Connecticut said, &quot;I do thank you for the mention of the Lonely Man on July 24 -.&quot;  It was signed &quot;Faith Baldwin.&quot;</P>
<P>Mrs. Millman and Mrs. Allison reported to the Board in November, 1952 on the Michigan Library Association Convention they had recently attended.  The speaker had been Norman Cousins, and his topic had been Adult Education.</P>
<P>At that same meeting the Board voted to change its policy regarding rental books.  From then on patrons would be entitled to the first three days free.  They would be charged 5 cents for each day they kept the book beyond the first three days.</P>
<P>The Library was closed in February, 1953 for its second redecorating.  In April it was closed again for four days for varnishing.</P>
<P>A year later in February of 1954 the City Commission offered to lend the room vacated by Justice of the Peace Charles A. Speer to the Library.  The new room was to be used as a Children's Library and was to open May 1, 1954.</P>
<P>That summer a teacher, Miss Evelyn Putnam, and Mrs. Ethel Clark offered to take charge of the Story Hour.  Student helpers assisted in the children's room.  Each year a senior girl was selected for this job.  At first high school credit was given from the vocational training program, and the student was able to leave school one hour early.  This program was later abandoned.  Beginning in 1960 credit was no longer given, but the student was dismissed early.</P>
<P>THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY</P>
<P> Sherri Mitchell became the first in a long succession of high school girls to take charge of the Children's Library.  Others included:</P>
<P>Caroline Gasser     1954-55</P>
<P>Rosalie Fink  1955-56</P>
<P>Janice Gasser  1956-57</P>
<P>Felice King  1957-58</P>
<P>Maralyn Fink  1958-59</P>
<P>Nancy Gaskill  1959-60</P>
<P>Jean Robinson  1960-61</P>
<P>Susan Wirick  1961-62</P>
<P>Gladys Motz  1962-63</P>
<P>Lynda Stephenson 1963-64</P>
<P>Molly Sapp  1964-65</P>
<P>Robyn Hudson  1965-66</P>
<P>The Children's Library was open from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m. weekdays and  1 - 5 p.m. on Saturdays during the school year.  Summer hours were 1 - 5 p.m. daily, Monday through Saturday.  These hours were the same as the open swimming hours at the city park pool; and on opening day at the pool and on especially nice summer days, business was slow. </P>
<P>The routine was invariable.  The student librarian threw her books from her last class into her locker, grabbed a coat, and bolted for the front door of Rodney B. Wilson High School.  She could save a few seconds if she used the well-worn path across the grass on the courthouse lawn.  On the coldest days it was always a relief to walk under the outdoor heater at the National Bank's walk-up window on East Walker.  On sunny days the radiometer in the window of the Police station would be spinning.</P>
<P>There was a quick trip through the south door of the Municipal Building and on into the Library to check in and pick up the tarnished key from the ladies in the main library.  If the girl should happen to be a few minutes late, she was met with silent disapproval.</P>
<P>Retracing her steps through the Municipal Building, she would return to the main stairway, race on past the public rest rooms, and carefully turn the key in the reluctant lock.  Flipping on the light switches at the left of the doorway, she would head straight towards the east well windows in search of oxygen for the stuffy little room.  In the summer the room was pleasantly cool but dank.</P>
<P>Quickly she would pick up from her desk any books which might have been returned overnight.  If luck were on her side, she could have the cards back in them and have them reshelved before the afternoon's hord of cherubs descended.  Otherwise some of those books would go right home with the little ones without having the original cards replaced.  This not only left no accounting of the book's whereabouts; it messed up the circulation count.  This was to be avoided at all cost.</P>
<P>Then the afternoon began.  If it were a rainy day, there would be large numbers of noisy, good-natured children hanging around the library all afternoon.  </P>
<P>One little boy, the son of sober and high-minded school teachers, was a constant companion to the librarian.  His parents were edified by his frequent trips to the public library and never guessed that he spent his days happily devouring all of the comic books he was not allowed to read at home.</P>
<P>If it happened to be opening day at the Veterans Memorial Pool, the librarian could plan a relaxing afternoon of dusting shelves.  The children's shelves were no problem because little hands passed over them so frequently that the dust rarely had time to settle.  </P>
<P>The storage shelves on the north wall were another matter.  These contained many wonderful old novels and history books.  One especially grimy and fascinating set included photos taken during World War I.  All of the cutlines and the entire text were in German - and not only German, but fractur at that. Reading these was surely more fun than dusting, but there had to be easier ways to learn German.</P>
<P>Student librarians were forbidden to eat on the job.  One such girl nearly starved to death while reading The Good Earth one sunny Saturday afternoon.  Upon arriving home she startled her poor mother by practically demanding that she cook up a rice dish for supper that night.</P>
<P> Wildlife abounded in the basement of the Municipal Building.  All sorts of bugs and rodents were especially attracted to the floor of the Children's Library where peanuts occasionally dropped from contraband candy smuggled in by young readers.  One wily mouse had been eluding both the student librarian and the janitor, Howard Castler, for quite some time.  </P>
<P>Day after day conventional mouse traps stood vacant.  Chewed up papers could be seen on the floor, but the mouse himself remained invisible.  Then one evening he made the mistake of running across the floor just as Laurita Allison made an unscheduled visit to the room.</P>
<P>From then on the word was out.  Get that mouse!  The crafty student librarian set out to capture the beast herself.  Carefully she smeared bits of a Baby Ruth bar in front of her desk.  Then she added a couple of pieces of broken peanut just for effect. The door was closed, and the lights were turned off.  Then the librarian returned to her desk to wait.</P>
<P> Eventually the creature scuttled across the floor towards the candy.  Wham!  Before he knew what had hit him, he found himself in total darkness - under the wastebasket.</P>
<P>&quot;Now what?&quot; thought the captor.  Placing several heavy books on top of the wastebasket, she ran to fetch the janitor.  He would have to do the dirty work.  Howard promptly removed the mouse but never would say exactly what had happened to it.  One rumor around the Municipal Building had it that Chief Everett Glazier had taken the poor animal out and shot it with his service revolver.</P>
<P>Chief Glazier was among the many adults who frequented the Children's Library on their way to the boiler room to have a smoke.  Each day, some times several times a day, these men would pass by the library and poke their heads in to say hello or to tell a story or two.  </P>
<P>Sometimes the librarian smiled and sometimes she cringed.  Often she learned to tell the visitors apart by the sound of their footfalls in the corridor.  If she expected one of her more tiresome visitors, she could always be straightening shelves on the far wall.  And if she happened to recognize one of the ladies from upstairs - why, she could always be found dusting those eternal storage shelves.</P>
<P>At closing time the ritual reversed itself.  Children were encouraged to leave by 4:55.  This gave the librarian a few minutes to pick up things and alphabetize the day's cards.  This was especially important on the evenings when the upstairs library would be open.  For then, especially if everything were not in order, someone would be sure to bring down a child during evening library hours.  And the next day the student would be greeted with those silent looks of disapproval.</P>
<P>A running tally of circulation from the children's section was kept daily by the librarians in the main library.  These women were always ready to close at 5 p.m. on the dot and were frequently impatient if a last minute rush should keep the student assistant from closing and reporting in on time.</P>
<P>Rural school teachers were frequent clients of the Children's Library.  Since many schools were located in the outlying areas, teachers often arrived late in the afternoon.  Several teachers could be counted upon to arrive about five minutes before closing time.  Of course they would select as many as 20 or 30 books to take back to their students; and the women in the main library would be circling around the south door of the darkened room, waiting.</P>
<P>The cards counted and alphabetized, the windows would have to be closed.  If that were not done, there would surely be some sort of monsoon that would strike the town overnight.  Then the window wells would flood, and it would be all over for the poor librarian.  </P>
<P>Finally the lights were switched off, and the door lock was coaxed closed.  This was accomplished by holding ones face in just the proper expression while the key was turning in the lock.</P>
<P>Upon returning the key the student would be greeted with a smile from Mrs. Millman and quiet acceptance from Mrs. Allison.  Or if things were not going according to schedule, there would be that deafening silence.</P>
<P>Regularly there would be a paycheck.  At Christmas and Easter there was a turkey or a ham from the City.</P>
<P>Another thing student librarians had to remember was that they always had a ride home.  It didn't matter if the girl had to hurry down the street and wait for a few minutes in her mother's empty office.  She had a ride home.  Otherwise Mrs. Millman would insist upon driving her.  </P>
<P>Mrs. Millman was the type of driver who could talk, or she could drive.  And although she should have been driving, she frequently preferred to talk.  She also firmly believed that the new &quot;Yield&quot; signs that were appearing on side streets meant &quot;Look straight ahead and gun it.&quot;  Yes, the experienced student always had a ride home.</P>
<P>In 1957 the Library Board gave Jan Gasser $5 for her high school graduation.  Twenty years later Sharri Desprez received a nice little bracelet charm.  Others had not been so fortunate.  One graduating senior had nearly bolted from her own party in embarrassment when, in front of all of her guests, she opened her gift from the Library Board and found silky little baby doll pajamas. </P>
<P>Late in 1965 Mrs. Millman's successor, Hila Bross, began making plans for improving the Children's Library.  Stickers were pasted onto the cover of children's books reminding parents that destroying books was punishable by law.  </P>
<P>Limits were imposed upon rural teachers regarding the number of books they could check out at one time and the length of time they could keep the books.  Each child in that teacher's room had to be registered at the library in order for the teacher to take books back to her class.  Walter Nickel called to say that his rural teachers were unhappy, but the Board upheld the new policies.</P>
<P>Red, white, and blue were chosen for the new color scheme.  The blue carpet came from St. Johns Furniture.  Mrs. Bross asked the city to paint the walls.  Sheer white curtains were to replace the Venetian blinds.  Later Hila had the old carpet from the children's library cut up for runners in the main library.</P>
<P>Beginning on November 6, 1967 Cleo Desprez took over as the Children's Librarian.  A former teacher, Mrs. Desprez had joined the staff in July of that year.  </P>
<P>One day she had been talking with Elizabeth Millman in Glaspie's Drug Store.  When Mrs. Millman offered her the job of Assistant Librarian, Cleo knew just what she wanted to do.</P>
<P>&quot;I guess I've always liked children,&quot; Cleo told a reporter for the Clinton County News.  &quot;For me library work is the next thing to teaching school.&quot;</P>
<P>Less than two years later financial constraints forced the Board to have the Children's Library moved back upstairs.  </P>
<P>There simply was not enough money available to pay someone to be in the basement all of the time.  Literature and biographies were placed in the basement room, and the Children's corner was again located on the first floor.</P>
<P>When she retired in 1981, Cleo Desprez recalled that she especially had hated to see the passing of the basement Children's Library that she and Hila had so carefully decorated.</P>
<P>&quot;Room is the whole thing,&quot; Cleo declared.  &quot;Hila's dream was to have our own library building.&quot;</P>
<P>1956-1980, YEARS OF RAPID EXPANSION</P>
<P>It was Saint Johns' Centennial year; and Library circulation in 1956 totaled 24,495 with 2069 adults and 701 children registered.</P>
<P>The next year the face of the Library Board began changing.  John Bond came on to represent the City Commission.  Then on August 10, 1957 former Board Chairman Edward W. Fehling died.  For some time before his retirement the Board had been meeting in his office.  After his retirement Fehling had spent many hours in the Library at the magazine table.  His special interests were travel and history, and the women in the Library began to await his comments about the stories he had read or the trips he had taken.  The Board purchased a subscription to the American Heritage Magazine in his memory.</P>
<P>Former Commission representative to the Board, Joe Matthews, replaced Fehling.  The new 1957 Board officers consisted of Nina DeWitt, Chairman and Joe Matthews, Vice Chairman. Teresa Merrill was still Secretary.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Millman completed her college courses at Central State College and received State Library Board certification late in 1958.  The Library Board had paid for half of the cost of the courses.</P>
<P>That same year the Library received yet another facelift.  Walls were painted, and a couple of years later new lights were installed.  Now readers would enjoy 50 candle power instead of the original nine over each table. </P>
<P>In 1974 this lighting arrangement was adjusted downward.  The reduction resulted in a 33% cut in the use of electricity in the main Library room.</P>
<P>Joseph G. Matthews died on January 18, 1962 in Holmes Beach, Florida.  The January 22 Board meeting had been a somber one.  The Board met briefly after returning from the funeral.  The only motion that was passed that day was a resolution to place a book in the Library in his memory.  A few months later Basil Deibert was chosen to replace Mr. Matthews.</P>
<P>In the meantime new staff members were being added to the Library.  Mrs. Dunkel began to work 8 hours per week.  Mrs. Walter Nickel was made an assistant, and Mrs. Welch was hired as extra help.  Later that summer Virginia Dietrich came on staff and began serving as clerk.  Mrs. Beatrice Cook conducted the summer story hour.</P>
<P>Because of the rules and regulations that accompanied the City's insurance plan, Mrs. Millman was forced to retire automatically after her 65th birthday in the spring of 1965.  The Library board went on record as saying that they hoped that the rules might be suspended so that Mrs. Millman could be reinstated.  They were not, and the Open House that was held on Sunday April 25, 1965 coincided with the Silver Anniversary of the Bement Library.  </P>
<P> The next year Mrs. Harold Millman was the guest of honor at a reception held in her honor during Library Week.  Girl Scout Cadet Troop 429, lead by Mrs. Gail Goetze, armed themselves with cloths and soapy water to clean the Library in preparation for the event.  Diane Kanaski, Patricia Mabie, Karen Kohls, Jane Thrush, Sandra Bovee, Mary Lou LeFever, Christin Idzkowski, Joanne Kanaski, and Mary Ann Kanaski scrubbed for about three hours to finish this community service project.</P>
<P> A photograph of Mrs. Millman was presented to her by Library Board Treasurer Beulah Ballantine and by Mrs. Manning Bross.  The picture was hung in the Library beneath that of her predecessor, Minnie Barrington.</P>

<P><h3>The Ladies Library Association</h3></P>
<P><h4><FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT>aint Johns was not yet 15 years old when Mary Strickland offered to let the Ladies Library Association use a room in her home for their first library.  Across Linden Avenue the county courthouse stood partially built on the village green.</P>
<P>In those early years merchants, attorneys, physicians, and clergymen had moved their families into the village.  These men usually had their daily employment to provide a sense of accomplishment and companionship.  At the same time their wives, many of whom were well educated and accomplished young women, found little opportunity to improve themselves in this alternately muddy and dusty little town.</P>
<P>Then shortly before the end of the Civil War, the State Legislature passed an act which provided for the &quot;formation of corporations for Library and scientific purposes.&quot;  A few years later ten Saint Johns women decided to take advantage of the new legislation.   </P>
<P>Early in 1870 Mrs. George W. Tuthill, Mrs. Marvin Babcock, Mrs. Robert McFarlan, Mrs. Samuel S. Walker, Miss Frances E. Tuckerman, Mrs. John B. McLean, Mrs. H. M. Lee, Mrs. C.S. Wells, Celia C. Smith, and Mrs. James H. Collins joined to form a corporation named the &quot;Ladies Library Association of Saint Johns, Michigan.&quot;  Under the terms of the law the association would be incorporated for a term of thirty years.  After that time, any and all assets were to be distributed to some organization in the area having a similar purpose.</P>
<P>The plan, as outlined in the February 3, 1870 issue of the &quot;Clinton Independent,&quot; was to purchase books with the annual fees collected from the members.  These books were to be selected to meet the needs of all ages. Of course there would be &quot;works of History, Travel, Science, Art and Fiction of an elevating and healthful order.&quot;  The extent of the library would naturally depend upon the number of its members.  Donations of books of &quot;merit and interest&quot; were gratefully received.  It was expected that the library would be ready for circulation within the next two weeks.</P>
<P>The Association was managed by ten directors who were chosen from among the active membership.  Officers included a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Librarian and Assistant Librarian.</P>
<P>The first officers of the Association included:</P>
<P>President - Mrs. Randolph Strickland</P>
<P>Vice President - Mrs. L.W. Earl</P>
<P>Secretary - Mrs. J. L. Paldi</P>
<P>Treasurer - Mrs. J. Wilkinson</P>
<P>Librarian - Mrs. J. H. Cranson</P>
<P>Assistant Librarian - Miss M. Paine.</P>
<P>On the Executive Board were:  Mrs. Strickland, Mrs. Cranson, Mrs. Walker, Mrs. Paldi, Mrs. Tuthill, Mrs. McFarlan, and Mrs. McLean.</P>
<P>Each year the Association published a little directory.  Ten years later, in 1880, the officers were:</P>
<P>President - Mrs. Marvin Babcock     </P>
<P>Vice President - Mrs. R. Strickland</P>
<P>Secretary - Mrs. S. S. Walker</P>
<P>Treasurer - Miss Frances Tuckerman</P>
<P>Librarian - Mrs. C. E. Ball</P>
<P>Assistant Librarian - Miss C. Shaver</P>
<P>Other members of the Association in 1880 included Mrs. G.E. Corbin, Mrs. S. S. Woodruff, Mrs. C.E. Grisson, and Mrs. Jesse Dunn.</P>
<P>It is interesting to note that the first names of many of these intelligent and well-read women would be lost completely were it not for census data taken throughout the years.  Local contemporary histories frequently made mention of the husbands and fathers of these women and carefully noted their achievements.  Rarely, however, were the accomplishments of their wives and daughters recounted.</P>
<P>The first President of the Ladies Library Association, Mary E. Strickland, was 41 years old in 1870.  She was married to a local attorney, Randolph Strickland.  Five years after the county seat was removed to Saint Johns, the family had moved from their home on the banks of the Looking Glass River in DeWitt.  </P>
<P>Shortly after coming to Saint Johns the family purchased and improved the residence of Dr. Crawford.  This Italianate structure was the first brick residence built in Saint Johns and stood at the corner of Linden Avenue and Cass Street.  In 1907, after the death of Mary Strickland in 1905, the stately old building was razed to make way for the construction of the second St. Joseph Catholic Church building.</P>
<P>The Stricklands raised four daughters, each of whom was said to be both charming and accomplished.  All were educated at the University of Michigan, known at the time as the Michigan University in Ann Arbor.  Martha, the eldest, studied law, married a man named Sheldon C. Clark and moved to Rockford, Illinois where she later taught parliamentary law.  Alida, later Mrs. W.H. Eastman, was the head of a private school in Grand Rapids.  Jessie was the musical one of the family.  She married Dr. Herman Ostrander of Lansing and died at a relatively young age.  Hattie married J.E. Allaban and also moved to Rockford, Illinois.</P>
<P>  Mary Strickland's husband was at one time or another a U.S. Congressman and a State Legislator.  Owing to his many political interests, Strickland was often absent from Saint Johns.  These absences seem to have given Mary the freedom to pursue her own cultural interests.  Besides providing the Ladies Library Association with their first rooms, she was also an enthusiastic member of the local ladies' Reading Circle, out of which later grew the Ladies Literary Club.  </P>
<P>In their old Linden Avenue home the Stricklands gathered around them the most intellectual people of their day and often, it is said, entertained speakers of nations reputation.  Perhaps Mary Strickland was best remembered by her contemporaries as an exceptional hostess.  She was especially noted for the balls and parties she gave.  </P>
<P>In 1906 Arvilla Hunt, whose husband was the druggist A.O. Hunt, described a gown she had made for one such occasion.  </P>
<P>It was of yellow and blue changeable silk, made with immense sleeves, a full skirt to accommodate the large hoops, the neck slightly low.  Her hair was dressed in the prevailing fashion then, parted in the middle and combed low over the ears with a huge back comb.  Of course the fan, scarf and huge poke bonnet were not lacking.</P>
<P>The dances always took place in the large room back of Mr. Strickland's study.  This room extended the entire width of the house.</P>
<P>  It was this room, too, which doubtless served as the village's first library.</P>
<P>Mary W. Babcock was 48 years old when she helped found the Ladies Library Association.  She had been born in Vermont but had moved to Livingston County, Michigan in 1835.  She studied on her own until the age of 15 when she began teaching.  She was able to teach until her mother died.  Then she had to assume the responsibility of managing her father's household until he married for a second time.  </P>
<P>When she was 19 years old, Mary married Marvin Babcock.  For a time her husband had been a peddler and engaged in many speculative endeavors including following the Gold Rush to California.  Finally he began selling jewelry in Saint Johns and eventually became a successful merchant.  </P>
<P>While her husband had been a Spiritualist who published a number of tracts outlining his views on religion, Mary was noted around town for her work in temperance and church societies.  The Ladies Literary Society was founded in her home, and she served as its president for 14 years.</P>
<P>Anna Tuthill was married to the Congregational minister, the Rev. George M. Tuthill.  She had been 44 years old when the Association was founded.  She and her family left Saint Johns in 1872 when another minister took over the pulpit.</P>
<P>Sarah McFarlan was 45 years old when the Association was founded.  She had been born in Connecticut and was married to Robert McFarlan, who owned a hardware store.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Lee was 39 in 1870.  She had been born in Canada.  Her husband Henry, who had been born in Missouri, was a hotel keeper.</P>
<P>Roxy Paldi was 27 years old when she became the Association's first secretary.  Her husband, Justin, was a civil engineer and secretary of the Board of Directors for St. Johns Manufacturing, the table factory.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Wells was 28 years old at the time.  She had just  married Charles, a boot and shoe merchant, in January, 1870.  To make ends meet they were also using their home as a boarding house.</P>
<P>Minerva Walker was only 25 when she helped found the Ladies Library Association.  At the time she and her husband, Samuel, had two girls, Susie who was 5 and Eloise who was still an infant.</P>
<P>Eliza Dunn was 28 and married to a dry goods merchant, Jesse Dunn.  She also had two young children, Edith, 5 and a baby, Gertrude.</P>
<P>Mrs. James B. McLean was a newlywed, just recently married to the Register of Deeds.</P>
<P>Hattie Collins was 22 years old and a newlywed as well.  Five years later her husband, James, would become the Village Clerk. In 1880 he was the Undersheriff.</P>
<P>Celia C. Smith was 21 the year that the first library opened.  Her father was a farmer, and like most unmarried women she was described in the 1870 census as being &quot;at home.&quot;  Her married friends were all busy &quot;keeping house.&quot;</P>
<P>One member of the Ladies Library Association was neither at home nor was she keeping house.  Miss Frances Tuckerman, 40, worked as a dry goods merchant herself and boarded with the family of barber, Samuel Davis.</P>
<P>There were three degrees of membership in the Ladies Library Association.  Any woman could become an Active member through the payment of a one-time-only initiation fee of $1.  Only Active members had the right to vote and hold office.  An additional annual fee of $1.00 was charged for the privilege of drawing books from the library.  </P>
<P>In another class were the Honorary members.  Any gentleman could become an Honorary member by the payment of the $1.00  initiation fee.  Men of course had no voting rights but could draw books from the library upon payment of the $1.00 annual fee.</P>
<P>Still another membership option was the Juvenile membership.  Any youth under the age of 15 could become a member by the payment of 50 cents initiation fee and $1.00 per year for the use of the library.  This user fee was payable in advance in quarterly installments of 25 cents during the months of March, June, September, and December.  In early publicity the founders of the Association explained that the fees for use of the library had been set artificially low so that any members of the community could avail themselves of the library's services.</P>
<P>Upon attaining the age of 15 any girl could become an Active member.  Boys of that age, however, were forever relegated to the lesser status of mere Honorary membership.</P>
<P>A few years later the By-Laws of the Association were amended.  Members moving from the village and those on brief vacations could transfer to another in writing their right to draw books from the library for the remainder of the time they had paid for.  Memberships, however, were not transferable.</P>
<P>A ledger was maintained in the library.  Each member's name was entered in the ledger.  All books were given a code number; and each month when the member withdrew a book from the library, the code number was entered in the ledger on the line containing the member's name.</P>
<P>No more than one book could be withdrawn from the library at  a time.  Exceptions to this rule could be made only by the Executive Board.  Each book was to be checked out of the library for a period of two weeks.  Books held beyond that time were subject to a whopping fine of 10 cents per week.  The Library was to be open every Saturday from 3 until 5 p.m. during the winter months and from 4 until 6 p.m. in the summer.</P>
<P>During the Centennial year of 1876 library hours were expanded to Wednesdays and Saturdays during the same time periods.  The library was staffed by Association members on Wednesday afternoons and by the librarian on Saturdays.  </P>
<P>In March of 1876 the Association contracted with Orrin Munger for the front room of his building located on the west side of Clinton Avenue.  The Association agreed to pay him the sum of $75 per year for at least five years.  </P>
<P>At once members of the Association recognized the need for more storage space, and Mr. Munger allowed them to build a closet in the room.  Carpet for the new library was obtained at a good price from Mr. Dunn's store.</P>
<P>In May, 1876 the Association moved the library into its new quarters.  The next month they celebrated the opening of the new library rooms with an ice cream social.</P>
<P>In August a new catalog of books available to members was printed.   A month later on Friday evening, September 22 the Ladies Library Association proudly sponsored the first &quot;hop&quot; of the social season.  There were also a number of somewhat regular &quot;entertainments&quot; which followed throughout the winter and early spring months.  These evenings often featured local musical groups.</P>
<P>Later that same fall the members planned an Author's Carnival.  That year the ladies donned costumes and performed scenes from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer.</P>
<P>In February of 1878 a member of the Association, Huldah Richards, was able to prevail upon her husband, the local Presbyterian minister, to give a lecture for the benefit of the Association.  The Reverend Jonathan E. Richards was a graduate of Yale College and was said to be well known throughout Michigan as a fine speaker.  Admission to the event was to be 25 cents.</P>
<P>The lecture seems to have been a huge success, clearing about $30 for the Association.  From their share of the proceeds the members purchased a step ladder, and poker, shovel and standard for the library rooms.  They also hoped to purchase an additional one dozen chairs, four of them arm chairs.  The price of the furniture would amount to $23.  </P>
<P>On February 26 of the same year another &quot;hop&quot; was held in rooms donated by Mr. Judd.  Perhaps embarrassed by the financial success of their recent enterprises, the members of the Association considered offering the Reverend Richards half of the purse, $15.  Just in case he should refuse their offer, however, members had already determined that they would use the money to purchase their new chairs.  In a further burst of gratitude the Association conferred Honorary membership for life upon both Mr. Judd and Mr. Richards.</P>
<P>The next spring members of the Association decided to hire a girl to clean the library rooms.  It was noted that special attention should be paid to the wall around the stove pipe.</P>
<P>In later years it would appear that it became harder and harder to find active members who were willing to spend the time needed to administer the library.  A number of other cultural organizations within the village began competing for the time and interest of the local women.  These included the Ladies Literary Club and the St. Johns Woman's Association.</P>
<P>As it became harder to gather members for the Association's March annual meeting, other organizations began to use the library rooms for their social events.  In April of 1899 a masquerade social was held there.  Six months later this same group held one of the ever popular milk and mush socials.  This was to be followed by a coon hunt.</P>
<P>In 1875 there had been 152 members who withdrew books from the library.  At the time the charter was due to expire in 1900 there were still 109 names inscribed on the ledger of the Ladies Library Association.  </P>
<P>When the Association was disbanded, two trustees were named to hold the money in trust for some other library purposes.  Many of the books were donated to the high school library at the Union School which was by then coming to be known as the Central building.</P></B>

<P><h3>The Next 25 Years Begin</h3></P>
<P><h4><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>
s the Library Board prepared to celebrate the Bement's 25th anniversary, they were looking to  expand.  Plans to use the upper and main floors of the firehall were under discussion. Still no definite decisions had been made, and no timetable had been set.</P>
<P>As she prepared to leave the Library, Elizabeth Millman recalled:</P>
<P>Originally the library was mostly a reading library.  But now a majority come from the school-age group, and the library has become more and more a study hall, both after school and on the evenings it is open.</P>
<P>Students of high school and the elementary schools flock in to gather material for lesson assignments.  Teachers now-a-days are asking for more and more outside reference material to augment the extbooks.</P>
<P>I have enjoyed every minute of my years as librarian.  I have always loved to read, and have been able to pursue that hobby to my heart's content during my years here.  Keeping up with the latest in books has kept me young, so that I really didn't believe it when they told me I had reached retirement age.</P>
<P>Librarianship as a career is most rewarding.  I should like to see many more young people take it up.  Libraries are becoming more and more important in the educational world, and there is a great need for trained library personnel.</P>
<P>Being in a softened and forgiving mood due to our age, we are giving you a chance to return any . . . forgotten books fine-free during the Silver Anniversary Week.  </P>
<P>This is your opportunity to ease your conscience with no pain to your pocket book.  Bring back those overdue books this week!</P>
<P>The Library had always subscribed to a number of periodicals and to the Reader's Guide and Periodicals Index.  A recent federal grant to libraries was currently supplying all of the periodicals listed by the Reader's Guide, so the Library's supply had increased greatly in number and variety.</P>
<P>Hila Bross was named the new librarian.  Hila's grandfather, the Rev. G.S. Northrup, had been the Baptist preacher in Saint Johns at the time of the Union School fire in 1885.  He was recalled to Saint Johns again just after the turn of the Century.</P>
<P>Two of Hila's aunts on her father's side had been teachers but had drifted into show business.  When Hila Axtell was eight years old, her family began ten years of traveling with the Hila Morgan Stock Company and the Monroe Hopkins Players throughout Iowa, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.  </P>
<P>Hila and her sisters did manage to get some education along the way.  Mildred Axtell Countryman attended Western State College and became a school librarian and music teacher.  Mildred had met and married another show business trouper, Floyd Countryman.  Their only daughter, Virginia, married Kenneth Jack Dietrich in 1955.</P>
<P>Hila attended boarding schools until she came to Saint Johns to live with the Northrups in 1926.  She graduated from St. Johns High School in 1929.  College had to wait, so she worked for the &quot;Clinton County Republican-News&quot; and the J.C. Penney Store.  Later Hila attended Michigan State University and Jackson Business University.</P>
<P>In 1953 Hila and her husband, Dr. H. Manning Bross, opened a restaurant in their home at French's Corners, north of Saint Johns.  She called the place the Salt Box House after the architectural style of the structure.</P>
<P>Hila was a cultured and intelligent woman.  Her early show business associations seemed to have given her an added flair that made her style a welcome addition to the somewhat literal atmosphere of conservative Saint Johns.  She brought to her new position both a sense of good taste and a willingness to innovate.</P>
<P>Teresa Merrill retired from the Library Board in July, 1965.  She was replaced by Mrs. Robert L. Wohlers.  Nina DeWitt retired in September.  The next month Mrs. Ladd Bartholomew joined the Board.  The new leadership included Basil Deibert, Chairman; Beulah Ballantine, Treasurer; and Jean Mary Bartholomew, replacing Teresa Merrill as Secretary.  Jack Smit represented the City Commission on the Board.</P>
<P>Immediately after coming into the Library as its Librarian, Hila Bross proposed that Library hours be extended.  She wanted the Library to be open from 12-5 daily and also from 7-9 on Tuesdays and Fridays for a total of 34 hours per week.</P>
<P>The new Library Board appointments and Library hours were both announced in a newspaper article in October.  &quot;The board emphasized that students are not allowed to bring their lunches into the library during the noon hour,&quot; the article concluded.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't Be a Book Hog&quot; was the theme Librarian Hila Bross used one year in an effort to get overdue books back to the library.  In honor of Groundhog Day, February 2, the Library suspended book fines for books returned on that day.</P>
<P>For some time a separate library system had been developing behind and beneath the big old wooden circulation desk.  Favored patrons and Library Board members could ask to have certain books, usually the latest best-sellers, held &quot;down under the counter&quot; for them.  A new Board policy was promulgated in October of 1965.  From then on books could be kept down under the counter for no more than 24 hours. After that the coveted volumes had to be returned to general circulation.</P>
<P>As time went on the Bement Library, like many small libraries, had neither the space nor the resources to meet the increasing demand for new and more varied reading materials.  In 1966 the Board agreed to join the Ingham County Library System for one year.  This membership also entitled Saint Johns residents who were interested to apply for cards to the Lansing Public Library. </P>
<P>The next year the Board voted to join the Central Michigan Library System on a trial basis provided that State Aid would accompany the membership.  The next year they chose to remain members, and for many years the Board continued to pay the membership dues out of the relatively small yearly State Aid checks.</P>
<P>Hila Bross continued the &quot;Bookshelf&quot; column in the local newspaper.  In January, 1968 she wrote:</P>
<P>While the main business of a library is the acquisition and circulation of books . . . still there is an increasing variety of activities connected with libraries these days.</P>
<P>Bement Public Library does venture into the audio field to the extent of having a small but choice collection of phonograph records for circulation.  And we are on a &quot;hot line&quot; from the Central Michigan Library System headquarters in Mason, through which we may borrow books we do not have.</P>
<P>Most of our operation, however, is still confined to the circulation of books, magazines, pamphlets, and clippings; and the answering of reference questions.  Most of these questions are asked in the library, but some come over the telephone.</P>
<P>Sometimes the question is an easy one, such as &quot;Who's the president of the Woman's Club now?&quot; or &quot;What's the official popu lation of St. Johns?&quot;</P>
<P>Frequently the caller claims that a certain word is not in his/her dictionary or encyclopedia, and asks that we look it up in ours.  This kind of call requires tact on our part because usually the reason the word can't be found is because the caller is not combining the first two or three letters in the proper order. . . .</P>
<P>Some of our most interesting questions come by letter, and frequently they are of a genealogical nature.  The staff of Bement Library does not attempt to do genealogical research, but if it is possible to answer a simple question through the use of our own resources, we usually do so.</P>
<P>Our most recent letter of inquiry comes from the Grand Rapids regional group of the Horseless Carriage Club of America.  They want information about the Triangle Truck Co. which operated in St. Johns about the time of World War I.</P>
<P>This librarian recalls that it was the Hayes Wheel Co., but the most vivid memory connected with it is the fact that it was possible to buy their scrap material for kindling and fire wood, and that a portion of a wheel rim made a marvelous curved seat for a rope swing out under a huge elm tree.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Hila Bross was working towards certification in Library Technology at Lansing Community College.  She assumed the costs of her education.  She asked no favors, she told the Board.  In the fall of 1966 she spoke to the Rotary Club, the Jaycettes and the rural teachers of the St. Johns School district.</P>
<P>Barbara MacKinnon was appointed by the City Commission in January, 1967.  At that time it became apparent to the Board that they must begin using some of the money they were acquiring from various outside sources, or they would lose it.  Suggestions included:</P>
<P>1. A bookmobile in conjunction with Central Michigan Library System</P>
<P>2. Book processing with Lansing and Central Michigan Library System</P>
<P>3. Shut-in program with a visiting librarian and large print books.</P>
<P>4.  New updated reference books</P>
<P>They decided to sell the old dictionary to the VFW Home in Eaton Rapids for $15.  By June a visiting librarian from Lansing, Mrs. John Henry Dudley, was available to visit shut-ins in Saint Johns.  One of her first clients was Dick DeGroot who had been homebound since undergoing back surgery.  After one year the federal funding for the program ran out, and the program was carried on by volunteers sponsored by the Central Michigan Library System.  In 1968 there were 19 volunteers in the tri-county area serving 32 homebound patrons.</P>
<P>Laurita Allison resigned on July 30, 1967.  She had worked for the Library for 14 years and still retained her position as Librarian for the elementary schools in the Saint Johns system.  A gift for Mrs. Allison came from the contributions of individual City employees.  </P>
<P>Cleo Desprez had been hired to replace Mrs. Allison as Assistant Librarian.  Retired rural teacher, Alice Jumper, began working in the library part time.</P>
<P>Two Board members had resigned at the same time as Mrs. Allison.  Basil Deibert and Beulah Ballantine were replaced by Tony Kuntz and Peg Feeman.  Board officers then included:  Jean Mary Bartholomew, Chairman and Barbara MacKinnon Secretary/Treasurer.  Advisory Committee assignments included: Tony Kuntz, book acquisition; Marijane Wohlers, equipment; Jean Bartholomew, books and business; Peg Feeman, decor; and Barbara MacKinnon, personnel.  In November, 1967 Marijane Wohlers resigned and Mrs. Hugh Banninga was chosen by the City Commission to replace her.</P>
<P>Former Board chairman Basil Deibert died unexpectedly on January 2, 1968.  The Library was closed during the funeral, and two books were placed in his memory.</P>
<P>In the spring of 1968 the Board decided that they must take exception to an assignment given to the students of 8th grade history teacher, Mr. McManus.  He had asked students to research a paper on &quot;American Imperialism.&quot;  School superintendent Earl Lancaster replied that the teacher simply had used the wrong terminology.</P>
<P>At that time the paperbound books that the Library had were kept behind the desk and were only circulated by request.  Patrons had to know they were there and ask for them specifically.  Many books, the Librarian and Board members agreed, were not suitable for 8th grade readers.  So many of them, it seemed, were filled with brutality and violence.</P>
<P>The Board agreed in January, 1969 not to purchase the controversial books <I>Candy,</I> and <I>Rosemary's Baby.</I></P>
<P>The next month Cleo Desprez told the Board that she had sent a letter of complaint to a publishing company regarding two mystery books she felt were not acceptable.</P>
<P>A red band policy was instituted.  Books which the Librarian believed were not suitable for all readers were marked on the spine with a piece of red plastic tape.  These books could not be withdrawn by young people or by adults who might be shocked by their content and thus become critical of Library policies.</P>
<P>A Saint Johns father attended the November, 1972 Board meeting to complain that his young daughter had brought home <I>Such Good Friends</I> by Lois Gould.  The book had been red banded, but the girl was large for her age and she had been able to check out the book.  The Board agreed that the policy had not been adhered to.  The father objected to having such books in the Library in the first place.  Mrs. Bross explained the popular demand for the type of books he objected to, saying that most of the books on the current Best Seller lists were of that nature.  The discussion also touched on the subject of censorship.  </P>
<P>After the father left the meeting, the Board voted to continue the red band policy system for all young people below the level of juniors in high school.</P>
<P>Hila Bross took a leave of absence in the fall of 1968 to complete her course work at Lansing Community College.  Cleo Desprez assumed the role of Acting Librarian, and Mrs. Bross was paid $500 to remain as Library Consultant.  In this way she could keep her Blue Cross health benefits and other insurance.</P>
<P>The Board agreed to purchase the textbooks for Mrs. Bross' fall classes.  These texts would then be added to the Library.  Mrs. Bross did ask, however, that she not receive her Christmas ham or turkey this year since she was going to school full time and was, after all, only a Consultant.</P>
<P>In March the Clinton County News printed the list of overdue books for 1969.  There were 305 books going back as far as 1963; and Cleo Desprez was hoping her Valentine theme, &quot;Have a Heart, Bring Your Books Back,&quot; would be effective.  </P>
<P>&quot;This fine-free period is a good time to get the overdue books gathered up and brought back,&quot; Cleo explained.  &quot;All libraries would rather have their books than the money.&quot;  Most of the books were returned promptly.</P>
<P>The Girl Scouts came again in April for a thorough clean-up of the library and grounds.  They spent most of their time outdoors raking and trimming.  Girls participating that year included Cheryl Bancroft, Jennifer Ott, Sue Ludwig, Helen Buggs, Karen Pease, Connie Cornell, Makayla Good, Leona Ludwig, Andrea Boyce, Karen Kundrata and Lee Morriss.  Mrs. Doyle Bancroft was their leader.</P>
<P>Hila Bross became a certified Library Technician in the fall of 1969 and came back as Librarian.  City Commissioner John Hannah joined the Board that fall.  </P>
<P>Redecoration of the Library began that winter in preparation for the celebration of the Library's 30th Anniversary the next April.  Raymond Eick was retained to do the scraping and painting.  The color chosen for the walls was celery green.  The new gold carpeting was purchased from Al Marrah. A $30 dollar wooden clothes hamper was added as an inside book drop.</P>
<P>As the Library came to be open more often at night, Mrs. Bross asked the City Commission to equip the locked Municipal Building doors with panic bars in case of emergency.  The Commission decided that panic bars would be too expensive, but they did offer to give the Librarian keys to the doors that might be used as emergency exits.  The Board also gave her permission to hire a girl to clean the Library floors as necessary.</P>
<P>During its 1970 observance of National Music Month, the St. Johns Morning Musicale featured a display of books by American composers at the Bement Library.  Musicale president, Mrs. Jeanne Bertoldi, announced that the year's theme was &quot;Parade of American Music.&quot;  Records supplied by the group were being played daily throughout the month on the local radio station, WRBJ.</P>
<P>Early in 1970 the Librarian began to explore the need for a new charge desk.  The beautiful old wooden desk just took up too much space.  A few months later the desks from the former Children's Library were placed in the main room, and school principal Roger Feeman accepted the old circulation desk and card catalog for use in Riley Elementary School.</P>
<P>Bess Osgood had quietly begun using the Library facilities to teach English as a second language back in 1959.  In the fall of 1970 the Library Board began sponsoring the project by purchasing texts and workbooks for the students.  Exchange students from the high school were allowed to take the books back with them when they returned to their native countries.  Other texts were added to the Library's collection after the students had finished with them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osgood met with the Friends of the Library in 1970 to explain her program.  She had brought three of her students with her.  Mrs. Marie Sukup originally had come from Czechoslovakia.  Mrs. Kyenge Hui Case and Mrs. Suki Hulett were from Korea.</P>
<P>Explaining the philosophy behind her weekly Monday night classes, Mrs. Osgood said, &quot;Anyone who has come here to live and wants the privilege of learning our language should have it.&quot;</P>
<P>Informality reigned in Mrs. Osgood's classroom, and she and her students frequently laughed together at themselves as they misunderstood one another.  When Mrs. Osgood used the phrase &quot;the frog was sitting in the sun,&quot; it brought forth giggles from the Korean students who thought they were being told a fairy tale of a frog actually sitting &quot;in&quot; the sun.  Then Mrs. Osgood explained that she really meant that the frog was sitting &quot;in the sunshine.&quot;</P>
<P>Most of the lessons were based upon the students' daily lives.  Sometimes the students swapped recipes, and Mrs. Osgood believed that she learned as much or more than her students.</P>
<P>In October, 1972 Hila Bross attended a State Library Conference on &quot;Reaching out to the Spanish Speaking.&quot;  Two years later several women from the community took advantage of a State Aid project called the Lauback Literacy workshop.  This was a workshop designed to train instructors to teach English as a second language.  It also proposed ways of teaching Spanish to the children of the Spanish-speaking parents in the community.</P>
<P>The Nuguyen family sent a letter to the Library Board in December, 1975 expressing their appreciation to Mrs. Osgood and to the Library Board for supplying them with text books.</P>
<P>The Board received a request in October, 1977 for a class to be held in Fowler.  The request was denied because the cost of the materials would have been born by the Bement Library.  The materials for the current six teachers and 11 students cost $181.26 that year.</P>
<P>By November there were four adults and three high school students working with Mrs. Osgood's program.  There were also two elementary students, a fifth grader and a first grader.</P>
<P>Margaret Rademacher tutored French exchange students.  Mrs. Max Calder worked with two Chicano adults.  Bea Barnum worked part time with students. </P>
<P>The program was growing rapidly, and the Library Board expressed the hope that some service clubs would step forward to help with the expense.  They decided to talk with Bill Swears, Bob LaBrie, and Lois Barnes at the high school to see whether they might be able to offer copying services to the program. </P>
<P>Ironically it was this shift of responsibility to the St. Johns High School which eventually proved to be the program's undoing.  One afternoon Bess Osgood ventured out into the halls of the high school just as classes were changing.  It had not been the fault of the students, she smiled later.  It was just that she couldn't move fast enough to keep up with the flow of traffic.  She was accidentally knocked down, and her hip was broken.  She was never able to return to working with her foreign-speaking students.</P>
<P>In June of 1970 Page Marie Geller received a raise to $.90 per hour.  She soon worked her way up to $1.00 when Joan Rosekrans left and Marie took over her position.</P>
<P>By the spring of 1973 Marie was working 11 hours per week and announced that she was soon to be married.  In June Marie Geller Foote thanked the Library Board for the $5 they sent her for a wedding present.</P>
<P>In the fall Joan Rosekrans returned from Ferris State where she had taken a Library Technician Course.  She was hired to replace both Marie Foote and Marsha Eckerly.  A few months later Rosekrans announced that she was marrying and moving away.  High school students Caren Dietrich and Sharri Desprez were hired to replace her.</P>
<P>Extensive weeding was already in progress in the fall of 1973 when the Library received word of a proposal from the Central Michigan Library System.  The Library could receive $500 worth of books with the stipulation that for each new book added .cb</P>
<P>to the collection an old one must be discarded.</P>
<P>At their January meeting in 1974 the Library Board pledged moral support for the proposed new Clinton County Historical Society at their upcoming organizational meeting on February 28.  One of the spark plugs for the new society was Librarian Hila Bross.</P>
<P>The following May an abandoned car was found in Council Bluffs, Iowa.  In it the police found a number of books from the Bement Library with the cards still in them.  The Library Board took that opportunity to address the larger problem of unreturned books, many of which were badly overdue.  Board member Jean Bartholomew moved that such patrons be denied library services for three months.</P>
<P>The salary of Library Clerk Virginia Dietrich was raised to $2 per hour that June.  The City also began to extend Blue Cross coverage to family members as well as eligible employees themselves.</P>
<P>The next June the Board received two applications.  Marie Geller Foote wanted to return part time.  Betty Moore asked to be considered for the position of Librarian after Mrs. Bross retired.  Both were told that there were no vacancies at the time, and Mrs. Moore's application was tabled.</P>
<P>In December of 1975 Hila Bross tendered her resignation effective July 4, 1976, her 65th birthday.  Cleo Desprez wanted to stay on as Assistant Librarian but was not interested in the Librarian's position.  It was at that same meeting that the Board marked a phonograph album as a memorial to Ladd Bartholomew.</P>
<P>In preparation for her departure Mrs. Bross began making an extensive inventory of the Library's holdings.  Work manuals and job descriptions, which had first been written in 1969, were updated.  </P>
<P>An old newspaper telling of the death of George Washington and published in January, 1800 had been donated to the Library by Ruth Smith Sirrine.  Since there was no room for the Library to display it properly, the newspaper was placed on indefinite loan to the Clinton County Historical Society Museum until such time as the Library had the proper facilities.</P>
<P>Back in 1972 a former resident, Edward S. Davis, had donated $10 to the Library for use in a museum fund.  For several years the Board had held the money hoping that a museum department would materialize.  Finally in 1976 the Board turned the $10 over the Historical Society's Museum.  A Pioneer Society book was also placed on indefinite loan at the Museum.</P>
<P>Jean Mary Bartholomew applied for the position of Librarian in February, 1976.  The Board planned to interview both Mrs. Bartholomew and Betty Moore.</P>
<P>In April Jean Bartholomew resigned from the Library Board, and John Hannah was appointed to take her place.  At the time he returned to the Board Mr. Hannah was the first City Commissioner to sit on the Board in a number of years.  All other cities, it was noted, had Commission members on their boards of directors.</P>
<P>Jean Bartholomew was appointed on April 1, 1976 to replace Hila Bross.  Mrs. Bartholomew enrolled for the Spring Term at Lansing Community College for a course on Technical Services for Libraries.  The new Librarian's starting salary was $6,360, and the Assistant Librarian was to receive $4,585.  The Librarian was to get a $5 raise at the end of each 12 hours of college credit she earned.  All other workers were now being paid at least minimum wage.</P>
<P>When asked about her successor, Hila said, &quot;I am sure she will bring a fresh approach to the library.&quot;</P>
<P>Then she continued, &quot;I have enjoyed the work in the library enormously.  You use all the brains, knowledge and energy you have.&quot;</P>
<P>When asked what she planned for her retirement, Mrs. Bross said that she wanted to clean out her attic and continue teaching piano lessons.  She also hoped to do some writing about the history of Clinton County.</P>
<P>&quot;She has everything up here,&quot; Cleo Desprez added.  &quot;When she retires, she will take all of this stored up information and knowledge with her.&quot;</P>
<P>The Board gave a dinner for Dr. and Mrs. Manning Bross.  They received a gift of three heavy pewter plates with ceramic centers picturing scenes from the American Revolutionary period, commemorating the bicentennial.  One of the plates was appropriately engraved.  These plates matched another the Board had given Dr. and Mrs. Bross on the occasion of their 40th wedding anniversary.</P>
<P>The Library was painted again in the fall of 1976, and the Board was again accepting applications for the position of page.  Gerald Good, Marcia Geller, and Jackie Plowman all applied for the position being vacated by Sharri Desprez.  Jackie Plowman was hired.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the new Librarian canceled the Junior Guild books and continued inventorying the rest of the fiction section.  Library employees were also weeding the vertical file and inventorying the record collection.  The Librarian suggested that magazines in the basement be kept for 10 years and then sold.  A few years later Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys were replaced as a part of the updating process.</P>
<P>The old red band policy of keeping some books from open circulation was soon abandoned.  &quot;Our library is somewhat unique with open shelves on sex material,&quot; Mrs. Bartholomew explained.  &quot;All of our books are available to all people.&quot;</P>
<P>In November of 1976 Board Chairman Tony Kuntz resigned from the Library Board.  Leon Brewbaker was named to replace him.  Officers of the Board included Lynn Banninga, Chairman and Peg Feeman, Treasurer.  Librarians had been acting as the Board's secretaries since about 1972.  This had become the custom with libraries in the area, Hila Bross had explained at the time.   </P>
<P>In 1976 a new 4-H group had been formed.  Members of the Tailwaggers Club began raising and training puppies to be sent to the Lions Leader Dog training.  When the pups became old enough, it was the responsibility of the young club members to take the dogs out and teach them how to behave in public buildings.  At first the Board informed the 4-Hers that dogs would be welcome in the basement room if they used the downstairs entrance.  Even then staff members were to be notified first, and no other dogs were to be allowed in any other parts of the building.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marge Webster attended the December Board meeting in 1977 to protest that the Board's policy was unreasonable.  All dogs who were kept under control were welcome in the Ovid Library, she added.</P>
<P>Peg Feeman moved and John Hannah supported the motion that all properly identified Leader Dog Trainees, under control, be allowed in the Library accompanied by their trainer.  Trainers could take only 15 minutes for research, and then they had to sign out their materials and leave.</P>
<P>Hila Bross was contacted in February, 1977 and asked to have an 8x10 black and white portrait made at Fitch Studios as soon as possible.  Of course the Board wanted to add her photograph to those of the other former Librarians in the Library.</P>
<P> In November of 1978 Hila was again asked to have her picture taken.  Finally in March of the next year Hila was said to be looking over the proofs, but she was never really satisfied with any picture she had ever had taken.  She insisted that she always looked too wooden in photos, and in a way she was right.  Only a candid shot of Hila could have captured her intelligent and expressive face and eyes.  And as far as we know, no one was ever able to get a truly candid photo of Hila.  She was too astute to be taken unaware and too self-conscious not to freeze at the first sight of a camera lens.</P>
<P>In March, 1977 the Library received a new coat of paint.  The curtains were cleaned, and fresh plants were added.</P>
<P>By the fall of 1977 the Bement Library had become a Class IV library in the Cooperative.  Under their rules the Librarian must have a five year or Masters Degree and the Assistant Librarian needed a four year college degree.  Present library employees were to be grandfathered in, but all employees to be hired in the future needed that amount of accreditation in order for the Library to remain in the Cooperative and receive aid.</P>
<P>Leon Brewbaker resigned in November of 1977, and a month later Mrs. Robert Barnes was appointed to take his place.</P>
<P>A blizzard struck Saint Johns on January 26 and 27, 1978.  On the second day, a Friday, Board Chairman Lynn Banninga and Page Jackie Plowman hiked in to the Library and opened it for the snowed-in travelers who were being housed upstairs in the Municipal Auditorium.</P>
<P>The next spring the Librarian asked the Library Board to establish a chain of command.  Henceforth no staff member other than the Librarian or the Assistant Librarian would be allowed to approach Board members with a problem.  This policy, she hoped, would eliminate communication break-downs and patron complaints.  Board members included John Hannah, Barbara MacKinnon, Peg Feeman, Marta Giesecke, and Lynn Banninga.</P>
<P>Visitors to the Library included the DeWitt Brownies, Mrs. Lashaway's first grade class, and the Adventist School.  The next summer Mrs. Dorothy Bakita complained that her class had not been allowed to visit the Library during the last week of school.  That was just too late in the year, explained Librarian Jean Bartholomew.  &quot;. . .We are not babysitters nor live entertainment for the last week of school,&quot; she added.</P>
<P>Summer Reading Club rules were still quite strict.  Each student first was asked to register at the Library desk.  Each participant was then expected to read 15 books: 5 fiction, 5 non-fiction, and 5 biographies between June and September.  Then each was asked to write a book report and turn it in early in September.</P>
<P>Award winners in the Summer Reading Club for 1978 included: 3rd grade - Amanda Koenigsknecht, Mary Worrall, and Adam Coffman; 4th grade - Charlene Busenitz and Pam Boehlke; 5th grade - Teresa Koenigsknecht, Richard Kirby, and Tracey Hundley; and 6th grade - Alice Puetz.  A quilt raffled off by the Keepsake Quilters Mrs. John Hannah, Mrs. Jim Hansen, Mrs. Terry Scranton, Mrs. Jim Martindale, and Mrs. John Giesecke, brought the Library $500.</P>
<P>That summer Jackie Plowman resigned.  Marie Foote was hired to replace her.  Carroll Furry was contacted to be trained as a substitute Page.  The next December Evelyn Henning resigned, and Carroll Furry was hired full time.  Janet Smalldon then became the substitute Page </P>
<P>The adequacy of the Bement Library again came under discussion when Alta Reed of the Clinton County Historical Society complained that historical materials were being inadequately housed and poorly preserved and that the workroom provided was unsuitable.  Among the materials under discussion were scrapbooks from several sources and papers and photographs from the Millman and the Arthur Wilson families.  There were also a number of unbound newspapers from the 1800's.  </P>
<P>In the fall of 1978 the Library Board discussed the possibility of preserving the newspapers in some way.  The next spring Betty Moore, representing the Historical Society, again contacted the Board about the condition of the old newspapers which were still being stored in a closet in the basement.  Another Historical Society member, Betty Minsky, agreed that they should be better preserved.  The Board replied that there was no money in the budget to care for the newspapers.  By summer the Board learned that the State of Michigan would bind the old newspapers free of charge if they were allowed to microfilm them first.  </P>
<P>After Geneva Wiskemann of the County Historical Commission complained about the condition of the materials, the Board agreed to use money donated by the Friends of the Library to purchase two lockable files.  These were to be placed in the Blue Room.</P>
<P> Meanwhile the Historical Society was embarked upon an immense project of its own.  Members were compiling and publishing a companion volume to the old 1880 <I>History of Clinton and Shiawassee Counties.</I>  This tome would cover the years 1880-1980 in Clinton County. One of the prime movers behind the project was former librarian Hila Bross.  She finally had the opportunity to put her knowledge of Clinton County history into writing. </P>
<P> As a part of the project, Shirley Karber was reading all of the past editions of the <I>Clinton Republican, Clinton County Republican-News, and Clinton County News</I> on microfilm using the Library's microfilm reader.  In July the Board received a letter from the 1980 History Book Committee which read in part: &quot;Please consider this check a donation to your Microfilm Reader Bulb retirement fund.&quot;  Shirley had already burned out two of the bulbs, and her task was not yet completed.</P>
<P>As the 1980 History was going to press Geneva Wiskemann, representing the Clinton County Historical Commission, again contacted the Librarian regarding the condition of the historical materials in its holdings.  Later Mrs. Wiskemann telephoned Peg Feeman and Lynn Banninga at home.  Privately she asked the Board members about the qualifications of their Librarian.</P>
<P>By way of reply both Board members assured Mrs. Wiskemann of Mrs. Bartholomew's qualifications.  Then they in turn questioned Geneva Wiskemann about genealogical materials which had come up missing from the Library's closet.  Further discussion of the subject was tabled.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1980 Barbara MacKinnon and Peg Feeman resolved to begin sorting materials to be put in files.  Later they decided to put off the genealogical work until after school began.</P>
<P>In November another member of the Historical Society, Arlynn Gantz, offered to index and separate the historical materials.  In return Lynn Banninga and Marta Giesecke from the Board offered temporary storage in the closet and reference library to the Clinton County Historical Society's new Genealogy project.</P>
<P>The next summer Mrs. Bartholomew asked the Board to restate an earlier policy.  No non-circulating genealogy materials were to be loaned to anyone for any length of time.</P>
<P>The Library was closed on the day of Manning Bross' funeral in the fall of 1979.  An old fashioned funeral wreath was placed on the Library door.   The next winter the Library closed from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. for the funeral of Tony Kuntz.  Again the funeral wreath was hung on the door.  The Board voted to subscribe to the large print edition of the Readers Digest in Mr. Kuntz's memory.</P>
<P>In the spring of 1979 Cleo Desprez had undergone gallbladder surgery and missed six weeks of work.  The next October she suffered a coronary.  At that time she was told that she would be paid for three months sick leave, and then her employment would be terminated if she were still unable to return to work.</P>
<P>Carroll Furry, who had recently received her State Certification, was appointed Acting Assistant Librarian.</P>
<P>By February Cleo Desprez was back at work, but she decided to retire following her 70th birthday on February 28, 1981.</P>
<P>Carroll Furry was offered and accepted the position of Assistant Librarian.  Janet Smalldon came on as Page.  A vacation chain of command was established whereby staff members could ask for vacations days in the following order:  Librarian, Assistant Librarian, Clerk, and Pages.</P>

<P><h3>Building the New Library</h3></P>
<P><h4><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>
he Bement Library had first opened its doors to the public on Saturday, April 13, 1940.  It wasn't until November of the next year that Minnie Barrington decided that space in the new library was inadequate.  She needed more storage room and asked for the middle room in the basement.  What she finally got two years later was a room in the old City Hall.</P>
<P>A year later the Board first discussed joining the State Board of Libraries.  The advantage to joining was that State Aid  money would be available to the Library for the first time.  </P>
<P>Winifred Daboll disagreed vigorously.  She believed that this step was the &quot;beginning of an intervening wedge by the State.&quot;  In the end the Board voted to join but agreed to withdraw if too many demands were made.</P>
<P>  As a Class II Library, the Bement Library was entitled to $423.17 that year.  A few months later the Board began looking into the possibility of obtaining a share of the penal fines set aside for library purposes.</P>
<P>In the meantime a store room in the old City Hall was secured and put to good use.  Later that fall the Board asked the city to clean the walls and pay for it.  Mr. Keiser was contacted to build a $50 partition in the storage room.</P>
<P>On September 6, 1944 the Board voted to remain members of the State Library because of the money and other benefits they had enjoyed over the past year.</P>
<P>Statistics that year showed that 31% of the patrons of the Bement Library were coming from outside the City limits.</P>
<P>In October of 1945 the Chairman of the Library Board went before the City Commission to ask for more funding.  Three years later the Board was assured of State Aid equal to the amount of funding they received from the City.</P>
<P>Early in 1948 the Library was given a new storage room in the basement of the Municipal Building, and the Board paid $117.20 to have shelves built in the new area.  Two months later the Board took a tour of their fine new storage area.</P>
<P>In August of that year the Board presented the mayor, Mr. Palmer, with the annual report and a copy of the constitution which had been revised to meet the demands of State Aid.</P>
<P>Soon the Board received word that the Library had been approved for State Aid until July, 1953.  This meant that they could draw money from the state equal to the amount of money given by the City.</P>
<P>Miss Daboll was still decidedly opposed to the Library's receiving State Aid.  Four months later she resigned from the Board of Directors.  She was replaced by Beulah Ballantine.</P>
<P>During the same month that Miss Daboll resigned over the financial dispute, the Library had received its annual $132.66 in State Aid.</P>
<P>Late in 1949 the Library lost its downstairs storage facility.  It seems that for some time there had been continuing pressure from a group who wanted to use the downstairs kitchen facilities.  A new storage facility was needed.</P>
<P>The balance on hand in the Library Board treasury was $1,772.42 on February 26, 1952.  And the Board was still discussing the benefits and weaknesses of State Aid.  A year later the question was still being discussed.  This time the Board voted to reject State Aid at least until November of 1953.</P>
<P>The Board invited a representative from the State Board to attend their September, 1953 meeting.  She explained to them that as a Class II library they could expect to receive $275 from State Aid that year.  In order to qualify, she noted,  their Librarian must hold a second grade certificate or be working toward it and must attend two workshops.  The Assistant Librarian needed to have a first grade certificate and would be required to attend two workshops within three years.  </P>
<P>Since the Board knew that both Mrs. Millman and Mrs. Allison could qualify, they decided to go ahead and apply once again for State Aid.  In April, 1954 the Board applied; and in July the Library received $261.03 from State Aid.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>As time went on, space continued to be at a premium.  Then in 1954 the City Commission had voted to lend the old Justice of the Peace office to the library for a Children's Library.</P>
<P>In 1956 the Library received $173.39 in State Aid and $3,885 from the City of Saint Johns.  The next January the Board granted raises to all Library employees in accord with the raises given to all of the City employees.</P>
<P>The 1957-58 budget of $4,700 was assured by the City.  A year later the Board again hoped to acquire some of the penal fine money distributed to libraries.  Since the money was being distributed through the schools, the Board contacted Superintendent of Schools Earl Lancaster.  He agreed to purchase $500 worth of books for the Bement Library if the Librarian would make the selections.  The Board agreed to accept the books.</P>
<P>At the same time the City Commission began requesting the removal of the Children's Library to another room in the Municipal Building.  The Board did not approve of the move and tabled the matter.</P>
<P>By 1961 the Board had acquired the penal fines for Saint Johns and was beginning to invest the income with a view to expanding the library or building a new one.  In a note to the City Manager, Ralph Precious, the Board enclosed the following 1951 opinion of the Michigan Attorney General:</P>
<P>Penal fines may be expended by authorities of participating libraries for any purposes involved in the establishment, maintenance and operation of libraries, including the acquisition of sites and buildings, purchase of equipment, including books as well as the general operating expenditures incident to libraries.</P>
<P>That year the penal fines invested in savings certificates amounted to $4,145.</P>
<P>The 1963 Library budget stood at $5500.  Penal fines amounting to $3,513 were placed in time certificates.   At the same time the City Manager suggested charging non-residents for the use of the library.  The Board rejected the idea unanimously.</P>
<P>Board Chairman Basil Deibert suggested in June, 1964 that the $10,500 which had been set aside by the Board for improvements or a new building be set aside as a contingency fund for possible use in a building or improvement program for the future.  The subsequent motion was approved unanimously.</P>
<P>Almost a year later Deibert asked the Board to call in a consultant from the State Library Board to make suggestions about how the Library could be enlarged.</P>
<P>On June 11, 1965 the Library Board met with the City Manager, Ken Greer, to discuss the possibility of remodeling the present library.  They discussed the amount of money that they had managed to save for the project, but it was the opinion of the consultants that Federal money would not be available for the plans they had drawn up.  The project was tabled.</P>
<P>Six months later  Greer returned for a special meeting to discuss liquidating the Library Board Building Fund.  Auditors, he said, had suggested that the money become a part of the City Treasury.  In the future penal fines would go directly to the City but would be earmarked for the building fund.  In the future all moneys would go to the City, and bills would be paid directly by the City Clerk.  In closing, the City Manager reminded the Board that they were appointed by the City Commission and could be removed at any time by that body.</P>
<P>City Commissioner Ray Kentfield promised the Library Board that from then on penal fines would go to the City but would be placed in a special building fund for the library.  Greer gave a tentative time period of five years before the Library expansion could begin under Urban Renewal.  The present funds, he said, were to be put in Treasury .pa</P>
<P>bonds and earmarked for the building fund.</P>
<P>Mayor Charles Coletta moved that the money the City was holding for the Library be ear-marked for a special building fund account.  The motion carried.</P>
<P>On February 1, 1966 the Librarian presented a cashier's check for $25,899.52 to the City Treasurer.  The Board had held out $200 to purchase a new rug and lamps for the Children's Library.</P>
<P>In order to keep the penal fines coming into the library, Board members were told that the City must contribute .3 mil to the support of the library.  The Board also began to look to the outlying districts for support.</P>
<P>Board Chairman Basil Deibert advised Coletta and Kentfield that the Board had received a penal fine check for $20,124.60 in October of 1966.  Board members still had many questions in their minds.</P>
<P>What kind of budget money could they expect from the City in the future?  Could the Librarian still order books and supplies direct instead of having to go through the City Clerk?  Why was there suddenly a delinquency of payment on some of the Library's accounts?  Would the City still continue to fund the Library at a high enough rate to keep them eligible to receive penal fines?</P>
<P>The fiscal year 1966-67 was the first year in its history that the Library operated without any local tax support, and none was expected for 1967-68.  The Library's chief source of income was from penal fines.</P>
<P>Penal fines for the past few years had been unusually generous, being $20,123.60 for 1966-67.  State Aid had totaled $281.45, book fines brought in another $285.69 and interest from bonds had equaled $101.45.  </P>
<P>By January it had been determined that the City must contribute .3 of a mil towards the support of the Library in order for the library to continue receiving penal fines.  The Board was hoping to be able to add Fowler to the Library's service area to increase penal fine income.  The Librarian was given a $100 limit on purchases.  And the Board received an inquiry from the County Library Board asking if the Bement Board was having any trouble with the City Commission.</P>
<P>The Board received a letter from City Manager Ken Greer in February, 1967 billing the Library for operating expenses, building maintenance, and administrative expenses.  In asking for payment he wrote:</P>
<P>Our auditors some years ago pointed out that the cost to operate the municipal building should be charged to those departments housed in the building also that the cost of our administrative expenses must be charged to the various departments and services of the City if the City were to have a true picture of its total operations.</P>
<P>The City Attorney at my request recently researched all the laws and has ruled that it is illegal for the library board to have funds in its own name also it would be illegal for the bank to disburse these funds contrary to law.  I am sure that this was not the intent of the Library Board in failing to turn into the City Treasurer all revenues.</P>
<P>A month later the Board was asking for clarification.  Mayor Coletta suggested that the City Commission and the Library Board have at least one joint meeting per year.  Commissioner John Furry said that the $22,000 must be kept in a separate fund to make the Library eligible for future penal fines.  City Manager Greer informed the Board that a lump sum of $15,981 had already been taken out of the $22,000.</P>
<P>Library Board members were stricken.  Basil Deibert demanded to know why they were suddenly talking about $22,000 when nearly $26,000 had been turned over to the City to be invested.  Deibert further went on record as stating that he would never accept any resolution that did not start with the original $25,899.52 - with an accounting given for all amounts.  In the end the retroactive rent was not collected, but no accounting was ever given either.  </P>
<P>Everyone agreed that the Library Board needed legal help.  At the time the Dearborn Library was having similar problems.  The Michigan Attorney General had issued an opinion that the Library Board had control over endowed funds.</P>
<P> Board members Basil Deibert and Beulah Ballantine and Assistant Librarian Laurita Allison resigned.  Consultants from the State Library and the Central Michigan Library System were called in.  They suggested that the Board turn the matter over to the  State Department of Education and the Attorney General.  </P>
<P>One consultant suggested that the Library should not have to pay rent because more than half of the money for construction of the Municipal Building was earmarked for &quot;library purposes.&quot;  In fact only about 58% of the City's share of construction costs or $20,428.88 came from the original Bement fund.  That figure represented only 32% of the total cost of the building. </P>
<P> The City had taken $6,593.87 from its General Fund at the time application was made for the Federal grant.   Money for other expenses incurred by the City throughout the course of the building project, including the purchase of the different properties, came from the City's water fund.  Therefore .pa</P>
<P>following the State consultant's logic, the Municipal Building could be said to belong about equally to the Library and the City Water Department.</P>
<P>With the specter of back rent removed the Board turned once again to the administration of the funds they no longer held in their own bank accounts.  The City Attorney, Harold Reed, was of the opinion that it was against the law for the City to levy the suggested 1 mil for Library services if the Library already had enough money to meet expenses.  </P>
<P>The penal fines for 1967 amounted to $23,142.  Right then the Bement Library was spending about $1.35 per person served whereas the State average was closer to $2.75 per person.  So a representative from the State Library suggested that the Library Board increase their budget and their services.   </P>
<P>That fall new Board member Tony Kuntz suggested that the Board invest $15,000 in each of the two local banks.  The Board was incensed once again to find that they were not going to be given the original copies of the time certificates for these investments.  They decided to ask the City Manager who replied:</P>
<P> I cannot direct that our City Treasurer violate either our City Charter or the statutes of the State of Michigan, which would be the case if the City Treasurer turned over these time certificates to the Library Board.</P>
<P>. . . State Law gives [the Library Board] the exclusive control of the expenditure of all monies collected to the credit of the Library Fund, but it does not proceed and make them responsible for its deposit or storage . . .  The City Treasurer is bonded but Board members aren't.</P>
<P>Doubtless the City Commission had been right to insist that the City Treasurer oversee the large sums of money being administered by the Library Board.  As the City Manager had pointed out, Library Board members were not even bonded.  And the Board was a creature of the City Commission in much the same way the Park Board had been back in 1940 when the Library Board was first created.</P>
<P>The problem was primarily one of degree.  While the City Commission continued to fund other City departments, it seems that the Commissioners suddenly had to take another look at the Library Board.  The Library didn't appear to need financial assistance from the City.  They were, in fact, generating some pretty good-sized revenues. </P>
<P>In the end it would appear that Winifred Daboll had been right to be afraid to take outside money -- if only for the wrong reasons.  Miss Daboll had been concerned about undue control coming into the Library from outside the community.  As it turned out, just the opposite had occurred.  So much money had begun coming into the Library from outside the City of Saint Johns that the City Commissioners may have begun to lose track of their obligation to support their own Library financially.  </P>
<P><B>FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY</B></P>
<P>In June, 1967 Mrs. Millman announced that the St. Johns Woman's Club was forming a new organization called &quot;Friends of the Library.&quot;  A nationwide organization, Friends was designed to encourage understanding and appreciation of the work of the library and to help in its future development.  The larger organization was also instrumental in obtaining bequests and gifts of books, manuscripts and other appropriate materials such as works of art, rare books, musical recordings and magazines for each public library with which it was affiliated.</P>
<P>The charter group was chaired by Mrs. Rolan Sleight.  Other members included Mrs. Roy Davis, Mrs. Lawrence Fish, Mrs. Cerelda Hicks, Mrs. Van Hoag, Mrs. K.L. Jones, Mrs. James Postlethwaite, Mrs. Leo Pouch, Mrs. William Richards Sr., Mrs. John Rumbaugh, Mrs. Joseph Spousta, Mrs. Marion Walling, and Mrs. Brandon White.  Men and women alike were invited to join the organization.</P>
<P>The new group met for the first time on September 21 at 7:30 p.m. in the Library.  Fifty-one families signed up at that organizational meeting.   Their purpose they said was to
 foster closer relations between Bement Public Library and the citizens of St. Johns; to promote knowledge of the functions, resources, services and needs of the library; to lead in the development of a program for the extension and improvement of library services and resources; and to aid in the provision of adequate housing and other facilities of the library.  </P>
<P>In essence, the Friends of the Bement Public Library was an auxiliary to the Library Board and the Library. </P>
<P> Dues in the new organization were set at $1 per family per year, and the group was headed by a 15-member board of directors.  Mrs. Brandon White was named the new president of the Friends of the Library Board.  Other officers included: Mrs. Rolan Sleight, vice president; Mrs. Lawrence Fish, secretary, Mrs. Millman, corresponding secretary; and Jack Davis, treasurer.  Other directors included the Rev. Gerald Churchill, Kurt Becker, Mrs. Maxine Parmelee, the Rev. Hugh Banninga, Mrs. Keith McDowell, Mrs. Marion Walling, Mrs. Erma Robinson, Mrs. Gordon Iacovoni, William Kemper, Mrs. Keith Bovee, and David Pocuis.  Ex-officio members of the board were Librarian Hila Bross and &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot; reporter Betty Jane Minsky.  </P>
<P>Members of the Friends of the Library were entitled to purchase books at reduced prices by ordering them through the library.</P>
<P>One of the first projects undertaken by the Friends was the keeping of a book of &quot;Memory.&quot;  In this book were to be recorded all of the books and special gifts donated to the Library over the years in memory of friends and family members.  Mrs. Jerry Stone headed this nearly overwhelming project.  The undertaking was made especially difficult since some of the gifts went back to 1939 before the Library was even opened.  </P>
<P>On October 29, 1967 the Friends hosted a reception for the departing Library Board members, Beulah Ballantine and Basil Deibert and the outgoing Assistant Librarian, Laurita Allison.</P>
<P>The next month the Friends of the Library debated the possibility of taking books to nursing homes and the county farm.  Soon the Clinton County Infirmary was getting a visit from one of the Friends of the Library about every two weeks.  Mrs. Leon Brewbaker was in charge of that project.  Residents of area nursing homes and the Infirmary thus were able to sign out books just as a patron would at the main library.</P>
<P> A book drop was installed at Rodney B. Wilson High School to aid students there in returning library books on time.  This project was overseen by a high school student, Medina Parsons.  She saw to it that books left at the high school for the Library were returned on time.</P>
<P>By January, 1968 the Friends also had decided to try to institute a book cart service at Clinton Memorial Hospital.  In preparation for the new project, Elizabeth Millman, Hila Bross, and Friends Board President Annette White spent a day at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing studying the library set-up provided there.  </P>
<P>&quot;It is a bigger deal there than we could ever hope to have here,&quot; Mrs. White pointed out, &quot;because I doubt if we could ever have a paid librarian.  But we learned how to set up this service, what books we would need, and how to get them ready.</P>
<P>&quot;These books have to be screened.  With Mrs. Millman in charge of it, we are quite fortunate because she was a librarian and is familiar with a lot of books.&quot;</P>
<P>The library service at the hospital was to be handled by volunteers, and they had to be people who were not squeamish about working in the hospital.  Hospital administrator Harold Reed readily approved the plan. Books were to be stored in the doctors' library at the hospital, but .pa</P>
<P>they were carried from room to room on a cart.  Long term patients at the hospital were able to order books to read that weren't a part of the collection at the hospital. </P>
<P>The first selection of about 107 books needed to be bound and marked.  Two workshops were held at the Library for that purpose.  Among the participants were Mrs. Brandon White, Mrs. John Rumbaugh, and Mrs. Gordon Iacovoni.  Whenever a jacket was not available, one was made of wallpaper.  Heathman's and Glaspie's donated two large catalogs of wallpaper samples for the purpose.</P>
<P>There was already a collection of books which the Hospital Auxiliary had used as part of their service.  Later these were sorted and processed to be added to the others.</P>
<P> The hospital book cart service was the largest of the organization's early projects.  Among the first volunteers to work at the hospital regularly were Kay Arehart, Shirley Casler, Adelaide Mikula, Mrs. Pat Kelly, Mrs. Erma Robinson, and Mrs. Lloyd Campbell.  Books were distributed on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.  Patients could return the books at the hospital or through the Bement Library.</P>
<P>In May, 1968 the Friends group sponsored a Library Art Exhibit at the Central National Bank.  Paintings included &quot;Lakeside&quot; and &quot;Quiet Sea&quot; by Warren Anderson, &quot;Daffodils&quot; by Georgianna Kelly, &quot;Countryside&quot; by Gladys Schueller, &quot;Driftwood With Bottle&quot; by Betty Penix, &quot;Fruit Still Life&quot; by Joan Ernst, &quot;Paysage on Alsace&quot; by William Morriss and &quot;Owl&quot; by Romaine DeCamp.</P>
<P>Of course the Friends of the Library were as anxious as the Library Board members were to see the Library settled in its new building.  During Sidewalk Days in the summer of 1968 the Friends workers collected $75 on their used book sale.  Eighty discarded library books were sorted into paper bags for the event.  Helping with the project were school children Jim Smith, Bill Brewbaker, Marty Brewbaker, Caren Dietrich, Janice Flermoen, Kathy Piper, Danny Piper, and Lori Piper.</P>
<P>The next year the Friends Board, headed by Adelaide Mikula, added a book discussion group to their list of activities and continued to sell books during the annual Sidewalk Sales.  </P>
<P>In April the Friends of the Library donated money to the Library in memory of Dr. Franklin W. Smith.  The next month Librarian Hila Bross and Mrs. Franklin Smith attended a District meeting of the Friends of the Library.</P>
<P>  </P>
<P>The Friends group took over sponsorship of the summer reading program.  At the end of each summer they gave a reception for the winners of the essay contests and awarded prizes.  Library Week celebrations also became a part of their involvement in the workings of the Library.</P>
<P>When the local Jaycettes began sponsoring a Lunch With Santa each December in the Municipal Building Auditorium, the Friends began sponsoring a story hour.  In 1972 Mrs. Robert Barnes and Hila Bross were assisted by other members of the Friends of the Library and the Drama Club of St. Johns High School.  For three Saturdays in a row they entertained children.  This year the groups were divided according to size and age to prevent the overcrowding that had nearly swamped the program in 1971.</P>
<P>The speaker for the 1973 annual meeting of the Friends of the Library was Roy L. Dodge, the author of <I>Michigan Ghost </I><I>Towns.</I>  After he spoke, prizes were awarded as usual for book reports completed during the summer Children's Reading Club.</P>
<P>In January, 1975 the Friends of the Library sponsored a Crafts Fair in the Municipal Auditorium.  At their annual meeting in September the Board reported that they had held their annual used book sale as usual in August. In addition to these activities, the Friends were planning to sponsor a sale of First Editions in conjunction with the Clinton County Historical Society's upcoming Home Tour.</P>
<P>In August, 1976 the Friends of the Library netted $70 during the Sidewalk Sales.  The books which they had not been able to sell in August were sent for distribution to Veterans hospitals.</P>
<P>At Christmas time in 1976 Mrs. H. Garapetian and Mrs. John Arehart did a Christmas reading program for a small but attentive group.  The next month 138 children's books were discarded, and 246 were purchased to replace them.  The Friends of the Library hoped to sell the discarded books during the next Sidewalk Days sales.</P>
<P>On April 5, 1977 the Friends of the Library collaborated with the Library Board to sponsor a Film Festival.  A projector was borrowed from the St. Johns Episcopal Church.  Library Board members Barbara MacKinnon and Peg Feeman chose the films, &quot;One Wish Too Many&quot; and &quot;The Little Engine That Could.&quot;</P>
<P>The winners of the 1977 Summer Reading Program and their parents were honored guests at a punch and cookies party.  Cash prizes and certificates were awarded as usual.  By December of 1977 the Friends of the Library turned to the Library Board looking for new members and new ideas.  </P>
<P>Library Board member Lois Barnes, who had been active in the Friends organization, told the Library Board that she believed that the problem with the Friends of the Library was a lack of direction by the old Board.  Ten members had left.  </P>
<P>Reorganization and reactivation of the Friends group became the pet project of Sue Cerney and Patricia Smith.  They needed, some said, someone other than the Librarian to serve as a liaison person between their Board and the Library Board.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cerney suggested that the organization be dropped for six months and then reorganized.  Kay Arehart was anxious to establish a new Board.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1978 the Friends of the Library did not hold their annual used book sale during Sidewalk Days.  There were not enough workers.  Still they hoped they might be able to get a sale together in time for the Historical Society's annual Home Tour.</P>
<P>On September 6, 1979 Sue Cerney, representing the Friends of the Library, turned over $438 to the Library Board to be used to purchase something for the Library sometime in the future.  All of the records and scrapbooks from the organization were placed in the Library for safekeeping.  The Board turned the money over to the City where it was placed in a separate account.  It was this money which had been used to purchase the storage cabinets in the Genealogy room.</P>
<P>As usual, in January of 1968 the Library Board began to look for more storage space.  The cupboards in the upstairs kitchen were suggested.  It was estimated that a new library would be needed in about six years, and the Chairman of the Board suggested that having the City levy one mil in taxes for the library would be a painless way to get it.  In the end the Library didn't even get to use the cupboards.</P>
<P>In September, 1968 the Library Board began entering into general contracts with the neighboring townships.  Bingham and Bengal were the first.  Penal fines that year amounted to $19,630.44.  The Board had another $34,605.59 on hand.</P>
<P>That same month the Board discussed using the old Grand Trunk depot as a library.  They were told that it still housed the telegraph key and that it would be too expensive to move it.  The Librarian thought that it was too small anyway and would need a fence to protect patrons from train traffic.</P>
<P>Towards the end of 1969 several building sites were discussed including the two that the Bement family had favored all along, the post office and A&amp;P Store lots.  Another site mentioned was the old Hicks mansion itself.</P>
<P>Consultants from the State Library were asked to visit the Hicks house which was being placed on the market by Mrs. Franklin Smith.  She had asked that the entire Board not tour the place unless they were really serious about purchasing the property.  The consultants reported that it would be impossible to use the old home effectively as a library.</P>
<P>The Board decided that perhaps they would do better to look into enlarging the present Library by remodeling the back of the Municipal Building.  Therefore the Board returned to the City to ask that 1 mil be levied for the support of the library.  </P>
<P>Board members agreed that there was no use purchasing a new charge desk until they knew whether they were moving.  Two months later they voted to go ahead and look at new desks.</P>
<P>Early in 1971 a Federal fund of $260,000 became available.  All the Board needed was a building site, a building plan, and a payment plan.  Sites available at that time included Kurt Becker's store, the old Richards Dairy, the DeRose property, a vacant lot at the corner of Cass and Wight Streets across from St. Joseph Catholic School, the Hicks house, the old Chevrolet garage on Higham, the City Park complex, Matthews Dairy, Miller Furniture, and the parking lot north of the Municipal Building.  Also under consideration was Dr. Burkhardt's old office, the original Hicks house on Brush Street.</P>
<P>Librarian Hila Bross told the Board that they must consider population growth and should be planning ahead for an area population of about 10,000 people.  In order to serve this population Mrs. Bross added that the Library would need a 20,000 volume collection of books with 2,500 linear feet or an allocation of one foot for each 8 books in the collection.  In addition there would be a need for 2,000 square feet of floor space; 1,200 square feet of reader space; 1,000 square feet of staff space and an addition 1,800 square feet of space needed for equipment.  The total amount of space required would be about 7,000 square feet.</P>
<P>Areas which would be needed in the new Library included historical, audio visual, children's, and reference departments, study areas, work areas for staff members, office space, and wall and counter display space.</P>
<P>The Richards property on Brush Street was 50 feet wide by 165 feet deep and was available for between $18,000 and $24,000.  The Burkhardt office, located on a piece of land 110 feet square, would cost $21,000 in cash.</P>
<P>The Board had $36,825.54 in savings, but the State Library Consultants told them that it would be almost useless to ask Bingham Township for millage since the City of Saint Johns did not support the Library financially.  The Board agreed to investigate the possibility of writing open-ended contracts between the Library Board and the Township Boards.</P>
<P>A piece of land at the corner of Higham and North Oakland Streets owned by James McKenzie came to the attention of the Board.  The site was 77 feet by 150 feet and was valued at $7,000.</P>
<P>On December 9, 1972 an emergency meeting of the Board was called because the word was out that the A&amp;P store was closing.  Board Chairman Tony Kuntz attended the next City Commission meeting in the company of Barbara MacKinnon and Hila Bross.  Friends of the Library members Donald Isbell, Jessie Finch, Orientis Fish, Olive Conklin, Adelaide Mikula, Robert and Lois Barnes, Pauline Torpey, the Rev. Francis Johannides, and Mildred Countryman also attended.  Commission members present that evening included Mayor Robert Wood, John Hannah, Jeanne Rand, Roy Ebert and Dr. James Grost.  Also in attendance were City Manager Harvey Weatherwax, City Clerk Thomas Hundley, and City Zoning Administrator Randy Humphrey.</P>
<P>Mr. Weatherwax and Mr. Humphrey, a representative from the Fire Marshall's office, and an engineer from the firm of Williams and Werkes of Grand Rapids went out to look over the place.  The Library Board was asked to prepare a plan for the use of the building and to present a possible budget.  Two contractors, Norm Rademacher and Ben Wieber, were asked to submit construction bids on a new roof, fire-resistent ceiling tiles, and rehanging the doors.  </P>
<P>The Board took a $1 option on the property and voted to purchase it - provided the City would support the Library with millage or a tax appropriation.  The Commission failed to approve the purchase, did not agree to support the Library financially, and the matter was dropped.</P>
<P>Meanwhile more and more townships were entering into contracts with the Library.  In March, 1973 Bingham, Bengal, and Dallas signed.  Each agreed to turn over their penal fines in exchange for library services for their residents.  The next month Olive and Riley Townships agreed to turn over half of their penal fines.  The other half was to go to the neighboring DeWitt Library.</P>
<P>Again in 1973 the Board Chairman returned to the City Commission to ask for the 1 mil levy.  The Board still hoped to be able to spend most of the newly acquired penal fines for a building or a building site.</P>
<P>Lynn Banninga and Board Chairman Tony Kuntz were sent to the City Commission to ask about the possibility of using the Municipal Auditorium as a Library.  In June, 1973 the Commission postponed action on giving the Auditorium to the Library.  By October the Library Board still had not received any answer from the Commission.</P>
<P>The Library had not qualified for State Aid in 1972-73 because City funds did not equal the required minimum of .3 mil of equalized valuation.  That year the Library stood to lose $3,426.  If they did not qualify for a second year in a row, they risked being dropped from the Central Michigan Library System.</P>
<P>Mayor Robert Wood announced that the City would give the Library $10,000 the next year.  This together with the penal fines should, he said, insure eligibility for State Aid.</P>
<P>Finally the State Board for Libraries reconsidered and sent the Library Board a check to be placed in a special account.  Librarian Hila Bross suggested that the money be used first to pay the Central Michigan Library System dues as usual.  The rest she hoped the Board would put into the Library's audio visual department.</P>
<P>In the spring of 1974 Peg Feeman moved that Chairman Kuntz be sent to the City Commission to &quot;request them to levy up to one mil for Library support in the event that the Board decides to spend most of the Library's funds for a building or a building site.&quot;</P>
<P>The City Commission declined.  Meanwhile half of Westphalia Township's penal fines were added to the support of the Library.</P>
<P>New library sites became available late in 1975.  These included the old Steel Hotel lot and Boron's Store.</P>
<P>A month or so later the old Clinton County News building on the south side of Walker was offered to the Library.  Editor Harold Schmaltz and the Staffords from Greenville gave the eager Board members a tour of the place.  Board members suggested asking contractors Norm Rademacher and Wayne Dush to look it over with an eye to remodeling the 75 year old building.  A State Library consultant said, however, that the building was inadequate and that any remodeling and repairs would be both extensive and costly.</P>
<P>The next June Mayor Roy Ebert and the City Commission allocated only $5,000 instead of the $10,000 that the Library Board had been promised.  If Federal Revenue Sharing Funds came through, though, the Board would receive the entire $10,000, they promised.  The City Commission was said to be ready to institute a special study committee to explore the Library's space problems, and the Board was hopeful.</P>
<P>In November, 1976 the grant request for the City's new Safety Building came through.  At one time the Board had hoped that a new library might be included along with the fire and police departments in this project.  Now they merely hoped for the old police office downstairs.  They received neither.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the City's 1977 Federal Revenue Sharing Fund money came through, and the Library received the additional $5,000 they had been promised.</P>
<P>Still the Library did not qualify for the full amount of State Aid because the penal fines were down.  They needed additional funding by June 30.  A State Library consultant advised the Board that the City Commission could not cut line items in the Library's budget.  The Bement Library would be placed on probation with the Central Michigan Library System until its money problems could be resolved.</P>
<P>Finally on June 22 Treasurer Eugene Simon told the Board that they would need an additional $4,000 to qualify for State Aid.  The Board needed to ask for another $5,000 from the City to make it look like the Library was receiving more local support.  &quot;This amount would be paid back in the form of Administrative fees and Maintenance,&quot; Librarian Jean Bartholomew explained to the Board.</P>
<P>Early in 1978 the old Ford garage became available.  The Board discussed it, and the matter was tabled.</P>
<P>In 1982 the Board lost $6,000 in State Aid because of a lack of local funding.  According to the minutes of the March meeting, &quot;the Board agreed that if the library [were] to continue functioning, there [would] have to be some support.&quot;</P>
<P>Letters were sent out to the Supervisors of Bengal, Dallas, Greenbush, Olive, Riley, and Westphalia Townships explaining the need for their share of the .3 mil of state equalized value.  The Board followed up the letters with personal visits to give the supervisors more detailed information.</P>
<P>Petitions were prepared for township residents to send to their local officials.  They read in part:</P>
<P>As a supporter and patron of the Bement Public Library, I want to express to you my support for the library, and to request that you contribute to the library the amount prescribed by the State of Michigan formula, and that you adopt this practice annually.</P>
<P>One float in the first annual St. Johns Mint Festival parade in 1986 featured a wagon full to overflowing with books.  The float, entitled &quot;The Great Library Chase&quot; also boasted a sign crying, &quot;Help!  We need room!&quot;  This parade entry was sponsored by a citizen's group called the &quot;St. Johns Area Library Project.&quot;</P>
<P>By 1987 when the question of a new library came up again, the Library Board was headed by Sheryl Plowman.  Other members included Barbara MacKinnon, Lynn Banninga, Tom Sullivan, and the Board's liaison with the City Commission, Robert Wood.</P>
<P> The St. Johns Area Library Project began trying to put together a plan.  It was suggested that perhaps other organizations might share space with the library in a new arts building.  </P>
<P>Rumors were flying that ground would soon be broken for a new post office.  Other sites the group was considering included the City Park complex, a building on north US-27 and the old bus depot on Railroad street.  The Library Board requested 10,000 square feet of usable space and 2,500 square feet of shared space.  </P>
<P>The new library to be built by the St. Johns Area Library Project would not belong to the City or the Bement Library, explained spokesman Joe Latoff.  The corporation would control all aspects of library operations including choosing the librarian and paying all bills and expenses in the new facility.</P>
<P>Library Board member Tom Sullivan was made the chairman of the Fund Raising committee.</P>
<P>Librarian Jean Bartholomew retired on July 8, 1988.  In parting she wrote:</P>
<P>I expect to live to a ripe old age, turn into an irascible, white-haired old lady with a lavender shawl and a cane carrying the banner for all kinds of causes.</P>
<P>There will be changes in the library.  The new person will be full of different, innovative ideas he or she will be anxious to implement. This is a mark of healthy progress.  An important aspect of any public service.</P>
<P>The board has the best interests of the library at heart and are trying hard to choose the ideal person for the position.</P>

<P>[Board] members have given unstintingly of their time and expertise for many years to keep this facility operating. This must be a labor of love because there is no pay and no glory.</P>
<P>Said Board trustee Lynn Banninga, &quot; You'll never replace Jean's personality.  [The Board] feels badly that she has worked so hard, unsuccessfully, for a new library.  It's just a shame that we weren't able to realize her goal before she retired.&quot; </P>
<P>In their search for the next Librarian the Board received responses from 20 applicants from Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and West Virginia.  In the end Board members were the most impressed with the qualifications of Mary Hutchins of Rockford, Illinois.  She assumed the position of Librarian on September 6, 1988.</P>
<P>&quot;We liked the ideas she had to go along with our ideas.  Together we feel we can make progress,&quot; explained Board Chairman Sheryl Plowman.</P>
<P>In January of 1991 the Bement Public Library was still squeezed into the limited space available to it in the Municipal Building, and the Library Board began mailing out post cards to library patrons inviting them to a &quot;Public Town Meeting.&quot;  The City Commission had indicated, the post card said, that the Library Board needed to show a groundswell of support for more funding for the Library.  </P>
<P>The town meeting was set for Monday January 21, 1991 at 7:30 p.m. at the Capitol Federal Savings Bank meeting room.  The bank was located on the site of the old Steel Hotel building, just one of the Library's many former potential building sites.</P>

<P> * One of the oldest structures still standing in Gaines, 
 and among the oldest railroad depots in Michigan, the Gaines 
 depot was built in 1884 by the Detroit, Grand Haven &amp; 
Milwaukee Railway, according the records of the Grand Trunk 
 Western Railroad. </P>
<P> * The railroad is the principal reason that Gaines became a <BR>
 community. In 1848 a line vas proposed by the Oakland &amp; <BR>
 Ottawa Rail Road Company from Pontiac via what was then 
named Fentonville to some point on the Lake Michigan shore. 
 The following year the Oakland &amp; Ottawa purchased the
 Detroit &amp; Pontiac and in 1855 formed the Detroit &amp; Milwaukee 
Railway. It was this company that constructed the line  through Gaines, probably reaching Gaines in the spring of  1856 and Owosso by July of that year. In 1856 the Detroit &amp;  Milwaukee completed its 189-mile line through Grand Rapids  to Grand Haven in 1858 where connections were made with  boats to Milwaukee. The Detroit &amp; Milwaukee became the  Detroit, Grand Haven &amp; Milwaukee Railway in 1878 and was  merged into the Grand Trunk Western in November 1928.  Today, the Grand Trunk Western is known as CN-North  America. Since the late 1850s the companies have largely  been controlled first by British and later Canadian  interests. </P>
<P> * The Gaines depot was constructed using an uncommon type  of yellow brick from Owosso, Michigan. This same brick can  also be seen at depots in Fenton and Holly on the line  toward Pontiac. </P>

<H1>Clinton County Courthouse</H1>
<IMG SRC="courth2.gif" HSPACE=1.5 ALIGN=right ALT="old courthouse">
<H2>A Brief Early History</H2>

<H4>  In the October, 1855 session of Clinton County's Board of
Supervisors, the question of moving the county seat from DeWitt
to St. Johns first arose. One supervisor favoring moving the county
seat to St. Johns. Another said they should &quot;strike out&quot;
St. Johns from the motion and insert &quot;center of Muskrat Lake.&quot;
No action was taken.</H4>

<H4> A year later the St. Johns supervisor, called for the move
to his community, providing residents there made a one-and-one-half
acre building site available. St. Johns residents raised $2,000
to help with the moving expenses.   In December, 1857, county
offices were moved from DeWitt to Plumstead Hall at the northeast
corner of Clinton Ave. and Walker Street in St. Johns.</H4>

<H4>In 1858 a 20 x 25 foot brick county building was erected on
the northwest corner of the public square. County offices were
housed there.  Courts met at Plumstead Hall until 1861.  Other
locations included George Stephenson's Clinton Hall on the east
side of Clinton Ave., Newton Hall on East Walker, and the Hicks
building on the west side of the second block of Clinton Ave.
</H4>

<H4>In January, 1869 supervisors discussed submitting a $25,000
building proposal to taxpayers. This was later approved, 1,734
to 1,170, A building committee composed of William L. Hicks, George
R. Hunt, Benjamin F. Shepherd, David Clark, Moses Bartow and John
Hicks was appointed and given authority to enter into contracts.
</H4>

<H4>In October, 1869 the committee adopted a plan similar to the
Bay City, Michigan courthouse designed by Oliver Hidden. Foundation
work contracts were awarded. The cornerstone laid in the fall
of 1869, and the foundation was completed the next month. Construction
came to a halt with supervisors rejecting all bids for the balance
of the work.  The committee believed that the low bidder had &quot;made
his estimate too low, and that in order to get through his job
and not lose money, he would be apt to slight his work . . . 
 Therefore, they wrote: Resolved that all bids for erection of
Court House be rejected, and that the Building Committee proceed
to procure materials for the erection of the same, and that Messers
[John] Hicks and Hunt of the of the committee are hereby authorized
to act for the committee in the purchase of the proper material.
</H4>

<H4>On March 15, 1871 the courthouse dome was struck by lightening,
tearing out the southeast corner completely and destroying all
of the glass.  Damage was estimated to be between $250 and $500.
</H4>

<H4>The Building Committee submitted a report to the Supervisors
on October 11, 1871.  In it Chairman John Hicks wrote:</H4>

<H4>The committee have exercised their best skill and judgment
to get the best of material and employ the best of workmen in
the construction of said building, and . . . think for the amount
expended the county will have the best building in the state.
</H4>

<H4>The Committee's final report was issued on January 8, 1872.
 &quot;The whole amount appropriated for building a Court House
was thirty-six thousand dollars as follows:</H4>

<TD><H4>$ 5,000</H4></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P><H4> Since then the building has been improved and modernized
through the years.  A $1,000 Seth Thomas clock in the tower rang
in the New Year in 1905.  In the spring of 1927 there was extensive
remodeling done to the interior including the addition of a fireproof
vault.</H4>

<H4>In August of 1957 a general renovation costing $20,000 took
place.  The entire exterior was sandblasted.   Other alterations
include a new entrance built in 1958 for $59,089.51; a west wing,
built in 1965 at cost of $165,765.56; and a matching east wing,
constructed for $246,000 in 1966. The latter included a civil
defense operating center in the basement, and part of that added
cost was matched by federal funds.</H4>

<H4>  Early in 1969 a supervisors room in the west wing was transformed
into a District Court and supervisors moved into the east wing
basement civil defense area.</H4>

<H4>Judges chambers had been added in 1958.  As a Centennial celebration
was being held in 1969, construction was being completed in the
Circuit Court, removing rows of rear seating to make way for conference
and office rooms.</H4>

<H4>The 65th Judicial District, 2nd Division, was established
January 1, 1969.  For a time the west wing was occupied by the
District Court, but  in 1974 it was moved to a separate building
on Whittemore Street. </H4>

<BR>
<H2>A brief history of Divine Mercy SFO Region
</H2><P><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="logo.gif"<P>
<H3>In the spring and summer of 1992 representatives from the 11 separate
Secular Franciscan Provinces in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan
began meeting with a representative of the National Fraternity
to start exploring the process of regionalization. In July of
that year a Steering Committee composed of Myrna Malabonga, S.F.O.;
Judith Vander Laan, S.F.O.; Agnes Urbiel, S.F.O.; Jean Martin,
S.F.O.; Marie Amore, S.F.O.; Cora Brodeur, S.F.O.; and Emile Alhaddad,
S.F.O. began meeting with the Authorized Representative, Gloria
Jean Staley, S.F.O.
</P>
<P>
By September, 1992 the group had received the approval of the
National Fraternity to enter the Developmental Phase of Regionalization.
At a Day of Deliberation and Discernment representatives from
the local fraternities chose the name Divine Mercy for their proposed
new region.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the lower Michigan Secular Franciscans, National
Minister Richard Morton, S.F.O. appointed the following people
to the Executive Council of the Emerging Region:  Gloria Jean
Staley, S.F.O. of Lincoln Park, Minister Pro-Tem; Judith Vander
Laan, S.F.O. of Grand Rapids, Vice Minister; Jean Martin, S.F.O.
of St. Johns, Secretary; Richard Schultz, S.F.O. of Troy, Treasurer;
Marie Amore, S.F.O. of Detroit, Formation Minister; and Cora Brodeur,
S.F.O. of Cheboygan; Alyce Smrek, S.F.O. of Lansing; and Agnes
Urbiel, S.F.O. of Detroit, Councilors.
</P>
<P>
In December, 1992 the new Executive Council held their first meeting
at St. Francis Retreat Center in DeWitt.  Plans were made for
three upcoming general meetings.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work was begun on the Mission Statement and Guidelines
in February, 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 1993 spring Unity Days were held.  Fraternities north of Lansing
met at St. Isidore Parish in Grand Rapids on April 24.  Fraternities
in the southern portion of the Emerging Region met at St. Michael
Parish in Southfield on May 15.  
</P>
<P>
The Guidelines were approved, and a name was chosen for the newsletter
at a meeting of the entire Regional Council for the Emerging Region
on June 26, 1993.
</P>
<P>
In August, 1993 members of the local fraternities met together
for a Day of Recollection at St. Francis Retreat Center in DeWitt.
 The speaker for the day was Fr. Lester Bach, OFM Cap.
</P>
<P>
The first edition of the Divine Mercy NEWSletter was published
in September of 1993.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, 1993 all of the fraternities in lower Michigan
and their brother and sister Secular Franciscans in Toledo, Ohio
were officially joined as the Divine Mercy Region. 
</P>
<P>
The first Regional Council, which still serves, was elected on
April 23, 1994.<BR>

a. At least five professed Secular Franciscans are needed to constitute
a reactivated fraternity.   
<BR>

request for reactivation must have been completed before the process
begins,  
<BR>
c. The level of Fraternity that is assisting the five in their
request shall confirm by letter that item b. has been carried
out. The same confirming fraternity shall include a letter of
Petition for Reactivation signed by the five. The letter of Petition

<h2>Chapter Nine</h2>
<h3>Active Members</h3>
40. An Active member is:
<BR>
a. A professed member who participates both by attending Fraternity
meetings and by providing financial support to the community

basis, but does provide financial support to the community.
<BR>
c. A professed member who neither attends meetings nor supports
the community but whom the Fraternity has dispensed (excused)
from such obligations.
<BR>
<h2>Chapter Ten</h2>
<h3>Dispensed (Excused) Members</h3>

Fraternity, these professed members have been granted a special
status for reasonable cause by the Fraternity Council with the
approval of the Spiritual Assistant.

whose income or resources are so meager that (s)he is unable to
contribute to the Common Fund may be dispensed from that obligation.

42. A dispensed (excused) member is just as much a member of the
Fraternity as is the person who does not need a dispensation from
any Secular Franciscan obligation.
<BR>
a. Therefore, the fraternity has an obligation to maintain contact
with its Dispensed Members and to visit and communicate with them.
<BR>
b. By the same token the Dispensed Member has an obligation to
keep in contact as far as possible with the Fraternity even though
(s)he is dispensed from one or more of the obligations of Secular
Franciscan life.

of their Fraternity, shall include all of their Active Members

of the traditional obligations of the Secular Franciscan Rule.

<BR>
<h2>Chapter Eleven</h2>

the Fraternity's membership rolls. Nor shall they be reported
as members of the National Fraternity.
<BR>
<h2>Chapter Twelve</h2>
<BR>
<h3>Fair Share Contribution</h3>
<BR>
46. The Fair Share refers to the amount of money which each Fraternity
contributes, to the Common Fund of the Region in order that the
Regional Fraternity may meet its operating expenses and make its
Fair Share Contribution to the National Fraternity.

each year is planned by the Regional Treasurer. A tentative budget
is then submitted to the Ministers of the local Fraternities at

may be amended or adjusted before it is voted on and approved
by the Regional Council  
<BR>
48. The money needed to meet the annual budget is raised by asking
the Fraternities of the Region to contribute some share toward

<h3>Corporate Profile</h3>

<blockquote>Entech Engineering was formed in 1980 by a group of experienced professional engineers.  Initial projects addressed the so-called energy "crisis" by assisting clients to analyze and take control of energy costs.   </blockquote>

<blockquote>
From that beginning, ENTECH (from ENergy TECHnology)  evolved over the past 16 years to become a fully integrated engineering/architectural firm of 68 individuals performing repeat business for dozens of clients, primarily in the eastern US.  Some clients have invited us to work with them in other regions of the US, such as the Midwest, Arizona and California.  </blockquote>

<blockquote>Our in-house full time staff includes the disciplines of electrical, mechanical, structural, civil, architectural and environmental.  The design teams are strengthened by 20 registered professionals, architects and engineers, who are supported by designers, drafters, marketing and  administrative personnel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Entech is widely recognized in the state of Pennsylvania for energy consulting, facilities design, water and waste water system design.  Our firm has worked with 30 colleges and universities, 15 municipalities along with several dozen industries and hospitals in the eastern US. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Each of the business units is managed by business unit directors who are responsible for marketing, client relations, design and project management within the unit.  Resources are freely used across units to best serve the client's need for a particular project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the area of TQM, Entech embarked on a total quality program in 1992 and to date has spawned over 30 teams, most comprised of a broad cross-section of company staff.  Teams investigate and recommend continuous improvement ideas in all areas - design, client relations, fee basis, CAD systems, marketing, benefits and human resources.</blockquote>

<a name="mission"></a>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<blockquote>Our mission is to provide consulting, engineering and other related professional services that meet or  exceeds our client's expectations.   This mission is based on a shared set of values  at Entech: client satisfaction, uncompromising ethical standards, teamwork, professional development, community involvement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We help clients achieve succesful projects by working closely with them in a partnering relationship from day one.  We help to define goals, schedule and budget the project and then communicate that to the various constituencies.  We can also bring financing sources to bear in combination with traditional engineering and architectural services, project management and startup assistance to achieve project goals and to stay within budget.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Entech's solid background in energy systems analysis and design is a part of everything we do, on all projects.  We know that 90% of the cost of a project comes in the long term operation and maintenance of the facility.  For that reason, we design systems that are sensitive to O&M costs as well as capital costs and aesthetics.  We look hard at life-cycle costs and work to minimize those costs through prudent design combined with energy saving materials for the structure as well as the systems.</blockquote>

<H4>RAWA Continues to Improve City's Water System..</H4>

<H4>Entech is in the midst of three major design efforts for the Reading Area Water Authority (RAWA).</H4><P>

These projects include the replacement of two severely deteriorated 16" water mains which hang from the Penn Street and Bingaman Street Bridges and span the Schuylkill River in the city of Reading, and the structural rehabilitation of RAWA's twin 13-million-gallon Northwest Reservoirs.  Both Entech and RAWA have placed these projects on a "fast track" due to the extent of structure deterioration which was discovered during a feasibility study that Entech performed last spring.<P>

The water main replacement projects are almost identical in that they both require the installation of a new, 18" ductile iron water main which will run parallel to the existing deteriorated and structurally unsound 16" wrought-iron water mains, and the installation of new structural support/pipe hanger systems.  Once the new mains are installed across the bridges, tie-ins/hot taps will be made on either side of the bridge to activate the new main.  With the new mains active, the old mains will then be cut out in sections and removed in order to reduce the amount of weight hanging from the bridge structures.  Entech is closely coordinating the water main replacement work, in particular, the structural support/pipe hanger system design, with PennDOT Bridge Unit officials to ensure a structurally adequate support system is obtained without jeopardizing the structural integrity of both PennDOT bridges.<P>

With respect to the Bingaman Street Bridge, Entech is also in the process of coordinating a possible joint venture between RAWA and the local gas company (UGI) as UGI has a 6" gas main on the same bridge which is also in need of replacement. Because both utilities (RAWA and UGI) need to replace their structures/mains in the immediate future and since the gas main is within a very close proximity of the water main, Entech believes it makes sense for both utilities to work together on this particular project as a sharing of the costs (if both projects are done simultaneously), will significantly reduce the cost to each party.<P>

With respect to the Northwest Reservoir project, Entech is designing the removal and replacement of unsound, severely deteriorated and/or missing sections of concrete on the roof systems of the 13 MG tanks.  The tanks have literally taken a beating over the last few winters and are in need of structural rehabilitation in order to maintain the structural integrity of the tanks and to avoid the major capital cost associated with replacement.<P>

Entech's goal is to have its design effort complete and have the projects submitted to the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) for funding assistance by January 1997.  The combined construction cost of these projects is estimated to be $1.5 million.<P>

Junior Achievement held its annual fund raiser at Berks Bowling Lanes on Sunday, November 10.  Brent Estock, civil designer, assisted with the coordination of the event and also volunteered to design signs which were placed throughout the bowling alley.  Brent acted as Entech's chairperson, recruiting other employees' participation.<P>

Bright and early Sunday morning two Entech teams reported to the bowling alley and attempted to roll a respectable score. Team members consisted of the Lloyd family: Matt and Sandi  and their four children; Sue DeHaven; Danette and Erik Ernst; and the Estock family, Brent with children, Heather and Wesley.<P>

Junior Achievement raised $23,000, of which over $400 was raised by the Entech team by  soliciting pledges from their family and friends for this worthwhile association.  <P>

The teams are looking forward to participating in next year's event even though Brent's young son Wesley showed greater bowling prowess than most of the adults. However, a suggestion was made from one who prefers to remain anonymous that next year young Wesley remain at home. <P>

Every year the United Way starts off its campaign with a "Day of Caring."  This is an opportunity for volunteers to see the programs that United Way funds, and the results that are achieved by this funding.  This day also allows the volunteers to get a first-hand perspective of the need that exists in our community and can voice that need to fellow employees in order to increase contributions.  Due to the generous contributions collected last year, the United Way has added six new agencies to their list this year while continuing to support its other agencies.  The financial support that is donated by Berks County residents to United Way is used locally to help Berks and other outlining counties.<P>

This year I was given the opportunity to participate in the "Day of Caring."  I spent my morning playing soccer with the children at KidsPeace, which is an alternative school for children between six years of age to nineteen years of age.  A full-time psychiatric nurse is on duty to help children cope with their feelings by one-on-one counseling, group therapy and home treatment.  The home treatment program allows the school to develop a close relationship with the family in order to pull all available resources together to help the child achieve goals.  The children earn rewards for achieving these goals in order to promote good behavior and to increase the desire for continued learning.  This school is not for permanent placement, but a structured environment, with individually developed programs that teach the student and their family the necessary tools to function as a family and achieve remarkable results...together.<P>

After spending a morning interacting with some of these children, it was comforting to know that money donated to United Way has a substantial impact on our community and helps our children learn to excel in all aspects of life...the way it should be...the United Way.<P>

	<STRONG>PROGRESS THROUGH EFFICIENCY</STRONG><P>

	The progress of civilization is created in part by humanity's ability to increase efficiency and overcome the problems of nature.  These increases are actually the sum effect of millions of small steps taken by individuals and organizations through learning, experimenting, risking and working.  The number of items for improvement is almost limitless.<P>

	At the leading edge of this progress have always been men and women of science, and  in one form or another, the engineers of their day.  We are proud to be in the company of such great people and we carry with great passion that mission with us today.<P>

	As you know, Entech has been one of the leaders of increased energy efficiency for clients, both large and small.<P>

	One area of our work that gets little attention is cost savings through client manpower reductions.  With each of our projects the aim is to do "more with less" by using proven technology and common sense.<P>

	As a simple example, consider the lowly exit light.  Old-style exit lights burned out several times a year, which required new bulbs and someone to make the change. This amounted to two hours of someone's time per exit light. Today with new LED technology, lights never need to be changed, and even better are the significant energy savings.  For a facility with many exit signs, efficiency gains are substantial.<P>

	Another example of reducing manpower costs is in central boiler plant operations.  Normally, there are several operators needed to cover round-the-clock operations.  When Shippensburg University approved Entech's summer shutdown strategy, six operators were then available to assist in other campus maintenance projects in the non-heating season, creating a huge cost savings.<P>

	Taking cost savings even further, Entech has found that by automating boiler plants, converting to newer boilers, or contracting for outside services (on call), college campuses, hospitals, military bases, government facilities, etc. can realize large annual cost savings, normally hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Knowing that Entech's efforts have contributed to the reduction of our clients energy costs, totaling millions of dollars per year, is a satisfying feeling that spurs us on to do even more.<P>

	It has been estimated that the present value of one operation or maintenance worker is approximately $1 million over 20-30 years.  While efficiency improvements do dislocate workers, our experience has been that the workers are retrained and actually advance in their careers.  This becomes a true win-win situation for all involved.<P>

	I would be remiss not to mention the great efficiency gains by new central chiller equipment.  There are thousands of older units operating in the 0.8 kw/ton range, which also face serious chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emission legal compliance issues.  By using new variable frequency controlled equipment and centralized plant operations, clients commonly see overall efficiencies fall below 0.5 kw/ton and savings as high as 50%.<P>

	The greatest enemy of progress is inaction. The energy industry generally agrees that, despite many years of improvement, 80% of energy efficiency opportunities remain to be accomplished even with today's technology.  We at Entech are looking forward to a bright, efficient, and progressive future.

<H4><EM>ENTECH wants you to know..........DEREGULATION NOW LAW</EM></H4><P>

On December 3, 1996, Governor Tom Ridge signed into law the bill to give every Pennsylvanian the ability to choose their electrical company by the year 2001.  Ridge stated the measure will help to make the Commonwealth a more attractive place to live and work by lowering electric bills and introducing competition into the electric utility market for the first time in Pennsylvania history.<P>

Key provisions of the new law are as follows:<P>

<UL><LI>The obligation to provide customers with transmission and distribution service will continue.</UL>

<UL><LI>Programs to assist low-income families will continue.</UL>

<UL><LI>The transmission and distribution system will be required to meet established national industry standards for installation, maintenance and safety.</UL>

<UL><LI>Rates will be capped for all generation, transmission and distribution charges for at least 4-1/2 years and as long as 9 years.</UL>

 <UL><LI>Utilities can recover their transition and stranded costs by issuing transition bonds.</UL>

<UL><LI>Retail choice will be phased in as follow: 33% of all customer load on 1/1/99, an additional 33% of all customer load on 1/1/00 and 100% of all customer load by 1/1/01.</UL>

<UL><LI>The PUC can order electric utilities to conduct pilot programs beginning 4/1/97.  5% of the utility's peak load will be committed to the pilot program.</UL>

<UL><LI>All generation suppliers must be licensed by the PUC and ensure financial responsibility.</UL>

Entech will continue to maintain its leadership role on the impact of electric utility rate structures and cost reduction strategies.  We will gladly assist those electric customers who wish to evaluate the impact of deregulation on their organizations.  It is our opinion that this piece of legislation  will influence energy costs more than any other legislation in the entire decade.<P>

<H4>Projects We Are Working On Now</H4>

<H3>THE MARKETPLACE</H3>
<H4>12/96</H4>

<STRONG>MUNICIPAL</STRONG><P>

Entech is currently providing the Municipal Authority of the Borough of Shenandoah (MABS) with construction management, engineering support and project closeout services related to their newly constructed 3.2 MGD water filtration plant.  The plant is part of a $6 million improvement/construction project funded by the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) which provides low interest funding and grant money for water and sewer system improvements.  This current PENNVEST project is one of many PENNVEST projects with which Entech has been involved.<P>

Additionally, Entech is providing MABS with the engineering services required for the inspection and preparation of annual dam inspection reports for Raven Run Dams #2 and #3  and Ringtown Dams #5 and #6.<P>
	 
<STRONG>GOVERNMENTAL</STRONG><P>

Entech was assigned its 150th project from the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA).  PIDA provides low-interest financing to encourage companies to move to, or expand their facilities in, Pennsylvania.  Entech has performed engineering services in the amount of $400,000 to date, with an additional $142,000 of active PIDA project work in-house.  Construction costs total approximately $100 million for the acquisition, renovation and new construction of 5 million square feet of industrial space.<P>

Entech continues its efforts to reduce the energy budget of the US Army. We recently began our ninth commission to analyze, consider,  and document opportunities for government installations to either reduce energy consumption or reduce the cost of their energy. Our history of finding large savings meeting the governments strict criteria has lead to the award of this additional work. The focus of this latest effort is the Edgewood Area of the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Edgewood is an Army research facility which consumes large quantities of electricity. Entech's mission is to find opportunities to save electrical costs, while maintaining the integrity of the Post's extensive safety systems.  As with most assignments at APG,  this one promises to be both challenging and exciting.  <P>

Entech's contract with the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources continues with the addition of office space to an existing office at the Shikellamy State Park.  Shikellamy is located at the southernmost tip of an island where the west branch of the Susquehanna joins the Susquehanna River.  Included in this project is the extension of mechanical and electrical systems to accommodate the heating, air conditioning, and lighting of a conference area, manager office, and entry vestibule.  The design allows for after-hour entry of groups who will use the conference room for community meetings.<P>

<STRONG>INDUSTRIAL</STRONG><P>

Corning, Incorporated of Corning, New York manufactures glass and ceramic products for a variety of markets.  Recently, Entech assisted Corning with the design development of a new Class 10 cleanroom at their Sullivan Park R&D Center near Corning.  Entech served as a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling consultant to Corning, studying the relationships of flow and temperature within the cleanroom during operation.  Study of process equipment geometries and the associated room heat gain sources were critical for controlling the environment.  Recommendations were made that included modifications to the raised flooring.  Investigations of local exhaust effects, etc. were also performed.<P>

Elf Atochem North America, Ltd., in Birdsboro, Pennsylvania manufactures polymer materials.  Recently, Entech assisted Atochem with reviewing a number of areas for process improvement.  Projects included an evaluation of a process cooling water system for their downstream pumps and heat exchanger packages which control the temperature of their process melters and reactors.  Subsequent findings and design changes are presently being implemented which include: new, larger pumps; side-stream filtration; balancing of flows to 34 pieces of process equipment; and additional instrumentation monitoring for improving operator control.<P>

Entech also performed a study of potential replacement fluids for their process heating medium, Dowtherm A.  Each fluid was evaluated for: heat transfer performance; system requirements such as pressure, temperature, etc.; environmental issues; health and safety; and life cycle costing.  A comparative study was presented that concluded with a recommendation to continue with Dowtherm A, while minimizing the problems associated with this fluid.<P>

<STRONG>UTILITY</STRONG><P>

Entech is pleased to be involved with recent changes at GPU Energy, including the "tenant fit-out" of space at the Berks Corporate Center which will accommodate the FMIS Group.  This work involved the relocation of lighting and ceiling diffusers and the layout of workstations and computer equipment to meet the needs of the tenant.  Unique to this project was the extremely short schedule which necessitated a "design-build" approach to the project.  Working with GPU Energy contractors, construction began only a short period after the contract was awarded to Entech.<P>

<P><B>1500 Market Street; Philadelphia, PA - Renovations</B> Centre Square is a 2.1 million square foot office building located directly across from City Hall in center city Philadelphia.  The facility includes two office towers, one of approximately 1,000,000 square feet and another of approximately 650,000 square feet which are joined by a six level (3 subterranean) combination atrium/parking garage.  Placed in operation in 1974, Centre Square remains as the largest office complex in the City and is the largest cast-in-place concrete structure in the State.  With the construction of new Class A office buildings nearby, the Centre Square owners, in 1986, embarked on a major renovation program exceeding $80 million intended to maintain the pre-eminent position in the commercial market place.  A summary of projects with which Entech was involved is as follows:

<P>	1)	<EM>Parking Garage Design/Repairs - Completed: 1990</EM>

		This project included significant reconstructive structural repairs and waterproofing to a cast-in-place concrete parking garage providing parking for 450 vehicles.  Storm drainage systems were repaired and/or modified as required.  Entech considered several types of lighting fixtures and lamps for this garage which is totally underground and receives no natural light.  The entire	garage was completely renovated and new lighting, wiring and distribution system were installed.

<P>	2)	<EM>Plaza-Lobby Renovations - Completed: 1991</EM>
	
		This project was the cornerstone of the capital program since it was the most publicly visible of the many projects undertaken.  The project was broken into two broad categories of exterior (plaza) and interior (lobby) work which was scheduled into a total of thirty work phases.

		<P>The exterior phases included demolition to the extensive public plaza, sidewalks, curbs and window wall systems at street level which permitted the replacement of a complex subterranean waterproofing system.  This waterproofing system serves as the "roof" for the underground pedestrian concourse which connects Centre Square to the areas' mass transit facilities. 
 
		<P>The interior phases of the project included significant modifications to the Galleria which is a central atrium, 80 feet in height, and capped by a combination cast-in-place concrete and aluminum/glass skylight.  The Galleria is ringed by walks on all levels which provide overlooks to a new interior fountain which rises approximately 75 feet from the base of the Galleria and provides the visual focus for the project.

		<P>Entech's services included modification to existing or new fire protection, HVAC and electrical systems for each retail area, replacements and enhancements of all interior and exterior lighting systems; establishment of a new command/control center for the relocated fire alarm system, elevator control system and a new security monitoring and access system for the entire complex; design of atrium smoke exhaust system to meet present fire codes.  The glass skylight presented unique challenges to provide beam type smoke detection and supply and exhaust systems at other locations.  This system is initiated by activating any of several infrared beam detectors.

		<P>Several retail spaces at street level were restaurants which incorporated kitchen exhaust systems discharging into areas directly outside the atrium (some were not ducted to the outside at all) and entering the atrium.  Entech designed a system of kitchen exhaust ductwork common to all existing (and potential) restaurant tenants.  The nature of existing conditions required that Entech work with the City of Philadelphia Department of Licensing and Inspections to successfully obtain proper variances for this work.

	
<P>	3.	<EM>East and West Tower Renovations - Completed:  1990/91</EM>

		This project was undertaken to provide upgrades to the office towers.  Work completed under this contract for which Entech had some level of responsibility included:  conversion of the east tower's core HVAC system from constant volume to a variable air volume (VAV) system.  Central fans were modified, variable frequency drives were installed, modifications to the electrical system were completed.  Distribution ductwork modified, tested, insulated.

<P>	4.	<EM>Elevator System Upgrades and Modifications - Completed:  1990</EM>

		Centre Square possesses thirty-seven (37) high speed passenger elevators and six (6) general purpose or freight elevators.  Although the elevators had been well maintained, no significant upgrades had been made to either the aesthetics or operational aspects of the system.  Entech's responsibility included control consolidation and relocation of major components to the new security command/control center.

<P>	5.	<EM>Tenant Improvement Projects - Completed:  1990/93</EM>

		Throughout the duration of the landlord's capital program, a concerted effort was made to retain existing and encourage new tenancy.  Typically, the following projects were constructed in "raw" space devoid of any improvements beyond the base building systems.

<P><B>1515 Market; Philadelphia, PA - Law Office Tenant Renovations</B> Modifications to 18th floor of 1515 Market Street, Philadelphia, to accommodate architectural upgrade for law offices.  Mechanical and electrical design to extend existing building systems into the space for lighting, plumbing, fire protection, and air conditioning systems for new office, computer room and lunch room spaces.

<P><B>1600 Market; Philadelphia, PA - Rest Room Upgrade Program</B> Entech provided mechanical/electrical plans and specifications for upgrading existing rest room facilities to meet new ADA handicap requirements.  While the project generally encompassed replacement and relocation of plumbing fixtures, and handicap fire alarm devices, the new configuration required modifications to sprinkler, ductwork and lighting systems.

<P><B>2000 Market Street; Philadelphia, PA - Renovations</B> 2000 Market Street is a 650,000 square foot office building located on the western edge of Philadelphia's central business district.  As a result of several major lease terminations occurring simultaneously and general pressure of the market place, the owners of 2000 Market committed to a program of capital improvements to accommodate a major tenant.  Prior to and in conjunction with the tenant improvement work, significant improvements were required to be completed by the landlord on the base building systems.  Entech involvement included consulting services for both base building and several tenant mechanical/electrical systems.

<P><B>1500 Walnut Street; Philadelphia, PA - Renovations</B> Consideration was given to ice storage for this Philadelphia building.  Ongoing consulting services include fire protection, HVAC, plumbing and electrical.  Entech provided plans and specifications for a new upscale restaurant tenant as well as a fire pump for the building.

<P><B>Administrative Headquarters for the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania; Philadelphia, PA</B> Entech provided renovations and upgrades to the mechanical and electrical systems for this historic structure in the Society Hill section of Philadelphia.  Formerly occupied by the Mutual Assurance Company, the facility was located in two of the finest American houses in Society Hill, located at 240 South Fourth Street and dating back to 1784.

<P>While extreme care was taken to preserve the original appearance of many of the features, a chilled water central air conditioning system and new electrical service were added.  Improvements were also made to the lighting and plumbing fixtures.  Entech provided plans and specifications detailing the building system additions and modifications.

<P><B>The Berks County Services Center; Reading, PA - Tenant Fit-out</B> Working with a local architectural firm, Entech provided plans and technical specifications for contractor bidding of the mechanical and electrical work for tenant fit-out.  With a typical floor plate of 17,000 square feet, each of the 5th, 9th and 15th floors of this new 16 story office building was upgraded to accommodate several agencies including the District Attorney, Children's Services, Mental Health Services and Employment Training.  Mechanical work included plumbing for new restrooms, coffee stations and lunch areas.  The fire protection system was modified and extended to accommodate new office arrangements.  Ductwork was extended from the base building system with a series of main and branch ductwork schemes which formed a zoned VAV air conditioning system.

<P>Of particular interest is a state-of-the-art Building Automation System (BAS) and the lighting control system.  New supporting equipment was added to effectively connect the HVAC, smoke exhaust, fire alarm and security controls to the BAS backbone framework.  The low voltage, 2 wire lighting control system was similarly upgraded to provide a series of daylight compensating photo electric cells and motion controls which provides all lighting control functions and enhances future relocation of lighting fixtures and controls.

<P><B>Foxcroft Square Pavilion Office Tower; Jenkintown, PA</B> Analysis of building HVAC and electrical systems to determine cost of utilities for the common areas.  Using the Elite Software DDE-2.1D which incorporates historical weather data for local geographical areas, we calculated energy use and generated a model of monthly utility bills specifically for the common areas.

<P><B>Meridian Bank - Headquarters Building; Reading, PA</B> The first step in the design and building of this new headquarter facility was to provided an integrated computer analysis of total building energy use which, from a baseline model reference point, compared energy, construction and life cycle costs for a variety of construction options including heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems, windows, wall and roof insulation, lighting and peak shaving.  This report served to enhance the decision making process as it affected various construction alternatives.

<P>Entech was then assigned the responsibility of providing the electrical and mechanical commercial design of a 140,000 square foot four-story building in the center of downtown Reading to be entirely leased by this banking community.  Entech interfaced the M/E engineering  (HVAC, plumbing, fire protection, electrical) with the owner, architect, and tenant A/E team and a variety of project consultants.

<P><B>PNB Building; Philadelphia, PA - Law Office Renovations</B> Modifications to various floors on an ongoing basis for upgrading to include law library, print shop, and office spaces.  Entech plumbing, fire protection, HVAC and electrical design accommodated a variety of tenant conditions in this existing building which is approximately 70 years old.

<P><B>Rittenhouse Regency; Philadelphia, PA - Tenant Improvements</B> This project included analysis and conceptual design improvements for tenant space of a single tenant occupying 5 floors of space.  In working for the tenant, Entech provided recommendations and cost estimates for improvements to the plumbing, fire protection, air conditioning and electrical system.  Our recommendations, while never implemented, served as a basis for lease negotiations with the landlord.

<P><B>The Robinson Building; Philadelphia, PA - Renovations</B> Entech provided mechanical and electrical design and consulting for renovating several floors of tenant space for this building at South 16th Street, Philadelphia as well as recommendations for upgrading base building air conditioning systems.  Tri water fire protection combining the water source heat pump with the sprinkler system was evaluated.

<blockquote><h2>Electric Utility Industry - Deregulation</h2></blockquote><p>

Entech Engineering is presently advising clients on issues related to the deregulation of the electric utility industry.  While all the answers are not yet available, it is important for large and medium size users of electrical power to investigate and plan for the future.  Our background in energy analysis and familiarity with the electric utility industry from an engineering and economic analysis point of view is available to you for your planning.  Please email <a href="mailto:SKarabin@entecheng.novell.net">Steve Karabin</a> for more information.  Or call him at 610-373-6667.

<p><b>Pennsylvania plugged into
electric competition</b>

<p>	Pennsylvania became only the fourth state in the country to plug into electric
competition when a bill that opens the electric industry to competition was passed by the
Senate 40-10 and by the House 171-28, and was signed into law by Governor Tom Ridge.

<p>	The measure will allow all Pennsylvania consumers the opportunity to shop around
for the best deal in electricity by the year 2001.  A pilot program allowing for competition
will begin in 1997.  Starting in 1999, one third of Pennsylvania electric consumers will be
phased into this new competitive arena each year through the year 2001.

<p>	Rates for generation, transmission and distribution of electric will be capped for at
least four years and maybe as long as nine years.  It is expected that electric rates may
decrease because the competitive arena will likely make each electric company find ways
to increase efficiency.

<p>	The Board of Directors of the Berks County Chamber of Commerce unanimously
approved of this legislation at its November meeting.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><br>

<p><b>Framework for Competition</b>

<p>	The new Pennsylvania law opening the electricity industry to competition provides a
framework for utilities, power providers and customers to implement it.  Hers's how it will  work.

<p>		Under the new law, customers--from the smallest homeowner to the largest
factory-- will get to shop for their electricity source, the generator.  Customers will be able
to buy from anybody selling electricity, whether an actual generator or a middleman
marketer.  Competition in the market will set the prices, subject to a temporary price cap.

<p>		That electricity, however, still will be delivered by the local utility, since nobody
wants a dozen companies' wires running down the street.  That separate delivery charge,
since it will continue under monopoly, will continue to need approval by the state Public
Utility Commission.

<p>		A third of a given utility's customers--a portion each of the residential,
commercial and industrial accounts--must have the shopping option by January 1, 1999;
another third by January 1, 2000; and the final third by January 1, 2001.

<p>		Total electricity rates are capped temporarily as of January 1, 1997.  The
generating portion is capped until 2001, when all customers have the shopping option. 
The delivery portion will be determined by the PUC.

<p>		Electricity bills will be split into several parts early on to show the cost of each,
particularly three: generation, delivery and a new competitive transition charge.  No matter
what those portions are, they may not add up to more than the current rate and possibly
will be less.

<p>	The transition charge is aimed at helping utilities pay off the expensive plants they
were required to build under the old regulated system, when they had to have capacity for
everybody in their territory running at full power, as well as a hefty reserve.  The law gives
the transition charge a nine-year lifetime, beginning January 1, 1997, although the PUC
can lengthen it or shorten it a bit.

<p>		Although not fully decided, another charge may be broken out on the bill, and
may actually rise rates slightly.  That is the cost of paying off the so-called non-utility
generators--private companies whose power the utilities have been legally required to buy,
most often at above-markets rates.

		<P><STRONG>Tobyhanna Army Depot</STRONG> requested <STRONG>Entech</STRONG> to conduct two consecutive comprehensive studies at the Depot. <EM> First,</EM> evaluate the existing high pressure steam distribution system.<EM> Second</EM>, study the coal-fired steam generation systems to determine options for the most economical way of extending the Depot's operations.<P>  After receiving the top performance award from the Army in 1994, Tobyhanna is looking for more ways to improve their quality for the next 20 years. 

<P>The systems have been in operation since 1952 when the Depot was first constructed and are no longer capable of supporting the Army's electronics missions with reliability.  <STRONG>Entech </STRONG> used a value engineering approach to the problem while considering the merits of various alternatives.  The prime finding was that the decentralization of steam production, coupled with alternative methods of generating heat, would allow the Army to maintain operational readiness while reducing the taxpayers expense in operating costs. <P> 

Upon completion of the studies, the Depot asked <STRONG>Entech</STRONG> to produce designs to replace the coal boiler and prepare bid documents in less than four months.  The <STRONG>Entech</STRONG> team responded and did the job on this tight time schedule.  <P>

Under the direction of <A HREF="mailto:DHaldeman@entecheng.novell.net">Dwight Haldeman</A>, the <STRONG>Entech </STRONG>team designed the estimated $14 million decentralization of the steam system which included six major boiler rooms, with a combination of 18 boilers ranging in size from 100 Hp to 600 Hp.<P>  

In addition, air rotation units were incorporated into six buildings, each 200 ft by 1200 ft.  The combination of units will be capable of circulating 3,120,000 cubic feet of air per minute; the rough equivalent of completely changing the air in the Astrodome every 15 minutes. 

<P>The design included opportunities to select from several potential fuel sources; natural gas, propane or oil. Each system is configured to maintain a 30 day strategic reserve capacity.  <STRONG>Entech's</STRONG> involvement produced quality improvements in readiness, reliability and operating costs.

		<P><STRONG>Entech </STRONG>performed a number of designs for the Letterkenny  Army Depot over the last several years.  These included upgrades to electrical and fire protection systems covering 120,000 sq ft area in two buildings; improvements to the fire protection systems in two additional buildings, and a high speed fire alarm system.

<P> At the wastewater treatment plant, <STRONG>Entech</STRONG> designed repairs to sludge handling equipment .  At the water treatment plant, we replaced flocculators, mixers and sediment tank flow meters.

<P>Under the government's EEAP (Energy Efficiency Analyses Program), <STRONG>Entech </STRONG>completed a comprehensive lighting study at the Letterkenny Depot.  The study covered more than 70 buildings, totalling over 1.8 million sq. ft.   Field data including utility bills were collected and analyzed using <STRONG>Entech's</STRONG> extensive library of utility rate analysis programs. The   incremental demand and usage charges were identified and presented to the Army to form the basis of a post- wide energy management strategy.

		<P><STRONG>Aberdeen </STRONG>.. peak electrical demand reduction study being completed in the second quarter of 1996.  Studies included testing electrical power feeders experiencing the greatest peak demand.  Computations for payback criteria include constructions costs and energy savings to be expected for modifications to reduce the demand load at the Proving Grounds.

<P> At <STRONG>Fort Dietrick</STRONG> Entech performed a study of the central boiler plant and steam distribution system and associated auxiliary equipment, funded by the EEAP.  The central plant includes over 400,000 lbs/hr of boiler capacity, and impacted over 100+ buildings totalling1,700,000 SF of space.

<P>At <STRONG>Ft. Meade </STRONG>Entech conducted a feasibility study of the facilities energy management system which covered 83 buildings, totalling 1,900,000 sq ft.   If the recommended modifications are implemented, significant savings will accrue from more precise control of the existing heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment. 

<P>At <STRONG>Ft. Monmouth</STRONG> Entech is conducting a study of Building 2700, a 700,000 sq ft multi-use facility.  This study will concentrate on Energy Conservation Opportunities for the central steam plant; steam distribution system; condensate return system; chilled water system; fuel supply; and environmental equipment.

<P>At <STRONG>Picatinny Arsenal</STRONG> Entech is analyzing the service water system to determine water and energy conservation opportunites throughout the entire water system.  The system includes 35 miles of water mains ranging in diameter from 2 to 12 inches. and is being supplied by two lakes within the confines of the Arsenal.  Entech is also developing a hydraulic model which will identify areas for improvement within the system.<P>

<P><STRONG>The Boroughs of Collegeville and Trappe, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania</STRONG>, have experienced significant growth in the past two decades, brought about by the expanding highway systems and development of the industrial park concept, which tends to move high-tech offices from the cities into the countryside.  The communities now have a combined population of about 8,000 persons, plus a significant student population at Ursinus College.

<P>Over time, water lines which were once adequate became undersized, materials of construction changed, new wells were developed changing the hydraulic characteristics of the flows in the pipes, and storage capacity became inadequate.

<P><B>Hydraulic Model:</B> Sensing a need to better manage their water system, the Collegeville-Trappe Joint Public Works Department contracted Entech to prepare a computer model for their water distribution and storage system.  The model will be used to evaluate the performance and capacity of the distribution system, identify deficiencies due to pipe tuberculation, undersized pipes, and dead end lines.  A model can also predict the impact of future development and identify system needs before construction of water line extensions.

	<P>Entech evaluated several computer models available and selected Cybernet Version 2, by Haestaad Methods, which uses AutoCAD in the development of its database. In this manner, the computer model is directly compatible with Entech's drawings which are needed for system improvements.

	<P>The Honesdale Consolidated Water Company (HCWC) is a private water company that serves the Borough of Honesdale, Wayne County, Pennsylvania.  The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) issued a Consent Order which required HCWC to filter the surface supply, or develop a groundwater supply and abandon the surface source.  In addition, all finished water storage must be covered.  Major components of this $4.1 million project include:

	<P><B>Feasibility Study:</B> A feasibility study was completed to determine present and future water demands by the year 2010.  With respect to water supply, three supply alternatives were studied: 1) adding filtration to the existing surface supply; 2) changing to an all groundwater source of supply; 3) combining the filtered surface water and groundwater supply

	The study indicated that the most cost-effective solution from both a capital cost and O&M cost would be the development of an all groundwater source of supply and the abandonment of the existing unfiltered surface supply.

	<P><B>Groundwater Testing: </B>Based on the recommendations of the study, HCWC proceeded with the drilling of test wells and pumping tests to determine if a sufficient groundwater supply could be developed to meet the water supply requirements of the system. The results of the drilling and testing program indicated there is a total safe-yield of 1.96 MGD available from two existing and four new wells.

	<P><B>Hydraulic Model:</B> Simulation was performed of the 1.0 MGD system, with 78 miles of 4" to 12" water mains, three pressure zones, six wells and four water tanks/reservoirs ranging in size from 220,000 to 450,000 gallons.

	<P><B>SCADA:</B> The system will be controlled and monitored by a 100 point SCADA system to be located at the water company.  Parameters such as well level, well flow, reservoir level, pump status, and operational alarms will be measured in the field and transmitted via radio to the water company office.  Under normal conditions, the SCADA system will operate well pumps and provide alarm annunciation to ensure a reliable system at all times.  If desired, the SCADA system can be overridden and the system operated manually.  

	<P><B>Financial Assistance:</B> Entech provided HCWC with financial assistance and guidance to apply for both private financing and PENNVEST financing.  An application and supporting documentation was prepared and submitted to PENNVEST as well as documentation for private financing.

	<P><B>Permitting:</B> Regulatory permits were prepared and submitted to: PA DEP, PennDOT, DRBC, and Soil Conservation.

	<P><B>System Improvements: </B> 
		 	
	<LI>development of four production wells and renovation of two existing wells
<LI>well pump stations and treatment facilities
<LI>four water storage tanks totaling 1.2 million gallons ranging from 220,000 gallons to 450,000 gallons
<LI>17,000 feet of 6, 8, and 12 inch distribution and transmission mains
<LI>three pressure reducing stations and two air release stations
<LI>SCADA control system

	<P>Entech Engineering, Inc. was contracted by the City of Reading to undertake a $26 million renovation of the city's antiquated water system.  A total of 72 separate projects was completed.  Major elements of the renovation project include:

	<P><B>18th Ward #4 Tank Replacement:</B>  Entech provided all engineering, design, and construction monitoring for this $1.5 million finished water storage tank.  The new 2.3 million gallon tank was constructed adjacent to the Authority's old, 1930 era, riveted steel, lead painted storage tank, which was dismantled as part of the project.

	<P>Entech conducted a detailed evaluation of steel vs. concrete tank type using a life-cycle cost analysis which took into account first costs and ongoing/future maintenance expenditures.  Plans and specifications were then prepared for construction of a 77 ft. diameter, 66 ft. high post-tensioned concrete tank.  Also included in the project was the  addition of an altitude valve, associated by-pass piping, isolation valves, and instrumentation, all contained in an underground vault.

	<P><B>Filter Plant Renovations: </B> Provided mechanical, civil, structural, electrical and architectural engineering design and construction inspection services for over $8.0 million worth of construction projects at the Maiden Creek Filter Plant.

	<P><B>Projects included:</B> 1) concrete and structural repairs for the coagulation channels, settling basins, and raw water conduits; 2) replacement of existing substation and distribution system; 3) electrical system upgrades to the entire building including indoor and outdoor lighting; 4) chlorine injection modifications and aqua ammonia feed system and bulk storage; 5) new carbon feed system; 6) replacement of dehumidification equipment; 7) boiler burner replacement; 8) new filter and backwash control system including motorized valves and electronic filter controls; 9) new traveling water screen and bulkhead replacement; 10) replacement of sand filter media; 11) new fiberglass reinforced sluice gates; 12) hydroelectric unit design and start-up/testing.

	<P><B>Chlorine/Ammonia Building Modifications:</B> Prepared plans and specifications for the installation of a multi one-ton cylinder chlorine system complete with two new scales (2 one-ton cylinders per scale), an evaporator for implementation of liquid and/or gas chlorination, a 6,000 gallon aqua ammonia tank and two new metering pumps.  Building renovations were designed to correct the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's code violations pertaining to the separation of feed/storage and adequate ventilation with chlorine sensors for personnel safety.

	<P><B>Bulk Lime Silo System:</B>  Provided layout design, plans, and specifications for the installation of a 30-ton hydrated lime silo system, slurry pumps, trenching/piping, foundation and controls.

	<P><B>Clearwater Basin Repairs:</B> Provided mechanical, civil, and structural engineering design and construction inspection services for over $1.0 million worth of construction repair projects at the 10 MG underground clearwater basins.  Projects included: partial floor slab removal and replacement, construction joint repairs and protection involving the installation of a flexible Hypalon liner system, installation of two 30" emergency back-up discharge pipe lines and associated valving, and coordination of lime sludge removal and drying operations.

	Also conducted complete structural analyses of column supports, ceiling arches, and foundations, and evaluated flow rates, capacity, chlorine contact time and water quality.

	<P><B>Distribution System Upgrades:</B> Entech developed plans and specifications for a multitude of improvements/upgrades to the city's 209 mile distribution system.  Entech designed and inspected over 30,000 LF of water main ranging in size from 6" to 36".  The distribution system upgrades include the elimination of dead ends via looping, replacing existing deteriorated and undersized mains with new larger diameter pipe, fire hydrant replacements, main line distribution valve replacements (30" and 36" sizes), etc. 

	<P>In addition, Entech worked extensively with PADOT, Conrail, and the Pennsylvania DEP to ensure proper permitting and safety of installation. Examples of other distribution system projects include: transferring of services from low pressure to intermediate pressure, new pressure reducing valves, aerial and underground stream crossings, cathodic protection and the development of an operational pipe flow model of the entire distribution system.  Total construction costs for the distribution system upgrades are in excess of $6.3 million.

	<P><B>Maiden Creek Pumping Station Upgrades:</B> Upgrade of the pumping station included structural and roof repairs, replacement of underground fuel tanks, new 900 HP diesel engine and speed reducer for a 17 MGD emergency pump, new pump discharge valves/operators, pump surge anticipator/relief system, new vacuum system, electrical system upgrades including new switchgear, lighting and emergency power system, electrification of an existing crane and new automated pump controls including a SCADA control system.  Entech also provide structural analysis of crane and building supports, evaluation of electrical, heating and pump control systems, pump flow tests and flow metering calibration, and an energy study to reduce electrical consumption during peak hours.
	
	<P><B>Hydraulic Flow Model:</B> Entech developed a hydraulic model to simulate pipe network flow analysis of the city's 13 MGD system consisting of 210 miles of 4" to 36" water mains, four pressure zones, three pumping stations (each with two to five pumps), four pressure sustaining valves, and eleven water tanks/reservoirs ranging in  size from 500,000 to 26,000,000 gallons.

	<P><B>SCADA:</B> Reading had a very old, unreliable, centralized reservoir monitoring system to track tank water levels.  This system was replaced with a state of the art Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which allows the city to accurately track and record not only tank levels, but also filter plant performance (filter status, flows, turbidities, etc).  Transmission/distribution system pressures, residual chlorine and PH levels, transmission line flows, pump suction and discharge pressures, and other data, continuously.  Operational control and status of pumps and storage tank altitude valves is also provided.  Over 350 points are monitored or controlled by the system.

	<P><B>GIS: </B> A Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed for the city to quickly access distribution and service information on the computer.  The system also contains fire hydrant, valve, and line details in a comprehensive database which is easily accessed over conventional phone lines.  Work orders and inventory tracking are an integral part of the system.

<P><B>State-wide Energy Analysis, Pennsylvania Wastewater Treatment Plants:</B> Entech completed a state-wide project that analyzed energy usage at 1,300 wastewater treatment plants.  The first phase included mailing a survey for data-gathering; the second phase involved in-depth studies of 16 high-cost plants.  The most common opportunity for improvement involved the use of variable frequency controlled motors.  Other program phases included preparing a financial analysis manual, design of a $20,000 demonstration plant project, development of a procedure for calculating savings, reports and several presentations.  The project was completed in 1991, with a fee of $57,000.

		<B>Air Conditioning Feasibility Study</B>: Entech conducted a feasibility study of alternative cooling systems for the Merner-Pfeiffer Hall of Science.  Cooling systems evaluated consisted of: direct expansion units, air-source heat pumps, water-source 
heat pumps, chilled water and thermal storage (water and/or ice).  All systems were evaluated for construction costs, comfort, energy consumption, operating and maintenance costs, and expected useful life.  Feasibility study completed November 1992.
		<P>
		<P><B>Mohn Hall</B>: Entech conducted an energy audit for Mohn Hall Dormitory.  The energy evaluation covered all energy systems inculding outside lighting.  Entech identified four Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs):<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Efficient fluorescent lighting
<LI>Incandescent to fluorescent lighting
<LI>Power Factor Correction
<LI>Replace Electric rooftop units with new gas rooftop HVAC unit.
</UL>

The estimated construction cost for the four ECOs was approximately $9,200.  The estimated annual savings were $3,200 for a 14% reduction from current energy expenditures resulting in a simple payback period of 2.8 years.<P>

Entech also completed and submitted an Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) grant application to the Pennsylvania Energy Office for Cycle XVI funding for the four (4) ECOs. If accepted, the grant would pay 50% of the engineering and construction costs involv
ed up to a maximum amount of $75,000.<P>

tunities (ECOs): 1) Summer Shutdown; 2) Boiler Plant Improvements; 3) Boiler Plant Lighting.  The estimated construction cost for the three (3) ECOs was approximately $97,000.  The estimated annual energy savings are $43,900 for a 14% reduction from curre
nt energy expenditures.  This saving yields an average simple payback period of 2.2 years.

	<P><B>Energy Conservation Measure Grant Application Submission:</B> Entech completed and submitted Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) Grant Applications to the Pennsylvania Energy Office for Cycle XVI funding for the three (3) ECOs.  Entech was successful
 in obtaining an ECM Grant for all three (3) ECO projects.  The total grant amounted to over $74,000.

	<B>Technical Assistance - Energy Analysis: </B>Entech performed a T/A study and grant application in 1991 	and later provided the audit of nineteen buildings (842,300 sq ft).  Energy evaluation included all energy systems.  A total of 51 Energy Conservat
ion opportunities were identified which when totally implemented, can result in a annual energy savings of $490,000 with a simple payback period of 3.2 years.
	<P>The University elected to implement the Summer Shutdown recommendations as the first step in the program. 

	<P><B>Ada S. Georges Dining Hall and Marcus Foster Student Center: </B> Provided mechanical and electrical design services to renovate the kitchen facilities.  Work consisted of installation of new kitchen hoods, new filters, lights, fire suppression sys
tem, new hood support system, new gas service, and ductwork modifications to increase make-up air.  The survey covered more than 100,000 GBSF.

	<P><B>Replacement of Steam and Condensate Lines:</B> Provided engineering and design services for the replacement of approximately 225 L.F. of five (5) inch underground high pressure steam piping and associated three (3) inch condensate return piping.  T
he steam lines are located between Baily Hall and Marcus Foster Student Center.

	<P><B>Cooling Load Calculations and Alternate Cooling Systems Analysis:</B> Developed cooling load calculations and recommendations for the replacement of cooling systems for the following three (3) buildings: 1) McKnight-Rogers; 2) Baily Hall; and 3) Ca
rnegie Library.  Based upon the cooling load calculations, Entech concluded that the existing air conditioning equipment located in Baily Hall and Carnegie Library were of proper size and a recommendation for a one-for-one replacement was made.  The cooli
ng load calculations for McKnight-Rogers indicated that the existing air conditioning equipment and supporting ductwork were severely undersized.  Entech recommended a complete system replacement with a complete packaged variable air volume system includi
ng roof top unit and insulated duct system.  Construction costs are estimated to be $150,000.

		At <A HREF="http://www.esu.edu">East Stroudsburg</A>, the main boiler was running all year round, even in the summer, to supply the steam 
		for absorption chillers.  Entech designed a system for 25 buildings on campus which allowed the University 
		to shut down the central boiler plant during the summer months.  
		<P>The equipment that was replaced included: six absorption chillers with centrifugal and reciprocating 
		chillers, installation of gas and electric water heaters in the same buildings, plus installation of a gas-fired 
		steam generator for the dining hall and science building.  A pool heater, gas line installation and an electric 
		distribution upgrade were also designed.
		<P>The shutdown of the campus main steam system was completed in September 1991.
		<P>Savings associated with this project were:
		<P>Steam savings = 65 million lbs (36%)
		<BR>Cost Savings = $300,000 per year
		<BR>Construction Costs = $750,000
		<BR>Payback period = 2.5 years
		<P>
		<P><B>Boiler #6 Replacement:</B>  Evaluation of the campus utility plant which has a 120,000 lb/hr steam capacity was performed to determine improvement options for the No. 6, 40,000 lb/hr fluidized bed boiler.  Entech recommended replacing the existing fluidized bed boiler with a new dual fuel (gas/oil) 20,000 lb/hr fire-tube boiler.  Additional recommendations include upgrading and replacing the deaerator, platforms, lighting, electrical distribution, fuel oil storage (60,000 gallon) tanks, and other major equipment in order to extend the life of the plant.  Completed the design for the removal of the existing boiler and the installation of a new 20,000 lb/hr fire-tube boiler.  Equipment to be removed includes: 40,000 lb/hr fluidized bed boiler, economizer, ash silo, baghouse, coal and sorbent bunkers, combustion air blower and dust system, I.C. fan, cyclones, ash handling system, coal and ash screw conveyors and associated motor control centers.  Construction costs are $1,100,000, with completion due the end of 1996.

		<P><B>Fuel Oil Tank Replacement:</B>  Designed replacement of three 20,000 gallon underground fuel oil tanks with double-wall tanks and piping.  Landscaping and parking improvements in front of the boiler plant are also included under this project.  Estimated construction cost is approximately $400,000.  Project is scheduled for completion in 1997.

		<P><B>Dansbury Commons HVAC Study: </B> Evaluated existing HVAC systems in campus dining hall.  Improvements and replacement options were reviewed, with recommendations made in a final report.

		<P><B>Kemp Library Lighting Project: </B> Designed a lighting retrofit project to decrease electrical costs in the library.  Approximately 180 fixtures are scheduled for conversion to T-8 lamps and electronic ballasts for a cost of approximately $100,000.  Energy savings are projected to be approximately $30,000.

		<P><B>Energy Management System: </B>Designed new 1,000 point Energy Management System for entire campus.  Services included preparing specifications, review of proposals and recommendations during award of contract.  Contract was awarded August 1991, with construction costs of approximately $750,000.

		<A HREF="http://www.esu.edu">East Stroudsburg University</A> commissioned Entech to perform a 
		campus-wide energy study.  Based on the recommendations from this study, ESU proceeded with the 
		design and construction of lighting improvements in the Field House and Natatorium.
		<P>In the Field House, 120 mercury vapor fixtures were replaced with more efficient metal halide fixtures. 
		The light 	fixtures specified were designed to partially illuminate the ceiling indirectly.  With the repainting 
		of the ceiling, the Field House now has a bright, more even, non-glare lighted environment.
		<P>In the Natatorium, the existing mercury vapor fixtures wre also replaced with metal halide fixtures. 
		The fixtures were realigned using the results of a lighting distribution modeling program, allow better 
		access for maintenance of the lamps and ballasts.
		<P>The project was completed in January 1992.  Total cost of the project was $120,000, with annual 
		energy savings of approximately $35,000.

		Entech conducted an energy audit of Indiana University of Pennsylvania's (IUP) central steam boiler plant which consists of four (4) coal-fired water tube boilers each rated at 30,000 lbs/hr. The average annual steam production is approximately 102,700 lbs of steam. The University's cogeneration plant was also evaluated since the cogeneration plant provides steam to make up shortages during peak demands. 
		<P>Entech recommended the replacement of two existing coal-fired boilers with two new gas-fired 30,000 lbs/hr boilers. Entech was retained to provide design and construction services for this project. The design included the demolition and removal of the two existing coal-fired boilers, adaptation of new boilers to existing systems and structures including foundations, piping interfaces, breaching connections, new electrical connections, fuel supply lines, local and remote (cogeneration plant) controls, lighting and equipment access to the building.
		<P>Construction costs are anticipated to be approximately $800,000, with expected energy savings of $185,000 per year and a simple payback period of 4.3 years. Entech was successful in obtaining an energy grant from the Pennsylvania Energy Office in the amount $75,000 to offset the cost of this project. 

		<P><B>Robert Shaw Building</B>:

		<B>Campus-wide Energy Audit </B>: Entech conducted an Energy Audit for the entire campus.  The Technical Assistance Study consisted of surveying twelve (12) building comprised of more than 400,000 S.F. of gross building area.  Fifteen Energy Conservation Opportunities (ECOs) were identified with annual energy savings of over $375,000 and an average simple payback of 2.6 years with construction costs totaling approximately $987,000.<P>

	Entech prepared the Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) Grant Application for participation in Cycle XV of the grant program and was successful in assisting Moravian College in obtaining a $70,000 ECM Grant for an Energy Management System (EMS).<P>

	Entech provided engineering and design services for the installation of the Energy Management System.  The EMS system consists of approximately 130 points.  Entech evaluated the instrumentation and controls in each building to determine existing conditions.  A list of control points were developed for each building, with a description of how each control/monitoring point will operate and interface with existing controls.  Construction costs estimated at $160,000.
		<P>
		<P><B>Hall of Science Building</B>:Entech updated the Technical Assistance Report for the Hall of Science Building.  Six (6) Energy Conservation Opportunities were identified with annual energy savings of over $50,000 and an average simple payback of 4.2 years with construction costs totaling approximately $210,000.<P>

	Of the six (6) ECOs identified, Moravian College has elected to seek an ECM Grant for a Variable Air Volume System.  The VAV system will reduce annual energy costs by approximately $41,000 with a simple payback of 4.5 years and construction costs totaling approximately $186,000.  Entech prepared and submitted the ECM Grant Application for Cycle XVI Funding.  Entech was successful in obtaining a $75,000 ECM Grant for the implementation of the VAV system.  Construction costs are estimated to be approximately $250,000.<BR><P>

<STRONG>Chiller System Analysis</STRONG>: Entech conducted an analysis of the existing chilled water system serving the Hall of Science Building.  The analysis included the investigation of the existing system and its effectiveness in both performance and useful service life.  The chiller analysis not only examined the existing system, but also investigated alternative chilled water systems which included reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, absorption, and thermal storage.  Analysis was completed in September 1993.<P>

The extent of destruction already wrought by the burning and bulldozing of rain forest has reached such proportions that it now threatens worldwide consequences. More than 4,000 acres of this irreplaceable forest is being burned off each hour!<BR><H3>Real Dangers to our Climate!</H3>The uncontrolled burning of the rain forest is pouring out carbon dioxide faster than surrounding forests can cleanse it from the air. The result: burning rain forest is a major contributor to the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; now predicted by many scientists.<P></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><H3>The Loss of Tomorrow's Miracle Drugs!</H3>While occupying only two percent of the earth's surface, rain forests support well over half of our planet's wild plants, trees, animal and insect life -- including vegetation that provides a quarter of today's drugs and medicines, for the treatment of everything from heart disease to leukemia.<P>Still, 99 percent of rain forest vegetation has yet to be evaluated for its possible medical value! Some 2,100 varieties of rain forest plants are known to possess cancer fighting properties. And no one knows how many other plants may do the same in the fight against cancer and other diseases.<P></TD><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=BOTTOM><IMG SRC="rainforest_lab.gif"><P></TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=BOTTOM><IMG SRC="rainforest_cat.gif"><P></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><H3>Burning the Answers to World Hunger!</H3>Without trees and plants, the delicate lands of the tropics quickly turn barren. Ironically, if left to science undisturbed, the life-nurturing rain forests of the world could help produce bumper crop yields worldwide. This is possible because scientists are learning how to interbreed our main food crops with their robust, disease-resistant rain forest relatives. Many rain forest plants also produce their own insect repellants -- harmless substances that may well hold the key to nonpoisonous insecticides.<P><H3>A Threat to Over Half the World's Wildlife!</H3>Rain forests are home to at least 50 percent of our planet's wild species, and hardly any can survive elsewhere.

The first Arbor Day was celebrated in the state of Nebraska in 1872, in response to a state proclamation urging settlers and homesteaders in that prairie state to plant trees that would provide shade, shelter, fruit, fuel, and beauty for residents of the largely treeless plains. On that first Arbor Day, more than one million trees were planted in Nebraska's communities and on its farms.<P>The Arbor Day idea was promoted by J. Sterling Morton, editor of the <I>Nebraska City News</I>, who later helped the idea spread to neighboring states and eventually to all of the United States and many other nations.<P>Today, Arbor Day celebrations are held in communities all over America, with the date determined by the best tree planting times in each area. Celebrations are held as early as  January and February in some southern states, and as late as May in more northern locations.

But more importantly, trees were needed as windbreaks to keep soil from blowing and for fuel and building materials, as well as shade from the hot sun.<P>Morton not only advocated tree planting by individuals in his articles and editorials, but he also encouraged civic organizations and groups of every kind to join in. His prominence in the area increased, and he became secretary of the Nebraska Territory, which provided another opportunity to stress the value of trees.<P></TD><TD><PRE>   </PRE></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><IMG SRC="sterling_morton.gif" ALT="J. Sterling Morton, Founder of Arbor Day"><BR><B><I>&quot;Each generation takes the Earth as <BR>trustees.  We ought to bequeath to <BR>posterity as many forests and orchards <BR>as we have exhausted and consumed.&quot;</I></B></TD></TR><TR><TD COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>On January 4, 1872, Morton first proposed a tree-planting holiday to be called "Arbor Day" at a meeting of the State Board of Agriculture. The date was set for April 10, 1872. Prizes were offered to counties and individuals for planting properly the largest number of trees on that day. It was estimated that more than one million trees were planted in Nebraska on the first Arbor Day.<P>Arbor Day was officially proclaimed by the young state's Gov. Robert W. Furnas on March 12, 1874, and the day itself was observed April 8, 1874. In 1885, Arbor Day was named a legal holiday in Nebraska and April 22, Morton's birthday, was selected as the date for its permanent observance.<P>During the 1870s, other states passed legislation to observe Arbor Day, and the tradition began in schools in 1882.<P>Today the most common date for the state observances is the last Friday in April, and several U.S. presidents have proclaimed a national Arbor Day on that date. But a number of state Arbor Days are at other times to coincide with the best tree-planting weather, from January and February in the south to May in the far north.<P>Arbor Day has now spread beyond the United States and is observed in many countries of the world. In some it is the king or queen who leads the national celebration, and in many countries exotic trees not suited to North America are planted in commemoration of the day.<P>J. Sterling Morton was proud of the success of Arbor Day and noted, "Other holidays repose upon the past. Arbor Day proposes for the future." He thought trees much superior to cold marble as a memorial to persons or events. "How much more enduring are the animate trees of our own planting," he said.</TD></TR></TABLE><P><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

Sterling Morton rounded Arbor Day. His simple idea of setting aside a special day for tree planting is now more important than ever... so have an Arbor Day celebration!<P>Raise the flag, strike up the band, make Arbor Day fun. Make it memorable. Organize a fun run. Make it a real event. See if a local business will donate prizes. Have a poster contest, or a poetry contest. Get the local PTA to sponsor a children's pageant or play. Organize and train volunteers to help you carry out Arbor Day ceremonies in your schools.<P>Get people excited. Show them things they've never seen before. Tell them things about trees they've never heard. Launch a thousand helium balloons with Arbor Day greetings inside offering a free tree to anyone who finds and returns the message.<P>Fill the air with music. Have an Arbor Day concert of songs about trees, or with tree names in their titles.<P>Get people into action. Ask a civic or service group to promote a paper drive to gather paper to be recycled and save a tree. Use the proceeds to buy a special tree to plant in a park or other special public place. Ask a local radio station to sponsor a tree trivia contest and give away trees to winners. Conduct a tree search. Ask people to find large, unusual or historic trees in your community. Tell people to take a hike--a tree identification hike--and have girl scouts or boy scouts act as guides.<P>Dedicate a forest, or a tree, or a flower bed in a park, and make it an occasion to talk about stewardship. Get a local nursery or garden center to hold an open house or field day. Organize an Arbor Day Fair.<P>Get people together. Ask retirement homes to invite children to plant a tree on their grounds and give the residents a chance to tell the kids about Arbor Day when they themselves were children. See if neighborhood organizations will hold block parties and get their members to adopt and care for street trees in front of their homes. Pass out buttons. Give away trees.<P>Make Arbor Day a real holiday. Make it special, and make it an occasion to look forward to. Make it a day of wonderful memories, and fill it with the promise of newly planted trees.<P>Celebrate Arbor Day in a personal way by planting a tree yourself. It is an act of optimism and kindness, a labor of love and a commitment to stewardship.<P>Anyone can do it. Start a tree seed in a cup, or a seedling in a pot. If you have no place to set it out later, give it to someone who does, and then watch it grow together. Find a place to plant a seedling or a sapling or the largest tree you can handle alone.<P>Each and every tree which is planted stands as a living reminder that we all bear responsibilities of stewardship. We are living links in a chain of humanity stretching from the dimmest past into an unknown future. We can each help make that future more certain by performing a simple act--by planting a tree.<P><H3>Planning an Arbor Day Ceremony</H3>An Arbor Day ceremony, be it simple and brief or an elaborate all-day observation, can be a delight to children and adults alike. It is especially meaningful to children if they have discussed the history of Arbor Day and have learned how to plant and care for trees before the ceremony is held.<P>A basic Arbor Day ceremony might include:<P>1. Greetings by a school principal or civic leader.<P>2. Reading a brief Arbor Day history.<P>3. Singing songs and reading poems about trees and tree planting.<P>4. Planting a tree together. Children might add a handful of soil brought from home to cover the roots. A small bottle holding the planters' handwritten names could also be placed by the roots.<P>5. Completion of planting, along with a demonstration about how to properly water and care for the new tree.<P>If resources allow, it is very memorable to distribute tree seedlings which can be adopted and planted at home.<P><HR WIDTH=469><P>For lots of ideas about how to observe and celebrate Arbor Day in your community, write for our free &quot;Celebrate Arbor Day!&quot; booklet:<P>THE NATIONAL<BR>ARBOR DAY FOUNDATION<BR>100 Arbor Avenue<BR>Nebraska City, NE 68410<P></TD></TR></TABLE><P><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

But the way it is carried to those who need to know the importance of tree planting to the planet is critical.<P>Each year The National Arbor Day Foundation nurtures a portion of its membership contributions by investing them in development of public service educational announcements.  That investment, in partnership with the nation's media, has resulted in the planting of many millions of trees by millions of people since the Public Service Educational Program began in 1972.<P>ABC has supported the Foundation's mission since its very inception.  It has urged countless millions to plant Trees for America; to support Tree City USA in their communities; and to plant Conservation Trees on their farms and support Rain Forest Rescue worldwide.  They have provided a vehicle for Children all across the nation to learn that Trees Are Terrific from Carly Cardinal, the Foundation's colorful spokesbird. During prime time, day time, or fringe time, the  ABC network has faithfully carried the Foundation's message.<P>Thanks to ABC, more people are planting more trees than ever before. Its contribution of air time has had an impact that will last for generations.  The tree planting which it has inspired means more liveable communities, cleaner air and water, more beautiful lands, and more habitat for wildlife.  The value of those millions of trees will grow through the oncoming years.<P>For its suburb support of the Foundation's Public Service Educational Program and the inspiration of countless environmental stewards in every corner of the nation, The National Arbor Day Foundation presents its 1996 Promise to the Earth Award to the American Broadcasting Corporation of New York, New York.<P><HR><P><H3>Paul Winter, Litchfield, Connecticut</H3><P>Paul Winter's musical realm has long embraced the traditions of many of the world's cultures, as well as extraordinary voices from what he refers to as "the greater symphony of the Earth," including wolves, eagles, and several dozen other species.  Since founding his Consort in 1968, he has made music that has transcended categories, reflecting his own diverse experience in jazz, symphonic and world music.  He uses the phrase "Earth Music" to describe his aspiration to celebrate the cultures, creatures and wilderness of the entire Earth.<P>Showcase magazine wrote that, " his music lingers with you because it is inspired by what we are -- a part of nature.  The feeling he expresses is his love for the richness and diversity of the wildlife and cultures that call earth their home."  Wilderness magazine wrote, " Paul Winter inhabits a lone place in the world of music: the place where music meets wilderness.  For  decades he has been exploring sounds of nature and bringing them together with this own world of music.  At the same time he has tried ceaselessly to assist in the struggle to preserve threatened places and endangered species of the earth."<P>To benefit the National Arbor Day Foundation, as part of Greenwich Work Shop's "Art in Concert Series, Paul Winter's work was teamed with that of Bev Doolittle.  The combined work  entitled "Prayer for the Wild Things," featured a full-length audio compact disc and a signed limited-edition print.  Proceeds from the collaboration have planted 100,000 trees in Shoshone National Forest<P>For his long dedication to preservation of what is wild in our world and his kind support, The National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Promise to the Earth Award to Paul Winter of  Litchfield, Connecticut.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

Hansen, Rantoul, Illinois</H3><P>She didn't get the nickname "Plantin' Peg" planting a few flowers here and there.  She earned it by covering the state with trees, nearly a third of a million of them, since the late 1950s when she began to re-acquaint the elementary children of Illinois with the celebration of Arbor Day.<P>No wonder a Chicago newspaper once expanded her nickname and began calling her "The 20th Century's Answer to Johnny Appleseed."  It's been said that she never met a tree she didn't like.<P>"During the Depression years," she wrote, "we could get Arbor Day seedlings for a penny, and we took them to Wisconsin with us where we planted them around the little house on our grandparents' farm." She realized later that children were no longer getting those Arbor Day seedlings.<P>After an ice storm devastated the trees of central Illinois, she went to see the superintendent of the local elementary schools, to see if he would let her start an Arbor Day celebration with the children.  He enthusiastically said yes.<P>She found a nursery to supply seedlings, and enlisted support from the local garden club and other civic organizations.<P>On Arbor Day of 1958, Rantoul school children took a nickel to school, and received a seedling and an Arbor Day button.  Most schools had assemblies for the celebration, and many teachers included information about trees and tree planting in their science classes.<P>Later she wrote, "I tried to re-establish Arbor Day with the distribution of seedling trees to school children because they are the future generation, and they needed the training and all that goes with the care and feeding of trees."<P>The Rantoul City Schools Arbor Day program became a state pilot project of the Garden Club of Illinois, and within a few years, school children all over Illinois were receiving seedlings on Arbor Day.<P>She has been named to Who's Who of American Women for her work in conservation, and honored by the Daughters of the American Revolution with a national award for her work.<P>	She says she doesn't have one favorite tree but of all the trees she has planted, she calls the first one her special memory tree.<P>"And now as I look in the backyard," she says, "all that grows there is the result of Arbor Day. When the red bud blooms in the spring and the dogwood comes out, you look back and think, yes, I remember.  There is such a nice melding of memory."<P>For her affection for trees and for the stewards of tomorrow, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Joyce Kilmer Award to Marguerite C. Hansen of Rantoul, Illinois.<P><HR><P><H3>James J. Nighswonger, Manhattan, Kansas</H3><P>He is a recognized leader in urban forestry at the state, regional and national levels.  Involved in the founding of the urban forestry movement in the late 1960's and early 70's, his  program was selected as a national model by the US Forest Service.  He has dedicated his career to educating public and  professionals alike about all aspects of urban forestry, in organizing and leading communities in the development of tree programs, and in improving the urban forest resource.<P>He has served on the National Urban Forest Council and is a technical advisor to the National Tree Trust and to the National Arbor Day Foundation's Tree City USA Bulletin.  He has been a mentor to several states in the development of their urban forestry and urban forestry council programs.<P>He provides leadership to Urban and Community Forestry Programs in 123 cities, 83 of which are Tree City USA's.  He works with 90 additional communities on various projects during the year.  His organized tree programs administer municipal forest resources of 235,534 acres with a tree value of $209 million.  Nearly 50% of the state's population lives in a Tree City USA.<P>Arborist training and certification are his vital interests.  He has provided administration and coordination of annual week-long training courses for the past 20 years.  Those schools have trained 900 arborists and groundskeepers from 10 states and Canada<P>He is a founder of his state's Urban Forestry Council.  That organization helps its members target programs to meet their local community forestry needs.  The concept is unique among Urban Forestry Councils nationally. The Council serves as advisor to the state forester and also conducts its own educational programs.<P>He has dedicated his professional life to serving and teaching people to value, plant and care for trees.  He once wrote, "There can be few careers more enjoyable than that which serves others, especially when that service involves trees and the benefits we enjoy from them.  Without a doubt, trees are a gift from God to make our world a better place and our lives more satisfying.  What a blessing it has been to work with people and with trees."<P>For his proud service in the cause of Community Forestry and in thanks for his loyal friendship, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Joyce Kilmer Award to James J. Nighswonger of Manhattan, Kansas.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

STERLING MORTON AWARD</H2><P><HR><P><H3>Dr. Roger C. Funk, Kent, Ohio</H3><P>To know the power of an idea and to foster its adoption is the essence of leadership. It is the central to the observance Arbor Day itself and to the work of J. Sterling Morton, the holiday's founder.<P>The 1996 J. Sterling Morton Award winner carries on that tradition.  He developed the concept of Plant Health Care or PHC.  It is a powerful idea whose time has come.  A holistic approach to plant care, PHC focuses on plant health and growth.  Use of the concept begins with proper soil preparation and proper plant selection.  It goes on to require preventive care and incorporates pest management.  Importantly, pest management is used only when damage warrants, and any control methods selected are those that are the most environmentally friendly.  Under his essential national leadership, the idea has taken strong root throughout the arboricultural profession.<P>He is nationally recognized as a leading authority in the field of tree, lawn and landscape care. He serves on the Biological Pest Control Advisory Panel for the Office of Technology Assessment in Washington, D.C. He holds a doctorate in plant physiology, a master of science in ornamental horticulture and a bachelor of science degree in agriculture from West Virginia University. His responsibilities embrace arboricultural and horticultural consulting, research and development, and training.<P>As Vice President of Human and Technical Resources for The Davey Tree Expert Company, he is affiliated with one of America's preeminent landscape care firms.  During his 20 years with the company he has developed and patented improved fertilizers and pesticide metering systems, and designed its lawn care program.   His research interests include soils, fertilization, and pesticide reduction. It was at Davey that he developed Plant Health Care.<P>He has been a featured speaker for the National Arborist Association, the International Society of Arboriculture, and National Urban Forest Conference, as well as the National Arbor Day Foundation's Tree City USA National Conference and the Trees and Utilities National conference.<P>The American Society for Horticultural Science, the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the International Society for Horticultural Science, the International Society of Arboriculture, the New York Academy of Sciences, the Ohio Academy of Sciences, the Ohio Turfgrass Foundation, the Professional Lawn Care Association of America and the Southern Turfgrass Foundation all count him among their esteemed members.<P>For the energy, enthusiasm, and impact of his work, the National Arbor Day foundation presents its 1996 J. Sterling Morton award to Roger C. Funk of Kent Ohio.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

It's a combination which seems quite possible in light of his accomplishments.<P>In support of his nomination, urban forester Linda Romero wrote, "Fallbrook is a small community in San Diego County.  Situated just north of San Diego and just south of Los Angeles, it is encroached upon from all directions.  He had a vision of maintaining its small town atmosphere in spite of the rampant urbanization that is occurring in southern California. It seems like an unstoppable machine running at the pace of a locomotive,  I didn't it was possible to slow it down or stop it...until I went to Fallbrook.  What I saw there was phenomenal.<P>He took me downtown and talked of plans to plant trees along the storefronts, to remove exotic vegetation from stream banks, to create a community greenbelt, and to preserve open space for community gardens, native forests, and wildlife habitat.  I thought his ideas were far beyond what anyone might hope to accomplish.  By the end of the day I realized that he was not only a man of many dreams, but also a man of action.<P>His accomplishments are amazing.  Land has been acquired and restored to its native condition.  Parks have been developed featuring bands stands and gazebos and planted with trees and flowers. A demonstration planting of fire-safe landscaping has been installed.  Ancient native oak woodlands have been spared the axe and preserved for future generations. There was more, a nature preserve with creeks, ponds, riparian (Ra PAIR ee in) woodlands, large wetlands, nature and botanical trails, an amphitheater, open meadows and grasslands was almost completed, and a Master Treescape Plan had been developed and is under way.  All that I saw that day had been accomplished by volunteers with his leadership.  Who is he? Is he a city employees? A County steward?  Neither, he is simply a resident of Fallbrook who doesn't want to loose the character of his hometown to the urban encroachment and strip development that plagues so much of Souther California. By the end of the day I knew that, in spite of many obstacles, he would accomplish every one of his goals and I also knew that I, too, was committed to help in any way possible."<P>For his worthy aims, and his wonderful accomplishments the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Lawrence Enersen Award to Roger Boddaert of Fallbrook, California.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

They each enjoyed camping, hunting, and fishing, and longed for a home in the countryside. Little did they know what was in store.<P>While surveying the property, they discovered severe soil erosion, drainage problems, and devastated woodlands.  The previous owners had cut most of the high-grade trees.  The Grosseto's contacted the local conservation district for planning assistance.  A conservation agreement was signed and a management plan prepared.  Fire roads were built as well as field terraces and a pond. Work on the home began as well.<P>Mary Grosseto has carried on stewardship of "Rambling Acres" since her husband's death in 1977.<P>She recently wrote, "We are all tenants of the land and it is everyone's responsibility to preserve the environment.  Becoming a "Tree Farmer" has made me truly aware of the natural resources which we take so much for granted.  It is a great privilege to enjoy wildlife in its natural habitat, and to share "Rambling Acres" with my children, grand-children, relatives and friends.  The farm is home to hunting, fishing, nature trail walks, nesting boxes for blue-birds, screech owls, diversified woodland, open pastures, wildlife cover, and timber production for the future.<P>Now I plan to conduct woodlot tours for prospective landowners, 4-H groups, Scouts and Civic Organizations.  They will be the future stewards of our environment".<P>For her vision of stewardship and love of the land, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Good Steward Award to Demetra Grosseto of Damascus, Pennsylvania.<P><HR><P><H3>Robert and Ilona Parker, Brush, Colorado</H3><P>Robert and Ilona Parker purchased their first tract of land in southeastern Morgan County, Colorado, in 1965, and have been adding acres since.  The farm is a mixture of irrigated cropland, dryland wheat, and pasture. Since 1967, the Parkers have planted more than 20,000 trees and shrubs.  There are 24 different species.<P>	The plantings in 35 separate locations, occupy 50 acres and comprise shelterbelts, field windbreaks, wildlife plantings, and a living snow fence.<P>The tree plantings have provided an opportunity for the Parkers to educate their friends, neighbors, and other people who come and visit the property.  They stress the benefits which trees provide, including enhanced wildlife habitat, reduced soil erosion, increased moisture retention, snow control, increased property value, and improved aesthetics.<P>They have participated in many conservation programs including:  the Forest Stewardship Program, the Stewardship Incentive Program, the Colorado Interagency Living Snowfence Program, The Agricultural Conservation Program, the Colorado Habitat Improvement Program, Pheasants Forever, and The Colorado Parks and Recreation Association.<P>They have encouraged Scouts to plant seedlings to earn Merit Badges.  They also welcome picnics, camping, and have designed a bridal path.  They have also held guided tours of their tree plantings for Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, Church Groups, Colorado Forest Stewardship Steering Committee and students from local schools.<P>For their hard work and dedication to tree planting, the Parkers have received Landowner Of The Year Awards from the  Colorado Senate' the Colorado State Grange, the Colorado Recreational Vehicle, Sports, Boat, and Travel Show, The United Sportsmen's Council of Colorado, the Morgan County Soil Conservation District, the Colorado Division of Izaak Walton League, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife.<P>For their example of wise stewardship and their dedication to tree planting and care, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Good Steward Award to Robert and Ilona Parker of Brush, Colorado.<P><HR><P><H3>Phil Rutter, Canton, Minnesota</H3><P>His life's work has revolved around two quite different projects, but both concern the vital relationship of trees, forests, and human beings.<P>	In the late 1970's, he found himself involved in research  that could have a major effect on two important problems.   Restoration of the American chestnut and the future of world food production systems.<P>In response to the first problem, he became a founder of the American Chestnut Foundation.  The foundation now has chapters in 7 states.  The national organization has 2,500 members.  A research farm has been established in Virginia.  Hybrids that are 7/8 American Chestnut have been created, and initial tests for blight resistance indicate that some carry the necessary blight resistance.  A great deal remains to be done, but the organization is robust enough to carry the project through.<P> At the same time, he began working on the American chestnut problem, his reading convinced him that growing food on woody plants was more sensible in many ways than current agricultural practices.<P>Environmental problems caused by accepted food production systems, based on annual tillage, are many.  Any food production system which does not require constant tillage could have immediate and far-reaching benefit. To that end he is conducting cutting-edge hybridization research to create highly productive, blight-resistant hazelnuts which offer great potential to meet humankind's protein needs. The extreme droughts of 1988-89 convinced him that hybrid hazelnuts, in particular, were sufficiently advanced to begin encouraging others to plant them experimentally.<P>In the United States, where interest is in hazelnut cultivation is strongest, universities are seeking funding for specific research projects to advance a machinable hybrid hazelnut crop, and a small group of farmers are making hazelnut plantings with intention of production. His hazelnut hybrids, which incorporate a majority of native DNA which makes them highly adaptive to heat, drought, flooding, and extreme cold, are particularly suited to America's Midwest.<P>His research on woody agriculture is now spreading to several different institutions and regions and China is hosting a cooperative project for development of chestnut agriculture, based on his hybrids adapted for 3rd World hand labor systems and needs.<P>For his far-reaching vision of earth stewardship, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Good Steward Award to Philip A. Rutter of Canton, Minnesota.<P><HR><P><H3>Bill Slagle, Bruceton Mills, West Virginia</H3><P>The land and the trees have been good to Bill Slagle at his Walnut Meadow Farm, and he has been good to them.  At his 100-acre farm, which came down from his great, great, great, great grandfather, John Friend Sr., he is a stewardship pioneer.<P>"I believe in taking care of the environment," he says.  "You have to move ahead and use good policy."<P>In addition to teaching at the Preston Education Center, he intensely manages 60 acres of forest land on his farm.  As a member of the Friendsville Rotary Club, he helps plant 10 acres of white pine a year, sometimes on strip-mined lands.  As a member of the American Walnut Council, he represents landowners from 16 states.  He also raises mushrooms and ginseng for the commercial market.<P>	Mostly a self-made, self-educated man, he even built the home he and his family live in today.<P>For Bill Slagle, ideas, maybe even more than the land and the things that grow upon it, are things you put to work.<P>His life is testament that West Virginians with a little land and a lot of personal enterprise can make it.<P>	For his innovation, curiosity and love of the land, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Good Steward Award to William Slagle of Bruceton Mills, West Virginia.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

Its major goal is to restore the street's tree canopy. During the first year of the project, magnolia, holly trees, live oak, and other evergreens were planted.<P>As much of the impermeable, concrete sidewalk material as possible, was removed and the walks relayed with brick or stone on a base of compacted sand.  This element of the project is important so that air and water can penetrate and nourish the roots of the young trees, while also improving conditions for older, existing, mature trees.  To further enhance the new corridor, tree lawns have been planted with Asian jasmine as a ground cover.<P>New period lighting, litter bins, street name and traffic signs have also been installed.<P>Now in its fourth year, the project will be completing the fifth and final phase in May of 1996.<P>The Bull Street Improvement Project has inspired a renewed enthusiasm and respect for the heritage of Savannah's historic landscapes, both natural and built.<P>For its vision of graceful green, growing to bring beauty to heritage, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents its 1996 Lady Bird Johnson Award to The Bull Street Improvement Project of Savannah, Georgia.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

There it devours its prey in full view of startled onlookers.<P>	Walkers round a bend to see a rabbit sunning itself beside the path.  A chipmunk sprints over the hillside trail across the feet of delighted hikers.<P>Right in the middle of one of Greensboro's nicest neighborhoods is its most unusual park - the Bog Garden.<P>The bog is a wild and ungroomed place, a nature preserve in the midst of the city.<P>In 1987, as Dr. Joe Christian and his wife, Annie, strolled through the Bicentennial Garden, they followed a beautiful gleaming bass downstream to discover a dream.<P>Trash and weeds choked an old lake, its dam broken, but yellow water iris, ferns and wildflowers - elements of a natural bog - inspired Dr. Christian.  When the property was donated to the city, his dream of restoring the bog became a reality.<P>Today, boardwalks loop over the marsh.  Ducks and Canada geese feed at the edge of the restored four-acre lake, and catfish swim in the creek.  Cardinals, screech owls and woodpeckers live amid the trees, and then there are the plants, lush, and thriving plantings in their abundance.<P>"Everything out here means something," Dr. Christian says.  He and a cadre of volunteers have rescued plants in the path of development and transplanted them to the bog.  Swamp roses came from Lake Brandt, European cranberry from Sedgefield and twisted laurel from Lake Jeanette.<P>The garden bears the names of dedicated volunteers.  The Nell Lewis Trail, named for the columnist and gardener, snakes along a hillside.  At the summit, 50 feet up, is Melvin's Mountain, named for Lionel Melvin, who contributed plants and expertise.<P>Though they may not know his name and won't find it on any sign, folks who walk regularly through the Bog Garden know the sight of Dr. Christian, standing happily up to his ankles in mud.  "I spent my whole life around sterile things, wearing suits and ties," the retired physician says.  "I guess that's why I love it."<P>His reward is in knowing that other people love it, too.<P>For its realization of nature's beauty restored, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Project Award to The Bog Garden of Greensboro, North Carolina.<P><HR><P><H3>Dallas Historic Tree Coalition, Dallas, Texas</H3><P>The Dallas Historic Tree Coalition is a citizen's group which advocates protection and preservation of irreplaceable trees in the urban landscape.  It was formed in response to the threat of destruction of a large grove of historic trees on the campus of Dallas Presbyterian Hospital.  The hospital planned to destroy the trees to make room for a new power plant.<P>Citizens with ties to the hospital, its neighborhood, and the aboricultural community felt strongly that every effort should be made to save the trees.  They met and formed The Dallas Historic Tree Coalition.<P>The Coalition requested a meeting with hospital administrators and retained a hospital architect who formulated alternative plans to accommodate plant construction and save the trees.<P>After tense weeks of private contacts and Coalition-sponsored public awareness campaigns, hospital administrators announced that construction plans had been revised and that most of the grove, especially the older specimens, would be saved. Rather than increase construction costs, as had originally been contended, the hospital announced that the changes would actually reduce project costs by $500,000.  By offering suggestions in a spirit of good faith, the Coalition achieved positive results for everyone involved.<P>	Overwhelming positive response from the community built coalition membership from a core group of 12 in 1994 to more than 500 today and reflects the city's diversity.<P>The Dallas Historic Tree Coalition is thriving and looks forward to teaching the entire community the tangible and intangible benefits of preserving heritage trees.<P>With admiration, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Project Award to The Dallas Historic Tree Coalition of Dallas, Texas.<P><HR><P><H3>South San Antonio High School Science Club, San Antonio, Texas</H3><P>The South San Antonio High School Science Club, in support of the 1991 theme for World Food Day - "Trees for Life", developed a local tree-planting program to help supplement the diets of needy families.<P>Students learned which fruit and nut trees grew best in the area and then raised funds to buy trees and supplies.  Fundraising activities included bake sales, plant sales, Earth Day T-Shirt sales, and school watch sales.<P>Biology, Environmental Science, and World Area Studies classes joined the Science Club in the tree-planting work.  Other school organizations, teachers, and community members were also invited to help.  During after-school and weekend work-sessions,  volunteer work teams were given basic planting instructions, and  assigned specific addresses where trees were to be planted.<P>Through their volunteerism, participating students helped build community pride and were initiated as caring, contributing citizens.  They have, in effect, become "teachers" in their school, their community, and their own families by modeling responsible environmental and social stewardship.<P>For its sense of community and the context of its mission, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Project Award to The South San Antonio High School Science Club of San Antonio, Texas.<P><HR><P><H3>Streetscape Program of the Grand Center Partnership, New York, New York</H3><P>Grand Central Terminal was once the midtown hub of Manhattan.  Glamorous Travelers arrived by train from all parts of the country.  It was a center for gracious hotels like the long-gone Commodore, the Biltmore, where sophisticates met under the clock, and the Roosevelt, where couples danced to Guy Lombardo's music at the fabled Roosevelt Grill.<P>But the old hotels closed, and the area became soaring office towers, inter-spaced with small shops and fast-food joints.<P>Now Grand Central Terminal and the area surrounding it are due for a major face lift and general revitalization.<P>An ambitious renewal plan has been proposed by the Grand Central Partnership, which represents corporate tenants and property owners in the area.  It will include opened vistas, new cafes and restaurants, park-like places to stroll and sit outdoors, lighted building facades, and new plantings of trees and shrubs.<P>It will also feature widened walks, upgraded shops, and better signs.<P>The plan promises to give the Grand Central District "a distinct urban charisma and a sense of place that is welcoming and pleasurable."  Its aim is to restore vigor and diversity to the area through reworking the total street environment.<P>It will reduce urban blight litter, crime, graffiti, and deteriorating public structures.  To help homeless people in and around the station, the partnership plans to open a "drop-in" center that will offer food and drink, clothes distribution, counseling, and remedial services of many kinds.<P>In admiration for its vision, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Project Award to the Grand Central Partnership Renewal Project of New York, New York.<P><HR><P><H3>Trees for the City, Washington, D.C.</H3><P>A project of the L'Enfant Trust, Trees For The City was founded to foster community awareness of, involvement in, and responsibility for the urban landscape through education, training, and citizen-based tree plantings.<P> Once known as the "City of Trees," Washington, DC was losing thousands of trees each year.  Due to budgetary constraints, City Government was unable to keep pace with tree replacement and maintenance.<P>The program brings people and trees together to make Washington a better place to live.  Tree planting not only helps improve the physical appearance and health of the city, but also fosters community spirit and responsibility. It builds pride in  neighborhood and self, and it makes real the ideal that one's own actions can and do make a difference.<P>	Trees For The City, through the Elizabeth Rowe Community Tree Bank, acts as a catalyst for neighborhoods to take responsibility for the urban forest.  Through Citizen Forester Workshops, it has trained more than 75 neighborhood task force leaders how to plant and care for street trees.<P>	It works toward revitalization of the complete living conditions in a run-down, partially abandoned neighborhood in Anacostia with the help of local community leaders, church groups, and community residents.<P>In partnership with the Potomac Electric Power Company, it helped homeowners plant trees strategically around their homes to demonstrate their energy-saving benefits.<P>Trees For The City youth education programs are designed to promote community stewardship in children by providing a greater understanding of the environment and the importance of trees in the city's ecosystem.  The programs include:<P>Learning Through Trees - which is an in-school seed to seedling school beautification project.<P>Latin American Youth Corps - an after-school tree-planting program in partnership with the 15th Street Latin American Youth Center.<P>Trail of Trees - a modern "johnny mapleseed" program. Environmentalist/runner, Tim Womick spreads the tree planting message to thousands of schoolchildren and community groups as he runs through cities, counties and across states to share his message on the importance of trees and the Washington Youth Tree Corps which teaches fundamentals of horticulture and forestry through classroom-based curriculum and hands-on experience, and    the HE Volunteer Service Corps, which provides urban forestry projects in the community for high school student volunteers.<P>TREES FOR THE CITY also fosters Memorial Plantings, designed to provide friends and neighbors an opportunity to celebrate the life of a loved one.  Trees are planted along streets and in parks with a brief ceremony of remembrance.<P>For its growing vision of pride of place, the National Arbor Day Foundation  presents a 1996 Project Award to Trees For The City of Washington, D.C.<P><HR><P><H3>Youth Environmental Entrustment Project, Denver, Colorado</H3><P>The Youth Environmental Entrustment Project is an educational program geared to help at-risk youth.<P>Participants, work projects, and financial support come from many agencies, foundations, and corporations and the project is administered and strongly supported by the Colorado State Forest Service.<P>The project's mission is to provide positive work experiences, job skills, and training in urban and community forestry.  Through hands-on training and work projects, youngsters learn tree care practices, quality work ethics, and community forestry skills in a culturally diverse setting.  Work projects include tree planting, pruning, mulching, insect and disease control, and urban trail improvement.<P>Most participants admit they had given little or no thought to the environment or tree planting before their involvement.  They did not realize a community could have a forest.  They thought it was "just a bunch of trees.  Water, waste, and wildlife issues are used to demonstrate how the environment, as a whole, is important.<P>The project changes participants' views about trees and the environment, about themselves, and about others.<P>By learning wise stewardship of their community forest, many young people are becoming better stewards of their own futures.<P>For its mission of stewardship fostered, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Project Award to The Youth Environmental Entrustment Project  of Denver, Colorado.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

Georgia-Pacific's talented touring troop quickly transforms school cafeterias and libraries into a setting for a studio-like game show where everyone is encouraged to participate.  Kids and teachers alike receive an fun-filled activity kit called The Tree Trunk so they can take part in projects both in and out of school.  Step-by-step instructions include how to make bird feeders and how to recycle paper.<P>In addition, Tree Wishes tunefully teaches about wildlife habitat, forest management, forest products, and recycling solid waste.<P>To salute its guaranteed good-time opportunity to learn wise stewardship, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Education Award to the Georgia-Pacific Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia.<P><HR><P><H3>ShadeKeeper, Dallas, Texas</H3><P>The SHADEKEEPER program is building a very important volunteer-based force to help care for the greater Dallas area community forest.  It provides leadership for tree planting, pruning and maintenance projects.<P>SHADEKEEPER training stresses environmental awareness and basic horticultural principles.  Through ten hours of classroom and twelve hours of workshop applications, new SHADEKEEPERS learn tree identification, site suitability, proper planting techniques, after-planting care and pruning.  SHADEKEEPERS commit to forty hours of volunteer work on tree planting and maintenance projects during the following year and also organize volunteer work days at the Dallas Parks Foundation's Elam Road Growing Center.<P>By the time SHADEKEEPERS graduate from the program, they can identify over thirty tree species and provide technical assistance at any tree planting event.  They are also the best force for winning new recruits.<P>Forty-eight SHADEKEEPERS, over the course of a single year,   provided more than $17,000 worth of volunteer value to community tree planting projects and growing center management.  The Dallas Parks Foundation has shared success of the program with various municipalities around Dallas including Mesquite, Lancaster, Grand Prairie and Highland Park.  SHADEKEEPERS have also assisted on over 140 projects in addition to Volunteer Work Days at the growing center, have become involved with the Trinity Blacklands Urban Forestry Council, and have assisted with elementary education programs.<P>In salute to its spirit and its success, the National Arbor Day Foundation awards a 1996 Education Award to the SHADEKEEPER program of the Dallas Parks Foundation of Dallas, Texas.<P><HR><P><H3>Trees and Me from Sea to Sea, Lincoln, Nebraska</H3><P>"Trees and Me from Sea to Sea" is a year-long adventure for  sixth graders.<P>Students begin their journey introspectively.  They explore opportunities for personal growth by developing an understanding of what it means to be capable, competent, and compassionate.  Along the way, they develop problem-solving skills and discover a sense of responsibility for themselves, others, and their environment--the spirit of stewardship.<P>Classroom investigations include study of Nebraska, Mexico, Central America, South America, and Canada.  Each locale is studied from historical and current perspectives as related to cultural, economic, environmental and human resources.  Pen pals from each locale share knowledge and personal viewpoints about their particular part of the world.  Information is shared  by exchange of letters, pictures, videos and gifts. Simultaneously, information is provided to Dawes students by local tree farmers and environmental specialists regarding reforestation efforts in the Western Hemisphere.  Atmospheric benefits, conservation, economic impact, and the ecological advantages of trees and tree planting worldwide are discussed at length.  This information is shared with pen pals and establishes dialogue about trees indigenous to their home.  Those relationships provide the underlying motivation for a "Grand Planting".<P>Students thank their international peers with a native tree.  Fundraisers are held and money is sent to each pen pal site so  that a tree can be planted on Arbor Day during a synchronized, continent-to-continent ceremony.<P>Kids prepare for the "Grand Planting" by keeping journals.   They develop a knowledge of Arbor Day, its history, and its significance. They have a contest to create T-shirt designs.  Invitations to the "planting" go out to everyone who has been a part of the program.  The city arborist helps students choose a location and select which kind of tree to plant.  A script for the ceremony is created from individual journals.  Kids bring a cup of dirt from home to place at the base of the newly-planted tree to symbolize community stewardship. <P>When Arbor Day itself arrives, kids greet their guests at the planting place and the appointed clock-watcher signals when it is nearing the moment for the simultaneous tree planting.  Conjecture abounds as students wonder aloud, "Did our pen pals plant their trees?  Did Mexico plant a Ceiba?  Did Brazil plant a Flamboyant?  Did Canada plant a King Maple?"  The celebration ends with a choral reading written especially for the event, as well as cookies, conversation, and a jubilant walk back to school.<P>As students transcend national boundaries to become part of the world community, they find themselves more alike than different from their peers.  Meaningful and productive learning based on activity, discovery, and human interaction underscores the potential for greater student achievement as well as environmental stewardship.<P>For fostering the insight that stewardship is an individual responsibility with world-wide implications, the National Arbor Day Foundation presents a 1996 Education Award to "Trees and Me from Sea to Sea" of Lincoln, Nebraska.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

He told the urban forestry story and asked for the club's help to tell it to the entire community.<P>What was needed was a multi-faceted educational campaign--and that's just what the folks of Lewiston got.<P>	The history of Lewiston's community forest became a focus.  Poplar trees, which were planted in the 1870's by Lewiston's pioneer merchants to cool the downtown, became known as The Poplar Trees of Lewiston.  Later those trees were cut down but  in the 1980's, progressive merchants, seeking to revitalize the downtown, replanted Main Street.<P>A logo and slogan came next.  They were used in advertising and promotion to tie many activities, and projects together to further the cause of urban forestry.  "Trees for Tomorrow" became the watch words of stewardship.<P>	Action followed the call, booklets were printed, a Tree Trust Federation established, and fundraising activities fostered.  Public Service Announcements were made for television.  The spots tell taxpayers about the importance of the Idaho Income Tax Check-off for Community Forestry.  Ad Club members also wrote public service announcements for radio and sent to 54 stations.  A Pruning Guide was reprinted, and an Arbor Day Poster was produced.  A state tree grove brochure has gone to press as well as a "Rare Trees of Lewiston" map.<P>All in all, the people of Lewiston are a good deal more environmentally aware thanks to the Lewis and Clark Valley Advertising Federation.<P>The National Arbor Day Foundation proudly awards a 1996 Public Relations Program Award to the Lewis and Clark Valley Advertising Federation of Lewiston, Idaho.<P></TD></TR></TABLE><HR WIDTH=469><P><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=469 CELLPADDING=0><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT><A HREF="../../join/free_trees.html"><IMG SRC="../../images/free_trees_button.gif" ALT="Get 10 Free Trees!"

<P>PCMDI scientists are conducting <A HREF="../phillips/amipstudies.html">AMIP
studies</A>, both independently and in association with AMIP diagnostic
subprojects. We are testing regional and hemispheric validation techniques
spanning synoptic to interannual time scales in an effort to evaluate the

Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric model and the Semtner-Chervin

<P>PCMDI has conducted several exploratory studies of the use of different

<P>CMIP, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, is the analog of AMIP
for global coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. CMIP began
in 1995 under the auspices of the Numerical Experimentation Group 2 (NEG-2)
of CLIVAR. The PCMDI supports CMIP in much the same way that it supports
AMIP: by helping NEG-2 to determine the scope of the project, by maintaining
the project's data base, and by participating in data analysis. CMIP has
received model output from pre-industrial climate simulations (&quot;control
runs&quot;) of 18 coupled GCMs. A new phase of CMIP (CMIP2) will examine
model responses to anthropogenic climate forcing.</P>

<h1>An Overview of PCMDI </h1>
<hr>
<p>
The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) was established in 1989 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (<a href=http://www.llnl.gov>LLNL</a>) in the <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/Miscellaneous/directions.shtml">San Francisco Bay area</A>. Our <a href=../phillips/PCMDIstaff.html>staff</a>  includes research scientists, computer scientists, and support personnel.  There are several means of <a href=../phillips/PCMDIcommunicns.html>communicating</a> with PCMDI.
<p>

<h2> Mission </h2>

PCMDI's principal mission is to develop improved methods and tools for the diagnosis,validation and intercomparison of global climate models (GCMs)--what we call a <A HREF="infrastr.html">climate modeling infrastructure</A>. PCMDI scientists also engage in research on a wide variety of outstanding problems in climate modeling and analysis.
<p>
The need for standards in both modeling and analysis has become increasingly
apparent as more complex models are developed, while the disagreement
among models, and between models and observations, remains significant and poorly understood.  The nature and causes of these disagreements must be accounted for in a systematic fashion before models can be confidently used for climate sensitivity and predictability studies in support of global change research.

<p>
<H2>Climate Modeling Infrastructure</H2>
PCMDI staff members devote a significant share of their time to the development of climate modeling infrastructure. Examples include ongoing construction of <A HREF="documentation.html">documentation</A>, <A HREF="validation.html">validation data and analysis tools</A>, and <A HREF="PCMDIsoftware.html">software products</A> designed specifically for global climate modeling and analysis.

<P>

<h2>The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)</h2>

<p>

As a preliminary contribution to  model diagnosis and intercomparison under standardized conditions,  PCMDI is coordinating the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) on behalf of the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) of the World Climate Research Programme (<a href="http://www.wmo.ch/web/wcrp/wcrp-home.html">WCRP</a>).  
<p>

In this project, some 30 <a href=../phillips/AMIPgroups.html> AMIP modeling groups</a> are simulating the climate of the decade 1979-1988 using the observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea ice, as well as common values of solar luminosity (1365 W/m^2) and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (345 ppm). 
The participating models' principal numerical algorithms and dynamical/physical parameterizations are summarized in <a href=../phillips/modldoc/amip/amip.html> AMIP model documentation</a>.    

<p>

A set of monthly-mean <a href=../gleckler/amipso.html> standard output data</a> from each AMIP model is archived at PCMDI, and some AMIP modeling groups have also provided <a href=../susan/amiphistory.html>history data</a> at six-hourly intervals.  Analysis of the models' performance in comparison with observational data reveals their systematic errors, while comparison of the AMIP simulations with each other provides a measure of current modeling uncertainties.  

<p>

More focussed analyses of the models' ability to simulate specific processes and phenomena are being carried out by more than two dozen <a href=../phillips/AMIPsubprojects.html> AMIP diagnostic subprojects</a> in which PCMDI is playing a supporting role.  
The results of this diagnosis and intercomparison of the AMIP model simulations were extensively discussed at an international <a href=../phillips/AMIPconference.html> AMIP Scientific Conference</a> in May of 1995.  


<p> 

<h2>PCMDI Research </h2>
<p>
PCMDI scientists are conducting <a href=../phillips/amipstudies.html> AMIP studies</a>, both independently and in association with AMIP diagnostic subprojects.  We are testing regional and hemispheric validation techniques spanning synoptic to interannual time scales in an effort to evaluate the fidelity with which models can simulate observations.
<p>
PCMDI has extensively studied the effects of <a href=../phillips/resolution.html> spatial and temporal resolution</a> on climate simulations performed with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric model and the Semtner-Chervin ocean model.     
In addition, we are examining the natural variability of simulated seasonal and interannual climate in <a href=../phillips/ensemble.html> studies of ensemble integrations</a> of the ECMWF model from different initial conditions.
<p>
PCMDI has conducted several exploratory studies of the use of nonlinear and common <A HREF="../phillips/statistics.html">principal components</A> for model/data and model/model intercomparisons.
We also are developing statistical techniques for <a href=../phillips/detection.html> detection of climate change</a> (by external forcing such as greenhouse warming) against the background of internal variability of the atmosphere and ocean.

<p>
<h2> Collaborations </h2>
<p>
PCMDI scientists are collaborating with a number of <a href=../phillips/AMIPsubprojects.html> AMIP diagnostic subprojects</a>.  Some of this work is coordinated with other WCRP/WGNE initiatives, such as the Monsoon Numerical Experimentation Group (MONEG) and the <a href="http://www.cais.com/gewex/gewex.html">GEWEX</a>-sponsored Project for Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes (<a href="http://cic.mq.edu.au/pilps-rice/">PILPS</a>).  

<p>

PCMDI also is supporting the Feedback Analysis for GCM Intercomparison and Observations (FANGIO) project through the development of prototype diagnostics to identify important radiative feedbacks.  In addition, we are collaborating with the Paleoclimatic Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP), for which PCMDI is  providing data storage and diagnostic software.    

<p>

PCMDI computer scientists also have worked with colleagues at the National Energy Research Supercomputer Center (<a href=http://www.lbl.gov/NERSC/>NERSC</a>) and in the <a href="http://gizmo.lbl.gov/optimass.html">OPTIMASS Project</a> at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (<a href=http://www.lbl.gov>LBNL</a>) to develop innovative data access, translation, and storage algorithms and software.

 
<p>

<h2>  Software Tools </h2>

An important component of PCMDI's work is the development, testing, and distribution of <a href=../phillips/PCMDIsoftware.html>software tools</a> for the access, storage, diagnosis, and visualization of data.  
 <p>
A comprehensive climate database management system (CDMS) is currently under development at PCMDI.  This tool will provide efficient access of information from both our model and observational data archives. 

<p>

<h2> Validation Data </h2>

Because validation is central to the diagnosis and intercomparison of global climate models, PCMDI is developing observational data products as an essential element of a climate modeling infrastructure. Our current priority is to accumulate observational data (including especially reanalyses) from the AMIP period of 1979-1988, but a longer-term goal is to acquire quality datasets that are generally useful for climate model validation.   

<p>
<h2> Future Plans </h2>
<p>

During the next few years, PCMDI will continue its efforts to develop a climate modeling infrastructure (consisting of standards and software for documentation, data management, diagnosis, visualization, validation, intercomparison, and exchange) in cooperation with the <a href=../phillips/climategrps.html>climate community</a>.  Much of this effort will be directed to supporting the next phase of the AMIP (designated as <A HREF="../amip2/overview.html">AMIP II</A>).
<p>
In the longer term, we will progressively shift our emphasis from atmospheric models to models
of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, and will support the development of a
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (<A HREF="../covey/cmip/Cmip.htm">CMIP</A>) in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.dkrz.de/clivar/hp.html">CLIVAR</A> initiative of the World Climate Research Programme. 
<p>
PCMDI also will address specific questions that are important model-related elements of global change research.  These include consideration of how to
most effectively control the unrealistic climate drift that is typical of
coupled systems, and how simulated natural variability may be used in the study
of  climate predictability and the detection of climate change on global and
regional scales. 
<p>
This research, supported by a climate modeling infrastructure, will provide the basis for the systematic application and improvement of models and for the comprehensive evaluation of their ability to characterize future climate changes as a result of anthropogenic activities.

<CENTER><H2>ARM/CHAMMP/PCMDI Workshop</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<P><BR>
A Workshop on Improving the Representation and Diagnosis of Solar Radiative Heating in Climate Models was held 6-7 May 1996 in Sequim, Washington.  The Workshop was cosponsored by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program, the Computer Hardware, Advanced Mathematics, and Model Physics (CHAMMP) Program,  and <A HREF="../PCMDI.html">PCMDI</A> on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Science Division.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>Workshop Purpose</H3></CENTER>
<P>
For some 30 models participating in the DOE-sponsored Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (<A HREF="../amiphome.html">AMIP</A>), the simulated net
cloud radiative forcing exhibits systematic errors.  In a large subset of the models, these discrepancies occur principally in the shortwave component of cloud forcing.  The sources of these errors include imperfections in  modeling of cloud amount and optical properties,  as well as in the modeling of shortwave radiative transfer in general.
<P>
Because these errors are large enough to have a significant impact on climate simulation, the DOE is sponsoring the ARM Enhanced Shortwave Experiment (ARESE) and called this Workshop in order to:

<UL>
<LI>promote discussion between the modeling, diagnostic, and observational
components of DOE's Global Change Program;
<P>
<LI>present the current state of climate models and discuss their relevant
systematic errors;
<P>
<LI>inform participants of the ARM Program's measurements of shortwave radiation at the surface, including why a variety of
measurements have been and will be made;
<P>
<LI> discuss which measurements can be used to develop
parameterizations for radiative transfer calculations, and
how to use them;
<P>
<LI>discuss early results from ARESE which is collecting unique data for the examination of radiative fluxes in clear and cloudy atmospheres.

PCMDI staff members devote a significant share of their time to the development of climate modeling infrastructure, by which we mean the collection of methods and tools for the diagnosis, validation and intercomparison of global climate models.  Examples include ongoing construction of <A HREF="documentation.html">documentation</A>, <A HREF="validation.html">validation data and analysis tools</A>, and <A HREF="PCMDIsoftware.html">software products</A> designed specifically for global climate modeling and analysis.

<h1>Model Validation</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Because validation is central to the diagnosis and intercomparison of global climate models, PCMDI is developing observational data products as an essential element of a <A HREF="infrastr.html">climate modeling infrastructure</A>.  
<P>
Our current priority is to accumulate observational data (including reanalyses) from the AMIP period of 1979-1988, but a longer-term goal is to acquire quality datasets that are generally useful for climate model validation. In the future, we plan to disseminate much of our validation data over the World Wide Web.
<P>
Statistical and dynamical analysis tools for the systematic  and comprehensive validation of global climate models are also under development at PCMDI. It is intended that these diagnostics will eventually be integrated into a single software library and disseminated to the <A HREF="climategrps.html">world climate community</A>.

<h1>Model Resolution Studies</h1>
<hr>
<p>
PCMDI has investigated the multifaceted effects of increasing horizontal resolution (from spectral T21 to T42, T63, and T106) on 15-month climate simulations made with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) cycle 33 atmospheric model.  This analysis included studies of the resolution-dependence of the simulation of atmospheric dynamics (Boyle 1992, 1993) and moist processes (Phillips et al. 1993, 1995), of ocean surface heat fluxes (Gleckler and Taylor 1992, 1993), of cloud-radiative forcing (Potter 1995), and of the Asian summer monsoon (Sperber et al. 1993, 1994).  
<p>
A general conclusion of these studies was that, although increasing horizontal resolution may improve the simulation of regional climate (e.g., the Asian monsoon), it does not comprehensively enhance the simulation of large-scale climate.  In fact, model biases can be exacerbated as resolution increases, in the absence of attendant changes in the physical parameterizations.
<p>
PCMDI also has investigated the effects of increasing horizontal resolution (from a grid spacing of 4x4-degrees latitude/longitude to 2x2-, 1x1-, and 0.5x0.5-degrees) on 10-year integrations of the Semtner-Chervin global ocean model (Covey 1992, 1994).  In general, the simulated ocean climate improved with resolution, with diminishing returns evidenced at resolutions finer than 2x2-degrees.  The equator-pole heat transport at even the finest resolutions was substantially below observational estimates, however.
<p>
In addition, PCMDI has examined the effects of <em>temporal</em> resolution (i.e., the frequency of sampling/storing model variables) in a simulation of perpetual-July climate made with the ECMWF cycle 33 model at T42 horizontal resolution (Phillips et al. 1992a,b).  It was found that the time-mean statistics of <em>surface</em> climate are better estimated by sampling at time intervals that are nonintegral divisors of a 24-hour day (e.g., at 7-hour rather than 6-hour intervals) because aliasing of the diurnal cycle is thereby reduced.  However, in following such a sampling strategy, care must be taken to avoid biasing the estimates of the variances of the daily-mean surface climate.

<h1>Principal-Component Statistical Studies</h1>
<hr>
<p>
PCMDI has conducted exploratory studies of the potential usefulness of
various linear and nonlinear statistical methods for model/model and 
model/data intercomparisons. 
<P>
Sengupta and Boyle (1993) applied the technique of common principal 
components (CPCs) to identify similar modes among vertically averaged 
atmospheric temperature fields as observed by the Microwave Sounding 
Unit (MSU) on satellites, as simulated by the ECMWF global atmospheric
model, and as represented by ECMWF analyses (a combination of data and 
model). They concluded that the use of CPC is a potentially promising 
approach for rigorously identifying model/data and model/model 
similarities, especially when the analysis is restricted to regions 
(e.g., the equatorial Pacific) where a dominant mode of variability 
(e.g. the ENSO) is likely to occur.  
<p>
Sengupta and Boyle (1995) considered the relative merits of applying
nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) based on auto-associative 
neural networks vs the more traditional linear analysis (PCA) to identify 
the dominant modes of precipitation variability over the U.S.  They found 
that NLPCA effected somewhat greater data reduction and that the leading 
nonlinear mode captured the seasonal cycle of precipitation more clearly 
than the leading linear mode.  They concluded that use of NLPCA should be 
considered especially when linear PCA fails to uncover physically 
meaningful patterns in climatological data analysis.

<h1>Climate Change Detection Studies</h1>
<hr>
<p>
PCMDI is conducting research on detection of signals associated with putative externally-forced climate changes.  These include investigations of appropriate statistical techniques for signal detection (Santer et al. 1991, 1993b, 1995a), as well as  general reviews of the problem of detecting anthropogenic climate change (Santer 1994, Santer et al. 1993a).  
<P>
Santer et al. (1993b, 1994, 1995a,b) apply signal detection techniques to coupled ocean-atmosphere model simulations of transient forcing by greenhouse gases and by sulfate aerosols.  Santer et al. (1995c) consider observed changes in atmospheric vertical thermal structure and its possible associations with secular changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and stratospheric ozone.

<h1>Ensemble Integration Studies</h1>
<hr>
<p>
PCMDI scientists are studying natural climate variability, as inferred from <a href=../phillips/amipruns.html> ECMWF model realizations</a> of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (<a href=../amiphome.html>AMIP</a>) experiment with different initial conditions.
<p>
Thus far, these efforts principally include: monsoon predictability studies in cooperation with the Monsoon Numerical Experimentation Group (Sperber and Palmer 1994a,b); an elaboration of ensemble techniques for seasonal prediction (Palmer et al. 1995) in the context of the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (<a href=" http://www.atmos.washington.edu/togacoare/summaries.html">TOGA</a>) program; and investigations of the chaotic behavior/predictability of land-surface processes (Phillips and Santer 1995a,b,c) motivated by the Project for Intercomparison of Landsurface Parameterization Schemes (<a href="http://cic.mq.edu.au/pilps-rice">PILPS</a>). 
<p>
Ensemble integrations are also being utilized for the testing of the practical significance (as opposed to the purely statistical significance) of differences between <a href="AMIPgroups.html"> AMIP model</a> simulations and observational data (Santer et al. 1995).

Description:          ECMWF T42L19 AMIP 10 Year Simulation ( 1979-1988 ).
                      This is the original ECMWF AMIP simulation run with the
                      cycle 36 version of the model.

Initial conditions:   ECMWF analysis of January 15 1979 00 GMT

Simulation t=0:       January 1, 1979 00 GMT

Boundary conditions:  Sea Surface Temperatures and sea-ice distribution are
                      from the official AMIP ten year dataset of monthly means.
                      Other boundary conditions specifying albedo, surface 
                      roughness, vegetation type, etc are from the ECMWF
                      climatology.

Output intervals:     Radiative fluxes are available every three hours.
                      History of state is output every six hours
                      Accumulated history is output once daily.

Peculiarities:        No runoff output.  Three dimensional cloudiness could not
                      be recovered from the history of state.  Some errors
                      present in setting sea-ice near sea-ice boundaries after
                      year one of the integration.

                      year monthly means for each month are averaged to produce
                      a one year climatology of values which are then used

                      In the special case of this experiment, each of the ten
                      year monthly means for each month are averaged to produce
                      a one year climatology of values which are then used
                      to prescribe sea surface temperature and sea-ice
                      distribution for ten consecutive seasonal cycles.
                      Other boundary conditions specifying albedo, surface
                      roughness, vegetation type, etc are from the ECMWF
                      climatology.

Output intervals:     Radiative fluxes are available every three hours.
                      History of state is output every six hours
                      Accumulated history is output every six hours.

<h3><a name="RP1">Report 1:&nbsp&nbsp  The Validation of Atmospheric Models</a></h3>

<h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp  W. Lawrence Gates</h4><hr>

<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
The validation of atmospheric models is a key part of the modelling enterprise, but one to which increased attention needs to be given if systematic progress is to be made in the development of predictive climate models.  The validation of current AGCMs in terms of the mean seasonal distribution of primary variables such as pressure, temperature, and wind shows a reasonable ability to simulate the observed large-scale features, while at the same time identifying a number of systematic errors.  More recent validations have included the simulation of variability, which reveals a modest level of skill but with further systematic errors.  Recent results from mesoscale models nested within AGCMs, however, have shown substantial skill in the simulation of regional climate.  In addition to conventional data sources of various resolutions, current model validation is enriched by the use of satellite observations and other special data sets, as well as by the analyses from operational models.
<p>
A comprehensive atmospheric model validation program includes examination of not only the mean and variance, but of the complete frequency distribution. Moreover, in addition to the primary dynamical and physical variables, the various derived quantities associated with fluxes and processes and the occurrence of specific events should also be evaluated.  A complete validation would also include evaluation of a model's ability to simulate more than just the present climate and/or its ability to simulate observed climate change (the latter aspect necessarily including the oceans).  This effort will require the acquisition, calibration and processing of global observational data sets specifically for the purpose of model validation.  Useful approaches toward such a program include the reanalysis of recent decades with modern AGCMs and advanced data assimilation systems, and the extension of the various atmospheric model intercomparison projects now underway to include a wider variety of diagnostics.

<h3><a name="RP2">Report 2:   &nbsp&nbsp  Analysis of the Temporal Behavior of Tropical Convection in the ECMWF Model</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Julia M. Slingo, Kenneth R. Sperber, Jean-Jacques Morcrette and Gerald L. Potter</h4><hr>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>

Extended (180-day) high resolution (T106) perpetual January and July integrations of the ECMWF model have been analyzed in terms of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the model's convective activity in the tropics.  The model's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is used as a surrogate for convective activity, consistent with similar studies based on satellite observations.  The 3-hourly temporal sampling is sufficient to allow diagnosis of intra- and interdiurnal variability; the length of the integrations is adequate for identifying lower frequency intraseasonal phenomena.  Wherever possible, use is made of the results from surface or satellite observations of the temporal characteristics of convection to verify the model results.
<p>
At intradiurnal time scales, the model captures the amplitude and phase of the diurnal harmonic over both land and sea.  The largest amplitudes occur over the summer continents, with contrasting phases of maximum OLR depending on the presence of convective activity.  Over the oceans, the model show a coherent structure to the diurnal cycle associated with regions of convection.
<p>
Analysis of synoptic (2 to 10 days) and low frequency (greater than 10 days) variability shows that in many instances the model agrees well with observations.  For both seasons, the model simulates westward moving phenomena over the oceans whose phase speed is reasonable.  In July, these easterly waves display well-defined periodicities in agreement with observations, whilst in January they are more episodic.  Low frequency variability is more prevalent in January, particularly over the convectively active regions of the eastern hemisphere.  In general, this variability has a larger spatial scale than synoptic variability; its periodicities, some in excess of 30 days, are typical of intraseasonal time scales.

<h3><a name="RP3">Report 3: &nbsp&nbsp  The Effect of Horizontal Resolution on Ocean Surface Heat Fluxes in the ECMWF Model</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp  Peter J. Gleckler and Karl E. Taylor</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
Annual mean ocean surface energy fluxes have been studied as a function of horizontal resolution in the ECMWF model (cycle 33) and compared with Oberhuber's COADS (1959-1979) based empirical estimates. The model has been run at resolutions of T21, T42, T63 and T106 for 15 months with prescribed monthly varying climatological SST and sea ice. The T42 simulation was extended to 2 years, which enabled us to determine that many differences between the resolution runs were significant and could not be explained by the fact that individual realizations of an ensemble of years can be expected to give different estimates of the annual mean climate state. In addition to systematic differences between the modeled and the observed fluxes, the simulated fields of surface shortwave and longwave radiation showed much more spatial variability than the observed estimates. This may be attributable more to deficiencies in the observations than to errors in the model. The modeled latent and sensible heat fields were in better agreement with observations. 
<p>
The primary conclusion concerning the dependence of ocean surface fluxes on resolution is that the T21 simulation differed significantly from the higher resolution runs, especially in the tropics. Although the differences among the three higher resolution simulations were generally small over most of the world ocean, there were local areas with large differences. It appears, therefore, that in relation to ocean surface heat fluxes, a resolution greater than T42 may not be justified for climate model simulations, although the locally large differences found between the higher resolution runs suggest that convergence has not been achieved even at T106.<p>

<h3><a name="RP4">Report 4:  &nbsp&nbsp  Behavior of an Ocean General Circulation Model at Four Different Horizontal Resolutions</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp  Curt Covey</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
A global ocean general circulation model is used to simulate the present-day ocean climate using four different latitude/longitude grid spacings. Horizontal resolution varies from l/2&#176  x  l/2&#176--the highest attained to date in an ocean circulation model with global coverage--to a coarse 4&#176 x 4&#176 grid traditionally used in climate modeling. This study addresses the question of whether resolution of smaller scale circulations is necessary in order to simulate the large scale ocean climate correctly. Results indicate that large scale circulation is rather sluggish at 4&#176 x 4&#176  resolution but surprisingly insensitive to grid spacing for resolutions finer than 2&#176 x 2&#176, even considering the constraints imposed on the model by surface boundary conditions and by "robust diagnostic" forcing near the poles and below the thermocline. Simulated transport of heat from the warm tropics to cooler higher latitudes is not overly sensitive to grid spacing for resolutions finer than 2&#176 x 2&#176;.  Furthermore, heat transport does not increase at l/2&#176 x 1/2&#176  resolution when sub-gridscale mixing of heat and momentum are altered so that mesoscale eddies appear in the model.
<p>
These results support inferences from earlier studies(based on simplified, limited-domain circulation models) that mesoscale eddies make little net contribution to poleward heat transport by the oceans. They suggest that for global climate modeling, the substantial computer resources required to explicitly resolve ocean mesoscale eddies might be better spent on improving simulations of other components of the climate system. Making this conclusion definite, however, requires a global ocean simulation that is fully eddy-resolving and that relaxes the artificial constraints of the present simulation, which tend to force the results toward present ocean climatology.

<h3><a name="RP5">Report 5:&nbsp&nbsp   The Effects of Sampling Frequency on the Climate Statistics of the ECMWF General Circulation Model</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Thomas J. Phillips, W. Lawrence Gates and Klaus Arpe</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
The effects of sampling frequency on the first- and second-moment statistics of selected ECMWF model variables are investigated in a simulation of "perpetual July" with a diurnal cycle included and with surface and atmospheric fields saved at hourly intervals.  The shortest characteristic time scales (as determined by the e-folding time of lagged autocorrelation functions) are those of ground heat fluxes and temperatures, precipitation and run-off, convective processes, cloud poperties, and atmospheric vertical motion, while the longest time scales are exhibited by soil temperature and moisture, surface pressure, and atmospheric specific humidity, temparature and wind.  The time scales of surface heat and momentum fluxes and of convective processes are substantially shorter over land than over the oceans.
<p>
An appropriate sampling frequency for each model variable is obtained by comparing the estimates of first- and second-moment climate statistics determined at intervals ranging from 2 to 24 hours with the "best" estimates obtained from hourly sampling.  Relatively accurate estimation of first- and second-moment climate statistics (10 percent errors in means, 20 percent errors in variances) can be achieved by sampling a model variable at intervals that usually are longer than the bandwidth of its time series, but that often are shorter than its characteristic time scale.  
<p>
For the surface variables, sampling at intervals that are non-integral divisors of a 24-hour day yields relatively more accurate time-mean statistics because of a reduction in errors accociated with aliasing of the diurnal cycle and higher-frequency harmonics.  The superior estimates of first-moment statistics are accompanied by inferior estimates of the variance of the daily means due to the presence of sytematic biases, but these probably can be avoided by defining a different measure of low-frequency variability.  Estimates of the intradiurnal variance of accumulated precipitation and surface run-off also are strongly impacted by the length of the storage interval.  In light of these results, some alternative strategies for storage of the EMWF model variables are recommended.

<h3><a name="RP6">Report 6: &nbsp&nbsp Sensitivity of Dynamical Quantities to Horizontal Resolution in a Climate Simulation with the ECMWF Atmospheric General Circulation Model (Cycle 33)</a></h3>
<p>
<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
The ECMWF model (cycle 33) was integrated for a full seasonal cycle at the four horizontal resolutions T21, T42, T63 and T106.  Within the limits imposed by the varying horizontal resolution, all other aspects of the model were identical for each integration.  In this paper a comparison is made of the dynamical aspects of the simulations.  Fields of zonally averaged zonal wind, eddy heat and momentum fluxes, global divergent wind and vorticity, and stationary wave patterns are presented and compared for each resolution.
<p>
The conclusions reached by this study are:  (1) T21 is qualitatively different from the highter resolutions; (2) the highest resolution does not provide a simulation which is egregiously superior to T42 and there are aspects of the T21 simulation, especially in tropical convection, which are clearly better than those of the higher resolutions; (3) aside from differences in smaller scale boundary forcing at the higher resolutions, the T42, T63, and T106 simulations are nearly identical in the dynamical aspects of the circulation considered here; (5) increasing horizontal resolution alone will evidently not result in an overall superior simulation unless other aspects of the model are modified <i>pari passu</i>.

<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp  W. Lawrence Gates</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) is an international effort to determine the systematic climate errors of atmospheric models under realistic conditions, and calls for the simulation of the climate of the decade 1979-1988 using the observed monthly-averaged distributions of sea-surface temperature and sea ice as boundary conditions.  Organized by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) as a contribution to the World Climate Research Programme, AMIP involves the international atmospheric modeling community in a major test and intercomparison of model performance; in addition to an agreed-to set of monthly-averaged output variables, each of the participating models will generate a daily history of state.  These data will be stored and made available in standard format by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Following completion of the computational phase of AMIP in 1993, emphasis will shift to a series of diagnostic subprojects, now being planned, for the detailed examination of model performance and the simulation of specific physical processes and phenomena.  AMIP offers an unprecedented opportunity for the comprehensive evaluation and validation of current atmospheric models, and is expected to provide valuable information for model improvement. <A HREF="../phillips/pubs/PCMDIrept7/AMIPexp.html">Hypertext</A>

<h3><a name="RP8">Report 8:   &nbsp&nbsp  The Impact of Horizontal Resolution on Moist Processes in the ECMWF Model</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Thomas J. Phillips, Lisa C. Corsetti and Stanley L. Grotch </h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
Summer and winter climates simulated at spectral scales T21, T42, T63 and T106 with the ECMWF (cycle 33) model are analyzed to determine the impact of changes in horizontal resolution (in the absence of changes in model physics) on atmospheric water vapor, clouds, convection, and precipitation.  Qualitative changes in many moist processes occur in the transition from spectral T21 to T42, especially in the tropics where atmospheric convection plays a central role; subsequent resolution increases mostly result in an intensification of patterns established at T42.
<p> 
However, the seasonal climate simulations do not show evidence of "convergence" to an asymptotic climate state at high resolution.  Global convective precipitation increases monotonically with resolution, but frontal precipitation, precipitable water, and cloud cover display a qualitatively different pattern: after undergoing abrupt reductions in the transition from T21 to T42, their global averages show relative increases at finer resolutions.  Precipitable water and cloud cover also display a seasonal asymmetry in their responses to increasing resolution.  The comparative insensitivity of global cloud cover to resolution is mainly a consequence of compensating tendencies of clouds in different regions.  With increasing resolution, decreases in low-latitude clouds that result from drying of the tropical atmosphere are partially offset by increases in high-latitude clouds associated with enhanced relative humidity in response to an intensifying extratropical cold bias.
<p>
The large-scale tropical moist processes are modeled more realistically at T21 than in the finer-resolution simulations, wherein anomalous seasonal climatic features such as a double ITCZ and underdeveloped summer monsoon circulation are evident.  Although some of these anomalies might ameliorate if the physical parameterizations were suitably "tuned," these deficiencies may reflect more fundamental problems related to a mismatch between the resolution of the model and the implicit spatial and temporal scales of the parameterizations.

<a name="RP9"><h3>Report 9:  &nbsp&nbsp A Modeling Perspective on Cloud Radiative Forcing</h3></a>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Gerald L. Potter, Julia M. Slingo, Jean-Jacques Morcrette and Lisa Corsetti</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>

Radiation fields from a perpetual July integration of a T106 version of the ECMWF operational model are used to identify the most appropriate way to diagnose cloud radiative forcing in a general circulation model, for the purposes of intercomparison between models.  Differences between the Methods I and II of Cess and Potter (1987) and a variant method are addressed.  Method I is shown to be the least robust of all methods, due to the potential uncertainties related to persistent cloudiness, length of the sampling period and biases in retrieved clear-sky quantities due to insufficient sampling of the diurnal cycle.
<p>
Method II is proposed as an unambigtuous way to produce consistent radiative diagnostics for intercomparing model results.  The impact of the three methods on the derived sensitivities and cloud feedbacks following an imposed change in sea surface temperature is discussed.  The sensitivity of the results to horizontal resolution is considered by using the diagnostics from parallel integrations with a T21 version of the model.<hr>

<h3><a name="RP10">Report 10:  &nbsp&nbsp  The Use of General Circulation Models in Detecting Climate Change Induced by Greenhouse Gases</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbspBenjamin D. Santer, Ulrich Cubasch, Uwe Mikolajeqicz and Gabi Hegerl</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
This article reviews some problems associated with the use of coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs) in studies which attempt to detect a greenhouse-gas-induced signal in observed climate records.  We show that model uncertainties affect both our predictions of how climate might change in response to greenhouse-gas (GHG) changes, and our estimates of the decadal- to century-time scale natural variability properties of the climate system.  Knowledge of the latter are essential in order to make meaningful statements about when and even whether we could expect to detect a greenhouse-gas signal.
<p>
We show that GHG signal uncertainties are associated with errors in simulating the current climate in uncoupled and coupled climate models, the possible omission of relevant feedbacks, the non-uniqueness of the signal (due to the twin problems of the model's internally-generated natural variability and its sensitivity to initial conditions), uncertainties regarding the future GHG forcing and atmospheric GHG concentrations, and the so-called "cold start" error.  Results from recent time-dependent greenhouse warming experiments are used to illustrate some of these points.  We then discuss how energy-balance models, stochastically-forced ocean GCMs, and fully-coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs have been used to derive estimates of decadal- to century-time scale natural variability, and consider some of the uncertainties associated with these estimates.
<p>
This review illustrates that it will be necessary to reduce both model signal and model natural variability uncertainties in order to detect a climate change signal and attribute this convincingly to change in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

<h3><a name="RP11">Report 11:   &nbsp&nbsp  Preliminary Validation of the Low Frequency Variability of Tropospheric Temperature and Circulation Simulated for the AMIP by the ECMWF Model</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbspJames S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
The ECMWF global model (cycle 36) is used to simulate the climate from 1979 to 1988.  This integration is in support of the WGNE Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP).  The model uses the observed monthly sea surface temperature for the ten year period during the integration.  Anomaly correlation and RMS calculations are carried out between monthly mean observed circulation (ECMWF analyses and MSU channel 2 temperatures) and the model results, although the use of monthly mean data restricts the conclusions to the low frequency variability.  The variables and regions considered are the 500 hPa geopotential and MSU temperatures for the Northern Hemisphere (30N to 70N), the 200 hPa zonal wind and MSU temperataures for the equatorial belt (15S to 15N), and the 1000 hPa zonal wind for the equatorial Pacific (15N to 15S and 120E to 100W).
<p>
The results show:(1) For the midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential there is a signal in the model results for the ENSO events of 1982/83 and 1986/87; (2) the model underestimates the midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential interannual variability as measured by the RMS but overestimates the MSU temperature variability in this region; (3) in general, outside of the ENSO periods, there is little correlation between the model and observed data anomalies of midlatitude 500 hPa geopotential; (4) in the tropics the variables evince a stronger correlation with observations in the interannual variation; (5) in the tropics the model underestimates the variability of the 200 hPa wind and MSU temperature; (6) the model, although non-interacting with the ocean, produces a credible simulation of the low frequency variability of the equatorial Pacific low level zonal wind.

<h3><a name="RP12">Report 12:  &nbsp&nbsp  Simulation of the Indian and East-Asian Summer Monsoon in the ECMWF Model:  Sensitivity to Horizontal Resolution</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Kenneth R. Sperber, Sultan Hameed, Gerald L. Potter and James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center><p>
The ability of the ECMWF model (cycle 33) to simulate the Indian and East Asian summer monsoon is evaluated at four different horizontal resolutions:  T21, T42, T63, and T106.  Generally, with respect to the large scale features of the circulation, the largest differences among the simulations occur at T42 relative to T21.  However, on regional scales, important differences among the high frequency temporal variability serve as a further critical test of the model's ability to simulate the monsoon.  More generally, the results indicate the importance of evaluating high frequency time scales as a component of the climate sytem.
<p>
T106 best captures both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Indian and East Asian Monsoon, while T42 fails to correctly simulate the sequence and development of synoptic scale milestones that characterize the monsoon flow.  In particular, T106 is superior at simulating the development and migration of the monsoon trough over the Bay of Bengal.  In the T42 simulation, the development of the monsoon occurs one month earlier than typically observed.  At this time the trough is incorrectly located adjacent to the east coast of India which results in an underestimate of precipitation over the Burma/Thailand region.  This early establishment of the monsoon trough affects the evolution of the East-Asian monsoon and yields excessive preseason rainfall over the Mei-yu region.  EOF analysis of precipitation over China indicates that T106 best simulates the Mei-yu mode of variability associated with an oscillation of the rainband that gives rise to periods of enhanced rainfall over the Yangtze River Valley.  The coarse resolution of T21  precludes simulation of the aforementioned regional scale monsoon flows.

<h3><a name="RP13">Report 13:   &nbsp&nbsp  Statistical Intercomparison of Global Climate Models:  A Common Principal Component Approach</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Sailes K. Sengupta and James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
Variables describing atmospheric circulation and other climate parameters derived from various GCMs and obtained from observations can be represented on a spatio-temporal grid (lattice) structure.  The primary objective of this paper is to explore existing as well as new statistical methods to analyze such data structures for the purpose of model diagnostics and intercomparison from a statistical perspective.  Among the several statistical methods considered here, a new method based on common principal components appears most promising for the purpose of intercomparison of spatio-temporal data structures arising in the task of model/model and model/data intercomparison.  A strategy for such an intercomparison is outlined in two steps:  first, the commonality of spatial structures in two (or more) fields is captured in the common principal vectors, and second, the corresponding principal components obtained as time series are then compared on the basis of similarities in their temporal evolution.

<p>
Recent investigations have considered whether it is possible to achieve early detection of greenhouse-gas-induced climate change by observing changes in ocean variables.  In this study, we use model data to assess some of the uncertainties involved in estimating when we could expect to detect ocean greenhouse warming signals.  We distinguish between detection periods and detection times.  As defined here, detection period is the length of a climate time series which must be available in order to detect a given linear trend in the presence of the natural climate variability.  Detection period is defined in model years and is independent of reference time and the real time evolution of the signal.  Detection time is computed for an actual time-evolving signal from a greenhouse warming experiment and depends on the experiment's start date.
<p>
Two sources of uncertainty are considered--those associated with the level of natural variability or noise, and those associated with the time-evolving signals.  We analyse the ocean signal and noise for spatially-averaged ocean circulation indices such as ice volume, heat and fresh water fluxes, rate of deep water formation, salinity, temperature, and transport of mass.  The signals for these quantities are taken from recent time-dependent greenhouse warming experiments performed by the Hamburg group with a coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model.  The time-dependent greenhouse gas increase in these experiments was specified in accordance with Scenario A of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  The natural variability noise is derived from a 300-year control run performed with the same coupled atmosphere-ocean model and from two long (>3,000 year) stochastic forcing experiments in which an uncoupled ocean model was forced by white-noise surface flux variations.  In the first experiment the stochastic forcing was restricted to the fresh water fluxes, while in the second experiment the ocean model was additionally forced by variations in wind stress and heat fluxes.  The mean states and ocean variability are very different in the three natural variability integrations.
<p>
A suite of greenhouse warming simulations with identical forcing but different initial conditions reveals that the signal estimated from these experiments may evolve in noticeably different ways for some ocean variables depending on the initial state.  The combined signal and noice uncertainties translate into large uncertainties in estimates of detection time.  Nevertheless, we find that ocean variables which are highly sensitive indicators of surface conditions, such as convective overturning in the North Atlantic, have shorter signal detection times (35-65 years) than deep-ocean indicators (>=100 years). 
<p>
We investigate also whether the use of multivariate detection vector increases the probability of early detection.  We find that this can yield 
detection times of 35-60 years (relative to a 1985 reference date) if signal and noise are projected onto a common "guess pattern" which describes the expected signal direction.  Optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio by (spatial) rotation in the direction of low noise components of the stochastic forcing experiments yields a further reduction in detection time (to 10-45 years).  However, rotation in space alone does not guarantee an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio for a time-dependent signal.  This requires an `optimal fingerprint' strategy in which the detection pattern (fingerprint) is rotated in both space and time.

This paper reports on energy fluxes across the surface of the ocean as simulated by fifteen atmospheric general circulation models in which ocean surface temperatures and sea-ice boundaries are prescribed.  The oceanic meridional energy transport that would be required to balance these surface fluxes is computed, and is shown to be critically sensitive to the radiative effects of clouds, to the extent that even the sign of the Southern Hemisphere ocean energy transport can be affected by the errors in simulated cloud-radiation interactions.

<p>
Three-dimensional climate models generate a large volume of time history data in the form of multidimensional arrays.  Repeated postprocessing of these data is required to produce the relevant statistics needed for comparison with other model histories and observational data.  Networks and desktop graphics workstations have made it possible to use remote supercomputers to perform climate simulations and postprocess their time history data, and then subsequently use local workstations to analyze, compare, and view the results.  New software tools and methods are required to take advantage of these technological advances.
<p>
In climate research, it is common to extract two-dimensional, horizontal grids from datasets for analysis and display.  In addition, it has become increasingly common to extract and visualize other two-dimensional cross-sections, as well as three- and four-dimensional fields, from large datasets.  The ability to quickly animate images of such data is providing a new perspective for understanding climate models.
<p>
This document describes the Data Retrieval and Storage (DRS) software library, Version 2.8, which defines a data format and access methods suitable for the data generated and used in climate model research.  It is oriented toward use (1) with models generating very large datasets on supercomputers, and (2) with graphics workstations used for analysis and display of smaller subsets of data.  This software is used extensively by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for the storage, postprocessing, analysis, and display of atmospheric model and observational data, and is available to collaborators in the climate modeling and diagnostic communities upon request.

This software was developed by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California.  It was designed to provide some of the basic capabilities needed for validating, comparing, and diagnosing climate model behavior.  It can be controlled either interactively, or from a script file, or control can alternate between these modes during a session.  A script can be saved during an interactive session and merely replayed, or it can be edited and replayed.  The state-of-the-system can be dumped as a script at any instant, and that script can be used later to restore that instant of the session.

A graphic display page is made up of one or more graphic pictures.  Each picture is defined by a picture template, a graphic method, and data.  These three elements are termed the "primary elements" in this application.  The picture template defines where to display; the graphic method defines how to display; and the data defines what to display.  Tables of attribute sets have been created for each of the primary elements, and the application provides the user with the capability for creating a picture by choosing entries from these tables.  Once a picture is created, it can be manipulated by changing the choice of primary elements or by altering them.  This application also includes tables of basic elements that describe text, lines, markers, fill areas, patterns, colormaps, and lists.  These basic elements are used to assign some of the attributes to the primary elements.  This fact allows a picture to be manipulated by choosing different basic elements or by directly altering these basic elements.
<p>
Attributes for data can describe variables existing in a file or variables to be computed as a function of previously selected variables.  The dimensions of variables can be subselected, reversed, transposed, wrapped, and thinned by selecting either a stride of nodes or by randomly selectring individual nodes.  Grid transformations are supported by allowing a different set of dimension vectors to be specified in the dimension descriptors.  A display page can be output as either Adobe PostScript for hardcopy, or as a raster image for hardcopy or animation.

<h3><a name="RP19">Report 19:   &nbsp&nbsp Global Ocean Circulation and Equator-Pole Heat Transport as a Function of Ocean GCM Resolution</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp  Curt Covey</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
To determine whether resolution of smaller scales is necessary to simulate large-scale ocean climate correctly, I examine results from a global ocean GCM run with horizontal grid spacings.  The horizontal grid spacings span a range from coarse resolutions traditionally used in climate modeling to nearly the highest resolution attained with today's computers.  This work represents an extension (to lower resolutions) of earlier studies by Semtner and Chervin.  The experiments include four cases employing 4&#176;, 2&#176;, 1&#176; and 1/2&#176; spacing in latitude and longitude, which were run with minimal differences among them, i.e., in a controlled experiment.  Two additional cases&#173; 1/2&#176; spacing with a more scale-selective sub-gridscale mixing of heat and momentum, and approximate 1/4&#176; spacingare also included.  The 1/4&#176; run resolves most of the observed mesoscale eddy energy in the ocean.
<p>
Several artificial constraints on the model tend to minimize differences among the different resolution cases.  Nevertheless, for quantities of interest to global climate studies the simulations show significant changes as resolution increases.  These changes generally but not always bring the model into better agreement with observations.  Differences are typically more noticeable when comparing the 4&#176; and 2&#176; runs than when comparing the 2&#176; and 1&#176; runs or the 1&#176; and 1/2&#176; runs.  A reasonable conclusion to draw for current studies with coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs is that the ocean grid spacing could be set to about 1&#176; to accrue the benefits of enhanced resolution without paying an excessively steep price in computer-time cost.
<p>
The model's poleward heat transport at 1/2&#176; grid spacing peaks at about 1 x 10&#94;15 W in the Northern Hemisphere and 0.5 x 10&#94;15 W in the Southern Hemisphere.  These values are significantly below observations, a problem typical of ocean GCMs even when they are less constrained than in the present study (e.g., when they are coupled to an interactive atmosphere).  This problem is alleviated somewhat in the 1/4&#176; run.  In this case, however, the eddies resolved by the model generally act to counter rather than to reinforce the heat transport of the mean flow.  Improved heat transport may result less from enhanced resolution than from other changes made in this version of the model, such as more accurate wind forcing.

<h3><a name="RP20">Report 20:  &nbsp&nbsp The Northern Wintertime Divergence Extrema at 200 hPa and Surface Cyclones as Simulated in the AMIP Integration of the ECMWF General Circulation Model</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbspJames S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center> 
<p>
Divergence and convergence centers at 200 hPa and mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) cyclones were located every 6 hr for a 10-yr general circulation model (GCM) simulation with the ECMWF (Cycle 36) for the boreal winters from 1980 to 1988.  The simulation used the observed monthly mean sea surface temperature (SST) for the decade.  Analysis of the frequency, location, and strength of these centers and cyclones gives insight into the dynamical response of the model to the varying SST.
<p>
The results indicate that (1) the model produces reasonable climatologies of upper-level divergence and MSLP cyclones; (2) the model distribution of anomalies of divergence and convergence centers and MSLP cyclones is consistent with observations for the 1982-83 and 1986-87 El Ni&#241;o events; (3) the tropical Indian Ocean is the region of greatest divergence activity and interannual variability in the model; (4) the variability of the divergence centers is greater than that of the convergence centers; (5) strong divergence centers occur chiefly over the ocean in the midlatitudes but are more land-based in the tropics, except in the Indian Ocean; and (6) locations of divergence and convergence centers can be a useful tool for the intercomparison of global atmospheric simulations.

<h3><a name="RP21">Report 21:   &nbsp&nbspTowards the Detection and Attribution of an Anthropogenic Effect on Climate</a></h3>

<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>

It has been hypothesized recently that regional-scale cooling caused by
anthropogenic sulfate aerosols may be partially obscuring a warming signal
associated with changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Here we use results from model experiments in which sulfate and carbon dioxide have been varied individually and in combination in order to test this hypothesis.

We use centered <i>[R(t)]</i> and uncentered <i>[C(t)]</i> pattern similarity statistics to compare observed time-evolving surface temperature change patterns with
the model-predicted equilibrium signal patterns.
We show that in most cases, the <i>C(t)</i> statistic reduces to a measure
of observed global-mean temperature changes, and is of limited use
in attributing observed climate changes to a specific causal mechanism.
We therefore focus on <i>[R(t)]</i>, which is a more useful statistic for 
discriminating between forcing mechanisms with different pattern 
signatures but similar rates of global mean change.
<p>
Our results indicate that over the last 50 years, the summer (JJA) and 
fall (SON) observed patterns of near-surface temperature change show 
increasing similarity to the model-simulated response to combined sulfate
aerosol/carbon dioxide forcing. At least some of this increasing
spatial congruence occurs in areas where the real world has cooled.

To assess the significance of the most recent trends in <i>R(t)</i> and <i>C(t)</i>,
we use data from multi-century control integrations performed with two different
coupled atmosphere-ocean models, which provide information on the statistical behavior of `unforced' trends in the pattern correlation statistics.
For the combined sulfate aerosol/carbon dioxide experiment,
the 50-year <i>R(t)</i> trends for the JJA and SON
signals are highly significant. Results are
robust in that they do not depend on the choice of control
run used to estimate natural variability noise properties.
The <i>R(t)</i> trends for the carbon dioxide-only signal are not significant in any
season. <i>C(t)</i> trends for signals from both the carbon dioxide-only
and combined forcing experiments are highly significant in all
seasons and for all trend lengths (except for trends over the
last 10 years), indicating large global-mean changes relative
to the two natural variability estimates used here.
<p>
The caveats regarding the signals and natural variability noise
which form the basis of this study are numerous. Nevertheless, we
have provided first evidence that both the largest-scale (global-mean)
and smaller-scale (spatial anomalies about the global mean) components
of a combined carbon dioxide/anthropogenic sulfate aerosol signal
are identifiable in the observed near-surface air temperature
data. If the coupled-model noise estimates used here are
realistic, we can be highly confident that the
anthropogenic signal that we have identified is distinctly
different from internally-generated
natural variability noise. The fact that we have been able to
detect the detailed spatial signature in response
to combined carbon dioxide and sulfate aerosol forcing, but not in
response to carbon dioxide forcing alone,
suggests that some of the regional-scale background noise
(against which we were trying to detect a carbon dioxide-only signal) is
in fact part of the signal of a sulfate aerosol effect on climate.
The large effect of sulfate aerosols found in this
study demonstrates the importance of their inclusion
in experiments designed to simulate past and future climate change.

<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
The ECMWF general circulation model (cycle 33) was used to test the effect of horizontal resolution on the simulated cloud radiative forcing.  The model was run with four resolutions:  T21, T42, T63 and T106 and the results were compared to the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE).  The ECMWF model produces relatively large errors in comparison to observations for January and July which can be attributed to the model being too dry and clouds too reflective.  Only the T21 resolution displays substantial differences from the other resolutions, and all resolutions are substantially different from ERBE observations.

<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp  James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
The 200 hPa kinetic energy budget terms are represented by means of their spherical harmonic components for a number of AMIP simulations.  The data used are the monthly mean wind fields for 1979 to 1988 decadal simulations.  The budget terms are decomposed into the divergent and rotational components.  The comparison is limited to the lower wavenumbers so as to be within the nominal limits imposed by the models with the coarsest spatial resolution.
<p>
The results show considerable differences among the models.  The comparison is best for the rotational wind and degrades for the divergent components, especially the conversion term.  There is some ambiguity among the models as to the sign of some terms at certain wavenumbers.  The models tend to overestimate the Walker-type (east-west) divergent circulations compared to the Hadley-type (north-south), as indicated by recent NMC and ECMWF operational analyses.
<p>
The intermodel differences are substantial when viewed in light of the differences in the oservational analyses and ensemble differences for the ECMWF model.  However, the median values of all the models taken together are usually in fair agreement with observational values.
<p>
There is no obvious, systematic pattern of errors which can be consistently attributed to specifics of the individual model horizontal and vertical resolution, numerics or physical parameterizations.

<h3><a name="RP25">Report 25:  &nbsp&nbsp Estimates of Zonally Averaged Tropical Diabatic Heating in AMIP GCM Simulations</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:&nbsp&nbsp James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
The vertical distribution of zonally and seasonally averaged diabatic heating is estimated for 29 GCM AMIP decadal simulations using the thermodynamic equation.  Since only the zonally averaged, monthly means were available, the transient and stationary wave components are not included in this budget.  The exclusion of these terms limits the useful analysis to the Tropics.  The vertically averaged values from the budget computation are compared to the vertically averaged diabatic heating computed directly from the sensible heat and radiative fluxes, and precipitation.  The comparison is quite favorable in the Tropics, with the effects of the neglected heat fluxes becoming apparent at about 30 degrees poleward from the Equator.  The computations are carried out for the solstitial seasons.
<p>
Based on the median heating distribution of the 29 models we find the following:&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) The model consensus of near equatorial heating is greater in magnitude and lower (&#126;500 mb) than that computed from the ECMWF analysis by Hoskins et al. (1989).   (2) The subtropical cooling tends to be greater in magnitude and highter than the Hoskins et al. computation, although this will be affected by the terms neglected in the budget computation.  Consideration of the individual model fields show that (3) there is a large variation in the magnitude and distribution of the tropical diabatic heating amongst the models.  The magnitudes in the northern summer vary by more than a factor of two.  (4) the amount of seasonal asymmetry about the equator varies widely among the models.  For some models the heating maximum remains on the northern side of the equator for both seasons.  (5) It is evident that the interactions among the many parameterizations and model formulations obscure any systematic signature of a particular penetrative convective scheme.  Finally, given the differences in the heating distributions among the models for this zonally-averaged, seasonally-averaged ten-year data set, it is clear that there is not yet a consensus on the proper parameterization suite to simulate this essential field.

<h3><a name="RP26">Report 26:  &nbsp&nbsp  Uncertainties in Global Ocean Surface Heat Flux Climatologies Derived from Ship Observations</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbsp Peter J. Gleckler and Bryan C. Weare</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
A methodology to define uncertainties associated with ocean surface heat flux calculations has been developed and applied to a revised version of the Oberhuber (1988) global climatology, which utilizes a summary of the COADS surface observations.  Systematic and random uncertainties in the net oceanic heat flux and each of its four components at individual grid points and for zonal averages have been estimated for each calendar month and the annual mean.  
<p>
The most important uncertainties of the 2&#176 x 2&#176; grid cell values of each of the heat fluxes are described.  Annual mean net shortwave flux random uncertainties associated with errors in estimating cloud cover in the tropics yield total uncertainties which are greater than 25 W m&#94;-2.  In the northern latitudes, where the large number of observations substantially reduce the influence of these random errors, the systematic uncertainties in the utilized parameterization are largely responsible for total uncertainties in the shortwave fluxes which usually remain greater than 10 W m&#94;-2.  Systematic uncertainties dominate in the zonal means because spatial averaging has led to a further reduction of the random errors.  The situation for the annual mean latent heat flux is somewhat different in that even for grid point values the contributions of the systematic uncertainties tend to be larger than those of the random uncertainties at most all latitudes.  Latent heat flux uncertainties are greater than 20 W m&#94;-2 nearly everywhere south of 40&#176N ,  and in excess of 30 W m&#94;-2 over broad areas of the subtropics, even those with large numbers of observations.  Resulting zonal mean latent heat uncertainties are largest (&#126;30 W m&#94;-2) in the middle latitudes and subtropics and smallest (&#126;10-25 W m&#94;-2) near the equator and over the northernmost regions.  
<p>
Preliminary comparison of zonal average fluxes suggest that most atmospheric general circulation models produce excessively large ocean surface fluxes of net solar heating and evaporative cooling when forced with realistic sea surface temperatures.  It is expected that the method introduced here will be refined to produce increasingly reliable estimates of uncertainties in surface flux atlases derived from ship observations.

<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
Recent studies have shown that patterns of near-surface temperature
change due to combined forcing by carbon dioxide and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols are easier to identify in the observations than signals due to changes in carbon dioxide alone (Santer et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 1995a). Here we extend this work to the vertical structure of atmospheric temperature changes, and additionally consider the possible effects of stratospheric ozone reduction. 
<p>
We compare modeled and observed patterns over the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere (850 to 50 hPa) and over the low- to mid-troposphere (850 to 500 hPa). In both regions there are strong similarities between observed changes and model-predicted signals. Over 850 to 50 hPa similarities are evident both in carbon dioxide-only signals and in signals that incorporate the added effects of sulfate aerosols and stratospheric ozone reduction. These similarities are due largely to a common pattern of stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming in the observations and model experiments. 
<p>
Including the effects of stratospheric ozone reduction results in a more realistic height for the transition between stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming.
In the low- to mid-troposphere the observations are in better agreement with the temperature-change patterns due to combined forcing than with the carbon dioxide-only pattern.
This is the result of hemispheric-scale temperature-change
contrasts that are common to the observations and the combined forcing signal
but absent in the carbon dioxide-only case. The
levels of model-versus-observed pattern similarity in both atmospheric
regions increase over the period 1963 to 1987. If model estimates
of natural internal variability are realistic, it is likely
that these trends in pattern similarity are partially due
to human activities.

<p>
The interannual variability and Reproducibility of rainfall over the Indian subcontinent, the Sahel and the Nordeste region of Brazil have been evaluated from the suite of AMIP simulations. Rainfall variations over the Nordeste region are the most readily captured owing to the intimate link with Pacific and Atlantic SSTs. The precipitation variations over the Indian subcontinent and the Sahel are relatively less well captured by the models respectively. Additionally, an Indian monsoon wind shear index was calculated for each model. The models are generally more adept at simulating the variability of the wind shear index than that associated with the rainfall over this region, indicating that the models exhibit greater fidelity at capturing the large-scale dynamical fluctuations. For each region improved skill scores and enhanced Reproducibility result for those models that qualitatively simulate the observed rainfall/SST correlation pattern which is dominated by an ENSO teleconnection in the Pacific Ocean. Accordingly for this subset of the models, the enhancement in skill and Reproducibility occurred mainly during years of strong El Ni&#241;o and  La Ni&#241;a conditions. 
<p>
A suite of six ECMWF AMIP runs (differing only in their initial conditions) have also been examined. The Indian monsoon rainfall exhibits a consistent response during 1987 and 1988, while during other years differences are simply not very predictable, possibly because of internal chaotic dynamics that are associated with intraseasonal monsoon fluctuations and/or land surface process interactions. In this case the Reproducibility is poor indicating that the average intramodel spread is greater than the temporal variability of the ensemble mean. For the Sahel and the Nordeste the Reproducibility increases to 2.4 and 9.0 respectively indicating a robust response to the boundary conditions for this model. 
<p>
Five SUNY/NCAR Genesis low resolution initial condition realizations were also examined. In this model the Nordeste rainfall also exhibited the largest Reproducibility, however for all regions the Reproducibility was smaller than that for the ECMWF model.

The relationship of the all-India and Sahel rainfall/SST teleconnections with horizontal resolution, convective closure and numerics has been evaluated. Models with resolution  >=T42 performed more poorly than lower resolution models. The higher resolution models were predominantly spectral. At low resolution, spectral vs. gridpoint numerics performed with nearly equal verisimilitude. At low resolution, moisture convergence closure was slightly preferable to other closure techniques. At high resolution, the models that utilized a moisture convergence criteria performed very poorly suggesting that moisture convergence may be inappropriate for models with horizontal resolution  >=T42.

<h3><a name="RP29">Report 29:    Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis of Climate Data</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp&nbspSailes K. Sengupta and James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
In traditional principal component analysis (PCA) a few significant linear combinations of the original variables are extracted to arrive at a parsimonious description of a complex data set obtained from climate observations, analysis or from GCM ouputs.These are uncorrelated variables which are used in practice to understand the principal modes of variation in the climatological process under study. If we drop the requirement of linearity and uncorrelatedness, a greater data reduction is possible allowing us to deal with fewer modes of variation. These nonlinear functions can in fact be obtained by using a series of auto-associative feed-forward neural networks in which the residuals from the previous network are fed as the contents of the input output pair for the next. It can be shown that in special cases such networks provide ordinary principal components.
<p>
We have explored this methodology to gain a better understanding of the precipitation data over the US observed over land and bordering oceans for the 1979 to 1988 decade. A careful comparison with the linear counterpart has been made. The improvement in the data reduction is noticeable but not overwhelming. Certain details in the modes of variation are more pronounced in the nonlinear representation. The leading nonlinear mode captures the seasonal cycles more clearly than the leading linear mode. In the latter, the seasonal cycle is shared by subsequent modes of the PCA. The principal linear and nonlinear modes of the observational data has been intercompared with the corresponding modes of the data obtained from a GCM simulation.
<p>
We conclude by observing that nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) based on auto-associative neural networks is potentially a more effective data reduction tool than conventional PCA. Also the principal modes of variation of the precipitation data of the continental US are better differentiated by a NLPCA than by ordinary PCA. It should be tried as an alternative method especially when linear PCA fails to show meaningful patterns in climatological data analysis.

<h3><a name="RP30">Report 30:    Correlation Between Outgoing Longwave Radiation and Surface Temperature in the Tropical Pacific:  A Model Intercomparison</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:  Curt Covey</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
Results from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project show that general circulation models tend to underestimate the emission of anomalous heat to space during the 1987 El Ni&#241;o episode in the tropical Pacific.  This bias suggests that the models may underestimate negative feedbacks on climate involving longwave radiation in the tropical atmosphere.  Such a possibility is consistent with analyses of paleo-data that suggest climate models generally overestimate climate sensitivity in the tropics. <p>

<h3><a name="RP31">Report 31:    Seasonal Characteristics of Precipitation over the United States in AMIP Simulations</a></h3>
<p><h4>Author:  James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>

The monthly mean precipitation patterns of the   Atmospheric Model Intercom
parison Project (AMIP) decadal simulations over the US and adjoining oceans are intercompared. A simple harmonic analysis of the 12 month seasonal mean 
precipitation values and a principal component(PC) analysis of the 120 monthly values were carried out. Emphasis is placed on the basic seasonal variation for three subregions, the Eastern US, Central US and West Coast US. 

 The results indicate the following: 
<ol><li>There are rather severe problems for almost all the models in capturing the seasonal variation of the precipitation over the Eastern US. The models typically overemphasize the Summer / Spring rainfall amounts. The PC analysis indicates that many of the models tend to extend the precipitation regime typical of the Central US too far to the east, resulting in a precipitation maxima occurring in the summer for the Eastern region.
</li>
<li>The seasonal variation of the west coast is handled with the greatest fidelity. This result cuts across all the models and may be attributable to the fact the SST forcing is specified and common to all the simulations. The common SST forcing is apparently a dominant factor in determining this region's precipitation climatology.</li>
<li>On the space scales of the regions selected, there is little consistent evidence that points to any specific model feature as a predictor of model performance. None of the obvious candidates such as horizontal resolution, convective closure schemes or land surface schemes are reliable discriminators of a model's ability to simulate precipitation.</li>
<li>For one smaller sub-region centered over Arizona, chosen because of the dominance of the semiannual cycle, there is evidence that increased horizontal resolution has an effect. For this intermountain region the higher resolution models as a whole do better than the low resolution models. However, even in this case there is enough variation amongst the individual simulations as to obscure the conclusion that increased horizontal resolution is a necessary or sufficient quality to produce a reliable simulation. 
</li>
<li>The models tend to have less interannual variation than the observations with more variance being explained by the leading ( annual cycle ) PC,  while the observations have a less peaked spectrum.</li>

<li>The models consistently overestimate the precipitation in the spring and early summer in all regions. This might indicate a common failing of all the convective schemes in dealing with extratropical convective instability that is 
endemic to this time of year.</li></ol>
<p>
It would appear that the models of the generation represented by the AMIP in
tegrations would not be suitable for direct coupling to a watershed disaggregation scheme even on a seasonal basis. The results indicate that there is substantial uncertainty in the distribution of precipitation throughout the year as simulated by most 
of these models.

<h3><a name="RP32">Report 32:&nbsp;&nbsp;Intercomparison of Low-Frequency Variability of the Global 200 hPa Circulation for AMIP Simulations</a></h3>
<p>
<h4>Author:&nbsp;&nbsp;James S. Boyle</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>
In the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) a number of GCMs 
are integrated for a 10 year period, 1979-1988, all using the same monthly mean sea 
surface temperature  (SST). This permits a useful intercomparison of the response of 
the models to the imposed SST. The variables used here for the intercomparison are 
the 200 hPa divergence and streamfunction. The data used are in the form of monthly 
averages and are filtered to a spatial resolution of T10,  although the actual spatial 
resolution of the models varies from R15 to T42. The data are manipulated in this 
manner to concentrate on the low frequency, large scale response. The tools of the 
analysis are principal components analysis (PCA) and common principal components 
(CPC). These analyses are carried out on the 120 months of data with the seasonal 
cycle removed  and in the case of the streamfunction with the zonal average also removed. The 1979-1988 period encompasses two El Ni&#241;o / Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (1982/83 and 1986/87), and as could be expected the ENSO characteristic 
response has a prominent impact in the model simulations.
<P>
The results indicate that :
<br>
<OL>
<LI>The PCA of the divergence has a dominant mode which is similar for all the 
models and has the signature of an (ENSO) response. It has an east-west dipole of divergence anomaly centered on the equator in the western Pacific. This mode accounts 
for 29% to 53% of the explained variance for the models considered. 
<P></LI>
<LI>
The streamfunction PC analysis also exhibits an ENSO type response as the 
dominant mode,  but this  accounts for only 8% to 21% of the variance. 
<P></LI>
<LI>The CPC analysis allows a direct comparison of the data from all the models 
on a common set of vectors. The component identified with the ENSO mode represents 27% to 52% of the variance explained for the divergence in this formulation. 
These results indicate that the models share a basic common pattern but there is a 
strong variation in the amplitude of the corresponding modes.
<P></LI>
<LI>The variance explained by the leading mode for the CPC streamfunction is between 5% and  19%,  and there is less commonality in the higher components than 
seen in the divergence. This appears to be related to the stronger streamfunction response in the mid-latitudes,  which is presumably more affected by nonlinearity and 
intrinsic variability of the model integrations. 
<P></LI>
<LI>Based on results using an ensemble of five decadal runs using the ECMWF 
GCM an estimate is made of the variation of explained variance due to intrinsic variability for a single model. It is found that in general the inter-model variation is somewhat greater than the intra-model ensemble variation using the ECMWF model.
<P></LI>
<LI>A probability density function (PDF) analysis in the space spanned by the 
first two CPCs for the velocity potential  ( which explain over 70% of the variance for 
all but one model) yields distinctive dynamical signatures. Some models populate a 
somewhat larger PDF space than others.
<P></LI>
</OL>
There is a strong implication that the models differ beyond the variation due to 
intrinsic variability in the dynamical system. Some of the models have distinctly different  responses to a common SST forcing. The disparate results indicate that consensus on the representation of the physics of the atmosphere has not been reached, 
and the present uncertainty in the parameterizations is greater than the intrinsic uncertainty of the model system as shown by ensemble simulations.

<h3><a name="RP33">Report 33:&nbsp;&nbsp;Model Simulated Northern Winter Cyclone and Anticyclone Activity under a Greenhouse Warming Scenario</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi Zhang and Wei-Chyung Wang</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<p>Two one-hundred-year equilibrium simulations from the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM1) are used to investigate the activity of northern winter extratropical cyclones and anticyclones under normal and greenhouse warming climate conditions.  The first simulation uses the 1990 observed CO<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>O, CFC-11 and CFC-12 concentrations and the second adopts the year 2050 concentrations according to the IPCC business-as-usual scenario.  Variables that describe the characteristic properties of the cyclone-scale eddies, such as surface cyclone and anticyclone frequency and band-passed root-mean-square (RMS) of 500 hPa geopotential height, along with the Eady growth rate maximum, form a framework for the analysis of the cyclone and anticyclone activity.
<p>
Objective criteria are developed for identifying cyclone and anticyclone occurrence based on the 1000 hPa geopotential height and vorticity fields and are tested using ECMWF analyses.  The potential changes of the eddy activity under the greenhouse warming climate are then examined.  Results indicate that the activity of cyclone-scale eddies decreases under the greenhouse warming scenario.  This is not only reflected in the surface cyclone and anticyclone frequency and the bandpassed RMS of 500 hPa geopotential height, but is also discerned from the Eady growth rate maximum.  Based on the analysis, three different physical mechanisms responsible for the decreased eddy activity are discussed:  (1) decrease of the extratropical meridional temperature gradient from surface to mid-troposphere; (2) reduction in the land-sea thermal contrast in the east coastal regions of the Asian and North American continents; and (3) increase in the eddy meridional latent heat fluxes.  Uncertainties of the results related to the limitations of the model and the model equilibrium simulations are discussed.

and it comprises a set of subroutines that can be linked to any FORTRAN program.
 EzGet reads files through the cdunif interface which is available from the

<h3><a name="RP35">Report 35: &nbsp;&nbsp; Structure of the Tropical Lower Stratosphere as Revealed by Three Reanalysis Data Sets</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors: &nbsp;&nbsp; Steven Pawson and Michael Fiorino</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>
<P>While the skill of climate simulation models has advanced over the last decade, mainly through improvements in modeling, further progress will depend on the availability and the quality of comprehensive validation data sets covering long time periods.  A new source of such validation data is atmospheric "reanalysis" where a fixed, state-of-the-art global atmospheric model/data assimilation system is run through archived and recovered observations to produce a consistent set of atmospheric analyses.  Although reanalysis will be free of non-physical variability caused by changes in the models and/or the assimilation procedure, it is necessary to assess its quality.  That is, how good is reanalysis and how close should our climate models agree with these data.
<P>
A region for stringent testing of the quality of reanalysis is the tropical lower stratosphere.  This portion of the atmosphere is sparse in observations but displays the prominent quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and an annual cycle, neither of which is fully understood, but which are likely coupled dynamically.  We first consider the performance of three reanalyses, from NCEP/NCAR, NASA and ECMWF, against rawinsonde data in depicting the QBO and then examine the structure of the tropical lower stratosphere in NCEP and ECMWF data sets in detail.
<P>
While the annual cycle and the QBO in wind and temperature are quite successfully represented, the mean meridional circulations in NCEP and ECMWF data sets contain unusual features which may be due to the assimilation process rather than being physically based.  Further, the models capture the long-term temperature fluctuations associated with volcanic eruptions, even though the physical mechanisms are not included, thus implying that the model does not mask prominent stratospheric signals in the observational data.  We conclude that reanalysis offers a unique opportunity to better understand the dynamics of QBO and can be applied to climate model validation.

<h3><a name="RP36">Report 36: &nbsp;&nbsp; On the Maintenance and Initiation of the Intraseasonal Oscillation in the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis and the GLA and UKMO AMIP Simulations</a></h3>
<p><h4>Authors: &nbsp;&nbsp; Kenneth R. Sperber, Julia M. Slingo, Peter M. Inness, and William K-M. Lau</h4><hr>
<br>
<center><h3>Abstract</h3></center>

<P>
In this study, satellite derived outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)
and the reanalysis from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) are used as verification data
in a study of intraseasonal variability in the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres
(GLA) and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) atmospheric general
circulation models. These models simulated the most realistic intraseasonal
oscillations (IO) of the 15 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project models
examined by Slingo et al. (1995, 1996). During the active phase of the
intraseasonal oscillation, convection is observed to migrate from the Indian
Ocean to the western/central Pacific Ocean, and into the South Pacific
Convergence Zone (SPCZ). The simulated convection, particularly in the
GLA model, is most realistic over the western/central Pacific Ocean and
the SPCZ. In the reanalysis, the baroclinic structure of the IO is evident
in the eddy-streamfunction, and eastward migration of the anticyclone/cyclone
pairs occurs in conjunction with the eastward development of convection.
Both the GLA and UKMO models exhibit a baroclinic structure on intraseasonal
time scales. The GLA model is more realistic than the UKMO model at simulating
the eastward migration of the anticyclone/cyclone pairs when the convection
is active over the western/central Pacific. In the UKMO model, the main
heating is located off the equator, which contributes to the irregular
structures seen in this model on intraseasonal time scales.</P>


<P>
The maintenance and initiation of the intraseasonal oscillation has
also been investigated. Analysis of the latent heat flux indicates that
evaporative wind feedback and frictional wave-CISK (conditional instability
of the second-kind) are not the dominant mechanisms for promoting the eastward
propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation since evaporation to the west
of the convection dominants. In the GLA model, enhanced evaporation tends
to develop in-place over the west Pacific warm pool, while in the UKMO
simulation westward propagation of enhanced evaporation is evident. It
is suggested that lack of an interactive ocean may be associated with the
models' systematic failure to simulate the eastward transition of convection
from the Indian Ocean into the western Pacific Ocean since examination
of observed sea surface temperature (SST) and its relationship to the active
phase of the intraseasonal oscillation indicates that the intraseasonal
oscillation may evolve as a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode. Above normal
SST to the east of the convection may play a role in maintaining the eastward
evolution of convection, while decreasing SSTs near the western portion
of the convective envelope are associated with the cessation of convection. <A HREF="../sperber/report36/Rpt36.htm">Hypertext</A>

<HR><A NAME="RP37"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Report 37: &nbsp;&nbsp; Intercomparison
of the Seasonal Cycle in 200 hPa Kinetic energy in AMIP&nbsp;GCM&nbsp;Simulations</FONT></H3>

<H4>Author: &nbsp;&nbsp; James S. Boyle 
<HR></H4>

<P>The 200 hPa kinetic energy is represented by means of the spherical
harmonic components for the AMIP simulations, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis
and the ECMWF reanalysis(ERA). The data used are the monthly mean wind
fields for 1979 to 1988. The kinetic energy is decomposed into the divergent
(DKE) and rotational (RKE) components and emphasis is placed on examining
the former.</P>

<P>The two reanalysis data sets show reasonable agreement that is best
for the rotational kinetic energy. The largest difference in the divergent
kinetic energy occurs during the northern summer. As might be expected,
the two analyses are closest in regions where there are sufficient observations
such that the effects of the model used in the assimilation cycle are minimized.</P>

<P>The observed RKE shows only a slight seasonal cycle with a maximum occurring
during the northern winter. The DKE, on the other hand, has a very pronounced
seasonal cycle with maxima at the solsticial seasons and minima during
the equinoctial seasons. The most energetic season is the northern summer
(JJA), the least energetic the northern spring (MAM). SON is a transitional
season with the three months having a large spread in values. The largest
jump in DKE is seen from May to June, evidently in response to the onset
of the Asian summer monsoon. The spectral decomposition of the DKE indicates
that the NCEP analysis has more energy in the zonal component of the flow
than the ERA. This is most pronounced during the northern summer.</P>

<P>The model results show a very large spread in the magnitudes of the
RKE and DKE although the models all evince a seasonal variation in phase
with that observed. The median value of the models systematically overestimates
the observed RKE throughout the year and underestimates the DKE during
the northern summer. These relations can be reversed for individual models.
There is also a marked tendency for the models to have too much DKE in
the zonal flow as compared to the reanalyses, especially at the higher
energy levels. It does not appear possible to associate any specific model
discrepancy with the particulars of the model formulation.</P>

<P>The median values of the seasonal cycle of RKE and DKE for the models
are superior to those of any individual model. Results are also presented
for simulations following the AMIP protocol but using updated versions
of the original AMIP entries. In most cases these new integrations show
better agreement with the observations.

<H3><A NAME="RP38"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Report 38: &nbsp;&nbsp; Climatology of East Asian Winter Monsoon and Cold Surges: Results from the 1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis</FONT></H3>

<H4>Authors: &nbsp;&nbsp; Yi Zhang, Kenneth R. Sperber and James S. Boyle

<HR></H4>

<P>This paper presents the climatology of the East Asian winter monsoon
and cold surges based on the 1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. In addition
to documenting the frequency, intensity, and preferred propagation tracks
of cold surges and the evolution patterns of associated fields, the temporal
distribution of the Siberian high and cold surges is discussed. Further,
this study examines the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and
cold surges and its relationship with ENSO. </P>

<P>There are on average thirteen cold surges in each winter season (October
to April), of which two are strong cases. The averaged intensity of cold
surges, measured by maximum surface pressure, is 1053 hPa. The cold surges
originate from two primary source regions: 1) northwest of Lake Baikal,
and 2) north of Lake Balkhash. The typical evolution of a cold surge occurs
over the period of 5-14 days. Trajectory and correlation analyses indicate
that, during this time high pressure centers propagate southeastward around
the edge of the Tibetan Plateau from the mentioned source regions. Some
of these high pressure centers then move eastward and diminish over the
ocean, while others proceed southward. The signature of the associated
temperature, wind, and pressure fields propagate farther southward and
eastward. The affected area encompasses the bulk of the maritime continent.
Although the intensity of the Siberian high is found to peak during December
and January, the frequency of cold surges has a maximum in November and
in March. This result suggests that November through March should be considered
as the East Asian winter monsoon season. </P>

<P>Two stratifications of cold surges are used to examine the relationship
between ENSO and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon. The first
one, described as the conventional cold surges, indicates that the cold
surge frequency reaches a minimum a year after El Nino events. The second
one, defined as the maximum wind events near the South China Sea, shares
the same source regions as the first. This stratification of surges is
found to be in good agreement with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).
Low SOI (high SOI) events coincide with high (low) frequencies of cold
surges.</P>

<P>The interannual variation of averaged meridional wind near the South
China Sea and the maritime continent is dominated by the South China Sea
cold surges, and is also well correlated (R=0.82) with the SOI. Strong
wind seasons are associated with La Nina and high SOI events; likewise,
weak wind years are linked with El Nino and low SOI cases. This pattern
is restricted north of the equator within the region of (0&deg;N-20&deg;N,
110&deg;E-130&deg;E), and is confined to the near surface layer. The surface
Siberian high, 500 hPa trough and 200 hPa jetstream, all representing the
large-scale monsoon flow, are found to be weaker than normal during El
Nino years. In particular, the interannual variation of the Siberian high
is in general agreement with the SOI. <A HREF="../zhang/report38/rep38.htm">Hypertext</A>

<head><title> PCMDI Future Plans </title></head>
<body background="blue_paper.gif">
<h1>Future Plans</h1>
<hr>
<p>

During the next few years, PCMDI will continue its efforts to develop a climate modeling infrastructure (consisting of standards and software for documentation, data management, diagnosis, visualization, validation, intercomparison, and exchange) in cooperation with the <a href=../phillips/climategrps.html>climate community</a>.  Much of this effort will be directed to supporting the next phase of the AMIP (denoted as <A HREF="../amip2/overview.html">AMIP II</A>).

<p>

In the longer term, we will progressively shift our emphasis from atmospheric models with prescribed ocean boundary conditions to models
of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system, and will support the development of a
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (<A HREF="../covey/cmip/Cmip.htm">CMIP</A>) in cooperation with the <A HREF="http://www.dkrz.de/clivar/hp.html">CLIVAR</A> initiative of the <A HREF="http://www.wmo.ch/web/wcrp/wcrp-home.html">World Climate Research Programme</A>. 

<p>

PCMDI also will address specific questions that are important model-related elements of global change research.  These include consideration of how to
most effectively control the unrealistic climate drift that is typical of
coupled systems, and how simulated natural variability may be used in the study
of  climate predictability and the detection of climate change on global and
regional scales. 

<p>

This research, supported by a modeling infrastructure, will provide the basis for the systematic application and improvement of climate models and for the comprehensive evaluation of their ability to characterize future climate changes as a result of anthropogenic activities.

<H1>EzGet: A Software Library to Facilitate Data Retrieval
</H1>
<HR>

<P>
A FORTRAN library called EzGet has been developed at PCMDI to
facilitate retrieval of modeled and observed climate data stored in
popular formats including <a href="../../drach/DRS.html">DRS</a>, <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">netCDF</A>,
<A HREF="http://grads.iges.org/grads">GrADS</A>, and, if a control file is supplied, GRIB.  You can specify how
the data should be structured and whether it should  undergo a grid
transformation before you receive it, even when you know little about
the original structure of the stored data (e.g., its original dimension
order, grid, and domain).

<P>
The EzGet library comprises a set of subroutines that can be linked to
any FORTRAN program.  EzGet reads files through the <a
href="../../drach/cdunif.html">cdunif</a> interface, but use of EzGet does
not require familiarity with cdunif.  The main advantages of using
EzGet instead of the lower level cdunif library include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> Substantial error trapping capabilities and detailed error messages </li>
<P>

<li> Versatile capability of conveniently selecting data from specified
  regions (e.g., oceans, North America, all land areas north of 45
  degrees latitude, etc.)</li>
<P>

<li> Ability to map data to a new grid at the time it is retrieved by EzGet</li>
<P>

<li> Automatic creation of ``weights'' for use in subsequent averaging or
  masking of data</li>
<P>

<li>Increased control in specifying the domain of the data to be retrieved.</li>

</ul>

<P>
Taken together these capabilities will simplify the process of writing
programs for accessing data stored in different formats and structures,
including all the observed data sets and the model output from various
model intercomparison projects (AMIP, PMIP, CMIP, etc.) archived at
PCMDI.

<p>  EzGet is updated and enhanced from time to time. Information on
differences between the most recent and earlier versions of EzGet along with a
description of current limitations of the software is available: see <a
href="ezget_bugs.html">updates, bugs and limitations</a>.

<p> If you wish to be informed of updated versions of EzGet (along with
a description of any bugs discovered), please  <a
href="ezget_form.html">register</a>. (If you register, you may expect
to be sent email, but not often--no more than a few times a year.)

<A NAME = "ftp">

<p>
EzGet serves a different purpose from other software tools developed at
PCMDI. EzGet is meant to be used in conjunction with FORTRAN programs
that need access to data.  For direct viewing and interactive
manipulation of data, a Visualization and Computation System (<a
href="../../williams/vcs/vcstoc.html">VCS</a>) has been developed.  To
transfer data to files, formats, or visualization systems, the Data and
Dimensions Interface (<a
href="../../williams/ddi/ddi.html">DDI</a>)
has been developed.  Neither VCS nor DDI can be called from a FORTRAN
program.

<p>
The EzGet software is currently available for the following
platforms/operating systems: Sun/SunOS 4.1.3, Sun/Solaris 2.4, IBM
RS6000/AIX 3.2, HP/HP-UX 9.0, SGI Irix 5.3.

<P>This paper presents the climatology of the East Asian winter monsoon
and cold surges based on the 1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. In addition
to documenting the frequency, intensity, and preferred propagation tracks
of cold surges and the evolution patterns of associated fields, the temporal
distribution of the Siberian high and cold surges is discussed. Further,
this study examines the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and
cold surges and its relationship with ENSO. </P>

<P>There are on average thirteen cold surges in each winter season (October
to April), of which two are strong cases. The averaged intensity of cold
surges, measured by maximum surface pressure, is 1053 hPa. The cold surges
originate from two primary source regions: 1) northwest of Lake Baikal,
and 2) north of Lake Balkhash. The typical evolution of a cold surge occurs
over the period of 5-14 days. Trajectory and correlation analyses indicate
that, during this time high pressure centers propagate southeastward around
the edge of the Tibetan Plateau from the mentioned source regions. Some
of these high pressure centers then move eastward and diminish over the
ocean, while others proceed southward. The signature of the associated
temperature, wind, and pressure fields propagate farther southward and
eastward. The affected area encompasses the bulk of the maritime continent.
Although the intensity of the Siberian high is found to peak during December
and January, the frequency of cold surges has a maximum in November and
in March. This result suggests that November through March should be considered
as the East Asian winter monsoon season. </P>

<P>Two stratifications of cold surges are used to examine the relationship
between ENSO and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon. The first
one, described as the conventional cold surges, indicates that the cold
surge frequency reaches a minimum a year after El Nino events. The second
one, defined as the maximum wind events near the South China Sea, shares
the same source regions as the first. This stratification of surges is
found to be in good agreement with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).
Low SOI (high SOI) events coincide with high (low) frequencies of cold
surges.</P>

<P>The interannual variation of averaged meridional wind near the South
China Sea and the maritime continent is dominated by the South China Sea
cold surges, and is also well correlated (R=0.82) with the SOI. Strong
wind seasons are associated with La Nina and high SOI events; likewise,
weak wind years are linked with El Nino and low SOI cases. This pattern
is restricted north of the equator within the region of (0&deg;N-20&deg;N,
110&deg;E-130&deg;E), and is confined to the near surface layer. The surface
Siberian high, 500 hPa trough and 200 hPa jetstream, all representing the
large-scale monsoon flow, are found to be weaker than normal during El
Nino years. In particular, the interannual variation of the Siberian high
is in general agreement with the SOI. </P>

<P>The East Asian winter monsoon, which is associated with a strong Siberian
high and active cold surges, is one of the most energetic monsoon circulation
systems. The dramatic shift of the northeasterlies and the outbreak of
cold surges dominate the winter weather and climate in the East Asian region.
The winter monsoon and cold surges exert a strong impact on the extratropical
and tropical planetary-scale circulations (Chang and Lau, 1982), and influence
the SSTs in the tropical western Pacific (Chang et al., 1979). Their general
characteristics and the possible linkage between cold surges and tropical
atmospheric and oceanic phenomena have been examined in many studies. For
example, Chang and Lau (1982) showed that the outbreak of winter monsoon
surges forced short term changes in the Hadley and Walker Circulation,
the East Asian jetstream and large-scale deep convection over the equatorial
western Pacific. Boyle (1986a, 1986b) found that the frequency and intensity
of the monsoon surges for a given month were related to the intensity of
the East Asian jetstream and the extratropical large-scale circulation
patterns. Lau and Chang (1987) suggested that the interannual variations
of the winter monsoon and cold surges may be related to ENSO and tropical
intraseasonal oscillations. Ding and Krishnamurti (1987) noted an eastward
shift of the tropical planetary scale divergent circulation in association
with the cold surges which was very similar to the shift of the divergent
circulation between El Nino and La Nina years.</P>

<P>However, little attention has been given to the climatological aspects
of the winter monsoon and cold surges. Boyle and Chang (1984) documented
the mean winter circulation statistics based on the Navy Fleet Numerical
Oceanography Center's (FNOC) gridded analyses. Pan et al. (1985) compiled
the statistics of the Siberian high and cold air outbreaks in China with
emphasis on the effect to local weather forecast. Ding and Krishnamurti
(1987) summarized the climatological tracks of cold surges based on the
data from the winter (DJF) of 1980 to 1984. Although the winter monsoon
was much weaker than normal during the 1982-83 El Nino event (Lau and Chang,
1987), there has never been a systematic investigation on the relationship
between ENSO and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and cold
surges.</P>

<P>The purpose of this study is to present the climatology of cold surges
and the Siberian high based on the 1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. We emphasize
the temporal and spatial distribution of the cold surges and the Siberian
high, their origin, propagation paths and evolution patterns. Of particular
interest is the interannual variation of winter monsoon and cold surges.
Given that the winter monsoon activity was weaker during the 1982-83 period,
one of our goals is to determine if a consistent relationship exists between
ENSO and the interannual variation of the winter monsoon and cold surges.

<P><A NAME="BM2__Description"></A><B>2. &nbsp;Description of the reanalysis</B></P>

<P>We use twice-daily surface and upper-air fields from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis
(Kalnay et al., 1996) for the period of 1979-1995. The surface quantities
include temperature, wind, and sea-level-pressure (SLP); upper-air fields
are winds at 925 hPa, 850 hPa, 700 hPa, and 200 hPa and geopotential height
at 500 hPa. The advantage of this data set is that the reanalysis used
a &quot;frozen&quot; state-of-the-art analysis/forecast system to perform
the data assimilation throughout the whole period, thus circumventing problems
with previous numerical weather prediction analyses due to changes in techniques,
models and data assimilation. Also, this dynamically consistent reanalysis
offers good horizontal (2.5&deg; x 2.5&deg;) and vertical resolution (17
levels).</P>

<P><A NAME="BM3__Winter"></A><B>3. Winter monsoon circulation</B></P>

<P><A NAME="BM3_1_Mean"></A>3.1&nbsp; Mean state</P>

<P>The winter monsoon circulation has been documented by many authors (e.g.,
Boyle and Chang 1984; Lau and Li 1984; Lau and Chang 1987; Boyle and Chen
1987) and is summarized here to serve as a background for this paper. The
dominant surface feature of the winter monsoon is the Siberian high. The
winter SLP averaged from 1979/80 - 1994/95 is shown in <A HREF="f1.htm">Fig.
1.</A> This surface pressure system, with central pressure in excess of
1036 hPa, covers the entire East Asian continent and yields northeasterly
flow over a large part of Asia. At 500 hPa, the flow pattern is dominated
by the coastal trough. The intensity of this trough is quasi-geostrophically
linked to the surface Siberian high. At 200 hPa, the most prominent feature
is the East Asian jet near Japan. This jet, the strongest on the globe,
is associated with intense baroclinicity, large vertical wind shear and
strong cold advection. It is maintained by the Coriolis torque acceleration
exerted on the ageostrophic wind near the jet entrance region. Its strength
is inherently related to the intensity of the surface Siberian high and
the 500 hPa trough. These features characterize the three-dimensional large-scale
monsoon circulation. </P>

<P><A HREF="f1.htm">Fig. 1</A> also presented the winter (DJF) surface
wind averaged from 1979/80 - 1994/95. This climatological surface wind
represents contributions from both the quasi-stationary Siberian high and
the cold surges. North of 30&deg;N, the wind blows along the north and
east periphery of the Siberian high. This anticyclonic flow pattern is
a reflection of the quasi-stationary pressure system. South of 30&deg;N
where the Siberian high pressure exerts less influence, the wind maximum
near the South China Sea can be largely attributed to the cumulative effects
of the cold surges. One of the main features of this field is that the
westerly flow near Japan bifurcates. The eastward branch merges with the
Aleutian low; the southern branch joins the tradewind belt. Cold air intensity
and thickness usually reduce significantly as the airmass moves southward.
Thus, the winter monsoon is a shallow phenomenon in lower latitudes.<BR>

<P><A NAME="BM3_2_Variance"></A>3.2 Variance of SLP and surface air temperature</P>

<P>The standard deviation of SLP in <A HREF="f2.htm">Fig. 2 (a)</A> indicates
that the Siberian high pressure is a rather stationary feature of the winter
monsoon. The largest variations occur to the northwest of the Siberian
high, and to the east where the variability near the Aleutian low dominates.
Although the standard deviation of temperature is largest at high latitudes
as indicated in <A HREF="f2.htm">Fig. 2 (b)</A>, substantial variability
also occurs over eastern China. This is noticed as a pronounced southward
extension of the standard deviation over this region. A similar, but less
well defined southward extension is also seen in the variability of SLP.
The southward extensions in both variables is an indication of the cold
surge activity.</P>

<P><A HREF="f2.htm">Figs. 2 (c) </A>and <A HREF="f2.htm">(d)</A> show the
percent of total variance of SLP and surface air temperature explained
by periods of 6-14 days, the typical lifetime of cold surges. Along the
east coast of China, over 25% of the total variance of surface air temperature
and SLP occurs on time scales of 6-14 days. The structure of the temperature
variation exhibits more regionality than that of SLP and has a pronounced
signal over eastern China. Power spectra of the surface air temperature
and SLP in this vicinity exhibits many common spectral peaks on these time
scales (not shown) suggesting a close association between the temperature
and SLP variation in this region, which is consistent with the characteristics
of cold surges. The substantial SLP variance over the Pacific Ocean near
25&deg;N and the one northward over Japan are not necessarily associated
with cold surge activity. These variation maxima are intriguing features
of the SLP which will be investigated in future works. Cold air activity
over the East Asia continent and the South China Sea will be of interest
here.</P>

<P><A NAME="BM4__Cold"></A><B>4. Cold surges and Siberian high</B></P>

<P>The cold surges are the most important transient disturbances embedded
within the mean monsoon circulation. The occurrence of a cold surge is
characterized by a southward movement of a surface anticyclone and an associated
abrupt 24-48 hours surface air temperature drop in the affected regions.
The typical scenario of a cold air outbreak is: the Siberian high and the
coastal trough reach a certain intensity. Further west over the continent,
an upper level short wave undergoes strong development as it moves eastward.
Eventually, the short wave develops into a major trough and replaces the
old quasi-stationary coastal trough. During this process, a surface anticyclone
moves southward and a cold surge occurs (Staff members of Academia Sinica,
1957). It should be pointed out that the build-up and maintenance of the
Siberian high pressure is a necessary condition for the occurrence of cold
surges. Radiative cooling, persistent cold air advection (usually blocking
over Urals) throughout the troposphere and large-scale descending motion
all contribute to the maintenance of the cold Siberian high (Ding and Krishnamurti,1987).
However, cold surges should not be regarded as the simple southward expansion
or temporal variability of the Siberian highs. Rather, it is of a separate
dynamical entity. The Siberian high and the cold surge are the two most
characteristic weather phenomena of the winter monsoon. The relationship
between the two will be further discussed in Section 4.2.<BR>

<P><A NAME="BM4_1_Criteria"></A>4.1 Criteria for cold surges</P>

<P>Objective criteria to identify the cold surges are required in this
study. Many cold surge definitions can be found in the literature. A summary
of the often used definitions is given in Boyle and Chen (1987). Some of
the cold surges are purposely defined for the convenience of weather forecasting.
Definitions vary depending on regions of interest. For example, cold surges
defined over the South China Sea may have nothing to do with cold surges
defined near Korea. The essence of the cold surges, as mentioned above,
is the rapid south-southeastward movement of a surface anticyclone, which
brings significant surface air temperature drop in the affected regions.</P>

<P>In defining a cold surge from the reanalysis, we choose to average the
necessary fields at particular regions which encompass a nine-grid-point
rectangular at the 2.5&deg; x 2.5&deg; resolution <A HREF="f3.htm">(see
Fig. 3)</A>. Region 1 is in southern Siberia, region 2 is in the middle
of China, and region 3 covers part of southern China. Using information
from these regions, we define a cold surge as follows:</P>

<P>1) Outbreak requires, (a) a surface anticyclone must be identified (Criteria
in Zhang and Wang, 1996) in the vicinity of region 1, which has an averaged
SLP &gt;1035 hPa, and (b) During the movement of a surface anticyclone,
the 24-48 hour surface air tem-perature drop must exceed 9&deg;C in region
2, or 6&deg;C in region 3.</P>

<P>2) Ending of a cold surge occurs when, (a) a negative pressure tendency
at the anticy-clone center has persisted for 24 hours and the center pressure
is &lt;1025 hPa, and (b) positive surface temperature trend was found over
50% of the grid points in the bulk of the East Asia continent (102.5&deg;E-117.5&deg;E,
25&deg;N-50&deg;N). </P>

<P>A cold surge is chosen when these criteria are met. The thresholds,
mostly based on synoptic experience, can be altered within a certain range.
Despite this, the overwhelming majority of surges will still be identified
because the key characteristics of cold surges are represented by these
criteria. Also, since a cold surge affects large areas of East Asia in
temperature and pressure fields, it is unlikely that a non-surge event
will be identified as a surge.</P>

<P>In order to verify the identified cold surges, time series of surface
air temperature in regions 1, 2, and 3 (T1, T2, and T3) of the 1987/88
winter are plotted in <A HREF="f4.htm">Fig. 4.</A> According to the criteria,
if a surface anticyclone has reached a certain intensity, a required drop
in either T2 or T3 will qualify the disturbance to be a cold surge. All
the observed cold surges during this season-known from other sources-were
found to be associated with a temperature drop in region 2 or region 3.
Fig. 4 illustrates how quickly the temperature can drop in a specific location
and its southward propagation. One of the strongest cold surges ever observed
occurred during late November of 1987. The recorded maximum surface pressure
is in excess of 1081 hPa; the temperature drops are ~ 15&deg;C in all three
regions. </P>

<P>The timing, duration, and frequency of cold surges identified using
this criteria are further compared with those defined operationally by
the Beijing Meteorological Center (BMC) for the period 1979-84 (the period
for which the data from BMC are available) and good agreement were found
between the two. Thus, we have confidence that the cold surge definition
is appropriate given the verification provided from in situ observations.

<P><A NAME="BM4_2_Statistics"></A>4.2 Statistics, trajectories and spatial
evolution of cold surges</P>

<P>Based on the above criteria, over 200 cold surges have been identified
during the 1979-95 period. Table 1 gives the average frequency, intensity,
and duration for cold surges and strong cold surges. Strong cases are defined
as events that are associated with temperature drop &gt;10&deg;C and northerly
wind &gt; 4 m s-1 in region 3. By the addition of this wind criterion,
the strong cases are assured to be cold surges that exert impacts in the
tropical region. The average maximum center pressure is ~1060 hPa for strong
surges, and it is ~ 1053 hPa for all cold surges. Lifetimes of individual
surges range from 5 - 14 days, with an average duration of ~7 days for
cold surges and ~ 9 days for strong events.</P>

<P>The trajectories of the surface anticyclones associated with each of
the cold surges are shown in <A HREF="f5.htm">Fig. 5.</A> The circles indicate
the original location of the high pressure center and the squares denote
the termination points. Based on the trajectories, cold surges tend to
originate from two distinct regions. The first is located northwest of
Lake Baikal near 95&deg;E-105&deg;E, 45&deg;N-60&deg;N, and the second
is to the north of Lake Balkhash and near 75&deg;E-90&deg;E, 52&deg;N-60&deg;N.
All the surges propagate southward or southeastward over eastern China.
Some of them ended in the East China Sea and coastal regions while others
propagate further south. </P>

<P>Although the cold surge trajectories terminated around 30&deg;N, the
pressure, temperature, and meridional wind perturbations are observed further
south. This is indicated in <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig. 6</A>, the climatological
evolution of cold surge associated SLP, temperature and northerly wind.
For each winter (120 days, mid-November through mid-March), daily values
of T3 are lag correlated with each of these fields. At each lag, the average
correlation from all 16 winters is calculated. Since a cold surge is associated
with a decrease in temperature the sign convention is such that: 1) a negative
correlation with SLP indicates high pressure, 2) a positive auto-correlation
with surface air temperature indicates low temperature, and 3) a positive
correlation with the meridional wind indicates enhanced northerlies. Correlations
for |r| 0.2 are contoured. This corresponds to the 95% confidence level
for 100 independent time samples. While estimating the actual number of
degrees of freedom is problematic, the correlation cutoff used is very
conservative given that 120 time points in each of 16 years of data were
used giving the potential of 1918 degrees of freedom ([16 x 120]-2).</P>

<P>At day -4, a massive high pressure covers most of Siberia, and temperatures
are below normal. However, the signal in the meridional wind is weak at
best. The centers of action in the surface air temperature and the SLP
are located near Mongolia (95&deg;E, 50&deg;N) at this time. It is of interest
to note the presence of significantly below normal SLP in the vicinity
of the maritime continent. This indicates the presence of a north-south
gradient of SLP prior to the southward migration of the cold air and enhanced
northerlies. Two days later, these centers of action have shifted southeastward,
and the correlations have become stronger. The signal in the v-wind also
strengthens, with the maximum northerlies located to the east of the SLP
and temperature signals. By day 0 the cold air and pressure surge have
spilled southward along the eastern flank of the Tibetan Plateau, with
the strongest correlations located over region 3. By day +2 the cold surges
have progressed further south, with the centers of action located over
southeastern China. The signal in the v-wind is located even further south,
with the strongest correlation (0.5) near 110&deg;E, 5&deg;N. Even on day
+4, there still remains a close correspondence between the SLP and temperature
centers, having now progressed to the southwest. The v-wind signature remains
intact over the South China Sea, with the maximum correlation located on
the equator at 105&deg;E. The deeper intrusion of the northerlies into
the tropics than either the SLP or temperature signature is a consistent
feature during individual years, when the correlations may be even stronger.</P>

<P>The eastward extension is also a robust feature although may not appear
as significant as the southward component. This is because the anticyclones
that travel to the east, unlike those to the south, are subject to immediate
and strong deformation by the warm and moist marine boundary once they
reach the east coast. Cold surges that ended in the vicinity of the East
China Sea belong to this category, and comprise a substantial number of
total cold surges <A HREF="f5.htm">(see Fig. 5)</A>. The patterns of lag
correlations of T2 with temperature, SLP and surface wind are found to
be very similar to those presented in <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig. 6</A> (not
shown). </P>

<P>The frequency, intensity, regionality, trajectory, and propagation patterns
of the cold surges presented above have extended and substantiated the
results of previous studies (Staff member of Academia Sinica, 1957; Zhu
et al., 1981; Ding and Krishnamurti, 1987). They are also consistent with
the annual cold surge summaries of BMC (1990).<BR>

<P><A NAME="BM4_3_Temporal"></A>4.3 Temporal distribution of cold surges
and Siberian high </P>

<P><A HREF="f7a.htm">Figs. 7 (a)</A> and <A HREF="f7b.htm">(b)</A> give
the monthly cold surge events and the number of days that the Siberian
high central pressure is greater than 1050 hPa. The intensity of the Siberian
high tends to peak in December and January. However, the cold surge frequency
exhibits maxima in November and March. This result contradicts with the
well-accepted close relationship between the intensity of the Siberian
high and occurrence of cold surges (Ding, 1994). Both dynamical and thermodynamical
reasons can be attributed to this. </P>

<P>First, the East Asian large-scale flow is usually in a low-index mode
during the regime transition period of November and March (Zhu et al.,
1979). In December and January, however, the usual high-index large-scale
flow is characterized by a strong Siberian high and an intense jetstream.
This pattern is unfavorable for the occurrence of cold surges despite the
abundance of cold air during this time. This is because that the short
waves tend to move rapidly through such a pattern without causing any disturbances
(Boyle, 1986a). The low index flow background, on the other hand, typically
has a blocking over the Asian continent and deep troughing along the coast.
This flow pattern yields a northwesterly flow over Lake Baikal which is
highly unstable and more ready to release potential energy when triggered
by a short wave (Boyle, 1986a). </P>

<P>Secondly, an important criterion of a cold surge is the 24-48 hour surface
air temperature drop. During December and January, the jetstream is further
south and the surface air temperature is relatively lower. As such, it
takes a very strong anticyclone to induce a substantial temperature change
in a cold background. While the surface air temperature is relatively warmer
during November and March, cold air and anticyclones with modest intensity
can significantly reduce the surface air temperature. From the view of
weather forecasters, it is the cold surges that occur during November and
March that yield a more abrupt temperature drop have the most significant
damaging effect on local agriculture and economy. </P>

<P>Recently, a very similar monthly distribution of cold surges has been
found by Ding and collaborators based on cold surges from 6 winters (Ding,
personal communication, 1996). They suggest that the warm and moist troughs
that moving out of the Bay of Bengal result in the relatively lower frequency
cold surges during December and January. </P>

<P>As mentioned before, one of the necessary conditions of cold surge outbreak
is that the Siberian high reaches a certain intensity. But this is by no
means guarantee that the cold surge frequency should monotonically increase
as the Siberian high intensifies. The statistics based on the 17-year data
shown here and Ding's recent results do not support &quot;The higher the
Siberian high pressure, the greater the possibility of cold surge occurrence
&quot;(Ding, 1994), a statement that has been mistakenly known in the forecasting
community. </P>

<P>The temporal distribution of strong cold surges is examined. Of all
the 26 strong cases identified, 20 of them occurred in December, January
and February, and five in November, only one in March and none during October
or April. The strong cold surges tend to occur during very cold months.
This suggests that large surface pressure gradient associated with a very
strong surface anticyclone and abundant sources of cold air is an important
driving force to push the cold air far into the tropics. This result also
suggests that the intensity of the Siberian high may be related to the
occurrence of strong cold surges that affect the tropical regions. Because
the cold surge frequency is high in November and March and the prevailing
northeasterly wind dominates a large area of East Asia during these months,
November through March (NDJFM) should be the months for studying the East
Asian winter monsoon and cold surges, rather than December through February
(DJF) which the majority of winter monsoon studies has emphasized.<BR>

<P><A NAME="BM5__Interannual"></A><B>5. Interannual variation</B></P>

<P>In order to investigate the possible linkage between the interannual
variation of the East Asian winter monsoon and ENSO, the 1979-1995 winter
average Southern Oscillation Index is plotted in <A HREF="f8.htm">Fig.
8</A>. Although the Southern Oscillation is not a standing phenomenon,
the evolution of monsoon circulation during ENSO phases is ignored given
that the winter monsoon is not examined on a monthly basis. The two major
El Nino events of 1982/83 and 1986/87 exhibit low SOI. Negative departures
of the SOI also occur during the 1989/90 and 1991/92 seasons. The 1988/89
La Nina event has SOI in excess of 2 hPa. </P>

<P><A NAME="BM5_1_Cold"></A>5.1 Cold surges</P>

<P>The annual cold surge frequency is first examined. An interesting feature
in <A HREF="f9.htm">Fig. 9</A> is that minimum frequency events occurs
one year after the El Nino years. To test the robustness of this result,
we investigated the sensitivity of the cold surge frequency to the SLP
threshold in the cold surge definition. Aside from an expected decline
in cold surge frequency with a stricter SLP criterion, the interannual
variations were found to be insensitive. Further, the cold surge frequency
from BMC during 1980-1984 shows the same variation pattern as in Fig. 9.
Data from BMC also indicates that cold surge frequency reaches a minimum
one year after the 1957/58 and 1965/66 El Nino events. This phenomenon
agrees with the 1~1.5 year lag response of the northeast China surface
air temperature to the SST near the eastern equatorial Pacific suggested
by Bao et al. (1989). </P>

<P>As mentioned earlier, the definition of a cold surge is regionally dependent.
The cold surges identified above, which are in good agreement with the
observations from BMC, typically influence the bulk of East Asia and the
coastal regions. However, a subset of these cold surges can reach to the
South China Sea. This is illustrated in <A HREF="f10a.htm">Figs. 10 (a)</A>
and <A HREF="f10b.htm">(b),</A> time series of meridional wind in three
regions for the 1987/88 season, along with region 1 SLP. The phases of
SLP variation are exactly reversed to those of region 3 meridional wind,
which are followed chronologically by the similar variation patterns near
Taiwan and in the vicinity of the South China Sea. The lags between the
variation patterns in each region, which represent the southeast propagation
of the surface anticyclones, are around 1-3 days. </P>

<P>The typical synoptic scenario of the propagation is as follows, before
the outbreak of a cold surge, the intensification of the Siberian high
simultaneously strengthens the northeasterly flow near region 3. The outbreak
of the cold surge pushes the anticyclonic flow southeastward and increases
the notherlies near Taiwan region. The wind then subsequently penetrated
further into the northern part of the South China Sea and the cold surge
ended. According to the weather forecasters (Li, personal communication,
1996) of Hainan Island (18&deg;N, 110&deg;E), whether a cold surge will
affect the Island and the surrounding oceans depends on its path and intensity.
When this region is under the influence of a cold surge, the most conspicuous
weather phenomenon is the strong northeasterly wind. The seven strong wind
events (northerly wind &gt; 7 m/sec) near the South China Sea in the 1987/88
season, as indicated in <A HREF="f10a.htm">Fig. 10 (a)</A>, is a subset
of the eleven cold surges identified during the season. Strong wind events
for other years are also examined (not shown). We found that, with on exception,
every event is associated with a cold surge outbreak from the extratropics.</P>

<P>Because the surface meridional wind is the most important indicator
of the cold surge activity in Hainan area, we define the South China Sea
cold surge as the number of days that maximum northerly wind &gt; 7 m/s
in the region of (10&deg;N-20&deg;N,110&deg;E-120&deg;E). Similar definition
has been used by Chang and Chen (1992). Based on this definition, the South
China Sea cold surge frequency is shown in <A HREF="f11.htm">Fig. 11</A>.
The interannual variation of cold surge frequency is in good agreement
with the pattern of SOI (correlation coefficient = 0.85). Low cold surge
frequencies coincide with El Nino and low SOI events; high frequencies
accompany with La Nina and high SOI years. This agrees with observed strong
wind record of Hainan Island (Li, personal communication, 1996) for winters
of 1950-1980, which indicates that cold air activity is much reduced during
the years of 1957/58, 1965/66, 1968/69, and 1972/73, all are El Nino events.

<P><A NAME="BM5_2_Mean"></A>5.2 Mean meridional wind</P>

<P>Frequency of the South China Sea cold surges not only bears good relationship
with the SOI, but also largely controls the meridional wind variation over
the South China Sea and over even larger areas. <A HREF="f12.htm">Fig.
12</A> shows time series of mean meridional wind for increasingly larger
regions. The patterns in all the three regions are similar to that of the
SOI. In agreement with the cold surges, stronger northerlies occur during
La Nina and high SOI seasons, and weaker northerlies occur during El Nino
and low SOI years. The correlation coefficient between the SOI and the
meridional wind in the South China Sea (10&deg;N-20&deg;N,110&deg;E-120&deg;E)
is 0.82. By examining the same time series as in Fig. 12 but over many
nine-grid-point rectangular boxes near the western Pacific, we found that
this SOI-like pattern of the wind does not exist in any of the areas outside
the region of (0&deg;N-20&deg;N,100&deg;E-130&deg;E). </P>

<P>The meridional wind variation is a shallow phenomenon, occurring primarily
at the surface. This is demonstrated in Fig. 13 where the wind variations
near the South China Sea are plotted at the 925 hPa and 850 hPa levels.
Although the patterns at both levels still bear certain resemblance to
that of the SOI, the biennial oscillation is the dominant mode. At 700
hPa and above (not shown), the geostrophic flow is decidedly zonal over
the entire East Asian continent and the wind in the northern part of the
South China Sea is under great influence of the split jetstream south of
the Tibetan Plateau. The signature of the SOI has been totally lost. Clearly,
this SOI-like wind pattern is horizontally restricted within the region
of (0&deg;N-20&deg;N,100&deg;E-130&deg;E) and vertically confined to the
near surface layer. </P>

<P>Based on the above discussions, it is clear that the variation of area
averaged meridional wind near the South China Sea and the maritime continent
hinges on the variation of the South China Sea cold surges. The South China
Sea cold surges share the same origin as the conventionally defined cold
surges. The area averaged meridional wind near the South China Sea is thus
greatly controlled by the northerlies propagated from the extratropics.</P>

<P><A NAME="BM5_3_Large_scale"></A>5.3 Large-scale features </P>

<P>As mentioned earlier, the surface Siberian high, 500 hPa trough, and
the 200 hPa jetstream characterize the winter monsoon large-scale circulation
and their strength are inherently related to each other. </P>

<P><A HREF="f14.htm">Fig. 14</A> presents the number of days that the central
pressure is greater than 1050 hPa in the region of (45&deg;N-55&deg;N,
90&deg;E-110&deg;E). Although this is not the only measure of the Siberian
high intensity, the broad aspect of the interannual variation of this measure
agrees with the SOI. The variation patterns indicate that, in general,
the Siberian high is stronger (weaker) in La Nina (El Nino) and high (low)
SOI years. The mean meridional wind averaged over the southeast periphery
(5&deg;N-20&deg;N, 160&deg;E-180&deg;E) of the Siberian high, another way
to represent the intensity of the high pressure, shows exactly the same
result as that of Fig. 14 (not shown). </P>

<P>The variation of the 500 hPa geopotential height anomaly along 135&deg;E
is calculated. Although the overall variation pattern (not shown) is not
comparable with the SOI, the 500 hPa trough is weaker during 1982/83, 1986/87
and 1991/92 El Nino events. The 200 hPa East Asian jet is also examined.
Although this jet is subject to propagation or expansion in the east-west
direction during different phases of ENSO, the jet intensity (at 140&deg;E)
is found abnormally weak during all three major El Nino events (not shown).
This result is consistent with the weak Siberian high and 500 hPa trough.</P>

<P>Overall, the large-scale monsoon circulation is weaker than normal during
all the three major El Nino events. In particular, the variation pattern
of the Siberian high generally agrees with the SOI.<BR>

<P><A NAME="BM6_Summary"></A><B>6. Summary and discussion</B></P>

<P>The study of the East Asian winter monsoon and cold surges from the
1979-1995 NCEP/NCAR reanalyses has revealed and extended several noteworthy
climatological features of the winter monsoon. According to the conventional
cold surge criteria, about 13 cold surges occur every winter season, of
which two are strong cases that influence the tropical region. The average
lifetime of the cold surges is about 7 days and the average intensity of
highs is 1053 hPa. The strong cases usually last for about 9 days with
average intensity of 1060 hPa.</P>

<P>The cold surges tend to originate from two source regions: one is near
the northwest of Lake Baikal and the other is to the north of Lake Balkhash.
The high pressure centers propagate southeastward, and end in the east
and southeast of China and surrounding oceans. Consistent with trajectories
of pressure centers, correlation patterns indicate that the signature of
associated SLP, surface wind and surface air temperature stretches further
south and east. The southward extent includes the bulk of the maritime
continent; the eastward extent reaches 150&deg;E. </P>

<P>Although the intensity of the Siberian high varies according to the
season and reaches its peak in January, the cold surges are most active
during November and March.This result suggests that November through March
should be considered as the East Asian winter monsoon season. It also indicates
that the occurrence of cold surges does not monotonically increase with
the strengthening of the Siberian high, an empirical rule that has been
widely believed in the forecasting community. Examination of monthly distribution
of strong cold surges indicates, however, that the majority of strong cold
surges occurs during DJF. This result suggests that large pressure gradient
associated with strong Siberian high is an important driving force to push
the cold air far into the tropics.</P>

<P>The two stratifications of cold surges are revealing when considering
the relationship between ENSO and the interannual variation of the cold
air activity. The first stratification, as described in the cold surge
identification criteria, yields result that is consistent with the in situ
observation from BMC. The interannual variation of cold surge frequency
shows that minimum surge frequency occurs one year after an El Nino event.
The second stratification, based on the maximum meridional wind event in
the South China Sea, indicates that the interannual variation of the South
China Sea cold surge is in good agreement with the SOI. High cold surge
frequency is found during La Nina and high SOI events, low frequency is
associated with El Nino and low SOI events. </P>

<P>The variation of the mean meridional wind near the South China Sea and
tge narutune hinges on the South China Sea cold surges. As in the case
of the cold surges, the interannual variation of the wind is also well
correlated with the SOI. Strong wind years are associated with La Nina
and high SOI events; weak wind years are found during El Nino and low SOI
events. This pattern of variation is restricted north of the equator within
(0&deg;N-20&deg;N,100&deg;E-130&deg;E), and confined to the near surface
layer. The interannual variation of the Siberian high, measured by means
of both pressure and wind, is in general agreement with the SOI. Both the
strength of the 200 hPa jetstream and the 500 hPa trough are found to be
weaker than normal during El Nino events, although their interannual variation
patterns do not agree with the SOI as closely as that of the Siberian high.</P>

<P>Given the close relationship between the SOI and the interannual variation
of the monsoon meridional wind and cold surges, it is natural to wonder
why some of the monsoon related disturbances, either originated from or
located in the extratropics, exhibit variation patterns similar to the
SOI, and what are the physical mechanisms between the ENSO/winter monsoon
interaction. </P>

<P>During a typical El Nino year, the convective activity in the maritime
continent is usually reduced. If the cumulus convection in this region
is one of the most important monsoon energy sources as suggested by Ramage
(1971), the suppression of the maritime convection should be responsible,
at least partly, for the weaker than normal extratropical monsoon circulation
during El Nino events. With the available observed outgoing longwave radiation
(OLR) data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we
have computed the OLR anomaly in the maritime continent (110&deg;E-120&deg;E,
5&deg;N-5&deg;S) from 1979-1992. The overall interannual variation pattern
(not shown here) is not as close to the SOI as that of the South China
Sea cold surges or the Siberian high. However, negative anomaly is found
during the 1988/89 La Nina season; likewise, positive OLR anomalies are
found during the 1982/83 and 1986/87 El Nino seasons. The correlation coefficient
between the OLR anomaly and the SOI is |R|=0.5.</P>

<P>On the other hand, evidence indicated that the winter monsoon and cold
air activity can greatly affect the tropical convective activity and SST.
Slingo (1996, personal communication) found that Indonesian convection
is enhanced when cold surges penetrated far into the tropics. Chang et
al. (1979) have shown that cold surges are capable of influencing the tropical
SST. But whether the cold surges can significantly affect the tropical
region, as has been discussed, depends on the intensity and path of the
cold surges. It may also relate to the background large-scale circulation.
Theoretical studies have suggested (Branstator 1983, Lau and Lim 1984)
that the interaction between the tropical convection and midlatitude circulation
depends critically on the relative position of the convection and extratropical
quasi-stationary waves. It has also been suggested that the interaction
between cold surges and convective activities near the maritime continent
will in turn modify the extratropical and tropical synoptic and planetary
scale circulations (Chang and Lau, 1980). Apparently, further studies are
much needed to delineate the mechanism of the interaction between the winter
monsoon and convection near the maritime continent.</P>

<P>In summary, in addition to extend and substantiate the climatological
aspects of the East Asian winter monsoon and cold surges, the current study
has clearly indicated that the interannual variation of the South China
Sea cold surges is in good agreement with the SOI. The South China Sea
cold surges share the same origin with the conventionally defined cold
surges. They also dominate the variation of the area averaged meridional
wind near the South China Sea and the western Pacific. The conventionally
defined cold surges, on the other hand, reached minimum frequencies one
year after El Nino events. Large-scale monsoon circulations are found to
be weaker than normal during El Nino years. However, physical mechanisms
responsible for the interaction between ENSO and the winter monsoon are
still not well understood, especially problems on if and how the winter
monsoon cold air activity affects the ENSO through its impact on tropical
SST pattern and convective activities in the maritime continent. Simulations
of coupled ocean models and GCM simulations with specified observed SST,
such as simulations from the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(AMIP), should provide a good opportunity to address these problems. <BR>

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN//2.0"><HTML><HEAD><TITLE>What's New</TITLE></HEAD>
<body background="gifs/blue_paper.gif">
<BODY><h2>What's New?</h2>
Version 1.3 of this hypertext summary documentation of the AMIP models (released on November 15, 1996) shows many changes from Version 1.2 (released August 10, 1995)--see  the <a href="01bckgrnd.html">History of Changes</a> for a comprehensive listing. 
<P>
Aside from numerous minor corrections and updates, Verson 1.3 includes <A HREF="01toc.html">summary reports and tables</A> on 16 new models that have been used for the AMIP I  experiment (i.e., for the period 1979-1988).  Three of these models are the entries of new AMIP groups (<A HREF="12ccsr_ToC.html">CCSR</A>, <A HREF="23llnl_ToC.html">LLNL</A>, <A HREF="30ntu_ToC.html">NTU</A>), while the remainder are newer versions of models from AMIP groups that elected to repeat the experiment.  For the latter cases, the new model reports express the <I>differences</I> from the original (or "baseline") model of each group.
<P>
Another Version 1.3 innovation  is the use of <A HREF="10sumtbls.html">HTML 3.0 tables</A> (rather than the gif images of earlier versions) to express selected features across all the AMIP models.  In addition to enhancing readability, the new tables allow the incluson of hyperlinks to directly connect the abbreviated table entries with the fuller descriptions of the model reports.
<P>
Finally, users can download Version 1.3 as <A HREF="ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/phillips/amipdoc/html/amipdochtml.tar.Z">compressed HTML</A> or <A HREF="ftp://sprite.llnl.gov/pub/phillips/amipdoc/postscript/amipdocps.tar.Z">compressed Postscript</A> for local viewing or printing.

<BR>
</B>In this study, satellite derived outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)
and the reanalysis from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) are used as verification data
in a study of intraseasonal variability in the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres
(GLA) and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) atmospheric general
circulation models. These models simulated the most realistic intraseasonal
oscillations (IO) of the 15 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project models
examined by Slingo et al. (1995, 1996). During the active phase of the
intraseasonal oscillation, convection is observed to migrate from the Indian
Ocean to the western/central Pacific Ocean, and into the South Pacific
Convergence Zone (SPCZ). The simulated convection, particularly in the
GLA model, is most realistic over the western/central Pacific Ocean and
the SPCZ. In the reanalysis, the baroclinic structure of the IO is evident
in the eddy-streamfunction, and eastward migration of the anticyclone/cyclone
pairs occurs in conjunction with the eastward development of convection.
Both the GLA and UKMO models exhibit a baroclinic structure on intraseasonal
time scales. The GLA model is more realistic than the UKMO model at simulating
the eastward migration of the anticyclone/cyclone pairs when the convection
is active over the western/central Pacific. In the UKMO model, the main
heating is located off the equator, which contributes to the irregular
structures seen in this model on intraseasonal time scales.

<P>The maintenance and initiation of the intraseasonal oscillation has
also been investigated. Analysis of the latent heat flux indicates that
evaporative wind feedback and frictional wave-CISK (conditional instability
of the second-kind) are not the dominant mechanisms for promoting the eastward
propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation since evaporation to the west
of the convection dominants. In the GLA model, enhanced evaporation tends
to develop in-place over the west Pacific warm pool, while in the UKMO
simulation westward propagation of enhanced evaporation is evident. It
is suggested that lack of an interactive ocean may be associated with the
models systematic failure to simulate the eastward transition of convection
from the Indian Ocean into the western Pacific Ocean since examination
of observed sea surface temperature (SST) and its relationship to the active
phase of the intraseasonal oscillation indicates that the intraseasonal
oscillation may evolve as a coupled ocean-atmosphere mode. Above normal
SST to the east of the convection may play a role in maintaining the eastward
evolution of convection, while decreasing SSTs near the western portion
of the convective envelope are associated with the cessation of convection.<BR>

<P><A NAME="1.  INTRODUCTION"></A><B>1. &nbsp;INTRODUCTION</B></P>

<P>The Madden-Julian (Intraseasonal) Oscillation is a dominant mode of
variability in the tropics (Madden and Julian 1971, 1972). It has long
been recognized that it is manifested on a time scale of ~30-60 days through
large-scale circulation anomalies, which occur in conjunction with eastward
evolving convective anomalies. These features are strongest and most coherent
during the boreal winter/spring when the western Pacific warm pool is centered
at or near the equator. The intraseasonal oscillation (IO) tends to move
most slowly over the Eastern Hemisphere where the convective signature
is most readily apparent. The current paradigm suggests that while convection
is active, the propagation is slow because the IO behaves like a moist
Kelvin wave. Once the convection subsides, usually in the vicinity of the
dateline, the IO behaves much like a dry Kelvin wave which has a faster
phase speed. The response to the convection is a forced Rossby wave which
is characterized by upper-tropospheric cyclones (anticyclones) that lead
(trail) the convection. These characteristics of the life cycle of intraseasonal
oscillations have been described by many authors (e.g., Knutson and Weickmann
1987, Rui and Wang 1990, Matthews 1993, Hendon and Salby 1994). Given the
dominance of this mode of variability, and the fact that suppressed convection
tends to precede and follow the active phase of the oscillation, the IO
is a useful tool for medium- and long-range weather forecasting in the
tropics.</P>

<P>The IO also influences the extratropics. As the tropical convective
heating makes it way into the western/central Pacific, teleconnections
into the extratropics have been noted (Ferranti et al. 1990, Lau and Chang
1992, Higgins and Schubert 1995, Higgins and Mo 1996). Ferranti et al.
(1990) demonstrated that the tropical intraseasonal oscillation projects
on to the Pacific/North American and North Atlantic oscillation patterns.
Their numerical experiments indicated that Northern Hemisphere forecast
skill scores were improved when tropical heating due to strong intraseasonal
oscillations was captured. Similar results were found by Lau and Chang
(1992). Thus, the IO is also important for medium- and extended-range weather
forecasts in the extratropics.</P>

<P>The signature of the IO has also been observed in the ocean. Sea surface
temperature (SST) variations of ~0.5&deg;K have been observed in conjunction
with the passage of intraseasonal oscillations (Krishnamurti et al. 1988,
Gutzler et al. 1994, Zhang and McPhaden 1995). Also, during the Tropical
Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE),
intraseasonal oscillations were observed to initiate downwelling oceanic
Kelvin waves in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which had the effect of shifting
the warm pool slightly eastward (Weickmann et al. 1994). Thus, the IO is
truly a global scale phenomenon, affecting both the atmosphere and ocean,
and even the length of day via modulation of the Earth's angular momentum
(Rosen and Salstein 1983). The IO merits much additional observational,
modelling and theoretical investigation especially since theories regarding
its initiation and maintenance are the subject of much debate (e.g., Hayashi
and Golder 1993, Chao and Lin 1994).</P>

<P>The simulation of intraseasonal oscillations by general circulation
models has been problematic. Models typically fail to capture the dominant
periodicity of the intraseasonal oscillation, simulating oscillations that
are usually weaker and not as spatially coherent as observed, and with
the correct seasonality not well reproduced (Hayashi and Golder 1986, 1988,
Lau and Lau 1986, Pitcher and Geisler 1987, von Storch et al. 1988, Park
et al. 1990, and Slingo and Madden 1991). All of these shortcomings were
manifested to one degree or another in the suite of 15 atmospheric general
circulation models (GCMs) analyzed by Slingo et al. (1995, 1996). Their
analysis used daily time-longitude output of 10&deg;N-10&deg;S averaged upper-tropospheric
velocity potential and zonal wind from 10-year simulations of the period
1979-88. These simulations were performed as part of the Atmospheric Model
Intercomparison Project (AMIP) in which the models were integrated using
the same monthly mean SST data (Gates 1992, WMO 1995). The amplitude of
20-100 day bandpass filtered zonal mean u-wind was found to be useful for
quantifying the ability of the models to simulate the IO. Based on this
stratification, it was found that models with weak seasonal cycles underestimated
the strength of the IO. Also, the models with the strongest IO's were best
at simulating the observed rainfall/SST relationship over the warm pool
during northern winter. This may be important from the point of view of
the current paradigm of the IO, which hypothesizes that it is a moist Kelvin
wave maintained by diabatic heating. Models with weak convection over the
warm pool would be less likely to maintain eastward propagation of the
wave since it would dissipate more quickly due to insufficient heating.
Additional results from that study also suggest that improved simulation
of the climatology and the seasonal cycle by GCMs may result in better
IO's. Stratification according to physical parameterization strongly suggested
that the quality of the IO variability is linked to the type of closure
used in the convective parameterization, with buoyancy closure being preferable
to moisture convergence.</P>

<P>While the afore-mentioned difficulties are somewhat discouraging, the
purpose of this paper is to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution
of intraseasonal oscillations in the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres
(GLA) and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) GCMs, two of
the models with the most realistic IO's from Slingo et al. (1995, 1996).
These models were most realistic in that they simulated 20-100 day bandpass
filtered 200hPa velocity potential and zonal wind anomalies of similar
magnitude to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts /Joint
Diagnostics Project (ECMWF/JDP) analyses. Even so, these models failed
to reproduce the observed broad spectral peak in the 40-60 day interval
based on the average power spectrum of all years of data. However, there
were limited periods when these two models produced intraseasonal oscillations
that were well defined, and with the correct periodicity. For such periods
the life cycle of the IO will be studied through the analysis of streamfunction,
outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and other dynamical/physical quantities.
In Section 2 the models and verification data are described, and in Section
3 the climatological base state is presented. In Section 4 the convective
evolution and vertical structure of the IO is analyzed using EOF and correlation
analysis, and in Section 5 various maintenance mechanisms are evaluated.
The role of SST and the possibility that the IO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere
mode is discussed in Section 6, and general discussion and conclusions
are presented in Section 7. <BR>

<P><A NAME="2.   THE MODELS AND"></A><B>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE MODELS
AND DATA</B></P>

<P>The National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis (Kalnay and Jenne 1991, Kalnay
et al. 1996) and satellite derived OLR (Gruber and Winston 1978, Gruber
and Krueger 1984) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) are the main data sets used for verification of the simulations.
Subsequently, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis is simply referred to as the reanalysis,
while other analysis products are referred to explicitly ECMWF/JDP analysis,
National Meteorological Center [NMC] analysis). The reanalysis data set
is generated using a ''frozen'' state of the art data assimilation scheme
and model. As such, this data set is based on a homogeneous system, and
hence does not suffer from inconsistencies introduced by changing models
and assimilation schemes which characterize the previous ECMWF/JDP and
NMC analyses. Although the satellite derived OLR and reanalysis data is
available for a longer record, we concentrate on 1979-88 (unless otherwise
specifically mentioned) since this corresponds to the period over which
the AMIP integrations were performed.</P>

<P>The GLA model analyzed here is version GCM 01.0 AMIP-1, circa 1992.
It is a gridpoint model with 4&deg; latitude x 5&deg; longitude resolution and
17 sigma levels in the vertical. Of particular relevance to this study,
the convective parametrization is a modified version of Arakawa and Schubert
(1974), in which different values of the "critical cloud work function"
are prescribed for different cloud types, including a parameterization
of evaporation of falling rain applied to both large-scale and convective
precipitation (Sud and Walker 1992, 1993).</P>

<P>The UKMO UM-Climate 1, circa 1993, is also analyzed. This is a gridpoint
model with 2.5&deg; latitude x 3.75&deg; longitude resolution and 19 vertical sigma
levels. The convection scheme is a modified version of the Yanai et al.
(1973) mass-flux scheme. Both updrafts and downdrafts are represented,
and specific details of the buoyancy closure are described in Gregory and
Rowntree (1990). Comprehensive details of the lineage, physics, and numerics
of these models (and all of the AMIP models) may be found in Phillips (1994).</P>

<P>In some cases, the data analyzed are bandpass filtered using a 20-100
day Lanczos filter to isolate more clearly intraseasonal variations. This
filter was used extensively in Slingo et al. (1995, 1996), where its response
function is given. Henceforth, data processed with this filter are referred
to as the "filtered" data.<BR>

<P><A NAME="3.  CLIMATOLOGICAL"></A><B>3. &nbsp;CLIMATOLOGICAL STRUCTURES</B></P>

<P><I>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;OLR: Time-mean and Variability</I></P>

<P>The time-mean OLR during northern winter, when the IO is most active,
is shown in <A HREF="f1.htm">Fig. 1</A> from NOAA
satellite observations, and for the models for the period of the AMIP integrations.
The models do a reasonable job of representing the basic structures of
the OLR. They capture the locations of the high OLR associated with the
subsidence of the subtropical highs. In the western Pacific, where the
reservoir of SST &gt;28&deg;C is substantial, the models generate deep convection.
However, there are several noticeable differences that are particularly
relevant to this study. Both models erroneously simulate convective maxima
over the central Indian Ocean, while failing to produce low OLR in the
vicinity of the Maritime continent. In the case of the UKMO model, the
convective maxima in the Indian Ocean is displaced near 10&deg;S. Also, in
both models the minimum values of OLR over the western Pacific Ocean are
not as low as observed.</P>

<P><A HREF="f2.htm">Figure 2</A> shows the standard
deviation of the OLR (based on 9-year average of the variance during each
four month boreal winter period). As demonstrated in previous studies (e.g.,
Slingo et al. 1992), regions of the lowest average OLR are typically coincident
with the largest variations in OLR as seen for the observations. While
this is the case for the GLA model, the UKMO model tends to exhibit the
largest OLR variations along the periphery of the low OLR values in the
time mean (<A HREF="f1.htm">Fig. 1</A>) This is
particularly apparent over the Indian Ocean and western Pacific where the
largest variations are located poleward of the OLR minima. The models also
exhibit larger variations than observed. This was also noted by Slingo
et al. (1995, 1996) with regard to the amplitude of the zonal wind on seasonal
and intraseasonal time scales.</P>

<P>In observations the dominant heating on intraseasonal time scales occurs
in the vicinity of the eastern Indian Ocean and the Maritime continent.
This is shown in <A HREF="f2.htm">Fig. 2</A> where &gt;20%percent of the
total variance of OLR is associated with intraseasonal time scales (30-70
days). During individual winters (e.g., 1987/88) intraseasonal time scales
can account for upwards of 50-60% of the total variance in OLR over the
eastern Indian Ocean. Substantial intraseasonal modulation of convection
over Southeast Asia, Australia and in the South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) is also observed. For the GLA model, the fraction of total variance
explained by intraseasonal time scales is smaller and less coherent than
observed. A local maxima is located over the central Indian Ocean coincident
with the OLR minima seen in <A HREF="f1.htm">Fig. 1</A>. Also, there is a pronounced underestimate of intraseasonal variability
near Indonesia. This is also the case for the UKMO model, which simulates
bimodal off-equatorial intraseasonal variability over the western Pacific
Ocean.<BR>
</P>

<P><I>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotational Flow Response</I></P>

<P>In this section we describe the current paradigm of the intraseasonal
oscillation using EOF analysis of filtered eddy-streamfunction and show
the dominant rotational wind structures. For the reanalysis and models,
the filtered data is generated on their respective longitude/latitude grids.
Prior to the calculation of the EOF's, the data is area-weight interpolated
to an 8&deg; x 10&deg; latitude/longitude grid. Cosine latitude weighting has been
used in the calculation of the EOF's.</P>

<P>The current paradigm of the intraseasonal oscillation is that it is
a Kelvin wave/Rossby wave interaction. The Kelvin wave signature of the
intraseasonal oscillation is most readily identified in upper-tropospheric
velocity potential (not shown). Time-longitude plots of upper tropospheric
filtered ECMWF/JDP analyses (Hoskins et al. 1989) have been presented in
Slingo et al. (1995, 1996). Space-time decomposition of this unfiltered
data demonstrate the dominance of the eastward propagating wave-1 IO signature
with a periodicity of ~50 days (not shown). The response of the rotational
flow to the convective heating anomalies is a Rossby wave pattern (Knutson
and Weickmann 1987, Rui and Wang 1990). Matthews (1993) showed this response
pattern in an EOF analysis of ECMWF/JDP 150hPa eddy-streamfunction that
was filtered to isolate intraseasonal time scales. This pattern is shown
in <A HREF="f3.htm">Fig. 3</A> for DJF for the period 1982/83-1989/90.
As indicated by the schematic diagram in Fig. 3, during the active phase
of the IO, cyclones lead the heating anomalies associated with the increased
planetary scale divergence over the Maritime continent, and an anticyclone
pair trails. EOF analysis of the reanalysis data set for the same period
demonstrates these same features with minor modification. The older ECMWF/JDP
and NMC analyses were subject to uncertainties introduced by changing assimilation
schemes and models. Even so, from ~1985 onward, the time-longitude filtered
upper tropospheric velocity potential from the ECMWF/JDP analyses and the
reanalysis are typically consistent in magnitude and phase. These results
confirm the robustness of the dominant patterns of the rotational and divergent
flow associated with the IO. In the remainder of the paper the reanalysis
data set is used for verification.</P>

<P>During the AMIP decade, nine winter/spring periods (November-May 1979/80-1987/88)
are available from which we generate the first two EOF's of the 200hPa
eddy-streamfunction from the reanalysis, and the GLA and UKMO simulations
<A HREF="f4.htm">(Fig. 4)</A>. As in <A HREF="f3.htm">Fig.
3</A>, EOF-1 from the reanalysis is the forced Rossby wave response to
the divergent outflow. EOF-2 corresponds to an eastward displacement of
the trailing anticyclones. EOF-1 in conjunction with EOF-2 describe the
eastward translation of the 200hPa eddy-streamfunction anticyclone/cyclone
complex as the intraseasonal convective heating migrates to the east. EOF-1
from the GLA model is similar to that from the reanalysis, although the
eddy-streamfunction complex is displaced to the west, being centered over
the Indian Ocean near the OLR minima seen in <A HREF="f1.htm">Fig. 1</A>.
In EOF-2 an eastward displacement of the trailing anticyclones is seen,
particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. As for the reanalysis, these two
EOF's in combination represent the eastward propagation of the Rossby wave
response. However, the GLA model simulates a more distinctive extratropical
wave train pattern in the Northern Hemisphere than suggested by the reanalysis.
For the UKMO model, EOF-2 more closely represents EOF-1 from the reanalysis
based on the location of the trailing anticyclones. The leading cyclones
over the Maritime continent are weak, and an extratropical wave-train pattern
dominates. EOF-1 is an eastward displacement of the trailing anticyclones
akin to that observed from EOF-2 of the reanalysis. In the reanalysis,
these IO related eddy-streamfunction loadings account for 23% of the variance
of periods between 20 and 100 days. However, the percent variance explained
by these modes is lower in the models than for the reanalysis, indicating
that the simulated IO time scales are noisier. This is consistent with
the results presented in Slingo et al. (1995, 1996).</P>

<P><A NAME="4.  INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION CASE"></A><B>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRASEASONAL
OSCILLATION CASE STUDIES</B></P>

<P>Many previous studies have used various techniques (regression, EOF
analysis, etc.) to generate composite life cycles of the IO based on many
years of data (e.g., Knutson and Weickmann 1987, Rui and Wang 1990, Hendon
and Salby 1994). While using many years of data retains the large scale
characteristics of the mode in question, it is desirable to analyze case
studies in an effort to address specific (and perhaps localized) processes/mechanisms
which may be operative and otherwise obscured from compositing over many
years (e.g., Matthews et al. 1996). Also, more importantly from a modelling
point of view, the GCMs exhibit difficulty at simulating coherent intraseasonal
oscillations. Space-time spectra and time-longitude plots of 10&deg;N-10&deg;S
averaged filtered 200hPa velocity potential presented in Slingo et al.
(1995, 1996) indicated that no model was able to capture the dominance
of the intraseasonal oscillation found in the ECMWF/JDP analyses. However,
in the case of the GLA and UKMO models, when a clear eastward propagating
signal is evident, the period of the oscillation is realistic. (The NCAR
CCM2 AMIP model also showed similar realistic intraseasonal variations
on occasion, but high frequency (daily) longitude-latitude data were not
available with which to perform an analysis for this paper.) Therefore,
in order to show the models in their best light, we examine the winter/spring
period during which these models exhibited their strongest and most coherent
intraseasonal oscillations. In the case of the GLA model, the winter of
1986/87 exhibited the best intraseasonal oscillations, while the winter
1980/81 from UKMO will be analyzed. These will be compared with the winter
of 1987/88 from observations and the reanalysis.</P>

<P>1987/1988 was observed to be a period of particularly active intraseasonal
variability (Matthews et al. 1996), which can be seen in the time-longitude
plot of 10&deg;N-10&deg;S averaged filtered 200hPa velocity potential from the
reanalysis (<A HREF="f5.htm">Fig. 5)</A>.
Coherent eastward propagation is evident, with the intraseasonal oscillation
making several apparent circuits of the globe from November through May
with a period of ~45 days. As we are interested in the convection associated
with the passage of the active phase of the IO in the vicinity of the Austral
monsoon, and as noted earlier this is also the region where the heating
associated with the intraseasonal oscillation tends to be strongest, we
average the filtered velocity potential between 100&deg;-140&deg;E. The resulting
pentad averaged IO index, also presented in <A HREF="f5.htm">Fig. 5</A>, has been standardized
by removal of the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (based on
17 years of reanalysis 1979-1995). As we can see, the amplitude of the
intraseasonal oscillation exceeds +/-3 standard deviations during February
and March 1988. This IO index, and those generated from the model case
studies, are used in the correlation analyses presented throughout this
paper in which we examine the relationship of the IO to convection, filtered
streamfunction, filtered latent heat flux, and filtered SST.<BR>
</P>

<P><I>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Convective Evolution</I></P>

<P>In order to examine the convection associated with the intraseasonal
oscillation, we correlate the observed IO index from <A HREF="f5.htm">Fig.
5</A> with pentad averaged NOAA OLR. It is important to note that the OLR
data has not been filtered in an other way. In <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig. 6</A>
the correlations of the IO index and OLR at various time lags are shown
for the 1987/88 seven-month case study period. These panels show the spatio-temporal
evolution of the convection associated with the intraseasonal oscillation.
The convention is such that a negative IO index (the active phase of the
intraseasonal oscillation) is associated with reduced OLR. Thus, positive
correlations indicate enhanced convection. Enhanced convection (suppressed
convection) significant at <u>&gt;</u>95% confidence level is shaded grey (black).
At day -15, a small region of enhanced convection is located over the tropical
western Indian Ocean. Over the western Pacific Ocean a large region of
suppressed convection is observed. At day -10 enhanced convection extends
over most of the tropical Indian Ocean, and the suppressed convection is
now dominant near the SPCZ. The development of convection over the eastern
Indian Ocean is readily apparent by day -5. At a lag of 0 days, enhanced
convection covers the eastern Indian Ocean and Maritime continent, from
10&deg;N extending southward over Australia. The convection is most developed
at this time in the vicinity of the region from which we generated the
IO index (100&deg;-140&deg;E, 10&deg;N-10&deg;S, the box in the day -15 panel). At positive
time lags, the convection associated with the intraseasonal oscillation
is found further east. Enhanced convection near the SPCZ is noted at lags
of +10 and +15 days as the convection weakens and diminishes in spatial
extent. At this time suppressed convection develops over the Indian Ocean
subsequent to passage of the active phase of the oscillation (day +10 and
day +15). While the spatial extent of the convective envelope varies from
year to year, it consistently exhibits the contiguous eastward transition
from the Indian Ocean through to the western Pacific. Eastward development
of convective anomalies over this region were noted by Kousky (1985) during
the winter 1984/85 in a time-longitude plot of NOAA OLR. The spatio-temporal
evolution of the intraseasonal convective anomalies in <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig.
6</A> is consistent with the one-point correlations of broadband OLR presented
by Lau and Chan (1985), the development described in Weickmann et al. (1985),
the convective life-cycle of the intraseasonal oscillation presented in
Hendon and Salby (1994), and the extended EOF analysis of Lau and Chan
(1985) and Murakami et al. (1986).</P>

<P>To represent concisely the spatio-temporal evolution of the enhanced
convection seen in <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig. 6</A>, we plot in <A HREF="f7.htm">Fig.
7 </A>the time lag at which the positive correlation between the IO index
and the OLR is a maximum. Data is plotted only at those gridpoints for
which the correlation coefficient is significant at <u>&gt;</u>95% confidence
level. (At each gridpoint there are 7 correlation coefficients corresponding
to the different lag correlations, as seen in Fig. 6. We then only consider
positive correlations significant at <u>&gt;</u>95% confidence level [shaded
grey in Fig. 6], plotting in <A HREF="f7.htm">Fig. 7</A> the time lag at
which the positive correlation is a maximum. This indicates the time when
the convection is most enhanced with respect to the IO index). The associated
maximum correlations are contoured over the time lags to provide information
regarding the strength of the relationship. Results from the GLA and UKMO
cases studies are also presented in Fig. 7.</P>

<P>Serial correlation may reduce the effective degrees of freedom used
to estimate the 95% confidence level (currently 41 degrees of freedom are
assumed based on correlating 43 pentads of data). However, the coherent
spatial signature of the correlation coefficients and the lag structure
seen in <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig. 6 </A>and <A HREF="f7.htm">Fig. 7</A> indicate
the IO index/OLR association is physically based. Also, while a more stringent
estimate of the degrees of freedom would reduce the area of the convective
signature, the associated eastward translation of the convection would
remain intact.</P>

<P>Clearly, at negative time lags the observed convection is enhanced west
of region from which we obtained our IO index. From day -15 through day
-5 the convective envelope expands eastward into the eastern Indian Ocean.
Both models fail to capture this eastward transition of enhanced convection
over the Indian Ocean. This shortcoming also occurs in other years of the
simulations, and is also seen in the seasonal variance statistics on IO
time scales (<A HREF="f2.htm">Fig. 2</A>).
On day 0 through day +5 the observed convection is enhanced over the Maritime
continent, extending southward over Australia. This is the time when the
models first generate realistic IO related convection, although the spatial
extent of the simulated convective envelopes are not as extensive as observed.
At subsequent time lags, the observed convection extends further east and
into the SPCZ. The GLA model is most realistic in this regard, while the
correlations from the UKMO model are particularly weak and not well defined
(even in the mean state <A HREF="f1.htm">[Fig. 1]</A> OLR <U>&lt;</U>210w m<SUP>-2</SUP>
in the SPCZ is not produced by this model).</P>

<P>The strength and extent of the SPCZ OLR anomalies is interpretable in
terms of the mechanism proposed by Matthews et al. (1996) by which ascent
is excited over this region. Their mechanism was developed based on diagnostic
analysis of the strong IO that occurred during late March 1988, and through
the use of an idealized model to ascertain cause and effect. They concluded
that ascent over the SPCZ, and hence enhanced convection, could be excited
in response to the incursion of high potential vorticity air from the southern
extratropics on the eastern flank of the upper-tropospheric anticyclone
that is established as the forced Rossby model response to convection over
Indonesia. Their idealized modelling studies indicated that the strength
of the SPCZ excitation was sensitive to the latitude of the heating over
Indonesia. The weak SPCZ signature in the UKMO case study presented in
<A HREF="f7.htm">Fig. 7</A> is consistent with the heating near Indonesia
being mainly confined north of the equator.</P>

<P>While the eastward propagation of the convective signature in these
models shows some improvement relative to previous studies (e.g., Lau and
Lau 1986, Pitcher and Geisler 1987, von Storch et al. 1988, Park et al.
1990, Slingo and Madden 1991), our results indicate that the models fail
to simulate the close association of the 200hPa velocity potential IO index
and convection (primarily over the Indian Ocean) seen on the observations.
Where eastward migration of the OLR signature is found in the models, the
spatial extent of the convective envelope is more confined than observed.
Dynamical phenomena associated with these shortcomings will be discussed
shortly.<BR>
</P>

<P><I>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical Structure of the Rotational Flow</I></P>

<P>In Section 3b we presented evidence that the models simulated a Rossby-wave
pattern at 200hPa on intraseasonal time scales. However, the anticyclone/cyclone
pairs tended to be displaced from the locations seen in the reanalysis.
We now present a similar analysis for the case studies discussed in Section
4a, and also include an analysis at 850hPa to evaluate the vertical structure
of the IO. Also, the principal component time series are presented to provide
information on the phase variations of the Rossby gyres, and their relationship
to the IO indices used for the OLR correlations <A HREF="f7.htm">(Fig.
7)</A>.</P>

<P>Note: For the reanalysis and the models, the streamfunction (and velocity
potential) were calculated from the u- and v-wind components. For the GLA
model, there were missing data where the 850hPa pressure surface was below
the orography. This occurred principally over the Tibetan Plateau, Antarctica,
a portion of Greenland, and a few gridpoints over the Rockies and Andes.
Since the sigma surface data were not available for vertical extrapolation
over these locations, missing values of the zonal wind were interpolated
as a function of longitude along each latitude circle. The missing values
of meridional wind were interpolated as a function of latitude at each
longitude. Where missing data existed around a complete latitude circle
(Antarctica), data from the previous (more equatorward) latitude circle
was used. In order to test the utility of this interpolation procedure,
a similar missing data mask was applied to the u- and v-wind data from
the reanalysis at 850hPa, and the interpolation procedure applied to the
daily data. The streamfunction calculation, bandpass filtering etc. were
then applied to this filled data set as usual, with the result that the
EOF's/PC's and streamfunction lag correlations with the IO index (Sections
4b and 4c) were virtually identical to those from the raw reanalysis. Thus,
we conclude that this filling procedure does not detrimentally affect the
diagnostics presented at 850hPa for the GLA model.</P>

<P>The reanalyzed and simulated EOF's of the 200hPa and 850hPa filtered
eddy-streamfunction for the case study periods are presented in Figs. <A HREF="f8.htm">8</A>-<A HREF="f10.htm">10</A>.
Even for this seven month period, the first EOF at 200hPa from the reanalysis
<A HREF="f8.htm">(Fig. 8)</A> shows a Rossby-wave pattern similar to that
presented in <A HREF="f4.htm">Fig. 4</A> for all winters. This rotational
flow complex is clearly associated with the IO since its principal component
(PC-1, thick solid black line in <A HREF="f8.htm">Fig. 8</A>) varies in-phase with the IO index
(thick solid grey line) used for the OLR correlations in Section 4a. During
the active phase of the intraseasonal oscillation (negative IO index) a
leading cyclone pair, and a trailing anticyclone pair are centered about
the upper-level outflow region in the vicinity of maximum heating near
the Maritime continent. The second EOF is in quadrature with the first,
with the anticyclone pair displaced to the east over the Maritime continent.
The second PC at 200hPa, denoted by the thick dashed black line in <A HREF="f8.htm">Fig.
8,</A> is out of phase with PC-1. Together these two EOF modes describe the
migration of the rotational flow associated with the eastward propagation
of the intraseasonal oscillation. That this was a year of very strong intraseasonal
activity is reflected in the percent variance explained by these two EOF
modes at 200hPa. In Fig.4 based on nine winter/springs, these two modes
accounted for 23% of the filtered eddy-streamfunction variance, while for
the period of this case study these modes explain 42% of the variance.
Lau and Lau (1986) and Pitcher and Geisler (1987) found similar quadrature
spatial displacements and temporal phases shifts of the first two EOF/PC's
in upper-tropospheric velocity potential in GCM simulations. However, in
both studies the period of the oscillation was 25-40 days.</P>

<P>As seen in <A HREF="f9.htm">Fig. 9</A> for the GLA case study, the first
two filtered eddy-streamfunction EOF's at 200hPa are consistent with those
presented in <A HREF="f4.htm">Fig. 4</A>. As suggested by the westward
displacement of EOF-1 at 200hPa relative to the reanalysis, PC-1 and a
filtered velocity potential IO index centered over the Indian Ocean (60&deg;-100&deg;E,
10&deg;N-10&deg;S average, thin grey line) vary in-phase with each other. The IO
index used for the OLR correlation in <A HREF="f7.htm">Fig. 7</A> (thick
grey line) lags the Indian Ocean IO index by 5-10 days. Consistent with
the reanalysis, PC-1 and PC-2 at 200hPa are (usually) out of phase with
each other. These modes explain 37% of the IO time scale variance, significantly
greater than noted for the nine winter/springs presented in Fig. 4 (18%),
but less than that in the reanalysis case study, indicating that more simulated
EOF's are needed to account for the same amount of observed variance.</P>

<P>For the UKMO case study <A HREF="f10.htm">(Fig. 10)</A>, the first 2
EOF's of 200hPa filtered eddy-streamfunction are similar to those from
the GLA simulation over the tropical eastern hemisphere, with a westward
displacement of the Rossby gyres in EOF-1. However, as in Fig. 4, the UKMO
model EOF's are dominated by an extratropical wavetrain, unlike the reanalysis
and the GLA simulation. Also, the phase relationships of the principal
component time series, clearly defined in the reanalysis, are only present
for limited periods (e.g. November and January/February).</P>

<P>To examine the vertical structure of the IO in the reanalysis, the first
two EOF's and PC's of the rotational flow at 850hPa are also presented
in <A HREF="f8.htm">Fig. 8</A>. The first principal component at 850hPa
(thin solid black line) varies in phase with PC-1 at 200hPa. Thus, the
loadings of the 850hPa EOF-1 denote leading anticyclones and trailing cyclones
consistent with low-level convergence in the vicinity of maximum heating
during the active phase of the IO. The second principal component at 850hPa
(thin dashed black line in Fig. 8) varies in phase with PC-2 at 200hPa.
Thus the first two modes are clearly baroclinic. It is noticed that the
EOF's at 850hPa are displaced slightly east of those at 200hPa, thus indicating
a westward vertical tilt. A westward tilt in the zonal wind was noticed
by Murakami and Nakazawa (1984) and Park et al. (1990) in their analysis
of observed intraseasonal variations. In addition, Park et al. (1990) demonstrated
that the GLA (an earlier version) and GLAS (Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheric
Sciences) models simulated a westward vertical tilt. Also, Slingo and Madden
(1991) found a westward tilt, with precipitation leading upper-tropospheric
velocity potential by 0.10 cycle for periods of 10- to 30-days in a perpetual
January simulation with CCM1.</P>

<P>The GLA model also simulates the baroclinic structure in the rotational
flow response <A HREF="f9.htm">(Fig. 9)</A>, but the presence of a westward
vertical tilt is not well defined. The baroclinic structure is only clearly
evident for a limited time period. From mid-January through May, PC-1 at
850hPa usually varies in-phase with PC-1 at 200hPa. The in-phase variation
of PC-2 at 200hPa and 850hPa is more tenuous. Thus, baroclinicity of the
IO simulated by this model is most evident in the first EOF. In the UKMO
simulation, the baroclinic structure is evident in both EOF's, but only
when the proper phase relationships of the principal components are reproduced.
This relationship is less robust than that expressed by the GLA model,
being most evident only during November and January/February. At 850hPa
approximately the same amount of variance is explained as at 200hPa in
the reanalysis and models respectively.</P>

<P>These results indicate that the vertical structure of the eddy-streamfunction
is baroclinic on intraseasonal time scales, with the 200hPa and 850hPa
out-of-phase eddy-streamfunction anomalies propagating to the east in near
unison. The models capture these relationship less effectively. The baroclinic
structure of the intraseasonal oscillation, initially noticed in the winds
by Madden and Julian (1971, 1972), has also been noted by many other authors
(e.g., Krishnamurti and Subrahmanyam 1982, Lau and Lau 1986, Knutson and
Weickmann 1987, Gutzler and Madden 1989, Rui and Wang 1990, and Slingo
and Madden 1991). The symmetry of the anticyclone/cyclone pairs about the
equator is consistent with the composite life cycle presented in Rui and
Wang (1990). The symmetry of the Rossby wave response, and the vertical
tilt will be explored in more detail in the next subsection.<BR>

<P><I>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spatio-Temporal Evolution of the Rotational Flow</I></P>

<P>In the same way that we used lag correlation analysis to show the spatio-temporal
evolution of enhanced convection during the active phase of the IO <A HREF="f7.htm">(Fig.
7)</A>, we can clearly show the propagation of the filtered eddy-streamfunction
during the active phase of the IO by correlation with the IO indices used
in Section 4a. This is useful because it clearly demonstrates the translation
of the Rossby wave streamfunction complex. Additionally, the correlation
analysis provides information regarding the vertical tilt of the oscillation.</P>

<P>Given the sign convention that the active phase of the IO corresponds
to a negative IO index, a positive correlation with the filtered eddy-streamfunction
in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to a cyclone. In the Southern Hemisphere,
a positive correlation corresponds to an anticyclone. Conversely, a negative
correlation in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere is associated with an
anticyclone (cyclone). To clearly portray the evolution of the bandpass
filtered streamfunction anomalies, we have combined the lag information
of the positive (negative) correlations in the Northern Hemisphere with
the negative (positive) correlations in the Southern Hemisphere to show
the spatio-temporal evolution of the cyclone (anticyclone) pairs. As with
the OLR, the lags are plotted where the confidence level of the correlation
coefficient is <u>&gt;</u>95%.</P>

<P>Note: in <A HREF="f11.htm">Fig. 11</A> we only plot lags for the strongest
negative and positive correlations out to +/- 15 days in order to facilitate
comparison with the OLR lags presented in <A HREF="f7.htm">Fig. 7</A>.
That the +15 day and -15 day lags are adjacent to each other does not imply
that the period of the IO is 30 days. The actual maximum and minimum lag
correlations near this boundary interface occur at longer lag and lead
times, yielding an IO periodicity of ~45 days in the reanalysis case study.
Extending the +/- lag window only serves to increase the spatial resolution
of the eastward propagation in the vicinity of the +15 day and -15 day
boundary.</P>

<P><A HREF="f11.htm">Figure 11</A> shows the migration of the filtered
eddy-streamfunction anomalies at 200hPa and 850hPa from the reanalysis
and the models. Confining our attention to the subtropics, at 200hPa for
zero time lag with respect to the IO index (yellow shading; recall the
IO index is based on the region 100&deg;-140&deg;E, 10&deg;N-10&deg;S), we see that the
leading cyclones are situated east of the date line ahead of the enhanced
convection <A HREF="f7.htm">(Fig. 7)</A>. The trailing anticyclones are
located over the western Indian Ocean to the west of the enhanced convection.
At 850hPa the baroclinic nature of the rotational anomalies is evident,
with an anticyclone (cyclone) pair leading (trailing) the enhanced convection
as depicted in the schematic diagrams in Fig. 11. These locations are consistent
with the EOF-1 patterns for 200hPa and 850hPa in <A HREF="f8.htm">Fig.
8</A>. The GLA model readily simulates the location of the Rossby gyres
at 200hPa and 850hPa for convection over the Maritime continent, while
in the UKMO simulation the lag information is less coherent.</P>

<P>During the onset of convection in the western Indian Ocean (day -15),
the trailing 200hPa (850hPa) anticyclones (cyclones) in the reanalysis
are not well established, and the convection tends to be located west of
the leading 200hPa (850hPa) cyclones (anticyclones). From day -10 through
day +10, the enhanced convection over the Indian Ocean and the western
Pacific tends to be situated at the interface of the cyclone/anticyclone
pairs (as per the schematics in <A HREF="f11.htm">Fig. 11</A>). However,
once the convection approaches the dateline (day +15), it tends to be situated
in-between the trailing 200hPa (850hPa) anticyclones (cyclones). At this
time the leading 200hPa (850hPa) cyclones (anticyclones) are weaker and
not well defined. In the GLA model, the western/central Indian Ocean convection
on days -15 and -10 is principally associated with the leading anticyclones
at 850hPa. (In the reanalysis this only occurs at day -15). The trailing
cyclones at 850hPa do not begin to develop in the Eastern Hemisphere until
day -5 when the convection first arises over the Maritime continent. This
staggered development of the trailing cyclones is consistent with the failure
of this model to simulate the clear eastward propagation of convection
over the Indian Ocean found in the observed data, and is associated with
the westward propagating OLR lag signature over the central/western Indian
Ocean <A HREF="f7.htm">(Fig. 7)</A> where convection over the Indian Ocean
occurs at the juncture of the trailing cyclones. In the UKMO model the
eastward migration of the filtered eddy-streamfunction complex is sporadic,
and not as coherent as in the reanalysis and GLA simulation.</P>

<P>In the reanalysis the establishment of the trailing anticyclones at
200hPa when convection develops in the central Indian Ocean, and the location
of the convection in-between the 200hPa trailing anticyclones when convection
nears the dateline were also seen in the IO life-cycle study of Hendon
and Salby (1994) using ECMWF and NMC analyses. Knutson and Weickmann (1987)
identified a similar spatial relationship between convective anomalies
and 250hPa streamfunction using NMC analyses. However, they found the streamfunction
pattern to be asymmetrical, with the Northern Hemisphere anomalies being
''most prominent.'' Alternatively, Rui and Wang (1990) found the streamfunction
anomalies to be more symmetrical about the equator, but stressed the association
of the tropical convective anomalies with the trailing ''upper- (lower-)
anticyclonic (cyclonic) circulation anomalies.'' They also indicated that
''the low-level circulation anomalies dissipate after the convection anomaly
passes the western Pacific.'' However, the lags in <A HREF="f11.htm">Fig.
11</A> suggest that the 850hPa cyclones continue to propagate downstream
in the reanalysis. Differences between the results presented here and those
of Knutson and Weickmann (1987) and Rui and Wang (1990) are most likely
due to our use of a single case study period rather than compositing over
many years of data. Also, it is possible that the different characteristics
are associated with the different prefiltering techniques applied to the
dynamical fields. While we have filtered the eddy-streamfunction data,
Rui and Wang (1990) retained higher frequency time scales through pentad
averaging of data from which only the seasonal cycle was removed. Thus,
higher frequency variations probably influenced their rotational signature,
particularly when the IO related convection was weak. Also, the different
data sets and analysis techniques may have contributed to the discrepancies
noted above.</P>

<P>In both hemispheres, the eddy-streamfunction lags in <A HREF="f11.htm">Fig.
11</A> for the reanalysis are essentially symmetrical about the equator.
The symmetrical nature of the rotational flow is also reflected in the
magnitude of the correlations (not shown), typically being &gt;|0.6| in
the subtropics of each hemisphere when convection is active over the Eastern
Hemisphere. The lags indicate that the spatial structure of this streamfunction
complex remains fairly uniform as the convection migrates eastward from
the Indian Ocean into the western Pacific. The GLA model has similar characteristics,
but only when the convection is located over the western/central Pacific
Ocean.</P>

<P>It is of interest to note that the 850hPa cyclone/anticyclone phase
lags are displaced slightly to the east of their 200hPa anticyclone/cyclone
counterparts in the reanalysis. This indicates that there is a westward
vertical tilt to the eddy-streamfunction anomalies, with the low-level
convergence leading the upper-level divergence. For the GLA model, the
correlation analysis establishes the presence of the westward vertical
tilt which was not evident in the EOF analysis.</P>

<P>The major shortcoming of the models is their poor performance over the
Indian Ocean. Common features between the models and observations/analyses
are most apparent when convection is active over the western/central Pacific.
At such times, both models simulate eastward propagating convective anomalies
and forced Rossby wave gyres which have a baroclinic structure on intraseasonal
time scales. These properties are however better simulated by the GLA model,
whereas the UKMO model is much noisier. The IO-related Rossby wave structures
are particularly poor in the latter model, and this is probably associated
with the tendency for the main center of convection to be located north
of the equator. <BR>

<P><A NAME="5.  MAINTENANCE OF THE INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION"></A><B>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;MAINTENANCE
OF THE INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION</B></P>

<P>Numerous theories of intraseasonal variability are prevalent in the
literature (e.g., see Hayashi and Golder 1993 for a review). In wave-CISK
(conditional instability of the second kind), the eastward propagation
of the convective envelope is maintained through the selective amplification
of Kelvin waves (Lau and Peng 1987). Consistent with the observed vertical
structure of the IO, this mechanism indicates a westward vertical tilt
with height should be present. However, a major difficulty with wave-CISK
is that the preferred periodicity of the dominant waves is shorter than
observed due to the preferred amplification of high frequency growth rates.
In frictional wave-CISK (Hendon and Salby 1994, Salby et al. 1994), meridional
convergence at the surface leads to amplification of the convective anomaly
when it occurs in-phase with the convergence at 850hPa through the generation
of eddy available potential energy (EAPE). The amplification stage occurs
while the convection is located over the western/central Indian Ocean.
At subsequent times the surface convergence shifts further eastward, nearly
40-50&deg; longitude ahead of the convection, where it is no longer in-phase
with the convergence above the boundary layer. This results in decreasing
EAPE, and decay of the disturbance.</P>

<P>The evaporative wind feedback mechanism (also known as wind-induced
surface heat exchange, WISHE), as proposed by Emanuel (1987) and Neelin
et al. (1987), considers the role of evaporation in the maintenance and
propagation of the IO, and it is not mutually exclusive of the wave-CISK
mechanism. Enhancement of the low-level easterlies about the equator ahead
of the convection is assumed to result in increased evaporative fluxes,
which in turn maintains the eastward propagation of convection.</P>

<P>In order to evaluate these mechanisms of IO maintenance, we use a longitudinal
translation scheme to composite OLR, filtered divergence, surface winds,
and latent heat flux in a frame of reference with respect to the eastward
propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation as it propagates through a
given domain. Lau et al. (1988) and Park et al. (1990) used this method
in their model verification studies. As with Lau et al. (1988) and Park
et al. (1990), we use pentad averaged bandpass filtered upper-level velocity
potential to define the eastward propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation.
These time-longitude data sets were presented in <A HREF="f7.htm">Fig.
7</A> for the reanalysis and models. In this scheme we define a longitudinal
translation to isolate the active phase of the intraseasonal oscillation.
This translation is denoted T- (using the notation of Park et al. 1990).
For an a priori selected longitude range the following steps are performed
at each pentad:<BR>
</P>

<P>1) We calculate the average of the 200hPa filtered velocity potential
in our predefined longitude range. This average is used as a weighting
factor when the translation is performed on the field of interest. Thus,
periods of strong intraseasonal activity are emphasized.</P>

<P>2) If this average is negative, the longitude of the velocity potential
minima in the predefined longitude range is mapped to the zero longitude
of the translation reference grid T-.
</P>

<P>This translation can be applied to any field of interest (F) resulting
in F-. Since the models and reanalysis are most consistent over the western
Pacific, we perform the translation for the region 105&deg;E-180&deg;W. We choose
to perform the translation on total OLR, total surface wind, and filtered
divergence to compare with the results of Hendon and Salby (1994), and
comment further on their frictional wave-CISK hypothesis. Additionally,
we translate the total latent heat flux to evaluate the role of evaporative
wind feedback, and to evaluate model performance.<BR>
</P>

<P><I>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;OLR and Filtered Divergence</I></P>

<P>In this section translations are applied to OLR and filtered divergence
<A HREF="f12.htm">(Fig.12)</A>. There are two reasons for this: (1) use of total OLR to show moreprecisely the location, magnitude and spatial extent of deep convection
about the wave center; (2) divergence is a very noisy field. For the UKMO
simulation surface data were unavailable.</P>

<P>As <A HREF="f12.htm">Fig. 12 </A>shows, the observed convection is
slightly displaced to the west of the wave center. The OLR signature extends
to 15&deg;S along the eastern flank which is consistent with the convection
observed in the SPCZ <A HREF="f7.htm">(Fig. 7)</A>. The baroclinic structure
of the divergence at 850hPa and 200hPa, and the ambiguous signal at the
surface are consistent with the results of Hendon and Salby (1994). In
the GLA model the convection is more intense than observed as indicated
by the lower values of OLR. The convection is located at the wave center,
and it is more longitudinally confined than observed. This model does simulate
a southeastward extension of convection which is associated with the SPCZ.
The convection in the GLA model is more realistic than that of the UKMO
model.</P>

<P>The presence of surface convergence (negative divergence) to the east
of the convection in the reanalysis, and to some extent in the GLA simulation,
indicates that an element of frictional wave-CISK is present. However,
the importance of this convergence relative to that which is coincident
with the convection has yet to be determined. In the GLA model, convergence
at the surface is dominant in the vicinity of the convection, suggesting
that convection is more closely tied to local boundary layer processes
than suggested by the reanalysis. In the UKMO integration the more irregular
structure in the divergence field is consistent with the weaker convective
signature, and agrees with the split tropical convergence zones seen inFigs. 
<A HREF="f2.htm">2</A> and <A HREF="f7.htm">7</A> on intraseasonal
time scales. <BR>
</P>

<P><I>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Latent Heat Flux, Surface Winds, and OLR</I></P>

<P>In <A HREF="f13.htm">Fig. 13</A>, translations of the latent heat
flux, surface winds (850hPa for UKMO) and OLR are presented. The most immediate
result is that strong latent heat flux occurs coincident with, and to the
west of the convection in the reanalysis and GLA simulation, where the
surface winds exceed 4m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The tendency of the latent heat flux to be
proportional to the windspeed is consistent with the TOGA-COARE in situ
measurements presented by Zhang and McPhaden (1995) and Lau and Sui (1996).
To the east of the convection, the latent heat flux is substantially lower
(and less than the climatological mean, not shown) in the reanalysis. This
result indicates that evaporative wind feedback (WISHE) is not the dominant
mechanism for maintaining eastward propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation.
This conclusion is consistent with the finding of Lau and Sui (1996) which
was based on an analysis of surface fluxes from the Improved Meteorological
Surface Mooring within the Intensive Flux Array (IFA) during the TOGA-COARE
Intensive Observation Period (IOP).</P>

<P>In the GLA simulation the latent heat flux to the east of the convection
does not exhibit as systematic a reduction, and in the UKMO simulation
the strongest latent heat flux tends to occur coincident with the convection.
Outside of the deep-tropics to the east of the convection in the reanalysis,
the latent heat flux is larger where the meridional wind component is strong.
This implies that characteristics of frictional wave-CISK are at work.
In the GLA model the correspondence between the meridional wind and evaporation
is strongest in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the UKMO model the flow
is more zonal than indicated by the reanalysis.</P>

<P>The degree to which frictional wave-CISK is operative is an open question.
Hendon and Salby (1994) went on to examine the behavior at 1000hPa, finding
an eastward displacement of 40-50&deg; in the location of convergence relative
to that at 850hPa. This shift was ascribed to friction, and formed the
basis for their frictional wave-CISK hypothesis. We looked for such a displacement
of the surface (10m) winds from the reanalysis (since that is what is available
from the model archive), and did not find evidence of such a displacement.
The reanalysis surface filtered eddy-streamfunction lags (not shown) were
consistent with those at 850hPa (Fig. 11), and EOF analysis as in Fig.
8 (not shown) also indicated the surface and 850hPa to be in-phase with
each other. This suggests that frictional wave-CISK may not be a dominant
mechanism for maintenance of the IO. However, important questions that
remain to be addressed with regard to this mechanism include: (1) How much
does the large-scale atmospheric moisture convergence to the east of the
convection contribute to the net moisture supply? (2) Is it substantial
enough to override the below normal latent heat flux in this region? Answers
to these questions are beyond the scope of the present paper, but further
evidence of the regionality of the latent heat flux for the case study
periods is explored using lagged correlation analysis in the next subsection.<BR>
</P>

<P><I>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;IO Index/Filtered Latent Heat Flux Correlations</I></P>

<P>Filtered latent heat flux correlations with the IO index from reanalysis
and the models are shown in <A HREF="f14.htm">Fig. 14. </A>Negative correlations
correspond to enhanced latent heat flux (evaporation). In the reanalysis,
on day -15, convection is located near 60&deg;E, 5&deg;S (Figs. <A HREF="f6.htm">6,</A>
<A HREF="f7.htm">7,</A> and <A HREF="f15.htm">15</A>).
To the west, near the Somali coast, a small region of enhanced latent heat
flux is found, but its magnitude and spatial extent is quite small. However,
enhanced latent heat flux is noticed extending ~30&deg; to the southeast of
the convection. This suggests that frictional wave-CISK may be important
during initiation of IO related convection. However, it is conceivable
that this enhanced latent heat flux is a symptom of the development of
the leading anticyclones at 850hPa on day -15, the purple shading seen
in <A HREF="f11.htm">Fig. 11</A>, which occur as a consequence of the convection. In this latter
scenario, the initiation of convection in the western Indian Ocean would
be associated with local processes. However, from day -5 through day +15,
enhanced latent heat flux at and to the west of the convection dominates.
To the east of the convection, the positive correlations indicate that
below normal evaporation extends well into the subtropics. This suggests
that large-scale moisture convergence from east of the convection may not
be dominant. The mechanism by which the IO propagates to the east is not
as yet understood, and a possible scenario by which this occurs will be
discussed in Section 6.</P>

<P>The lagged correlations for the GLA model <A HREF="f14.htm">(Fig. 14)</A> provide a valuable qualification
to the Lagrangian translation of the latent heat flux given in <A HREF="f13.htm">Fig.
13</A>. The correlations clearly show that the enhanced evaporation develops
in-place over the warm pool beginning when the convection first develops
there on day -5. The dominant evaporation tends to remain over the warm
pool, even on day +15 when convection is located near the dateline, thus
giving the appearance that enhanced evaporation occurs to the west of the
convection in the Lagrangian translation. This model appears to be more
closely tied to local behavior over the warm pool than the variations from
the reanalysis that occur over most of the eastern hemisphere as the IO
develops and matures.</P>

<P>In the UKMO model, the main center of evaporation lies to the east of
the convective signal on day -5 and day 0, when convection first becomes
apparent over the Maritime continent <A HREF="f7.htm">(Fig.7)</A>. This
suggests a WISHE type mechanism during onset in this model. Subsequently,
when convection is near the dateline, evaporation from the west dominates
which is more consistent with the reanalysis. This is an important difference
relative to the GLA simulation and the reanalysis, namely that the UKMO
evaporation tends to migrate to the west, whereas the GLA evaporation develops
in place, while in the reanalysis the evaporation migrates to the east
behind the convection.</P>

<P>The Lagrangian translation and correlation analysis indicate the importance
of the latent heat flux at and to the west of the convection. These results
confirm the in situ observations over the IFA during the TOGA-COARE IOP
(Lau and Sui 1996), and indicate that these interactions are operative
over the oceans of the eastern hemisphere during the active phase of the
IO. For the case study periods analyzed, the models do not simulate in
a robust manner the enhancement of evaporation to the west to the convection.
Thus, the physical mechanism by which the convection is maintained in the
reanalysis is not well reproduced by these models. Since the reanalysis
indicates that WISHE and frictional wave-CISK are not the dominant mechanisms
by which the eastward propagation and time scale of the IO are established,
other mechanisms of IO variability must be investigated.<BR>

<P><A NAME="6.  THE INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION: A COUPLED"></A><B>6. &nbsp;THE
INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATION: A COUPLED MODE?</B></P>

<P>The overall poor simulation of intraseasonal oscillations in the AMIP
simulations is disturbing and perhaps suggestive that a fundamental process
is lacking in AGCMs (Slingo et al. 1995, 1996). One such process may be
the response of the SST to changes in the surface winds and fluxes associated
with the IO. Krishnamurti et al. (1988) showed that anomalous fluxes associated
with the IO may affect the SSTs in the West Pacific, and recent results
from TOGA-COARE have suggested that SSTs are modulated coherently by the
IO (e.g. Gutzler et al. 1994; Chen et al. 1996, Lau and Sui 1996, Zhang
1996a). Using weekly observed SST distributions, covering a number of years,
Hendon and Glick (1996) showed that intraseasonal variations in SST (with
root-mean-squared amplitude of ~0.5&deg;K) are relatively important for the
Indian and west Pacific Oceans when compared with the seasonal and interannual
variability. Evidence of a coherent relationship between SSTs and atmospheric
forcing at intraseasonal time scales has also been provided by Zhang (1996b)
using an extended time series covering several years from the TOGA TAO
(tropical atmosphere ocean) array. He notes that the intraseasonal variability
of SST, although generally weaker than the seasonal and interannual variability,
is easily detectable. He also notes that the coherence between the atmospheric
forcing and the SST variations is significant for timescales in excess
of 4-5 days, and that the atmosphere appears to force the SST.</P>

<P>Using a time-longitude cross-section of SST, and plotting its relation
to OLR, Gutzler et al. (1994) suggested a relationship between SSTs in
the Indian Ocean and the phase of the IO. They found that just prior to
the onset of convection in the Indian Ocean, positive SST anomalies of
~0.5&deg;K developed near 90&deg;E, and subsequently the "positive SST anomalies
appear to shift eastward ahead of the enhanced convection associated with
the OLR anomalies." Flatau and Flatau (1996) have developed a conceptual
model which suggests that modification of the SST by the convective system
favors the development of positive SST anomalies ahead of the convection,
and negative SST anomalies at and to the west of the convection that result
in conditions favorable for the eastward migration of the convective envelope.
Lau and Sui (1996) found SST warming over the IFA was associated with above
normal shortwave radiation at the surface and below normal latent heat
flux when IO related convection was located to the west. Subsequently,
when convection was located east of the IFA, SST cooling was dominated
by enhanced latent heat flux. This scenario is consistent with the west
Pacific observations of Zhang (1996a), and suggests that the IO may be
a coupled phenomenon which requires an interactive ocean surface to produce
the correct organization of convection and its eastwards propagation. Investigation
of the response by the atmosphere to such changes in SST requires further
attention, particularly over the Indian Ocean.</P>

<P>In order to investigate the relationship between the IO and SST in more
detail, we have correlated the IO index with filtered observed SST (and
skin temperature over land) for the 1987/88 case study. The SST data is
that which was used in the ECMWF (and NCEP/NCAR) reanalyses, and the skin
temperature is that produced from the ECMWF reanalysis (it was more convenient
for us to gain access to the observed SST via the ECMWF reanalysis). In
<A HREF="f15.htm">Fig. 15</A>, these correlations are plotted as gridpoint
data, while correlations of the IO index with OLR are plotted as isolines
(same data as used in <A HREF="f6.htm">Fig. 6</A>) in order to show the
association between the SST and convection. As seen in <A HREF="f15.htm">Fig. 15,</A> on day
-15, the enhanced convection (blue contours) develops over a region of
warm SST anomalies in the western Indian Ocean just south of the equator,
and in the central Indian Ocean just north of the equator. Enhanced warming
is also found along the equator extending to 90&deg;E, which at day -10 is
where the enhanced convection is strongest. At day -10 significantly warmer
SST spreads south of the Indonesian peninsula near 115&deg;E, 15&deg;S, which is
precisely where suppressed convective activity (and presumably enhanced
subsidence) occurred during the previous pentad (day -15). Similarly, at
day -5 the convection extends eastward to New Guinea and adjacent to northwest
Australia, where above normal SST and suppressed convection were found
on day -10. This cycle continues on day 0 where convection north of New
Guinea is manifested. On day +5 through day +15 convection is found near
170&deg;E, 5-20&deg;S where warm SST anomalies developed previously, subsequent
to suppressed convection.</P>

<P>In the vicinity of the enhanced convection, cloud shielding and enhanced
latent heat flux serve to cool the local SST, resulting in a zonal gradient
of SST with warmer values to the east that may provide the impetus for
convection to develop further east. To the west of the convection evaporative
cooling dominates, particularly over the Indian Ocean from day 0 through
day +10 where below normal SST coincides with the enhanced latent heat
flux seen in <A HREF="f14.htm">Fig. 14</A>. As a result the western limit
of the convection is eroded. This cycle of suppressed convection east of
the convection, leading to increased SSTs and eastward migration of the
convective envelope at subsequent pentads, with conditions in the west
that serve to decrease SSTs and convection, is consistent with the Flatau
and Flatau (1996) air-sea convective intraseasonal interaction (ASCII)
mechanism for maintaining eastward propagation of the intraseasonal oscillation
and observations over the western Pacific (Lau and Sui 1996, Zhang 1996a).
Furthermore, our results suggest that it is the local gradient of SST that
is important for the eastward migration. For example, as indicated in <A HREF="f15.htm">Fig.
15</A>, the convection enhances eastward from the Indian Ocean into the
western Pacific from day -10 through day 0, while the convection over the
Indian Ocean remains intact on day -10 and day -5. Only on day 0 does the
convection over the Indian Ocean begin to subside as cold SST anomalies
develop where the evaporative cooling intensifies <A HREF="f14.htm">(Fig.
14)</A>. Thus, it appears the local SST gradient near the eastern boundary
of the convective envelope is associated with the downstream development
of convection, while the SST gradient near the western boundary is related
to the cessation of convection.</P>

<P>It is likely that the warm SST anomalies to the east of the convection
result as a consequence of upper-level outflow and subsidence. Such conditions
would enable a shallow mixed surface layer to heat up via shortwave radiation
in the presence of light winds. As shown previously in <A HREF="f13.htm">Fig.
13</A>, the surface winds to the east of the convection are very weak during
the active phase of the IO, thus evaporative cooling is not dominant at
this local. However, near the western portion of the convective envelope
the strength of the surface westerlies is such that evaporative cooling
plays a dominant role in modulating the surface energy budget. This results
in the cooling that is observed systematically behind the convection. The
data suggest that the warm SST anomalies may be particularly important
in the Indian Ocean. They may be associated with the onset of convection
in the western Indian Ocean, and they appear to the lead the convection
through to the western Pacific Ocean.</P>

<P>Over land, the surface skin temperature from the ECWMF reanalysis indicates
that systematic cooling and heating occur over the continental interior.
The signal is actually first manifested in the observed SST in the vicinity
of the Benguela current. The suppressed convection over the Atlantic Ocean
on day -10 through day 0 (red contours) suggests enhanced subsidence, which
in turn implies an intensification of the subtropical anticyclone. This
in turn should result in enhanced coastal upwelling, which appears to be
manifested as below normal SSTs that propagate northward along the west
coast of Africa. Statistically significant below normal temperature anomalies
are subsequently found over continental Africa, which may exceed 2-3&deg;K
during individual intraseasonal episodes. Conversely, on day +5 through
day +15, above normal SSTs develop over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean
and continental Africa which is consistent with lower OLR near the anticyclone.
The lower OLR implies the presence of decreased subsidence, a weaker anticyclone,
less coastal upwelling and warmer SST adjacent to the west coast of Africa.
Convection is found over tropical Africa after the warming is established
over the continent as the active phase of the IO establishes itself over
the Eastern Hemisphere. Analysis of other case study periods would be beneficial
in determining the robustness of these large-scale temperature fluctuations.</P>

<P>The results of the IO index/SST correlations indicate that large-scale
surface temperature anomalies propagate to the east in conjunction with
the passage of intraseasonal oscillations. The large-scale structure of
this temperature signal might be useful for medium-range weather forecasting,
particularly over land. However, the role the SST plays with regard to
the initiation and eastward migration of IO-related convection can only
be conclusively determined by using coupled ocean-atmosphere models.</P>

<P><A NAME="7.  DISCUSSION AND"></A><B>7.&nbsp; DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</B></P>

<P>The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set is used in a study of observed and
simulated intraseasonal variability. EOF analysis indicates that the large-scale
structure of the IO-related rotational flow is consistent with the previous
ECMWF/JDP and NMC analyses. Most encouraging is the regionally consistent
relationship of the reanalysis and satellite derived OLR which clearly
characterize the spatio-temporal evolution of the convectively driven forced
Rossby wave response on intraseasonal time scales. The models perform best
when the IO-related convection is over the Maritime continent. At such
times the forced Rossby wave gyres are most well defined. The GLA model
better simulates the eastward propagation of the convection and streamfunction
anomalies over the western/central Pacific Ocean. In the UKMO simulation
this signature is more irregular. A major shortcoming of both models is
their inability to properly simulate the convection over the Indian Ocean,
and its progression to the Maritime continent. Such eastward propagation
over the oceans of the Eastern Hemisphere is a fundamental property of
the IO that always occurs during the active phase of the oscillation in
the correlation statistics. Thus, determining causes for the models failure
to capture this signal is of fundamental importance.</P>

<P>Intraseasonal variability in an earlier version of the GLA model has
previously been documented by Park et al. (1990). The results presented
here indicate that the simulation of the IO has improved as this model
has undergone development. The modifications to this models formulation
have been numerous (Sud and Walker 1992, 1993), and therefore direct attribution
to a specific modification which resulted in the improved IO simulation
is not possible. However, it is believed that modification to the Arakawa-Schubert
convection scheme, by including a minimum entrainment parameter and different
"critical cloud work functions" and a more realistic parameterization
of the physics of falling rain are the primary sources of improved IO simulation.
This belief is supported by the study of Tokioka et al. (1988) in which
inclusion of an entrainment parameter in an Arakawa-Schubert convection
scheme improved low-frequency eastward propagating waves in a GCM experiment.
Other modifications that may have contributed to the IO improvement include
a more sophisticated planetary boundary layer treatment, and increased
vertical resolution.</P>

<P>While it is encouraging that documented improvement of intraseasonal
oscillations in GCM's has occurred in recent years, there are still many
problems to overcome. We have shown the GLA and UKMO models in their best
light by selecting the periods when their intraseasonal oscillations were
strongest and most coherent. During other years, simulation of the spatio-temporal
evolution of the dynamical and convective signatures tend to be less coherent.</P>

<P>A factor to consider is the different horizontal resolutions that these
two models have employed since simulation of the intraseasonal oscillation
has been shown to be sensitive to this characteristic. In instances when
a specific model has been run at a variety of horizontal resolutions, demonstrably
poorer intraseasonal oscillations have been simulated as horizontal resolution
was increased (Slingo et al. 1995, 1996; Gualdi et al. 1995). These authors
found that deterioration of IO simulation was most significant when resolution
increased from approximately T21 to T42. The GLA (4&deg; latitude x 5&deg; longitude)
and UKMO (2.5&deg; latitude x 3.75&deg; longitude) models straddle these horizontal
resolution regimes, and perhaps coincidently, the UKMO model simulated
a more irregular intraseasonal oscillation than the GLA model. It may therefore
prove a challenge for the GLA model to simulate coherent intraseasonal
oscillations using increased horizontal resolution. Alternatively, the
IO in a lower resolution version of the UKMO model may become more coherent.
This is not meant to suggest that low resolution is preferable, but rather
this conundrum symbolizes unknown shortcomings in our understanding of
processes and scale interactions that occur at high resolution. The apparent
decrease in skill at high horizontal resolution may be related to the closure
of that convection scheme and its interaction with resolution. At approximately
T42, tropical synoptic scale disturbances begin to be realized. Thus, it
is possible that classes of higher frequency synoptic scale phenomena (e.g.,
cloud clusters, super-cloud clusters, westerly wind bursts etc.) are not
properly represented. Thus, poorly simulated fast modes of variability
may detrimentally affect slower modes. Proper simulation of such high frequency
multi-scale phenomena may be crucial for simulating realistic intraseasonal
variability (Chao and Lin 1994).</P>

<P>Analysis of the reanalyzed latent heat flux suggests that evaporative
wind feedback (WISHE) and frictional wave-CISK are not the dominant mechanisms
which promote the eastward migration of the IO during the case study period
analyzed. Also, investigation of the relationship between the latent heat
flux and observed SST indicates that warming of the SST in advance of the
convection is a viable mechanism for promoting eastward migration of the
convective envelope on intraseasonal time scales. Evaporative cooling is
of minimal importance for the surface energy balance ahead of the convection.
Thus, SSTs in this region warm, probably due to shortwave heating, thereby
promoting eastward migration of the convection through a change in the
local SST gradient. Conversely, evaporative cooling (and possibly cloud
shielding) near the western portion of the convection is associated with
decreasing SST and the cessation of convection. The monthly mean SSTs used
for the AMIP integrations do not capture these regionally specific evolving
anomalies. However, the use of weekly or daily observed SSTs as a boundary
condition would not be the ideal solution for improved IO simulation since
the synoptic state of a simulation would not be expected to agree with
the observed synoptic state under which the SSTs were manifested. Additionally,
the evidence presented suggests that the IO is a coupled air-sea mode.
Thus, investigation of the IO using coupled ocean-atmosphere models is
of paramount interest.</P>

<P>Although Slingo et al. (1995, 1996) discuss reasons for the poor simulation
of IO variability, the overall lack of skill exhibited by the models suggests
that the IO may have to be treated as a coupled mode. Thus, much fundamental
research needs to be pursued both observationally, and in the modelling
community. It is anticipated that additional insight will be gained from
further analysis of data from the TOGA-COARE IOP during which several strong
intraseasonal oscillations occurred. However, the dearth of in situ observations
over the Indian Ocean is particularly troubling, especially given the models
shortcomings over this domain. Extending the TOGA-TAO array into the Indian
Ocean would be beneficial for understanding the ocean-atmosphere interactions
over this region, and for the study of transitions between the Indian Ocean
and western Pacific.</P>

<h1>The Next Phase: AMIP II</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
With the endorsement of the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) of the World
Climate Research Programme, the PCMDI has agreed to coordinate the next phase of AMIP.  
The WGNE has appointed seven scientists to serve as members of the international AMIP Panel, who
have assisted PCMDI in the design of AMIP II.  The recommendations
of many AMIP participants also have been incorporated. 
<p>
As in AMIP I, the primary objective of AMIP II will be to support a community standard
control experiment of global atmospheric general circulation models.  <A HREF="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/proposals.html">
Diagnostic subprojects</a> will be established 
to coordinate comprehensive analyses of the AMIP II simulations.
There will also be a special effort to study the effect of intrinsic
variability on the simulations, and support will be given to some numerical experimentation.
<p>
For further information, refer to the <A HREF="amipnl8.html">AMIP II Guidelines</A> published
in AMIP Newsletter No. 8.  All inquires should be sent to
<a href="mailto: amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov">amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov</a> or to the 
AMIP Project Office, PCMDI, L-264, LLNL, P.O. Box 808, Livermore, CA,

<P>In 1989 the need for systematic intercomparison and evaluation of atmospheric
models was emphasized by the Joint Scientific Committee (JSC) of the World
Climate Research Programme (WCRP). A project to address this need was established
by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE), and officially
endorsed by the JSC in 1990 as the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project
(AMIP). During the same period, the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis
and Intercomparison (PCMDI) was established at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) by the Environmental Sciences Division of the U.S. Department
of Energy for the purpose of increasing understanding of the differences
among climate models.</P>

<P>The WGNE invited the PCMDI to serve the climate modeling community by
implementing AMIP, and PCMDI has done so since 1990. Five years after its
inception, the project reached a milestone: the analyses of the first AMIP
simulations were presented at the First International AMIP Scientific Conference
in May 1995. Prior to that conference, the PCMDI staff prepared a proposal
for the continuation of the project. Although not without shortcomings,
AMIP was regarded as a success by its participants, who, in response to
PCMDI's proposal, overwhelmingly supported the concept of an AMIP II. Subsequently,
many climate scientists have provided suggestions which have been incorporated
into the AMIP II experimental guidelines. In late 1995, the WGNE chose
to reconstitute and enlarge the AMIP Panel (Gleckler, 1996), whose first
task was to assist PCMDI in the final design of AMIP II.</P>

<P>AMIP is an international effort to develop a community infrastructure
for atmospheric modelers and diagnosticians. This is being accomplished
by establishing a standardized experiment, with a diverse group of scientists
performing extensive diagnoses. In support of this &quot;benchmark&quot;
exercise, the project also serves to identify scientific, informational
and cooperative standards that are acceptable to the community. The result
is a more thorough and efficient evaluation of AGCM simulations, which
is crucial for model development and improvement.</P>

<P><A HREF="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</A></P>

<P><A NAME="1.2 Motivation and"></A>1.2 Motivation and mission</P>

<P>The impetus to continue AMIP stems from the strong support of the international
community of climate modelers and diagnosticians. As the AMIP infrastructure
has matured, the benefits of the project have continued to unfold. Since
the inception of the project there has been a substantial increase in cooperation
and collaboration among AGCM modeling and diagnostic groups. Many revealing
diagnostics have been developed, leading to increasingly comprehensive
model evaluation. The process of identifying systematic model errors has
consequently been improved and accelerated.</P>

<P><I>Mission statement</I></P>

<P><I>AMIP II will assist community efforts to improve atmospheric general
circulation models by establishing standards for model simulation, documentation,
validation and diagnosis. This will be accomplished by the implementation
of standardized experiments that facilitate improved comparison of simulations.
Comprehensive documentation will serve to clarify experimental procedures
to ensure that they are properly interpreted by the scientific community.
The desired result is the continuing advancement of simulation diagnosis,
which ultimately supports the improvement and development of models.</I></P>

<P><A HREF="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</A></P>

<P><A NAME="1.3 Project"></A>1.3 Project overview</P>

<P>AMIP II will maintain its focus on the support of a community standard
control experiment, in cooperation with those analyzing the simulations.
There will be a special effort to study the effect of intrinsic variability
on climate model simulations, and AMIP II will also begin to support some
numerical experimentation.</P>

<P>The minimum requirement for a modeling group's participation will be
to carry out a standard AMIP II simulation (under the guidelines summarized
below), and to submit standard model output to PCMDI in a timely manner.
Contribution of multiple realizations will be optional for AMIP participants,
as will participation in future AMIP-supported numerical experimentation.</P>

<P>In the years ahead, the AMIP control experiment is anticipated to evolve
further. Model intercomparisons will take place at an increasingly fundamental
level, as envisaged for Level 3 intercomparison defined by the WGNE (Gates,
1992).</P>

<P>The AMIP infrastructure will assist the development of other climate
model comparisons such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP),
the Seasonal Prediction Model Intercomparison Project (SMIP), and the Paleoclimate
Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP).</P>

<P>Development of a standardized control experiment presents a challenge,

compromises in the experimental design. Thus the AMIP II experimental protocol
is partitioned into <I>requirements</I> and <I>recommendations. </I>All

requirements. Treatment of the recommendations will be documented for each

<P>To ensure that results are included in the next series of AMIP studies
and presented at the 2nd International AMIP Conference, standard model
output from AMIP II simulations should be submitted to PCMDI before the
end of 1997. To demonstrate the results of model development and improvement,
many groups may wish to submit revised-model AMIP II simulations (as in
AMIP I) from time to time. PCMDI will process and distribute up to one
revised model simulation per year for each participating modeling group.</P>

<P><A NAME="2.2 Multiple"></A>2.2 Multiple realizations</P>

<P>To assess the statistical significance of some results, it is necessary
to perform an ensemble of integrations that are identical except in their
initial conditions. AMIP participants have expressed strong interest in
the systematic study of this issue, and the AMIP Panel has chosen to coordinate
an ensemble study in AMIP II. Multiple integrations require substantial
computational resources, and it is therefore likely that only a few AMIP
modeling groups will be able to contribute to the ensemble project. Modeling
groups choosing to participate should run a minimum of 6 AMIP II simulations
(Zwiers, 1996). To enable comparison of the weather-induced interannual
variance with variance due to the boundary forcing, a 20-year run with
the AMIP II SST and sea-ice <I>climatology</I> (Fiorino, 1996) is also
recommended. Only a subset of the AMIP II Standard Model Output will be
requested of ensembles <A HREF="#4.2 Multiple">(see Section 4.2)</A>. A
recommended procedure for determining the initial conditions for each run
is available at: <B>http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/mrics.html</B> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>(under

<B>(<A HREF="mailto:amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov">amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov</A>)</B>.
A discussion forum will be established for those interested in contributing
AMIP II multiple realizations.</P>

<P><A HREF="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</A></P>

<P><A NAME="2.3 Numerical"></A>2.3 Numerical experimentation</P>

<P>Many AMIP modeling groups have recommended that the project be expanded
to include numerical experimentation, making use of the standard AMIP II
simulations as control runs for comparison. In fact, most modeling groups
have used their AMIP I simulations in this way, and this represents an
important motivation for the AMIP &quot;benchmark&quot; exercise. However,
some issues are sufficiently fundamental to justify a community-wide systematic
model inter-comparison of carefully controlled sensitivity experiments.</P>

<P>While the AMIP Panel has approved the concept of numerical experimentation
in AMIP II, it has concluded that further investigation is needed to determine
which experiments justify the support of the AMIP infrastructure. PCMDI
will establish an internet forum (available by regular mail if requested)
to report experimentation proposals made by climate scientists. It is expected
that most of the proposed sensitivity experiments will have already been
performed with one or more models and these preliminary experiments will
identify which issues warrant an organized comparison.</P>

<P>Experimentation will initially be limited to a few projects regarded
by the AMIP Panel to have the most potential benefit to the modeling community.
As the foundation for AMIP experimentation develops, sensitivity studies
designed to address specific diagnostic interests will gradually be introduced.
To benefit fully from the AMIP infrastructure, participants in the numerical
experimentation projects will be expected to adhere to the AMIP guidelines
for experimental documentation and data exchange standards. Scientists
who wish to submit proposals should contact the AMIP Project Office. Proposals
will be made available to the AMIP community at: <B>http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/amipexps.html</B>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(under construction) </FONT></B>where readers
will be able to contribute comments to a public forum. Proposals, and reactions
to them, will be reviewed by the AMIP Panel within six months of their
submission. As sensitivity experiments begin to be supported by AMIP, modeling
groups will have the opportunity to participate in those that are of interest
to them. Participation in AMIP experiments may range from several modeling
groups to the entire AMIP community.</P>

<P>Analysis of AMIP II simulations will continue to be coordinated through
a set of diagnostic subprojects, but with improvements and clarifications
based on the experience of AMIP I. There will be no limit <I>a priori</I>
to the number of subprojects the AMIP Panel will approve for AMIP II. However,
the Panel will strive to ensure that all approved subprojects: 1) are of
scientific merit, 2) have a high probability of being completed, and 3)
are coordinated appropriately with one another and with the modeling community.
Existing AMIP I diagnostic subprojects must be re-approved by the AMIP
Panel to participate in AMIP II.</P>

<P>With the more comprehensive standard model output in AMIP II it will
be possible to pursue a variety of new intercomparison studies. It is anticipated
that diagnostic subprojects will continue to focus on evaluating simulations
through in-depth analysis of processes, phenomena, regional characteristics,
and by comparison with the best observations available.</P>

<P>AMIP II model output will initially be made available to approved diagnostic

<P><A NAME="3.2 Subproject"></A>3.2 Subproject responsibilities</P>

<P>Participation in an AMIP II diagnostic subproject will ensure early
access to model output, but will also entail certain obligations. AMIP
is a community-based effort, and all participants must therefore accept
certain responsibilities to ensure that the project is carried out in an
efficient and equitable manner.</P>

<P>Diagnostic subproject leaders must agree to provide PCMDI with brief
annual progress reports. These summaries should include a short analysis
update (no more than a few pages and figures), and a listing of all AMIP-related
conference and manuscript abstracts. The purpose of these summaries will
be to keep all AMIP II participants informed of the projects' progress.
PCMDI will organize these subproject summaries on the PCMDI web pages.
Access to subproject progress summaries will be restricted to AMIP participants
for a review period before they are made public. Diagnostic subproject
leaders must also agree to keep modeling groups informed of model data
usage. For example, before submitting an AMIP II study for peer-reviewed
publication, the manuscript should be sent to each modeling group whose
data were used in the analysis. Modeling group representatives should be
given a reasonable period (at least one month) to provide comments.</P>

<P>While PCMDI will perform extensive quality control on all AMIP simulations,
there is always the possibility that some suspicious data may be uncovered
after the data has been distributed to the diagnostic subprojects. If a
subproject discovers an error, it should be reported to PCMDI immediately
so that it may be corrected.</P>

<P>The WGNE AMIP Panel reserves the right to revoke subproject privileges
if the agreed-upon responsibilities are not fulfilled.</P>

<P><A HREF="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</A></P>

<P><A NAME="3.3 Collaboration"></A>3.3 Collaboration protocol</P>

<P>In AMIP I, some difficulties were encountered because it was unclear
what sort of cooperation was expected among participants. Based on these
experiences, some guidelines have been developed for collaboration between
diagnostic subprojects and modeling groups. These guidelines are (by necessity)
compromises, but the aim is to provide an acceptable framework for all
participants.</P>

<UL>
<LI><I>Equal treatment of all modeling groups:</I> Modeling groups participate
in AMIP with the expectation that their simulations will be analyzed. In
preparing manuscripts for journal publications, a subproject leader may
choose to focus on only a few models that most clearly illustrate each
point. When results for only a subset of models are shown, it is expected
that the corresponding results would be sent to modeling groups whose results
are not shown. At some level, however, results of all available models
should be compared collectively (e.g., the results from all models shown
on zonal mean plots or in a summary table).</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>Clarifying the implications of results:</I> There are two points
that should be made clear in all AMIP studies. The first is the age or
model version of each simulation. For simulations more than a few years
old, it should be emphasized that the results may not be indicative of
the current model version. The second point that should be expressed is
a warning that the results of a specific subproject do not necessarily
reflect the overall performance of the AGCMs. For example, attempts to
rank the performance of AMIP I simulations have yielded very different
results, depending on the aspect examined.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><I>Authorship:</I> This issue is often a problem in large projects.
Here we propose a compromise that reflects the sentiments of many subprojects
leaders and modelers, namely that 1) no individual should receive co-authorship
in an AMIP study without directly contributing to that study, and 2) the
modeling groups deserve recognition for their participation in AMIP. The
suggested compromise is straightforward: For all reports and papers resulting
from their analysis of AMIP simulations, subproject leaders should include
in the authorship listing the phrase, &quot;Participating AMIP II modeling
groups.&quot; For example:</LI>
</UL>

<P>M. Brian<SUP>1</SUP>, J. Smith<SUP>1</SUP>, and Participating AMIP II
modeling groups<SUP>2</SUP></P>

<P><SUP>1</SUP> University of John Doe</P>

<P><SUP>2</SUP> List of all groups whose model output was used.</P>

<P>Modeling group representatives (not necessarily the official AMIP contact)
will be given the opportunity to actively participate in diagnostic subprojects
of interest.</P>

<P>When a modeling group representative acknowledges an interest to participate
in a subproject, they should expect to provide sufficient assistance to
earn explicit co-authorship. In the diagnostic subproject agreements, the
leaders will agree to use their professional judgment to determine what
constitutes a sufficient contribution to qualify for co-authorship. It
is anticipated that individuals responsible for preparing models for AMIP-supported
numerical sensitivity projects will have done sufficient work to justify
co-authorship.</P>

<P><A HREF="#TOC">Return to Table of Contents</A></P>

<P><A NAME="3.4 Call for"></A>3.4 Call for proposals</P>

<P>The AMIP Panel is now accepting diagnostic Subproject proposals. The
deadline for proposal submission is 1 April 1997. Late proposals will be
reviewed, but may be disadvantaged in the final structuring of the diagnostic
subprojects. Prospective project leaders should be aware that this is a
multi-year project; AMIP II model output may not be available until early
1998.</P>

<P>Once the proposals have been evaluated by the AMIP Panel, prospective
subproject leaders will be advised on how to formally proceed with the
establishment (or continuation) of a subproject. This will involve elaboration
of the proposal in the form of an agreement to adhere to the AMIP II subproject
protocol. Proposals will be limited to one page and final subproject agreements
to three pages. Instructions for the preparation of a subproject proposal
may be accessed via <A HREF="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/proposals.html">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/proposals.html</A> or requested from

Model Output</U></B></P></CENTER>

<P><A NAME="4.1 The AMIP II standard"></A>4.1 The AMIP II standard experiment</P>

<P>The AMIP standard model output has been substantially revised for AMIP
II <A HREF="#Appendix-A">(see Appendix A)</A>. The monthly mean and high
frequency output are more comprehensive than before, with nearly twice
as many monthly mean fields in the AMIP II listing. It is expected that
there will be no cosmetically altered output (e.g., spatial smoothing).
For consistency with the reanalysis projects of NCEP/NCAR (Kalnay et al.,
1996) and ECMWF (Gibson et al., 1994), monthly mean upper air variables
are to be interpolated to the 17 WMO standard pressure levels in AMIP II,
compared to the 1-3 levels in AMIP I. Several monthly mean variables are
not well defined for some models (e.g., cloud ice). Because of the large
data volume, the only high frequency output expected of all groups is listed
in Table 3 of Appendix A. Table 6 is more than three times the data volume
of Table 3 and is only expected from those groups with sufficient resources.
For reference, the volume for one AMIP II T42L17 simulation (if in IEEE
32 bit) is 8.2 Gb for the variables expected from all groups (Tables 1-5),
and an additional 22.4 Gb for the high frequency output optional (Table
6).</P>

<P>Many AMIP participants have provided valuable suggestions for the construction
of the AMIP II standard model output, but practical considerations have
resulted in some compromises based on: 1) the need for more fields to allow
for more extensive analysis and intercomparison; 2) data management limitations;
3) availability of verification data; 4) special interest fields for GCM
development; and 5) whether a field is well defined for most models. See
<A HREF="#Appendix-B">Appendix B</A> for a discussion of the decision-making
process on the model output listing and temporal sampling for averages.</P>

<P><A NAME="4.2 Multiple"></A>4.2 Multiple realizations</P>

<P>For practical reasons, the multiple realization intercomparison outlined
in <A HREF="#2.2 Multiple">Section 2.2</A> will be limited to the analysis
of low frequency model data, including Tables 1 and 2 of the AMIP II standard
model output <A HREF="#Appendix-A">(Appendix A)</A>. Table 1 output will
only be archived at 850, 500, 200 and 50 hPa.</P>

<P><A NAME="4.3 Data transmission"></A>4.3 Data transmission standards</P>

<P>For years, climate scientists have struggled with the lack of community
standards for data formatting and structuring. While there are many popular
data formats, varied data organization can seriously inhibit efficient
communication and collaboration.</P>

<P>During the past five years, PCMDI has collected model and observational
data from many institutions worldwide. The data have come in all forms,
and have caused substantial challenges, a problem familiar to many in the
field. Recognizing that no single format is going to be acceptable to the
entire community in the near future, PCMDI has developed multi-format software
enabling easy access to data in several popular formats <A HREF="#5.2 Supporting">(Section
5.2)</A>.</P>

<P>With the approval of the WGNE AMIP Panel and the encouragement of many
collaborators, PCMDI has taken a further step to improve data communication
in AMIP II. The Library for AMIP Data Transmission Standards (LATS, see
<A HREF="#5.2 Supporting">Section 5.2</A>) has been developed to establish
data standards for AMIP II. All AMIP II data transferred to and from PCMDI
will be required to be LATS-generated, which automatically conforms to
several community standards.</P>

<P>The motivation for LATS, at least within the community of AMIP participants,
is to create an environment where scientists will be able to read, analyze
and display data much more efficiently. Compliance with the requirement
will ensure that PCMDI can efficiently process AMIP II data, provide modeling
groups with a &quot;quick-look&quot; intercomparison <A HREF="#5.5 Computational">(Section
5.5)</A>, and distribute the output to the subprojects. Together with additional
software developed by PCMDI <A HREF="#5.2 Supporting">(Section 5.2)</A>,
this represents a significant effort to support accessibility and analysis
of climate model and observational data. By conforming to accepted standards,
LATS-generated data is accessible to a variety of popular analysis tools
in addition to those supported by AMIP. It is hoped that LATS will inspire
the climate community to pursue acceptance of data standards beyond the
context of AMIP.</P>

<CENTER><P><B>AMIP II DESIGN RATIONALE</B></P></CENTER>

<P>An important objective of AMIP is to develop standard experimental protocols
that evolve with the improvement of atmospheric models and technological
advancements. The design of any community-wide effort is inherently difficult
because of the lack of consensus. Conservative compromises have been made
to preserve the goal of the project, i.e., to serve as a standard test
of AGCMs. The reasoning behind some of the difficult decisions in the design
of AMIP II is summarized below.</P>

<CENTER><P><U>Experimental design</U></P></CENTER>

<P><I>The AMIP II SSTs and sea-ice</I>: In the original AMIP II proposal
(Gates, 1995) the boundary conditions used in the NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses
were advocated for use in AMIP II. However, examination of the SSTs and
sea-ice used in both reanalyses revealed a significant temporal discontinuity
in the SSTs near the sea-ice margins as source data changed. This prompted
construction of a corrected data set for use in AMIP II (Fiorino, 1996).</P>

<P>Another concern was the temporal sampling of the SSTs and sea-ice. There
are two reasons why it was decided that monthly mean SSTs and sea-ice should
be used in AMIP II, rather than the weekly means used for some of the years
in both the ECMWF and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis projects. First, satellite-based
estimates of weekly means are not available prior to November 1981 and
the sea ice became a daily analysis after 1991. Using the monthly mean
data mitigates the potential conflicts between the quasi-independently
analyzed SSTs and sea-ice. Second, the implications of forcing an AGCM
with weekly SSTs and sea-ice are not clear. While the seasonal cycle is
more realistic, some variability present in the weekly averages represents
the effect of the observed weather, which may be inconsistent with the
weather simulated by the AGCM. Experts are planning to develop consistent,
higher frequency (weekly to daily) data sets. As these become available,
some groups will likely be interested in evaluating the contribution of
the higher frequency SST and sea-ice forcing. If there is sufficient interest,
such experimentation could be supported by the AMIP infrastructure.</P>

<P><I>Recommended use of a realistic time model</I>: It is clear from the
point of view of climate statistics and the current state of AGCMs that
the exact number of days in a given simulated month has little effect on
model statistics. The recommended use of a realistic time model stems from
a practical perspective. Differences in the AGCM time models in AMIP I
caused a multitude of problems for both data managers and users. Improved
software ameliorates this problem, but if this inconsistency persisted
it would continue to greatly complicate the use of the data, particularly
the high-frequency output.</P>

<P><I>The ozone recommendation</I>: After discussing this issue with a
number of modeling groups, it was evident that many would welcome a recommendation.
Experts consulted by the AMIP Panel all agreed that it would be premature
to constrain models with anything other than a monthly mean zonal average/height
ozone climatology. Choosing a specific data set to recommend was difficult.
An intercomparison of state-of-the art data sets (Boyle, 1996) revealed
that all the products evaluated were equally credible, with varying strengths
and weakness. These views were confirmed by the experts consulting with
the AMIP panel. The final decision was based on the fact that the Wang
et al. (1995) data set is the only one that has been published in the peer-reviewed
literature, is already being used by many modeling groups, and represents
a climatological average over most of the AMIP II period.</P>

<P><I>Surface energy and hydrological balance: </I>This recommendation
is less stringent than some would like. There is good reason to consider
more serious restrictions, as many AMIP I simulations showed significant
discrepancies in their surface schemes. However, this represents an area
of continuing model development, determined by the interests and needs
of each modeling group. It is not the aim of AMIP to dictate priorities
of model development. Moreover, as a result of the problems revealed in
AMIP I, many modeling groups have already improved their surface schemes.</P>

<P><I>Land/sea mask and topography</I>: PCMDI has offered to provide land-sea
masks on any grid requested because it was discovered in AMIP I that some
models with the same resolution (e.g., 4x5 or T42) had substantial inconsistencies
in critical regions (e.g., the Indian subcontinent).</P>

<CENTER><P><U>Diagnostic subproject structure</U></P></CENTER>

<P>The majority of AMIP I participants (both modelers and diagnosticians)
were in favor of preserving the framework of focused projects established
in AMIP I. Although not without complications, the organization of the
AMIP I Diagnostic Subprojects was generally regarded as successful. It
has operated at a &quot;grass-roots&quot; level, with diagnosticians working
in small teams to pursue their special interests. AMIP II will be similar,
but the AMIP Panel will process the subprojects according to their areas
of study, and work to ensure that there is improved coordination.</P>

<CENTER><P><U>Standard Model Output</U></P></CENTER>

<P><I>Variable listing</I>: The fields included in the AMIP II Standard
Model Output were viewed to be the most important for the modeling and
diagnostic communities. Many more variables were considered, but practical
considerations (e.g., data volume and calculation difficulties) forced
reductions to the list. In the coming years the advice of experts in other
disciplines (e.g., hydrology) will be sought for diagnostics needed for
impact studies. For the moment, however, it is believed that the current
state of AGCMs and their application in AMIP II (e.g., relatively low resolution)
does not justify further extension of the list of fields.</P>

<P><I>Temporal sampling</I>: It has been recommended that the temporal
sampling used to calculate the monthly averages be consistent with that
of the reanalysis projects (especially Tables 3 and 6, the high frequency
output). Monthly averages of state variables are based on four instantaneous
samples per day, while physical tendencies are accumulated. The motivation
for this recommendation is to address the concern of a sampling bias when
model output is compared with reanalysis. It is only <I>recommended</I>
for several reasons. First, preliminary studies suggest that the potential
biases resulting from calculating monthly averages from four instantaneous
samples per day (with respect to accumulation) are small compared to the
model-to-model and model-to-reanalysis differences found in the AMIP I
simulations. In cooperation with several modeling groups, PCMDI is currently
quantifying this bias (averages based on samples versus accumulation) for
the AMIP II Standard Output. Until this issue has been thoroughly investigated,
only a recommendation can be justified because for some groups this sampling
may cause an extreme data handling burden. A second reason for only recommending
the sampling is that assimilation makes use of observations taken over
a window of time (~<U>+</U> 3 hr). Although the analysis system does account
for the differing times of the observations, the result is not truly instantaneous.
Moreover, the bias due is difficult to quantify. Despite these limitations,
consistency between the reanalysis and model output is desirable. Modeling
groups are encouraged to consider the advantages, keeping in mind that
in the future this could become increasingly important (as systematic simulation
errors are reduced, the sampling biases will be of more concern). It is
expected that groups who do not follow these recommendations will provide
output that represents the true model average (i.e., accumulate all fields).
Coordinated efforts to study these and other issues (e.g., vertical interpolation)
in AMIP II will help to determine what should be done in the future.<BR CLEAR="BOTH">

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>AMIP II Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice: Observational
and Boundary Condition Data Sets</H1>

<P>
<HR>The AMIP II SST and sea ice boundary conditons is available at this
site.<B> </B>Two distinctly different data sets have been prepared. The
first is the AMIP II SST and sea ice <B>observational data set</B>. These
data represent the monthly averages of the SST and sea ice data used in
both the ECMWF and NCEP reanalysis projects, although several important
corrections were made. </P>

<P>The second data set is the AMIP II SST and sea ice <B>boundary conditions</B>.
These data are derived from the observational data set, and is <B>to be
used in the AMIP II simulations</B>. The primary difference between the
boundary condition data set and the observational data set is that adjustments
have been made to insure that when it is linearly interpolated between
monthly average values (i.e., when used as boundary conditions for an AGCM),
<I>the monthly average of the observations is preserved</I>. Monthly averages
are not preserved when the observations are linearly intepolated between
monthly average values (as in AMIP I) because the interpolation process
utilizes three months for each simulated month (e.g., Jan, Feb and Mar
are all used for the Feb values). When the boundary condition data is used
for an AGCM simulation, it has been shown that in addition to preserving
the observational monthly means, the seasonal cycle and the interannual
variance are more accurately represented than the method used in AMIP I.
</P>

<P>Both these data sets have been reviewed by experts in the community.
Documents (soon to be finalized) are available for both data sets: </P>

<head><title>AMIP II Diagnostic Subproject Proposals</title></head>
<body background="blue_paper.gif">
<h1>Call for Preliminary AMIP II Diagnostic Subproject Proposals</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<P>
Proposals for the formation of AMIP II diagnostic subprojects are now being
accepted for review by the WGNE AMIP Panel. 
As in AMIP I, in-depth analysis and intercomparison of the AMIP II 
simulations will be be carried out by a diverse community of experts.  
Scientists with interest in establishing an offical AMIP II diagnositc subproject 
should be familiar with the 
<a href=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip2/amipnl8.html>
AMIP II guidelines</a>, especially the responsibilites of AMIP II diagnostic
subprojects.  Approved diagnostic subprojects will have exclusive access  
to AMIP II model output for the first two years after it
has been placed in the AMIP archive.  There will be no direct funding provided by
the AMIP Project Office to approved diagnostic subprojects. 
<P>
Proposals should be no more than 1000 words (excluding references),
and include: <P>
<P> 
1) Short title <a href=http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/phillips/AMIPsubprojects.html>
(examples from AMIP I)</a>
<P>
2) Name and address of proposed subproject leader(s)
<P>
3) Background to the intended research
<P>
4) Objectives: A clear and concise discussion of the intended diagnostic/intercomparison study, including justification of its importance 
<P>
5) Methodology (e.g., specific computations and diagnoses to be made, sources
of validation data to be used)
<P>
6) Data requirements: A listing of the variables from the AMIP II Standard Model Output that are required for the intended study, including specification of the averaging 
period (monthly or 6-hourly).  Each requested variable should be justified, particularly the 6-hourly data.      
<P>
7) References (including a listing of all relevant publications by the proposed subproject leader(s)) 
<P>
Existing AMIP I diagnositic subprojects must be re-approved if they are to be continued in AMIP II.
The above instructions apply for existing subprojects, although the proposal can be similar to
that accepted in AMIP I if justification is given for the continuation of the subproject.
<P>
<P> 
The deadline for proposal submission is 1 April 1997.  Late proposals
will be reviewed, but may be disadvantaged in the final structuring
of the diagnostic subprojects. Proposals should be sent to the 
AMIP Project Office at <a href="mailto:amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov">amip@pcmdi.llnl.gov</a>
(strongly preferred), or by regular mail to:

<h1>Overview of AMIP I </h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>

As a preliminary contribution to  model diagnosis and intercomparison under standardized conditions,  PCMDI is coordinating the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) on behalf of the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) of the World Climate Research Programme (<a href="http://www.wmo.ch/wcp/wcphtml/wcp-home.html">WCRP</a>).  (See <A HREF="pubs/PCMDIrept7/AMIPexp.html">PCMDI Report No. 7</A> for background information on the AMIP and <A HREF="../amipnews.html">News</A> for current highlights.)
<p>

In this project, some 30 <a href=../phillips/AMIPgroups.html> AMIP modeling groups</a> are simulating the climate of the decade 1979-1988 using the observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea ice, as well as common values of solar luminosity (1365 W/m^2) and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (345 ppm). 
The participating models' principal numerical algorithms and dynamical/physical parameterizations are summarized in <a href=../phillips/modldoc/amip/amip.html> AMIP model documentation</a>.    

<p>

A set of monthly-mean <a href=../gleckler/amipso.html> standard output data</a> from each AMIP model is archived at PCMDI, and some AMIP modeling groups have also provided <a href=../susan/amiphistory.html>history data</a> at six-hourly intervals.  Some of these data are in the <A HREF="archives.html">public domain</A>. Analysis of the models' performance in comparison with observational data reveals their systematic errors, while comparison of the AMIP simulations with each other provides a measure of current modeling uncertainties.  

<p>

More focussed analyses of the models' ability to simulate specific processes and phenomena are being carried out by 26 <a href=../phillips/AMIPsubprojects.html> AMIP diagnostic subprojects</a> in which PCMDI is playing a supporting role.  

<p>

Diagnosis and intercomparison of the AMIP model simulations was comprehensively discussed in an international <a href=../phillips/AMIPconference.html> AMIP Scientific Conference</a> organized by PCMDI in May of 1995.  The Conference Proceedings have been published as a <A HREF="../phillips/AMIPconference.html#AMIP_Proceedings">WCRP report</A>.   An archive of <A HREF="../amipabs.html">AMIP abstracts</A> is also available.  
<P>
Analysis of this first phase of the AMIP experiment (designated as AMIP I) is largely completed,  and a new phase (designated as <A HREF="../amip2/overview.html">AMIP II</A>) is now underway.

<P>
The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) is an international effort to determine the systematic climate errors of atmospheric models under realistic conditions, and calls for the simulation of the climate of the decade 1979-1988 using the observed monthly-averaged distributions of sea-surface temperature and sea ice as boundary conditions. Organized by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) as a contribution to the World Climate Research Programme, AMIP involves the international atmospheric modeling community in a major test and intercomparison of model performance; in addition to an agreed-to set of monthly-averaged output variables, each of the participating models will generate a daily history of state. These data will be stored and made available in standard format by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Following completion of the computational phase of AMIP in 1993, emphasis will shift to a series of diagnostic subprojects, now being planned, for the detailed examination of model performance and the simulation of specific physical processes and phenomena. AMIP offers an unprecedented opportunity for the comprehensive evaluation and validation of current atmospheric models, and is expected to provide valuable information for model improvement.

<P>
Intercomparison of the results from different atmospheric model integrations has been carried out since the beginning of large-scale atmospheric modeling in the 1950s, and is an important part of modeling research. Most such model intercomparisons have been made in connection with numerical weather prediction, in which short-term forecasts in selected cases are compared with one another and with observation. In particular, the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) has organized several such model tests since the early 1970s in support of the World Climate Research Programme (and of the earlier Global Atmospheric Research Programme). In the area of climate, however, fewer such tests have been carried out, due in part to the greater computational resources required and in part to the lack of a clear experimental strategy. Among the first juxtapositions of the results of atmospheric climate models was that given in the report of the U.S. GARP Committee's Panel on Climatic Variation (National Academy of Sciences, 1975) and in the subsequent compilation of the zonally-averaged monthly mean sea-level pressure and precipitation of then-current atmospheric climate models (Gates, 1975, 1987).

The recent intercomparisons of the performance of atmospheric models by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with climatological sea-surface temperatures (Gates et al., 1990, 1992) show that although there is continuing disagreement among current models (and between models and the corresponding observations), there has been an overall narrowing of the range of model results and a reduction in the models' systematic errors as a whole. A compilation of model systematic errors in the seasonal mean sea-level pressure, temperature, zonal wind and precipitation as simulated by 14 atmospheric models has also recently been completed under WGNE auspices (Boer et al., 1991, 1992). In this study it was found, for example, that  a large-scale error common to all current atmospheric GCMs is colder than observed air in the lower troposphere in the tropics and in the upper troposphere in higher latitudes. A corresponding WGNE study of extended-range predictions with 8 atmospheric models shows a similar common error (Bourke et al., 1991).

A corresponding WGNE study of extended-range predictions with 8 atmospheric models shows a similar common error (Bourke et al., 1991).
<P>
The basic purpose of AMIP is to undertake the systematic intercomparison and validation of the performance of atmospheric GCMs on seasonal and interannual time scales under as realistic conditions as possible, and to support the in-depth diagnosis and interpretation of the model results. In particular, the simulation of the mean climate and the sequence of shorter-term climatic states, and the simulation of specific atmospheric processes and phenomena are of interest to both the climate and weather prediction communities. Such analyses and intercomparisons require that all models simulate the same time period under comparable experimental conditions, and that the same diagnostic measures of performance be calculated for all models. As simple as it sounds, the decision to undertake such a structured or standardized simulation is a major step forward in climate model intercomparison. In terms of the WGNE's definitions of model intercomparison shown in <A HREF="Fig_1.html">Figure 1</A>, AMIP is a level 2 intercomparison in which the models' climate is specifically generated for the purpose of intercomparison, in contrast to model intercomparisons in which results are taken from uncoordinated and possibly disparate runs (i.e., level 1 intercomparisons). An earlier example of a level 2 diagnostic intercomparison is that of Cess et al. (1989), while the reports of Boer et al. (1991) and Neelin et al. (1992) are examples of level 1 model intercomparisons.

<H3><A NAME="Section_3">3. AMIP experimental plan</A></H3>
<P>
The decade 1979-1988 was selected as the AMIP test period. This choice was a compromise between the desire to use as long a simulation period as possible in order to obtain representative results, and the increasing difficulties with observed global data sets as one proceeds to earlier years. This time period includes the FGGE observational year 1979 and the occurrence of the major ENSO event during 1982/3. Satellite observations also become increasingly available during this period. Realistic atmospheric forcing is sought by specifying the global distribution of the sea-surface temperature and sea ice in terms of the observed monthly averages on a 2 latitude-longitude grid, from which the appropriate spatial and temporal interpolations can be made for each model. A data set meeting these requirements was specifically constructed for AMIP by the NOAA Climate Analysis Center in cooperation with the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions at the University of Maryland. An edited version of this AMIP SST and sea-ice data set is available from PCMDI, and has been distributed to AMIP participants. These data are illustrated for the month of September 1982 in <A HREF="Fig_2.html">Figure 2</A>. The sequence of 120 monthly mean observed SST and sea-ice distributions during 1979-1988 provides realistic forcing for (and constraint on) the atmosphere, and constitutes a "perfect" ocean for the purposes of AMIP.
<P>
Atmospheric GCMs represent the land surface character and its behavior in a wide variety of ways, including the possible interaction with vegetation. In order to keep the AMIP specifications as simple as possible, it was decided to make no common specification of the land surface. Thus, over land (as determined by each model's land-sea distribution) surface properties such as the albedo, emissivity, roughness, soil moisture and snow/ice cover, and the possible effects of surface vegetation, are left entirely up to each modeling group. (The validation and intercomparison of land surface parameterization schemes in atmospheric models is being undertaken by the joint WGNE/GEWEX project PILPS (Henderson-Sellers, 1992). Neither has any attempt been made to use common surface elevation data or to specify the values of geophysical constants such as gravity and the orbital parameters, although standard values of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (345 ppm) and solar constant (1365 W/m^2) have been specified; these values are close to the averages observed during the AMIP period. 
<P>
The initial conditions for the AMIP integrations beginning on 1 January 1979 were also not specified since these would presumably have no significant effect beyond the first month. The atmospheric forecast models in AMIP generally use an operational analysis for 1 January 1979 as initial AMIP conditions, while most of the atmospheric climate models use either climatological January conditions or the results of earlier model runs appropriate for January. In any case, the integrations are carried out over the 3653-day period 1 January 1979 to 31 December 1988, inclusive.
<P>
A common list of standard monthly-averaged output has been established as shown in the <A HREF="Table_1.html">Table</A>. Set 1 consists of the monthly mean global geographical distributions of selected surface and vertically integrated variables (sea-level pressure, ground and surface air temperature, cloudiness, precipitable water, soil moisture and snow mass). In addition, the monthly means of selected components of the atmospheric heat and hydrologic budgets and the surface wind stress are accumulated at each physics time step in the models' integrations. Set 1 also includes the monthly mean cloud radiative forcing as found by subtracting the net outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere in the (artificial) case without clouds from that in the (normal) case with clouds. Set 2 of the AMIP standard output consists of the monthly mean global geographical distributions of selected three-dimensional variables (temperature, geopotential height, specific humidity, the zonal and meridional wind and the associated stream function and velocity potential) at the 850, 500 and 200 hPa levels. In addition, set 2 includes the geographical distributions of the monthly variance (defined as the variance about the monthly mean of the daily averages found from 6 hourly values) of all variables in the set, while set 1 includes the monthly variance of selected variables (sea-level pressure, ground and surface air temperature). Set 3 of the AMIP standard output consists of the monthly means of the zonally-averaged distributions of selected variables in the meridional-vertical plane (temperature, specific and relative humidity, cloudiness, zonal and meridional wind, and the mean meridional streamfunction).
<P>
In anticipation of the use of the AMIP results in a wide variety of diagnostic studies, some of which may require information not contained in the monthly averaged standard output sets, each participating modeling group is requested to generate a 6-hourly history-of-state consisting of the prognostic variables of the model, along with the 6-hourly sub-totals of those quantities accumulated for the standard output. For those models without a diurnal cycle, a once daily history is appropriate.

<H3><A NAME="Section_4">4. AMIP implementation and present status</A></H3>
<P>
As part of its commitment to the implementation of AMIP, the PCMDI with the support the Environmental Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy is providing computer time to those atmospheric modeling groups wishing to run their models' AMIP simulation at LLNL, and is supporting the visit to Livermore of a representative of each group for that purpose. In order to manage effectively and to access the standard output and history-of-state data that are expected to be in archival storage at LLNL, the PCMDI has developed a data management system (known as the Data Retrieval and Storage system, DRS) for storing, retrieving and visualizing both model-generated and observational data. DRS is a file-oriented system of libraries and utilities that support a machine-independent data file format. These consist of the DRS Library, which is the programming interface to DRS, and the PCMDI Graphics package, which is a menu-driven, point-and-click utility that allows interactive data selection from DRS files and the creation and manipulation of graphic displays and animations. This software, as well as interactive utilities that support DRS file browsing and manipulation, are available to all AMIP participants as well as to other groups engaged in related studies. 
<P>
In support of AMIP and the broader interests of the atmospheric modeling community, PCMDI is developing a computerized database of the properties of the models participating in AMIP, as a subset of a more comprehensive information system of the principal historical versions of atmospheric GCMs.  PCMDI is also assembling an observational database for validation of the AMIP simulations and related diagnostic studies (see <A HREF="AMIPexp.html#Section_5">section 5</A>).
<P>
In testimony to the widespread interest in model validation and intercomparison in both the forecasting and climate modeling communities, there are presently more than 30 <A HREF="AMIPgroups.html">31 atmospheric GCMs</A> participating in AMIP. This includes models from all of the world's principal climate modeling groups as well as those from many operational weather forecasting centers. The principal characteristics of the AMIP models are summarized by Phillips (1994) and <A HREF="../../modldoc/amip/amip.html">Phillips et al. (1995)</A>. 
<P>
The horizontal resolution of the models being used for AMIP ranges from 2.5 degrees latitude x 3.75 degrees longitude to about 4 degrees latitude x 6 degrees longitude among the 12 finite-difference models represented, and from R15 to R40/T63 among the participating 19 spectral models, while the number of vertical levels (usually in sigma or hybrid coordinates) ranges from 2 to 30. Although most models include a diurnal cycle, there are wide variations in the schemes used in models' parameterization of radiation, convection, clouds, frictional effects and soil properties. 
<P>
From the monthly-averaged standard output (see <A HREF="Table_1.html">Table</A>), the PCMDI, in cooperation with the participating modeling groups, will undertake the preparation of a series of reports summarizing and intercomparing the models' results, together with an estimate of the models' systematic errors on the basis of the observational data bank being assembled for AMIP model validation (described below). While much important information on the model's individual and collective performance will be provided by these statistics, insight into the models' portrayal of specific physical mechanisms requires a deeper and more revealing diagnosis of the results.

<H3><A NAME="Section_5">5. AMIP diagnostic subprojects</A></H3>
<P>
To promote the advanced or sophisticated diagnosis of the AMIP results, a series of <A HREF="AMIPsubprojects.html">diagnostic subprojects</A> is being undertaken by members of both the climate modeling and climate diagnostics communities. Each diagnostic subproject is focussed on a particular phenomenological aspect of the simulations, on a particular physical or dynamical process, or on model performance in a particular region.  Following approval of a diagnostic subproject proposal by the WGNE AMIP Panel, the <A HREF="AMIPgroups.html">AMIP modeling groups</A> are polled as to their willingness to release their model's data and/or their interest in being more actively involved by providing the required diagnostics and participating in the analysis.
<P>
The PCMDI will assist the diagnostic subprojects in the acquisition of the required model data from the AMIP standard output and the model histories (which are expected to be available at LLNL in DRS format), and will provide computational assistance to the extent feasible. Proposals for additional AMIP diagnostic subprojects are welcome, and should be sent to the author as soon as possible.

<H3><A NAME="Section_6">6. Future plans</A></H3>
<P>
After completion of the computational phase of AMIP in 1994, attention will increasingly focus on the analysis and intercomparison of the results as discussed above. This diagnostic phase of AMIP is expected to continue for as long as necessary in order to exploit fully the unique AMIP dataset. An informal AMIP Newsletter is issued twice each year by PCMDI, in which summaries of the project's status and other information relevant to AMIP are given; AMIP Newsletters are available from PCMDI upon request. Depending upon progress, it is anticipated that an international AMIP scientific conference will be convened in 1995.
<P>
The availability of observational data with which to validate the models' performance is essential to the success of AMIP. Although data from a wide variety of sources are currently available, they are generally not for the specific AMIP decade or in a format readily useful in model validation and diagnosis. To develop a model-oriented observational database in support of AMIP, the PCMDI is acquiring gridded global data sets for as many of the variables in the AMIP standard output and for as many months of the AMIP period as possible. These data include temperature, geopotential, wind and relative humidity from both ECMWF and NMC analyses, and the cloudiness, radiation and precipitation as generated by the WCRP International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the WCRP/NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), and the WCRP Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) observational programs, respectively. It is planned to store these data (and other relevant data that may become available) at PCMDI in uniformly-formatted DRS files for ease of access and use in connection with AMIP analyses. It is recognized that when a reanalysis of the period 1979-1988 is performed with an advanced data assimilation system (as currently under consideration by both the ECMWF and NMC), it will be possible to generate consistent observational estimates of the AMIP monthly-averaged standard output variables as well as a complete history. AMIP therefore provides an important justification for carrying out such a reanalysis in a timely fashion over the next few years (Bengtsson and Shukla, 1988).
<P>
In addition to its obvious and unprecedented value in the comprehensive validation of the current generation of atmospheric GCMs, the results of AMIP can serve as a reference for the systematic documentation of model improvements by the repetition of some or all of the AMIP simulation with new model versions, and may also provide a useful yardstick for sensitivity and predictability studies with atmospheric models. AMIP also compliments the intercomparison of ocean models being undertaken by the WCRP TOGA Numerical Experimentation Group (D. Anderson and T. Stockdale, personal communication), and may serve as a prototype for intercomparisons of coupled atmosphere-ocean GCMs. In the future it may be useful to extend the AMIP period beyond 1988 (and perhaps before 1979), and to repeat the AMIP integrations with improved boundary conditions as well as with improved models. Independent realizations of the AMIP integration with different initial conditions have already been recognized by several modeling groups as an important source of information on natural variability and climate predictability.
<P>
AMIP may be regarded as the first "electronic" model intercomparison, in the sense that its results and diagnoses (along with the corresponding observed data) will be electronically available for analysis and display. The greatest obstacle to achieving this goal lies in the development of efficient techniques for the storage, retrieval and visualization of extremely large databases. This is a major challenge to the computational sciences community on whose skills climate modeling studies increasingly depend.

<TITLE>Hawai`i English Language Program</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor ="#ffffff">
<img src ="images/helplogo25.GIF"><p>

<STRONG>The Hawai'i English Language Program (HELP)</STRONG> is a
full-time noncredit intensive ESL program designed for
highly motivated individuals who wish to improve their
English skills for academic, business, or professional
needs. For intermediate students, an intensive TOEFL
preparation course is also available. HELP is open to all
applicants 18 years or older who have completed high school
or its equivalent. The program issues I-20s for full-time
international students. 
<H3>Location</H3>
HELP is located on the campus of the University of Hawaii in beautiful Manoa
Valley in Honolulu, the capital of the State of Hawaii.
Manoa Valley is known for its frequent, brilliant rainbows.
The campus is only minutes away from the heart of Honolulu
and the beaches of Waikiki and Ala Moana. 

<H3>Quarterly Terms</H3></CENTER>
There are four 10-week terms each
year, beginning in January, April, July, and October. (See
the insert for specific dates.)  Each full time student will
be in class four hours a day, five days a week for a total
of 20 hours. All classes are conducted in the HELP facility
from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
<HR>
<CENTER><H2>Faculty and Staff</H2></CENTER>

The faculty and staff are highly qualified professionals with
many years of  teaching experience overseas and in the U.S.

<CENTER><H2>Courses and Levels of Instruction</H2></CENTER>
HELP offers
courses at five levels of instruction:  Basic, Beginning,
Low-Intermediate, High-Intermediate, and Advanced. Courses
are of three types:  core courses in Reading, Writing,
Structure and Communication skills; elective content-based
courses; and the TOEFL preparation courses. The TOEFL
preparation courses will concentrate on reading
comprehension, structural analysis, listening comprehension,
vocabulary development and test-taking strategies for TOEFL.
In addition to the twenty in-class hours per week, there are
approximately one to two hours of related outside
assignments per day. These assignments are intended to help
students extend their English language skills beyond the
regular classroom lessons. 
<CENTER><H2>Placement Testing and Orientation</H2></CENTER>
All new and returning HELP students are
required to take the HELP placement test in order to
establish their level of language proficiency. There is no
minimum score for admission to HELP. Students who score at
the basic level will probably require 6 to 8 quarters to
reach the advanced level of English language proficiency.
After placement testing, students will receive counseling
for course selection and an orientation that will offer
important information about the program and services
available at the University of Hawai'i. 
<CENTER><H2>Student Activities and Holidays</H2></CENTER>
A variety of activities are
planned for HELP students to provide opportunities to get to
know other students and their cultures and to learn more
about Hawaii and its unique way of living. HELP commemorates
all State and National holidays that the University of
Hawai'i observes. 
<CENTER><H2>Important Admissions Information</H2></CENTER>
Admission to HELP does not constitute admission to the
University of Hawaii at Manoa. Therefore, HELP students may
not register for credit courses offered by the University of
Hawaii.
<H3>Housing and Living Expenses</H3>
HELP is not
able to offer on campus student housing. Students are
responsible for their own housing arrangements. A separate
insert provides assistance in finding suitable off-campus
housing. Living expenses vary a great deal, depending on the
level of lifestyle you pursue. In order to estimate your
expenses, you should consider the cost of HELP fees,
textbooks, health insurance (if purchased through HELP),
housing, and living expenses. Please see inserted sheet for
current estimated expenses. 
<H3>Medical Insurance</H3>
All
students are required to have a medical insurance plan.
Students must show proof of a medical plan purchased in
their home country or purchase a medical plan through HELP
upon arrival. <h4>Student Visas</h4> "This school is
authorized under federal law to enroll non-immigrant alien
students." HELP issues I-20 AB forms (certificate of
eligibility) for applicants who are accepted into the
program. Applicants should take the I-20 AB form to the U.S.
Embassy or Consulate in their country to obtain a student
visa (F-1).

<H2> How and What is the DTS? (And what it isn't) </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The DTS (Document Tracking System) was implemented on June to September of 
1995 after a discussion with, then the Interim Dean of the College of Continuing
Education, Gerald Morihara.  He wanted a system that would stream-line the processing
of various documents that flowed throughout the College.  The DTS was a tool to
"coerce" staff members to process the documents that entered into their in-tray in
a timely manner.  The system was to clue the originator of a document to the different stages 
of processing his/her document was expected to go through and take the appropriate steps
if deviations occured.
<P>
The DTS logs the flow of a real document as it changes hands within the College.  It is not
a substitute for actual forms.  Forms are not represented electronically by the system --
the system is not a forms editor.  Instead, it holds information about the form/document(s) and who
may currently have it.
<P>
The DTS was implemented using ACI`US 4th Dimension (4D) relational database.  The server is a currently
a Macintosh IIfx with 32 Megabytes of RAM and can support 25 simultaneous users.  CCECS is networked 
via 10BaseT supporting a total of 72 nodes.  Client machines vary from IIcx's to PowerMac 7100's.

<p>The name"Puette" is derived from the old Saxon word for magpie and the typically French diminutive "ette" was added by the Normans at  the time of the conquest of 1066.<P>

The shield design appearing as background to this page is a crest that dates back to the crusades in which an ancient ancestor presumably distinguished himself in battle/pillage.  The three yellow circles represent "bezants" or coins from the crusades. <p>

The name "Puette" is, therefore, a British surname and harkens back to old Staffordshire.  Details of the family's movement to America have not been tied down yet, but there is evidence of migration from old Virginia to Lenoir, North Carolina around 1790.<P>
<hr>
<P>Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, I am a twenty-seven year resident of the State of Hawai'i.  I was recruited from the mainland in 1969 to teach English at a public school on Maui.  I became a member of the Maui Teachers' Association and, soon thereafter, was a conventioneer at the founding of the Hawaii State Teachers' Association.  A few years later, I found himself serving as a school leader and picket captain during Hawai'i's first
state-wide teachers' strike.
<P>
I have an M.A. from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.
<P>
I taught as a Lecturer and Humanities Instructor variously at a private College in Kyoto, Japan, and the University of Hawai'i's Honolulu and Leeward Community Colleges. For three years I served as a full-time field organizer and contract representative for the Central O'ahu Chapter of the Hawai'i State Teachers Association.  At present, I am the Director of the Center for Labor Education & Research at the University of Hawai'i where, for the past fourteen years, I have been teaching classes for the local labor movement and working to establish a Labor Studies degree program.  At CLEAR I teach a Union Leadership Skills Seminar, a Labor Law course and popular programs on Grievance Handling, Stress Management, and Labor History.
<P>
I am also the publishing editor for a Hawaiian labor history series, author of the booklets, <A HREF = "book5.html">Labor Dispute Picketing: Organizing a Legal Picket in Hawai'i</A> and <FONT color="#FF0000">Pa'a Hui Unions: the Hawai'i State AFL-CIO, 1966-1991</FONT>; and of the books: <A HREF = "book-genji.html">A Readers Guide to the Tale of Genji</A> (Tuttle, 1983), <A HREF = "book1.html">The Hilo Massacre</A>(UH, 1988), and <A HREF ="book-TJE.html">Through Jaundiced Eyes: How the Media View Organized Labor</A> (ILR Press, 1992).
<P>
In addition, I was appointed by the governor to the Hawai'i Committee for the Humanities; I'm a member of the executive board of the local chapter of the Industrial Relations Research Association; a college representative of the UH Professsional Assembly; a founding member of the Hawai'i Association of Labor Editors; and a long time volunteer counselor with the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America, having taught dozens of American Labor merit badge clinics for hundreds of boys throughout the state.  In 1992, working
with the Hawai'i State AFL- CIO and the Labor's Community Services Liaison Program of Hawai'i, I helped develop a similar program for the Hawai'i Council of the Girl Scouts, whivh was the first such program for Girl Scouts in the United States.
<P>
In 1993, I was named winner of Penn State's Lowell-Mellett Award for outstanding media criticism, and in 1994 was given the George Meany Award for Outstanding Service to Youth by the Hawai'i State AFL-CIO and the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
<p>

<strong>FOUNDATIONAL APPROACHES IN SCIENCE TEACHING (FAST)</strong><p>

<em>Foundational Approaches in Science Teaching </em>(FAST) is a
multidisciplinary, integrated, inquiry science program designed to
meet the special needs of students in grades 7-10.  FAST uses a
laboratory-and field-centered approach to learning science.  Students
spend approximately 60% to 80% of class time doing investigations. 
The remaining time is devoted to data analysis, small-group and class
discussion, literature research, and report writing.  There are three
one-year courses in the program.  A separate teacher institute is
provided for each FAST course.  In the institute participants carry
out all activities and experience this curriculum as
students.<P><strong>

DEVELOPMENTAL APPROACHES IN SCIENCE, HEALTH, AND TECHNOLOGY
(DASH)</strong><p>

DASH is a sequential K-6 program that integrates the content of
science, health, and technology and articulates well with other
subjects.  In DASH, children discover the workings of science through
practical, hands-on experiences.  Activities are designed to promote
children's mental and physical development.  The goal of DASH is to
develop in students a basic knowledge of science, health, and
technology concepts and skills that will enable them to understand the
environmental and health concerns arising in our technological
society.<p>

The program uses a carefully planned sequence of activities involving
both students and teachers in defining concepts, generating and
testing ideas, correcting misconceptions, and ultimately coming to a
consensus on the adequacy of explanations.  Students engage in
classroom activities, field studies, data collecting, small group and
class discussion, home projects, and writing, drawing, or otherwise
recording findings.  Each activity results in a student invention or
other products.  In the institute participants carry out all
activities and experience the curriculum as students.<p><strong>

<p>The name"Puette" is derived from the old Saxon word for magpie and the typically French diminutive "ette" was added by the Normans at  the time of the conquest of 1066.<P>

The shield design appearing as background to this page is a crest that dates back to the crusades in which an ancient ancestor presumably distinguished himself in battle/pillage.  The three yellow circles represent "bezants" or coins from the crusades. <p>

The name "Puette" is, therefore, a British surname and harkens back to old Staffordshire.  Details of the family's movement to America have not been tied down yet, but there is evidence of migration from old Virginia to Lenoir, North Carolina around 1790.<P>
<hr>
<P>Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, I am a twenty-seven year resident of the State of Hawai'i.  I was recruited from the mainland in 1969 to teach English at a public school on Maui.  I became a member of the Maui Teachers' Association and, soon thereafter, was a conventioneer at the founding of the Hawaii State Teachers' Association.  A few years later, I found himself serving as a school leader and picket captain during Hawai'i's first
state-wide teachers' strike.
<P>
I have an M.A. from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania and a Ph.D. from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.
<P>
I taught as a Lecturer and Humanities Instructor variously at a private College in Kyoto, Japan, and the University of Hawai'i's Honolulu and Leeward Community Colleges. For three years I served as a full-time field organizer and contract representative for the Central O'ahu Chapter of the Hawai'i State Teachers Association.  At present, I am the Director of the Center for Labor Education & Research at the University of Hawai'i where, for the past fourteen years, I have been teaching classes for the local labor movement and working to establish a Labor Studies degree program.  At CLEAR I teach a Union Leadership Skills Seminar, a Labor Law course and popular programs on Grievance Handling, Stress Management, and Labor History.
<P>
I am also the publishing editor for a Hawaiian labor history series, author of the booklets, <A HREF = "book5.html">Labor Dispute Picketing: Organizing a Legal Picket in Hawai'i</A> and <FONT color="#FF0000">Pa'a Hui Unions: the Hawai'i State AFL-CIO, 1966-1991</FONT>; and of the books: <A HREF = "book-genji.html">A Readers Guide to the Tale of Genji</A> (Tuttle, 1983), <A HREF = "book1.html">The Hilo Massacre</A>(UH, 1988), and <A HREF ="book-TJE.html">Through Jaundiced Eyes: How the Media View Organized Labor</A> (ILR Press, 1992).
<P>
In addition, I was appointed by the governor to the Hawai'i Committee for the Humanities; I'm a member of the executive board of the local chapter of the Industrial Relations Research Association; a college representative of the UH Professsional Assembly; a founding member of the Hawai'i Association of Labor Editors; and a long time volunteer counselor with the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America, having taught dozens of American Labor merit badge clinics for hundreds of boys throughout the state.  In 1992, working
with the Hawai'i State AFL- CIO and the Labor's Community Services Liaison Program of Hawai'i, I helped develop a similar program for the Hawai'i Council of the Girl Scouts, whivh was the first such program for Girl Scouts in the United States.
<P>
In 1993, I was named winner of Penn State's Lowell-Mellett Award for outstanding media criticism, and in 1994 was given the George Meany Award for Outstanding Service to Youth by the Hawai'i State AFL-CIO and the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America.
<p>
That's the professional me.  For a look at some of my personal interests,  follow the arrow "Forth."

Two years before the federal law (FMLA) was passed, Hawai'i enacted its own Family Leave law to allow up to four weeks of unpaid leave a year to employees who need to take care of a new baby or a sick family member.  At first the law affected only state and county workers, but after July 1994, the law covers all but federal employers in the State who have 100 or more workers for each working day of twenty or more weeks in the current or proceeding year.<P>
To be eligible for this leave, employees must have been working for six months.  Employees are expected to give "reasonable notice" in cases where the leave is "foreseeable."  Employers may require applicants to provide certification from an appropriate authority.  Upon return from statutory family leave, employees must be returned to their former position or equivalent position with the same pay, benefits, and other conditions of employment.<P>
An aggrieved employee must file a "verified complaint in writing" the State Department of Labor and Industrial Relations.<P>
To a large degree, this state law has been overshadowed by the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 which covers employers with even less 100 employees and provides more weeks of unpaid leave.

<strong><A NAME ="FMLA">Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (Pub. L.
103-3)</strong><A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch28.html">(29 U.S.C. Chapter 28)</A>
<br> 
This federal law requires employers of 50 or more employees within a 75 mile area to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons, such as:
<UL>
<LI>The birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care;</li>
<LI>The care of an immediate family member (spouse, child or parent, or someone who stands or stood in place of such a family member); or</li>
<LI>Medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a 'serious health condition'.</li>
</UL>

Employees are eligible if they have worked for a covered employer for at least one year, and for 1,250 hours over the previous 12 months. [Rules & Regs. at 29
C.F.R. 825 & LRX 403:7101)<P>

<p>

The employee may be required, where the leave is 'foreseeable', to provide 30 days advance notice and medical certification.  Leave may be intermittent or a reduction in the usual number of hours worked per day or week.  Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee must ordinarily be restored to his/her former
position/pay/benefits and other terms of employment.<P>

For the duration of the FMLA leave, the employer must maintain the employee's medical insurance coverage, though the employee may be liable to reimburse the employer for such premium payments if he/she does not return to work.  And it is unlawful for the employer to discharge, discriminate, restrain or coerce an employee for using the leave.</a><P>

<strong><A NAME ="FLSA">The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/ch8.html">
(29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.)</A></strong><BR>
The FLSA was enacted to regulate wages and hours and the employment of child
labor. Commonly referred to as the federal wage and hour law, the FLSA sets the
federal minimum wage and was amended in 1963 by the Equal Pay Act to prohibit
sex-based wage discrimination as well.<P>

<A HREF ="http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/whd_org.htm">http://www.dol.gov/dol/esa/public/whd_org.htm</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE><br>

Today the law provides compensation standards and regulation in four basic
areas: 1) minimum wages; 2) overtime compensation; 3) sex-based wage
discrimination; and 4) child labor.  It applies generally to interstate commerce
and industry (liberally construed) and operates independently of individual
state laws and other federal acts which apply compensation standards to public
works contracts (<A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/40/276a.html">
Davis-Bacon</A>), government service contracts (<A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/40/ch6.html">
Service Contract
Act</A>), and government supply contracts (<A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/41/35.html">
Walsh-Healey</A>).  Thus, higher state
minimum wage acts are not superseded or preempted, and federal standards cannot
be used to excuse non-compliance with the higher state minimums.  For instance,
as of 10/1/96 the federal minimum wage per hour was $4.75 which will rise to $5.15 on 9/1/97, but the state of Hawai`i minimum rate since 1/1/93 has been $5.25, so in Hawai`i the state minimum takes precedence.  The federal wage and hour laws do not limit the number of hours that an employee can work in a week, but the employee must be paid time-and-one-half the regular rate for each hour worked over 40 hours in a workweek.<P>

Federal law defines 'oppressive child labor' through the use of age
restrictions. Essentially minors under 14 cannot be employed except in
agriculture; minors 14 to 16 can work limited hours outside of their school
hours in a limited class of jobs; and minors 16 to 18 cannot be employed in
certain hazardous occupations. Under the federal law, an employee may sue for
back wages within two years (three in the case of willful violations), while the
state provides workers up to six years to file suit.<P>

<strong>COVERAGE & EXEMPTIONS:</strong><br>
The FLSA uses rather complicated formulae in determining which workers are
covered.  Exemptions may apply to classes of employees or types of industries,
or may exempt certain workers from some, but not all provisions of the act. For
example agricultural workers employed by members of the immediate family; a
hand-harvest laborer paid on a piece-rate basis and who commutes daily to the
farm at which he's employed; an employee of an employer who did not use more
than 500 man-days of agricultural labor during the calendar year, etc.<P>

White Collar Exemption Rules:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Executive, $250+/week; has the primary duty of managing an enterprise,
department or subdivision thereof; customarily directs the work of two or more
employees.</li>
<LI>Administrative, $250+/week; primary duty is office work directly related to
mgmt. policies or work related to academic instruction; exercises discretion and
independent judgement in the performance of non-manual work. </li>
<LI>Professional, $250+/week; primary work is the performance of
learned/artistic/ educational profession.</li>
<LI>Outside sales, works away from employer's place of business, paid mostly on
commissions with little or no supervision.</li>
<LI>Highly skilled in a computer-related occupation, paid at least 6.5 times the
minimum wage; primary duties are consultation and program design, creation or
modification.</li>
</UL>

In 1947 the Portal to Portal Act (29 U.S.C. 251-262) amended FLSA to give
clearer definition the term "workday" and to answer questions regarding
employers' liability to compensate workers.<P>


HOURS WORKED (29 CFR Part 785)<br>
<DL>
<DT>Voluntary late work -29 CFR 785.11
<DD>Work not requested but suffered or permitted is work time. For example, an
employee may voluntarily continue to work at the end of the shift. He may be a
piece worker, he may desire to finish an assigned task or he may wish to correct
errors, paste work tickets, prepare time reports or other records. The reason is
immaterial. The employer knows or has reason to believe that he is continuing to
work and the time is working time.<P>

<DT>Rest breaks	-29 CFR 785.18
<DD>Rest periods of short duration, running from 5 minutes to about 20 minutes
are common in industry.  ... They must be counted as hours worked.<P>

<DT>Meal breaks	-29 CFR 785.19
<DD>Bona fide meal periods are not worktime.  Bona fide meal periods do not
include coffee breaks or time for snacks.  These are rest periods.  The employee
must be completely relieved from duty for the purposes of eating regular meals.
... The employee is not relieved if he is required to perform any duties,
whether active or inactive, while eating.<P>

<DT>Lectures/meetings	-29 CFR 785.27
<DD>Attendance at lectures, meetings, training programs and similar activities
need not be counted as working time if the following criteria are met: (a)
Attendance is outside of the employee's regular working hours; (b) Attendance is
in fact voluntary; (c) The course, lecture or meeting is not directly related to
the employee's job; (d) The employee does not perform any productive work during
attendance.<P>

<DT>Training programs	-29 CFR 785.31
<DD>The training is directly related to the employee's job if it is designed to
make the employee handle his job more effectively as distinguished from training
him for another job, or to a new or additional skill.<p>

<DT>Changing clothes at work	-29 CFR 785.24 and 790.8(c)
<DD>Among the activities included as an integral part of a principal activity
are those closely related activities which are indispensable to its performance.
 If an employee in a chemical plant for example, cannot perform his principal
activities without putting on certain clothes, changing clothes on the
employer's premises at the beginning and end of the workday would be an integral
part of the employee's activity.<P>

<DT>Changing clothes off work	 -29 CFR 785.24 and 790.8(c)
<DD>On the other hand, if changing clothes is merely a convenience to the
employee and not directly related to his primary activities, it would be
considered as a 'preliminary' or 'postliminary' activity rather than a principal
part of the activity.<P>

<DT>Travel time to/from work	-29 CFR 785.35
<DD>... travel time at the commencement or cessation of the workday .... need
not be counted as worktime unless it is compensable by contract, custom or
practice.  On the other hand, 29 CFR 785.36 provides, if an employee who has
gone home after completing his day's work is subsequently called out at night to
travel a substantial distance to perform an emergency job ... all time spent on
such travel is work time.<P>


<DT>Travel time during work	-29 CFR 785.38
<DD>Time spent by an employee in travel as part of his principal activity, such
as travel from job site to job site during the workday, must be counted as hours
worked.<p>

<DT>Civic work -co. requested   -29 CFR 785.44
<DD>Time spent in work for public or charitable purposes at the employer's
request, or under his direction or control, or while the employee is required to
be on the premises, is working time.<P>

<DT>Medical attention  -29 CFR 785.43
<DD>Time spent by an employee in waiting for and receiving medical attention an
the premises or at the direction of the employer during the employee's normal
working hours on days when he is working constitutes hours worked.<P>

<DT>On call time	 -29 CFR 785.17
<DD>An employee who is required to remain on call on the employer's premises or
so close thereto that he cannot use the time effectively for his own purposes is
working while 'on call'.  An employee who is not required to remain on the
employer's premises but is merely required to leave word at his home or with
company officials where he may be reached is not working while on call.<P>
</DL>

INDUSTRIAL HOMEWORK  (29 CFR, Part 530)<BR>
One of the earliest and longest struggles of the labor movement has been the
fight against industrial sweatshops and unregulated piecework doled out as
homework to workers at low or subminimum wage rates.   The FLSA defines homework
as work done in or about a home, apartment, tenement, or room in a residential
establishment.<P>

Homeworkers must be paid at least the hourly minimum wage and overtime in
accordance with the act, unless the employer has a certificate permitting the
employment of a particular disabled worker at less than the minimum wage.<P>

There is no general ban on homework; however, regulations do require employers
to obtain certification from the DOL for garment industry and jewelry
manufacturing workers.</a><P>

Employers in certain industries may select 20 work-weeks per year during which they shall be exempt from the overtime compensation requirement, although they must pay 1 and 1/2 times the regular rate for hours in excess of 48 per week.  These
industries are agriculture; first processing of dairy products; processing of sugar cane molasses or sugar cane; first processing or canning or packing and agricultural or horticultural commodity; handling, slaughtering, or dressing poultry or livestock; agriculture and processing of agricultural products seasonally; or first processing or canning or packing of seasonal fresh fruits.<P>

EQUAL PAY:<BR>

Variation of rates are not prohibited if based on seniority of length of service, substantial difference in duties or services performed, difference in shift.  The employer may not reduce the rate of pay of a higher paid worker in order to comply with this section.<P>

ENFORCEMENT:
Under Section 387-12(b) any employer who violates the minimum wage or overtime provisions of this law is liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation, and in the case of wilful violation in an additional amount as liquidated damages.</a><P>
<HR SIZE = 6>
<strong><A NAME ="Payment">Hawai'i Payment of Wages Law</A></strong><br>
Requires employers to pay wages regularly at least twice each calendar month and within 7 days after the end of each pay period.  Payment must be in cash or check convertible to cash on demand.  If the paycheck bounces, the employer is liable for any special handling fee assessed by the bank.

breakage charges, bad checks accepted or the cost of required physical exams, nor may the employer or prospective employer require payment of job application processing fees.<P>

It must be noted, however, that the law does not cover State and County employees and allows a variety of exceptions to the above provisions which need to be weighed in light of the specific details of each case.</a><P>

<HR SIZE = 6>
<strong><A NAME ="Garnish">Hawai`i Garnishment of Wages Law, HRS
652</strong><br>
Under the Garnishment Law, an employee who has major debts or creditors may have a portion of his/her wages withheld by court order until the debt is paid.   The law allows for the portion withheld to be 5% of the first $100 per month, 10% of the next $100, and 20% of the amount exceeding $200 per month.<P>

The federal wage garnishment law (Title III of the <A HREF = "http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1673.html">
Consumer Credit Protection
Act</A>) further limits the amount of an employee's weekly earnings which may be garnished to 25% of his/her disposable earnings.  The federal law and the Hawai`i Employment Practices Act (HRS &#167;378-32) also prohibit employers from discharging any employee because of the garnishment.</a><P>

Under Hawai'i`s law, generally minors under 14 cannot be employed except in
theatrical or coffee harvesting.  Employers are required to obtain certificates
of age and employment for children under the age of 18 who are working in
compliance with the federal and state limitations.  Minors 14 and 15 years of
age may only be employed between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., except
from June 1 to the day before Labor Day, when they may work between 6:00 a.m.
and 9:00 p.m. The law also requires minors 14 and 15 years of age be given a
rest period of at least thirty consecutive minutes after working five hours
continuously.  The state law does not cover minors selling or distributing
newspapers, golf caddies, those employed by their parents, or minors working at
a private residence.</a><P>

<P>
</center>Published in 1986 with careful attention to the underlying economic issues, this history of the transit industry's labor relations sheds considerable light on the emergence of one of Hawaii's most controversial labor leaders.<P>
	From the time he first arrived in the islands in 1938, Art Rutledge has been one of the most significant figures in the history of the Hawaiian labor movement. Best known for the boldness of his confrontational style as the leader of Hawai'i's Teamsters and long time Business Manager of the hotel workers' union, Rutledge has had a definite impact on a number of different unions.<P>
	Though Stern's work does not attempt a definitive biographical treatment, this relatively short study of Art Rutledge's leadership of the transit workers' union accomplishes what many weightier books tend to miss. Stern shows us simply and directly the evolution of a leadership style and the building of a distinctive strategy for union representation that he describes as Rutledge Unionism. [147 pages]<P>


The late Bernard (Bernie) W. Stern was involved in labor relations work for over 50 yearsas a labor economist with the NLRB in Washington, as a union researcher and negotiator, as a consultant to both labor and management on benefit plans, and as a mediator in several disputes. From 1962-1965 he served as assistant to Art Rutledge. After twenty years as a consultant and mediator to Hawaii's labor community, he retired and began writing labor history.  He died May 4, 1988, shortly after completing work on <A HREF = "book3.html">The Aloha Trade</A>, his study of labor in Hawai'i's hotel industry.<P>

This is the most recent edition of CLEAR's popular little handbook on Labor Dispute Picketing.  This 1994 update contains short, easy-to-follow descriptions of the basic rules governing picket line conduct and organization.  The Guide includes information on the different types of picketing: ULP, informational picketing, area standards picketing, common-situs, secondary boycott, etc.. <p>

There is also a useful section of practical guidelines for picket captains and a 17-page summary of the laws of Hawai'i relating to ingress and egress, obstruction, etc., based in large part on the material used to brief police officers assigned picket line duty.<p>

Unlike the other CLEAR publications, this handbook is designed to fit in a pocket or handbag (5 and a half by 4 inches) as a ready reference. [54 pages].<P>

<A NAME ="S1"><strong>Sec. 89-1  Statement of findings and policy.</strong>  The legislature finds that joint decisionmaking is the modern way of administering government.  Where public employees have been granted the right to share in the decisionmaking process affecting wages and working conditions, they have become more responsive and better able to exchange ideas and information on operations with their administrators.  Accordingly, government is made more effective.  The legislature further finds that the enactment of positive legislation establishing guidelines for public employment relations is the best way to harness and direct the energies of public employees eager to have a voice in determining their conditions of work, to provide a rational method for dealing with disputes and work stoppages, and to maintain a favorable political and social environment.<p>

The legislature declares that it is the public policy of the State to promote harmonious and cooperative relations between government and its employees and to protect the public by assuring effective and orderly operations of government.  These policies are best effectuated by (1) recognizing the right of public employees to organize for the purpose of collective bargaining, (2) requiring the public employers to negotiate with and enter into written agreements with exclusive representatives on matters of wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, while, at the same time, (3) maintaining merit principles and the principle of equal pay for equal work among state and county employees pursuant to sections 76-1, 76-2, 77-31, and 77-33, and (4) creating a labor relations board to administer the provisions of chapters 89 and 377.

All members shall be appointed by the governor for terms of six years each.  Public employers and employee organizations representing public employees may submit to the governor for consideration names of persons representing their interests to serve as members of the board and the governor shall first consider these persons in selecting the members of the board to represent management and labor.  Each member shall hold office until the member's successor is appointed and qualified.  Because cumulative experience and continuity in office are essential to the proper administration of this chapter, it is declared to be in the public interest to continue board members in office as long as efficiency is demonstrated, notwithstanding the provision of section 26-34, which limits the appointment of a member of a board or commission to two terms.<p>

The members shall devote full-time to their duties as members of the board.  Effective January 1, 1989, and January 1, 1990, the salary of the chairperson of the board shall be set by the governor within the range from  $69,748 to $74,608 and $72,886 to $77,966 a year, respectively, and the salary of each of the other members shall be ninety-five per cent of the chairperson's salary.  No member shall hold any other public office or be in the employment of the State or a county, or any department or agency thereof, or any employee organization during the member's term.<p>

Any action taken by the board shall be by a simple majority of the members of the board.  All decisions of the board shall be reduced to writing and shall state separately its finding of fact and conclusions.  Any vacancy in the board shall not impair the authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.  The governor may appoint an acting member of the board during the temporary absence from the State or the illness of any regular member.  An acting member, during the acting member's term of service, shall have the same powers and duties as the regular member.<p>

The chairperson of the board shall be responsible for the administrative functions of the board.  The board may appoint an executive officer, mediators, members of fact-finding boards, arbitrators, and hearing officers, and employ other assistants as it may deem necessary in the performance of its functions, prescribe their duties, and fix their compensation and provide for reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties within the amounts made available by appropriations therefor.

The board shall be within the department of labor and industrial relations for budgetary and administrative purposes only.

<li>Establish, after reviewing nominations submitted by the public employers and employee organizations, lists of qualified persons, broadly representative of the public, to be available to serve as mediators, members of fact-finding boards, or arbitrators;<br>

Because of the nature of work involved and the essentiality of certain occupations that require specialized training, units (9) through (13) are designated as optional appropriate bargaining units.  Employees in any of these optional units may vote either for separate units or for inclusion in their respective units (1) through (4).  If a majority of the employees in any optional unit desire to constitute a separate appropriate bargaining unit, supervisory employees may be included in the unit by mutual agreement among supervisory and nonsupervisory employees within the unit; if supervisory employees are excluded, the appropriate bargaining unit for these supervisory employees shall be (2) or (4), as the case may be.<p>

The compensation plans for blue collar positions pursuant to section 77-5 and for white collar positions pursuant to section 77-13, the salary schedules for teachers pursuant to section 302A-624 and for educational officers pursuant to section 302A-625, and the appointment and classification of faculty pursuant to sections 304-11 and 304-13, existing on July 1, 1970, shall be the bases for differentiating blue collar from white collar employees, professional from institutional, health and correctional workers, supervisory from nonsupervisory employees, teachers from educational officers, and faculty from nonfaculty.  In differentiating supervisory from nonsupervisory employees, class titles alone shall not be the basis for determination, but, in addition, the nature of the work, including whether or not a major portion of the working time of a supervisory employee is spent as part of a crew or team with nonsupervisory employees, shall also be considered.<p>

(b) For the purpose of negotiations, the public employer of an appropriate bargaining unit shall mean the governor or his designated representatives of not less than three together with not more than two members of the board of education in the case of units (5) and (6), the governor or his designated representative of not less than three together with not more than two members of the board of regents of the University of Hawai'i in the case of units (7) and (8), and the governor or his designated representatives together with the mayors of all the counties or their designated representatives in the case of the remaining units.  The designated employer representatives for units (5), (6), (7), and (8) shall each have one vote and in the case of the remaining units, the governor shall be entitled to four votes and the mayor of each county shall each have one vote, which may be assigned to their designated representatives.

The fact-finding board, acting by a majority of its members, shall transmit its findings of fact and any recommendations for the resolution of the dispute to both parties within ten days after its appointment.

If the dispute continues thirty days after the date of the impasse, the parties may mutually agree to submit the remaining differences to arbitration, which shall result in a final and binding decision.  The arbitration panel shall consist of three arbitrators, one selected by each party, and the third and impartial arbitrator selected by the other two arbitrators.  If either party fails to select an arbitrator or for any reason there is a delay in the naming of an arbitrator, or if the arbitators fail to select a neutral arbitrator within the time prescribed by the board, the board shall appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators necessary to complete the panel, which shall act with the same force and effect as if the panel had been selected by the parties as described above.

(c) If the parties have not mutually agreed to submit the dispute to final and binding arbitration, either party shall be free to take whatever lawful action it deems necessary to end the dispute; provided that no action shall involve the disruption or interruption of public services within sixty days after the fact-finding board has made public its findings of fact and any recommendations for the resolution of the dispute.  The employer shall submit to the appropriate legislative bodies the employer's recommendations for the settlement of the dispute on all cost items together with the findings of fact and any recommendations made by the fact-finding board.

If, after eighteen working days from the date of impasse, the parties have not mutually agreed upon an arbitration procedure and an arbitrator or arbitration panel, the board shall immediately notify the employer and the exclusive representative that the issues in dispute shall be submitted to a three-member arbitration panel who shall follow the arbitration procedure provided herein.<br>

Within five calendar days after receipt of such list, the parties shall alternately strike names therefrom until a single name is left, who shall be immediately appointed by the board as the impartial arbitrator and chairman of the arbitration panel.<p>
Upon the selection and appointment of the arbitration panel, each party shall submit to the panel, in writing, with copy to the other party, a final offer which shall include all provisions in any existing collective bargaining agreement not being modified, all provisions already agreed to in negotiations, and all further provisions other than those relating to contributions by the State and respective counties to the Hawai'i public employees health fund which each party is proposing for inclusion in the final agreement.<br>

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the parties from reaching a voluntary settlement on the unresolved issues, with or without the assistance of a mediator, at any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing conducted by the arbitration panel.<p>
Within thirty calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, a majority of the arbitration panel shall issue a final and binding decision.<p>
