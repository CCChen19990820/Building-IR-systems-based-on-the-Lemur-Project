<P>    CHICAGO, Nov. 6,1996-- The Internal Revenue Service encourages
parents to get ready for the upcoming tax filing season early by obtaining
taxpayer identification numbers (TINs) from their day-care providers and
making sure their dependents have social security numbers.</P>

<P>    Anyone claiming the credit for child and dependent care expenses must
include on their return the name, address, and TIN of each care provider.  If
the provider is a nonprofit charitable, religious, or educational
organization, only the name and address are required.</P>

<P>    A TIN is a social security number if the provider is an individual.  It's
an employer identification number if the provider is a partnership or
corporation.  The same requirement applies to a person who receives benefits
through their employer's dependent care assistance program.</P>

<P>    Form W-10 can be used to request this information from the provider.  To
get a free copy of this form, call the IRS toll-free at 1-800-TAX-FORM (829-
3676).</P>

<P>    In addition, anyone claiming a dependent born before December 1 of this
year must enter that person's social security number on their 1996 return.
Low and moderate income families claiming the Earned Income Credit are also
required to include social security numbers for their qualifying children.
According to the IRS, a refund will be reduced or delayed if any social
security number required to be listed on the return is either incorrect or
missing.</P>

<P>    For help getting a number or to resolve any questions about a social
security number you already have, visit a Social Security Administration
office or call toll-free 1-800-772-1211.</P>

<P>    CONTACT:  Steve Mongelluzzo of the Internal Revenue Service,

<P>Because some herb-selling shops or "botanicas" sell mercury for
use in homes, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
is alerting consumers that mercury vapors (which have no odor)
are hazardous. CPSC recommends that consumers avoid breathing
mercury vapors. Most uses of mercury that expose consumers to
fumes are banned. However, some ethnic traditions encourage the
sprinkling of mercury around the house for religious reasons.
This is hazardous because people - especially young children -
could breathe the mercury vapors.</P>

<P>Mercury can cause serious and permanent nerve and kidney damage.
Mercury poisoning (acrodynia) has these symptoms: rapid
heartbeat, sweating, irritability or hostility, withdrawal or
shyness, memory loss, peeling of hands and feet, leg pain, slight
hand tremors, difficulty with fine motor control (such as
handwriting), sleeplessness, and headaches. Young children and
children born to women exposed during pregnancy may be especially
sensitive.</P>

<P>If you believe you have mercury poisoning, see a doctor. If
mercury has been sprinkled in your home, open all windows so the
mercury vapors can escape. It may take several days of
ventilation to eliminate the mercury. If you have questions about
how to clean up and dispose of mercury, call your local health
department. To avoid mercury poisoning, do not sprinkle mercury
around the house or expose people in the home to mercury vapors.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), East West Distributing Co. and Walgreens of Deerfield,
Ill., is recalling about 95,900 hand-shaped, five finger Decorative
Novelty Candles made for Halloween. The hand-shaped wax candles generate
high flames that may present a fire hazard. </P>
     
<P>This recall is the third issued by CPSC and candle distributors concerning
the potential fire hazard associated with certain brands of the five
finger, hand shaped Halloween candles.  Recalls of two similarly styled
candles were issued by Russ Berrie and Company of Oakland, N.J., (for
17,600 Dem Bones and 67,600 Glowing Gore wax candles) and C.R. Seasons LTD
of Farmingdale, N.Y., (for 47,100 Bleeding Hand wax candles).
    </P> 
<P>The Decorative Novelty Halloween Candle is hand shaped with five fingers
each having individual wicks. The candle flames may reach 8 inches high as
the candles melt down to the palm with the wicks of the five fingers
burning together. East West Distributing Co. and Walgreens have received
no reports of excess flames or injuries associated with the Bleeding Hand
Halloween candles. This recall is being conducted to prevent injuries and
fires.
    </P> 
<P>The hand-shaped wax candle is pink skin-toned color with a red band around
the bottom of the wrist. The 7-inch high candle is packaged in a purple,
red, and yellow-shaded cardboard box with a picture of the candle on the
front. The name "Decorative Novelty Candle" is printed on the front of the
box with the price of $2.99 in the upper right hand corner.. Walgreens
retail stores sold the five finger, hand-shaped candle nationwide from
August 1996 through October 1996 for $2.99.  
    </P> 
<P>Consumers should immediately stop using the hand-shaped candles and return
remaining candles to Walgreens for a refund of the purchase price. For
more information consumers should call East West Distributing Co. or
Walgreens at (800)289-2273.
    </P> 
<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from
unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or
a product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand
service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at
(800) 638-8270. To order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at CPSC's
web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via Internet gopher services at
cpsc.gov. Consumers can report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

Parents and schools need to work together so allchildren can succeed in school. </p><P>Almost everyone agrees that parents are, after all, their children'sfirst and most important teachers.  You, as a parent, haveimportant knowledge about your child's likes, dislikes, needs, andproblems that the school may not be aware of.  You may also haveideas for improving your child's school.  But even though studiesshow that most parents want to be involved in their children'seducation, they may not be exactly sure how to go about it,especially if, like most parents, they work during the school day.<p>Parents often ask the following questions:</P><HR><a name="Involve"></a><H3> What Can I Do To Involve Myself With My Child's School</H3> <P>Some schools value parent involvement by providing numerousopportunities for parents to interact with each other, with teachers,and with students.  Your child's school can provide ideas on howto participate.  One important way you can become involved inyour child's schooling is to exercise any choices available in theselection of course work, programs, or even schools.  Manyschools are moving toward "school-based management," in whichadministrators share the responsibility for operating schools withteachers, students, parents, and community members.  You canbecome involved in committees that govern your child's school orjoin the local parent-teacher association.</P> <P>The National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education(NCPIE) says that schools should regularly communicate withparents about their child's progress and the educational objectivesof the school.

For able or gifted learners, flexible pacinggenerallymeans some form of acceleration, accomplished by moving thestudent upto advanced content or by moving advanced content down to thestudent.The rate of progress can be varied in either direction. Withflexiblepacing all students can progress through school at a pacethatprovides a steady challenge without crippling frustrationorunreasonable pressure.   </P><HR><a name="Methods"></a><H3>MethodsTo Achieve Flexible Pacing </H3>  <P>In practice, flexible pacing can beachieved by a variety of methods:   </P><P>Continuous progress. Studentsreceive appropriate instruction dailyand move ahead as they master contentand skills. The purest form offlexible pacing, continuous progress breaksthe age-in-grade lockstep.   </P><P>Compacted course. Two or morecourses, usually scheduled for asemester each, are compacted into anabbreviated time.   </P><P>Advanced level course. Students are enrolledin courses normallytaught at a higher grade level.   </P><P>Gradeskipping. Students move ahead 1 or more years, skipping levelsin thenormal sequence of promotion.   </P><P>Early entrance. Students enterelementary school, middle school, highschool, or college earlier than theage usually prescribed.   </P><P>Concurrent or dual enrollment. Studentsat any grade level takeclasses in two school levels. For example,elementary school studentstake some classes at junior high; junior highstudents take some highschool classes; high school students enroll forsome courses at acollege or university.   </P><P>Credit by examination.Students enter an advanced-level course orreceive credit upon satisfactorycompletion of a comprehensiveexamination or upon certification of mastery.The best known examplesare the College Board's advanced placement andcollege-levelexamination programs.   </P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><HR><a name="How"></a><H3>HowCan Schools Or Districts Begin To Implement A Flexible PacingProgram?</H3>   <P>Flexible pacing will not occur systematically or toany significantextent unless the school or district has a policy thatstronglyencourages the practice and provides the necessary inservicesupportand planning time for teachers. It is often best to introducetheprogram gradually, with a carefully targeted student population.Somedistricts have selected a single subject area, often mathematics, asastarting place. Other school districts have successfullyintroducedcontinuous progress programs for students of all abilities atselectedschool sites. This approach works best when the principal andteacherschoose to work in that setting.   </P><P>Flexible pacing entailsnot only flexible instruction but alsoflexible management systems. Today,in many schools, computerizedstorage of records and schedules makesflexible pacing options easierto use, whereas the recordkeeping alonewould have been overwhelmingjust a few years ago. Attention to individualneeds for every studentor selected groups of students can be developedpiece by piece.Planners should start wherever appropriate: with a singlesubject, asingle set of students, or a single school.   </P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR><aname="Teacher"></a><H3>Teacher Changes Needed To Promote Flexible Pacing</H3>  <P>Allowing students to move through the school curriculum attheir ownpace requires a special commitment from every teacher. First,theteacher must agree that the best way to serve students is to allowthemto progress in key subject areas as they master content andskills. Theteacher must recognize that as a consequence students willbe placed forinstruction with other students at the same achievementlevel, notnecessarily with those of the same age.   </P><P>A shift to flexiblepacing normally requires training or retraining inteaching methods andclassroom management that support some form ofcontinuous progress.Inservice instruction may include conferences andworkshops on methods ofgrouping, team teaching, curriculumsequencing, and a variety of topicsspecific to the subject of pacing.Teachers may also need training in moreadvanced or broader contentwithin specialty areas. At the secondary level,summer institutes thatprepare teachers for the College Board's advancedplacement courses orthe International Baccalaureate are well established.Thesecooperative programs contribute by helping teachers address theneedsof advanced high school students undertaking college-levelcourseworkon their high school campuses.   </P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><HR><aname="Benefits"></a><H3>What Are The Benefits Of Flexible Pacing? </H3><P>The educational benefit of flexible pacing is individualizationofinstruction and learning to a higher degree than is possiblewhenstudents all move in lockstep. Students have found curriculummorechallenging and less repetitious. Arranging school-wide schedulinginblocks (e.g., mathematics from 9:00 to 10:00 a.m., reading andlanguagefrom 10:00 to 11:00) permits an easy flow in which allstudents arestudying the same subject at the same time but atdifferent levels. Oncegrade labels are removed from achievementlevels and disassociated fromchronological age, students of allabilities appear to thrive.</P><P>The desired outcome of sound teaching and learning, whatever thepace,is mastery of concepts and skills. In a school withcontinuousprogress, students can move ahead naturally as they are ready.Theyare not forced to choose between remaining in grade level, wheretheymay be bored, or skipping ahead, where they may miss learningcriticalskills or information.   </P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><HR><a name="People"></a><H3>HowAre People Reacting To Flexible Pacing Programs? </H3>  <P>Typically,teachers, administrators, and parents of children inschools with flexiblepacing are excited by the progress of theirchildren. Although flexiblepacing is too new to have established astrong database in research, mostschools using it have found that itallows highly able learners to moveahead rapidly in all aspects oflearning and skill development.</P><P>One survey of students in the Las Cruces Public Schools (Daniel&amp; Cox,1988) showed that students welcomed the opportunity for earlyentryinto a more complex curriculum. They viewed their years inacceleratedclasses as productive and challenging. All of the 37 studentsin theprogram said that if they had the choice to make over again,theywould still choose the accelerated curriculum. For each of them,theadvantages far outweighed any disadvantages.   </P><P>Flexible Pacingfor Able Learners is available from The Council forExceptional Children,1920 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091.   </P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR><aname="Resources"></a><H3>Resources</H3>   <P>Cox, J., Daniel, N.,&amp; Boston, B.

<H3>DO'S</H3>

<ul>
<li> Do remember that you can't take away their pain, but you can share it and help them feel less alone.</p>

<li>Do let your genuine concern and care show.</p>

<li>Do call the child by name.</p>

<li>Do treat the couple equally. Fathers need as much support as mothers.</p>

<li>Do be available ... to listen, to run errands, to drive, help with the other children, or whatever else seems needed at the time.</p>

<li>Do say you are sorry about what happened to their child and about their pain.</p>

<li>Do accept their moods whatever they may be, you are not there to judge. Be   sensitive to shifting moods.</p>

<li>Do allow them to talk about the child that has died as much and as often as they want.</p>

<li>Do talk about the special, endearing qualities of the child.</p>

<li>Do give special attention to the child's brother and sister--at the funeral and in the months to come (they too are hurt and confused and in need of attention which their parents may not be able to give).</p>

<li>Do reassure the parents that they did everything they could, that the care the child received was the best possible.</p>

<li>Do put on your calendar the birth and death date of the child and remember the family in the following years. Remembering the child is very supportive.</p>

<li>Do extend invitations to them. But, understand if they decline or change their minds at the last minute. Above all continue to call and visit.</p>

<li>Do send a personal note or letter and/or make a contribution to a charity that is meaningful to the family.</p>

<li>Do get literature about the disease and grief process to help you understand.</p>


</ul>

<hr>

<H3>DON'TS</H3>

<ul> 
<li>Don't think that the age of the child determines its value and impact.</p>

<li>Don't be afraid to touch, it can often be more comforting than words.</p>

<li>Don't avoid the family because you feel helpless, uncomfortable, or don't know what to say.</p>

<li>Don't change the subject when they mention their child.</p>

<li>Don't push the parents through the grieving process, it takes a long time to heal and they never forget.</p>

<li>Don't encourage the use of drugs or alcohol.</p>

<li>Don't ask them how they feel if you aren't willing to listen.</p>

<li>Don't say you know how they feel, unless you've lost a child yourself.</p>

<li>Don't tell them what they should feel or do.</p>

<li>Don't try to find something positive in the child's death.</p>

<li>Don't point out that at least they have and/or should be grateful for their other children.</p>

<li>Don't say that they can always have another child.</p>

<li>Don't think that death puts a ban on laughter. There is much enjoyment in the memory of the time they had together.</p>

<li>Avoid the following cliches It was God's will or it was a blessing." "You're young, you'll get over it." "At least it wasn't older." "Get on with your life. This isn't the end of the world." "God needed another flower for his garden." "You must be strong for the other children."</p>

<li>"Be brave, don't cry." "Time will heal." "You're doing so well."</p>

<H3>Please, SEE ME THROUGH MY TEARS</H3> <H4>by Kelly Osmont, 1982</H4>

<P>You asked, "How are you doing?" As I told you, tears came to my eyes ... you immediately began to talk again, your eyes looked away from me, your speech picked up, and all the attention you had given me went away...</P>

<P>How am I doing'? I do better when people will listen to my response, even though I may shed a tear or two ... for I so want their attention; but to be ignored because I have in me pain which is indescribable to anyone who has not been there ... I hurt and feel angry. So when you look away, I am again alone with it...</P>

<P>Really, tears are not a bad sign' you know! They're Nature's way of helping me to heal... They relieve some of the stress of sadness. I know you fear that asking how I'm doing brought this sadness to me... No, you're wrong.. the memory of my son's death will always be with me, only a thought away. It's just that my tears make my pain more visible to you ... but you did not give me the pain ... it's just there.</P>

<P>When I cry, could it be that you feel helpless? You're not, you know. When I feel your permission to allow my tears to flow, you've helped me more than you can know.</P>

<P>You need not verbalize your support of my tears, your silence as I cry is my key do not fear.</P>

<P>Your listening with your heart to "How are you doing?" helps relieve the pain, because once I allow the tears to come and go, I feel lighter. Talking to you releases things I've been wanting to say aloud, and then there's space for a touch of joy in my life.</P>

<P>Honest ... when I tear up and cry, that doesn't mean I'll cry forever-maybe just a minute or two-then I'll wipe the tears away, and sometimes you'll even find I'm laughing at something funny ten minutes later.</P>

<P>When I hold back my tears, my throat grows tight, my chest aches and my stomach begins to knot up... because I'm trying to protect you from my tears... then we both hurt... me, because I've kept the pain inside and it's a shield against our closeness, and then you hurt because suddenly, we're distant.</P>

<P>Please, take my hand and I promise not to cry forever (it's physically impossible, you know.)</P>

<P>When you see me through my tears... then we can be close again.</P>

<a name="Defining"></a>
<H3>Defining Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD)</H3>



<P>Attention deficit disorder is a syndrome characterized by serious and
persistent difficulties in the following three specific areas:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Attention span.

	<LI> Impulse control.

	<LI> Hyperactivity (sometimes).
</OL>

<P>ADD is a chronic disorder that can begin in infancy and extend through
adulthood, having negative effects on a child's life at home, school,
and within the community. It is conservatively estimated that 3 to 5%
of our school-age population is affected by ADD.</P>

<P>The condition previously fell under the headings, "learning disabled,"
"brain damaged," "hyperkinetic," or "hyperactive." The term attention
deficit disorder was introduced to describe the characteristics of
these children more clearly.</P>

<P>There are two types of attention deficit disorder, both of which are
described below.</P>

<HR>

<a name="Hyperactivity"></a>
<H3>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</H3>


<P>According to the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (3rd ed., rev.) (American Psychiatric Association,
1987), to be diagnosed as having ADHD a child must display, for 6
months or more, at least eight of the following characteristics prior
to the age of 7:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Fidgets, squirms or seems restless.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Has difficulty remaining seated.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Is easily distracted.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Has difficulty awaiting turn.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Blurts out answers.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Has difficulty following instructions.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Has difficulty sustaining attention.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Shifts from one uncompleted task to another.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Has difficulty playing quietly.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Talks excessively.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Interrupts or intrudes on others.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Does not seem to listen.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Often loses things necessary for tasks.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Frequently engages in dangerous actions.<BR><BR>
</OL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<HR>

<a name="Undifferentiated"></a>
<H3>Undifferentiated Attention Deficit Disorder</H3>


<P>In this form of ADD the primary and most significant characteristic is
inattentiveness; hyperactivity is not present. Nevertheless, these
children still manifest problems with organization and
distractibility, and they may be seen as quiet or passive in nature.
It is speculated that undifferentiated ADD is currently
under diagnosed, since these children tend to be overlooked more easily
in the classroom. Thus, children with undifferentiated ADD may be at a
higher risk for academic failure than those with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<HR>

<a name="Establishing"></a>
<H3>Establishing The Proper Learning Environment</H3>


<P>Seat students with ADD near the teacher's desk, but include them as
part of the regular class seating.</P>

<P>Place these students up front with their backs to the rest of the
class to keep other students out of view.</P>

<P>Surround students with ADD with good role models, preferably students
whom they view as significant others. Encourage peer tutoring and
cooperative/collaborative learning.</P>

<P>Avoid distracting stimuli. Try not to place students with ADD near air
conditioners, high traffic areas, heaters, or doors or windows.</P>

<P>Children with ADD do not handle change well, so avoid transitions,
physical relocation (monitor them closely on field trips), changes in
schedule, and disruptions.</P>

<P>Be creative! Produce a stimuli-reduced study area. Let all students
have access to this area so the student with ADD will not feel
different.</P>

<P>Encourage parents to set up appropriate study space at home, with set
times and routines established for study, parental review of completed
homework, and periodic notebook and/or book bag organization.</P>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<HR>

<a name="Instructions"></a>
<H3>Giving Instructions To Students With ADD</H3>



<P>Maintain eye contact during verbal instruction.</P>

<P>Make directions clear and concise. Be consistent with daily
instructions.</P>

<P>Simplify complex directions. Avoid multiple commands.</P>

<P>Make sure students comprehend the instructions before beginning the
task.</P>

<P>Repeat instructions in a calm, positive manner, if needed.</P>

<P>Help the students feel comfortable with seeking assistance (most
children with ADD will not ask for help).</P>

<P>Gradually reduce the amount of assistance, but keep in mind that these
children will need more help for a longer period of time than the
average child.</P>

<P>Require a daily assignment notebook if necessary:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Make sure each student correctly writes down all assignments each
	day. If a student is not capable of this, the teacher should help him
	or her.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Sign the notebook daily to signify completion of homework
	assignments. (Parents should also sign.)<BR><BR>

	<LI> Use the notebook for daily communication with parents.
</OL>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<HR>

<a name="Assignments"></a>
<H3>Giving Assignments</H3>



<P>Give out only one task at a time.</P>

<P>Monitor frequently. Maintain a supportive attitude.</P>

<P>Modify assignments as needed. Consult with special education personnel
to determine specific strengths and weaknesses of each student.
Develop an individualized education program.</P>

<P>Make sure you are testing knowledge and not attention span.</P>

<P>Give extra time for certain tasks. Students with ADD may work slowly.
Do not penalize them for needed extra time.</P>

<P>Keep in mind that children with ADD are easily frustrated. Stress,
pressure, and fatigue can break down their self-control and lead to
poor behavior.</P>

<a name="Overview"></a>
<H3>Overview  </H3>

<P>Approximately 3% to 6% of all school-aged children are believed to
have developmental reading disabilities, or dyslexia.  In fact, almost
50% of children receiving special education have learning
disabilities, and dyslexia is the most prevalent form. Consequently,
dyslexia has been given considerable attention by researchers and
extensive literature exists on instruction and remediation methods.</P>

<P>Dyslexia is a neurocognitive deficit that is specifically
related to the reading and spelling processes.  Typically, children
classified as dyslexic are reported to be bright and capable in other
intellectual domains.  Current research indicates that the vast
majority of children with dyslexia have phonological core deficits.
The severity of the phonological deficits varies across individuals,
and children with these deficits have been shown to make significantly
less progress in basic word reading skills compared to children with
equivalent IQs.  For example, some experts report that between ages 9
and 19, children with dyslexia who have phonological deficits improve
slightly more than one grade level in reading, while other children
with learning disabilities (LD) in the same classroom improve about
six grade levels.  Without direct instruction in phonemic awareness
and sound-symbol correspondences, these children generally fail to
attain adequate reading levels.</P>
<HR>

<a name="Definition"></a>
<H3>Definition  </H3>


<P>Phonological core deficits entail difficulty making use of
phonological information when processing written and oral language.
The major components of phonological deficits involve phonemic
awareness, sound-symbol relations, and storage and retrieval of
phonological information in memory.  Problems with phonemic awareness
are most prevalent and can coexist with difficulties in storage and
retrieval among children with dyslexia who have phonological deficits.</P>

<P>Phonemic awareness refers to one's understanding of and access
to the sound structure of language.  For example, children with
dyslexia have difficulty segmenting words into individual syllables or
phonemes and have trouble blending speech sounds into words.</P>

<P>Storage of phonological information during reading involves
creating a sound-based representation of written words in working
memory.  Deficits in the storage of phonological information result in
faulty representations in memory that lead to inaccurate applications
of sound rules during reading tasks.</P>

<P>Retrieval of phonological information from long-term memory
refers to how the child remembers pronunciations of letters, word
segments, or entire words.  Children with dyslexia may have difficulty
in this area, which leads to slow and inaccurate recall of
phonological codes from memory.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<HR>

<a name="Classification"></a>
<H3>Classification and Identification </H3>



<P>Historically, classification criteria for developmental dyslexia have
been vague and, consequently, open to interpretation.  For example,
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, revised 3rd edition (DSM-III-R), developmental reading
disorder (dyslexia) may be diagnosed if reading achievement is
"markedly below" expected level; interferes with academic achievement
or daily living skills; and is not due to a defect in vision, hearing,
or a neurological disorder.  Because of such imprecise guidelines,
educators and clinicians use a wide variety of criteria when defining
dyslexia.</P>

<P>School psychologists classify children based on federal and
state learning disability placement criteria.  The federal guidelines
for LD placement are as follows:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>      Disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes

(memory, auditory perception, visual perception, oral language, and
thinking).

<LI>     Difficulty in learning (speaking, listening, writing, reading,
and mathematics).

<LI>    Problem is not primarily due to other causes (visual or
hearing impairment, motor disabilities, mental retardation, emotional
disturbance, or economic environment or cultural disadvantage).

<LI>      Severe discrepancy between apparent potential and actual
achievement.
</OL>


<P>While the federal guidelines are more specific than the
DSM-III-R criteria, they are still rather nonspecific.  Consequently,
eligibility criteria for LD services for reading disabilities vary
from state to state.</P>

<P>Fortunately, there is some general agreement among educators,
clinicians, and researchers in terms of identifying phonological
deficits in children with dyslexia. Phonological processing impairment
is generally identified by significantly impaired performance
(generally, a standard score less than 85) on phonological processing
tasks.  The following include some assessment measures that may be
used to identify these phonological core deficits:</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), C.R. Seasons LTD. of Farmingdale, N.Y., is recalling
about 47,100 hand-shaped, five wick Bleeding Hand Halloween candles. The
hand-shaped wax candles generate high flames that may present a fire
hazard.</P>

<P>The Bleeding Hand wax candle is hand shaped with five fingers each having
individual wicks. The candle flames may reach 8 inches high as the candles
melt down to the palm with the wicks of the five fingers burning together.
C.R. Seasons has received no reports of excess flames or injuries
associated with the Bleeding Hand Halloween candles. This recall is being
conducted to prevent injuries and fires.</P>

<P>The hand-shaped Bleeding Hand wax candle is sold in two colors: pink
skin-toned with a red band around the bottom of the wrist; and dark green
with a red band around the bottom of the wrist. The 7-inch high candle
came in a plastic and purple cardboard package labeled with the names
"Bleeding Hand Candle" and "C.R. Seasons LTD" on the front and back of the
packaging.</P>

<P>Small gift and specialty stores and drug stores in New Jersey, New York,
and Connecticut and the discount store Caldor sold the Bleeding Hand
Candle during Halloween of 1995 and 1996 for about $4. Caldor is
cooperating with CPSC and C.R. Seasons in this recall.</P>

<P>Consumers should immediately stop using the hand-shaped Bleeding Hand
candle and return them to the place of purchase for a refund of the
purchase price. For more information consumers should call C.R. Seasons
LTD at (800) 425-9889.</P>

<P>    NEW YORK, Nov. 1, 1996-- Cirrus Air Technologies, the burgeoning
non-medical healthcare company, is introducing the newest version of its debut
product -- EarPlanes(R) to the public in early 1997.  New Children's EarPlanes
was created specifically for the sensitive ears of children, ages one to
eleven. </p>
<P>    EarPlanes(R) is the patented scientific breakthrough solution to the ear
pain experienced by millions of air travelers who fly while suffering from
sinus conditions, allergies, colds or who have ears sensitive to air pressure
changes.  EarPlanes has answered the question of over 42 million North
American air travelers per year: "How can I keep my ears from hurting?"  The
product was recently introduced to consumers following several years in
development.  Reaction to EarPlanes by healthcare professionals, the travel
industry and former ear pain sufferers has been positively received.</P>
<P>    EarPlanes' enthusiastic reception encouraged the company to introduce a
pediatric version, Children's EarPlanes, currently available for children,
ages three through eleven.  New Children's EarPlanes are in the final stages
of development now, and will be available to the public by January, 1997.</P>
<P>    "We knew we'd pioneered a unique pain-alleviating product that would fill
a void in the travel healthcare marketplace," said Drew O'Connell, president
of Cirrus Air Technologies.  "Our research indicated that each year almost one
out of three airline passengers suffers from ear pain on take off and landing,
but until the introduction of EarPlanes there wasn't a product that addressed
the needs of these travelers.  With more and more families traveling with
young children, our research showed that babies might need pain relief even
more than adults, since a child's Eustachian tube is not fully developed, and
therefore may experience more ear pain than older children or adults."</P>
<P>    Travel Smart reports that its products are now available at some 30,000
mass merchandisers, pharmacies and airport shops throughout the US including
WalMart, KMart, Walgreen's, CVS, Eckerd, Long's, and Sav-On.  EarPlanes and
Children's EarPlanes are also available throughout Canada and the United
Kingdom.</P>
<P>    In addition to EarPlanes, Cirrus Air Technologies' rapid growth enabled it
to develop and introduce a range of other ear related products using its
patented regulator technology.  These include AquaEars (protects water-
sensitive ears but does not block sound), Children's AquaEars (for children 3
through 11) and EarFilters (protects ears from harsh surrounding noises while
allowing normal conversation to be heard).  Also, FootPlanes(TM) a specialized
hosiery developed to control foot swelling while in-flight, are available now
through Cirrus Air Technologies.</P>
<P>    EarPlanes consist of a small, pliable disposable silicone rubber lug
(similar in look to a regular ear plug) which contains an ingenious CeramX
filter.  When this diminutive plug is inserted into the ear prior to take-off
and landing, it works with the body's own internal mechanism, enabling air
entering the ear to do so slowly, comfortably and safely negating the often
painful effects of rapid cabin air pressure changes.  EarPlanes are also a
safe and reliable alternative to taking cold or sinus medication for many
people since EarPlanes work in a similar way to clear the Eustachian tube of
fluid which causes pressure and consequently causes pain.  These "small
necessities" are effective ear devices for greater comfort during air travel,
water sports, and while in noisy environments.</P>
<P>    EarPlanes and New Children's EarPlanes retail for under $5 in the US and
about $7 (CND) in Canada for a round-trip pair.  To order by phone, call
800-962-4943.</P></P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Graco Children's Products Inc. of Elverson, Pa., is
announcing a free repair kit for about 133,000 traditional style Graco
playards (also known as a playpen). The mesh on playards made between
November 1995 and September 1996 may unravel from the seam, resulting
in a possible choking or entanglement hazard.  </P>

<P>Graco has received 9 reports of toddlers unraveling a strand from the mesh
and becoming entangled in it or mouthing it. No serious injuries resulted. </P>

<P>To protect children from possible injury, Graco is offering a free, easily
applied solution that will prevent the mesh strands from unraveling.</P>

<P>The recalled playards were sold nationwide in juvenile products and
discount stores such as Toys R Us and Walmart for $35 to $55 each. The
drop-side style playards have vinyl covered top rails and a vinyl covered
pad. A manufacturing date is located on a label on the playard floor under
the pad. Recalled playards have manufacturing dates 111395 (November 13,
1995) through 091296 (September 12, 1996).</P>

<P>Consumers should call Graco at (800) 423-9078 for a free repair kit and
application instructions or write to Customer Affairs, Graco Children's
Products Inc., P.O. Box 100, Elverson, PA 19520.  Consumers should not use
the playard if the netting has started to unravel.</P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from
unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or
a product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that
between 1985-1989, the latest period for which data are
available, there were 1,200 amputations of children's fingers
because of contact with exercise bikes. Most children were under
the age of five. Many of the injuries occurred when the child's
fingers touched the moving bike wheel or the chain and sprocket
assembly.</P>

<P>The Commission is concerned about the severity of injuries to
children, especially because the hazard may not be obvious.
Therefore, the Commission warns parents always to keep children
away from exercise bikes. Never use a bike without a chain guard,
and when not using the bike, store it where children cannot get
to it.</P>

<B>WARNING</B>

<P>Children's fingers can be amputated if they touch moving parts of
exercise bike.</P>

<P>Keep children away from exercise bike.</P>

<H3>Section 1: The Super Sitter  </H3>



<P>     Baby sitting can be a super way for you to earn money.  And,
it's a good way for you to learn a lot about children, about
families, about having a job, about managing money ... and about
PRODUCT SAFETY.  Every job has certain guidelines.  Baby sitting
is no exception.  There are certain things that will be expected
of you as a sitter and things that you should expect of the
parents. That's why the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
has prepared this Super Sitter Guide.  It is to help you become
more aware of some of these guidelines, particularly:  </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>   the need for constant observation and alertness to the
     	child's environment
	<LI>   selecting toys for children that are not dangerous
	<LI>    the importance of children playing with toys in the proper
     	manner
	<LI>    the need for keeping children's products in good condition
     	so they don't become dangerous for them to use
</UL>

<HR>

<a name="Expected"></a>
<H3>Section 2:  What Is Expected Of The Sitter  </H3>

<P>     There are certain do's and don'ts.  In addition to "sitting"
with the children, these are a few of the things you should know
and remember as a Safe Sitter.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	
<LI>   Before the parents leave, get the names and phone numbers
suggested in the Super Sitter's Very Important Phone Numbers
List.<BR><BR>
<LI>    Have the parents show you through the house or apartment and
point out where the items you will need are located, such as the
children's clothing or playthings.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Always know where the emergency exits are located. In case
of fire don't stop to try to put it out by yourself!  Get the
children out of the house without stopping to phone. Take them to
a neighbor.  Call the fire department, and then call the parents
to let them know where you and the children are.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Keep the youngsters safe by preventing accidents.  Know
where the potential hazards are, such as electrical outlets,
appliances, and exposed heating elements.  Also ask the parents
if all medicine, bleaches and household cleaners are securely
locked up.  <BR><BR>
<LI>    Stairs can be dangerous for youngsters.  Keep a
curious toddler from playing on or around them.  Running or
horseplay on them can lead to falls, particularly if the
youngsters are wearing socks or other "slippery" footwear.
Remember, too, that stairs are not meant to be a storage area.
Anything placed on the stairs can become an obstacle to fall
over.  <BR><BR>
<LI>    If there is a gate across the stairway, make sure it is
kept latched.  Babies in carriages, walkers or strollers should
never be left unattended, especially in an area around stairs
or ramps -- whether indoors or out.  A malfunction of the
carriage's safety brake or a sudden movement by the child could
put it right over the edge.  If a gate is not provided, place a
barrier of some kind in front of the stairway that a child
cannot climb over.  Accordion-style gates with large V-shaped
or diamond-shaped openings should not be used since they can
entrap a child's head, causing strangulation.  A gate with a
straight top or small V's and diamond-shaped openings is safer.
Make sure pressure gates are firmly in place and can't be
dislodged by the child.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   Caution the child about the dangers of glass doors or
windows. A child running or riding on a trike or bike could
easily go through the glass.  Be sure you keep toys, scatter rugs
and other articles that could cause someone to slip or trip away
from these areas.  If you are caring for a particularly active
child, place a large chair or other piece of furniture in front
of the glass area for safety's sake. You also can suggest to the
parents that large, colorful decals at eye level for both
children and adults can make glass doors safer.<BR><BR>
<LI>   Unless specifically instructed by the parents, do not bathe
the baby.  A clean facecloth in lukewarm water will suffice in
most cases for cleaning the skin.  Bathing a baby calls for
utmost care and supervision; aside from the risk of hot water
scalds, there is always the danger of drowning. While you may
want to be of help to the parents, bathing the infant is not
recommended.  <BR><BR>
<LI>    If you are changing the baby's diapers, plan on having
everything within immediate reach so you won't have to step away
from the infant even for a second. If you are not constantly
watching them, babies can roll over and fall from changing tables
or other high places.  Have diapers, pins, etc., next to you so
the baby is under constant supervision.  <BR><BR>
<LI>    Infants may choke on small items which they put
in their mouths.  Small pieces of food, coins, pins and other
non-toy items could lodge in the baby's throat and cause
choking or asphyxiation.  It could also occur with small toys
or parts of toys intended for older children.  Watch the baby
carefully to make sure these objects are not within reach.  In
the event of accidental choking, apply first aid measures to
clear the child's airway.  Also call the rescue squad.  (If you
don't know first aid, contact your local American Red Cross
office or  an approved community agency for instruction.)  <BR><BR>
<LI>    A "super sitter" will look for hazards before they surface.
Loose, baggy clothing can be dangerous if it gets caught on
furniture, cribs, playpens, etc., as children climb, play or
scamper about the room.  Clothing can also be a problem if it
becomes tightly wound around the baby.  Be on the alert for
hazards such as these, and adjust the clothing so that it
cannot become tangled.  <BR><BR>
<LI>   To prevent accidental injuries, keep doors and windows
locked at all times.  Remember that children, though under your
supervision, can at times just  "seem to disappear" from your
watchful eye.  <BR><BR>
<LI>    Never open the door to strangers.  If there is a question
about someone at the door, call the parents to check with them. <BR><BR>
<LI>    In case of accident or illness, don't try to be doctor or
nurse except for minor cuts and bruises. Call the parents for
instructions.  If they cannot be reached, call your own parents
or go to a neighbor for help. The sick or hurt child may require
a doctor or emergency care. <BR><BR>

<H3> Section 3: Where The Child Is ...
  </H3>


<P>     With several children -- particularly toddlers (2 and 3 year
olds) -- you won't be doing much sitting." You'll be playing with
them and supervising their play activities. Where They Play ...
Just a reminder that whether you're actually playing with the
children or supervising them, keep them within safe play areas,
preferably within your sight. Keep them away from potential
danger areas in the home such as the kitchen, bathroom, workshop
and storage areas.  They move fast, so you will have to be able
to move even faster!  </P>

<P><B>The Playpen</B>  <BR>
     You should be aware of hazards to a child left alone in a
playpen.  A string of toys across the top or even to one side of
the playpen could be a strangulation risk.  Dropside mesh
playpens and portable mesh cribs, used with a side left down, can
pose a serious hazard to newborns and infants.  When the side is
down, the mesh forms a loose pocket into which an infant can fall
or roll and suffocate. Dropsides should ALWAYS be up and locked
securely in position when a child is in the playpen or crib.
Don't put any toys in the playpen that a child can climb on to
get out.  And little fingers can get caught in hinges.  </P>

<P><B>Baby Walkers</B> ... the baby hot rod! <BR>
     Baby walkers seem fun to scoot around in, but they also can
scoot down a flight of stairs, into a hot stove, against a table
edge or into a glass door. They offer limited balance to a child
not yet completely able to stand or walk.  If unstable, walkers
can easily tip over.  Stay with the child when he or she is in
the walker, and assist it over thresholds or carpeting.   </P>

<P><B>High Chairs</B><BR>
    A child in a high chair requires almost constant attention.
Babies can slip out of a high chair in an instant if not properly
strapped in.  An unstable high chair can tip over ... with the
baby in it!  Make sure that any safety belts or straps on the
high chair are securely fastened and that the tray is properly
secured. Don't let the child stand up while in the chair, and
keep other children from climbing on it.  Keep the chair away
from "traffic lanes," doorways, refrigerator and stove, and far
enough away from tables and walls so that the child can't push
the chair over.  </P>

<P><B>The Crib </B><BR>
   If baby is to sleep safely, make sure that the crib is as safe
as you can make it.  If there is too much room (more than two
fingers width) between the mattress and the side of the crib, an
infant's head could get caught in between and the infant could
suffocate.  Roll up a couple of large bath towels and place them
in the space.  If the slats are more than 2-3/8 inches apart, the
baby's body can slide between the slats and the baby can
suffocate. </P>
<P>    If the child is old enough to stand up, the parents should
set the mattress at its lowest position, with the side rail at
its highest position.  Check the mattress support frequently to
make sure it hasn't become unhooked from the end panels.  Any
toys you leave in the crib should never be ones that could be
used to help in climbing out.  Also, do not use crib toys that
may have strings or elastic attached to them -- these can
strangle or choke! Cribs with decorative knobs on the cornerposts
can be a strangulation hazard.  Children's clothing and strings
or necklaces can catch on the protrusions, especially if the
child is trying to climb out. Crib gyms should be removed from
the crib when the baby is five months old or can push up on hands
and knees, otherwise the baby can get his/her chin across the
crib gym or catch clothing on it and strangle.   </P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) warns that
iron medications (sometimes identified as ferrous sulfate,
ferrous gluconate, or ferrous fumarate) can be deadly to a young
child. Many adults may not realize the hazard of iron
preparations. The Commission recommends that parents keep
medicine with iron out of the reach of young children.</P>

<P>Iron is available in combination with vitamins or alone.
According to poison control center data, iron supplements are
responsible for 30 percent of pediatric poisoning deaths from
medications. A small number of iron pills consumed by a child can
cause death. Poisonings happen when children swallow their
parents' iron pills. CPSC recommends that obstetricians and
gynecologists tell their maternity patients that prenatal
medicine with iron is poisonous to children.</P>

<P>CPSC requires that iron-containing medicines and vitamins with
iron be packaged in child-resistant closures. Parents should
always properly re-secure safety closures. In addition, parents
should keep medicines with iron out of the reach of children and
should properly discard iron pills after use so children cannot
reach them. Medicines should be discarded by flushing down the
toilet, not in a wastebasket where children can find them.</P>

<P>Always use child-resistant closures and keep iron-containing
medicine out of the reach of children.</P>

<H3>What Does It Mean To Place Gifted Students In Cluster Groups?  </H3>




<P>A group of five to eight identified gifted students, usually those in the
top 5% of ability in the grade level population, are clustered in the
classroom of one teacher who has training in how to teach exceptionally
capable students.  The other students in that class are of mixed ability.
If there are more than eight to ten gifted students, two or more clusters
should be formed. </P>

<HR>

<a name="tracking"></a>
<H3>Isn't Cluster Grouping The Same As Tracking? </H3>


<P>No.  In a tracking system, all students are grouped by ability for much of
the school day, and students tend to remain in the same track throughout
their school experience. Gifted students benefit from learning together,
and need to be placed with similar students in their areas of strength
(Hoover, Sayler, &amp; Feldhusen, 1993; Kulik &amp; Kulik, 1990; Rogers, 1993).
Cluster grouping of gifted students allows them to learn together, while
avoiding permanent grouping arrangements for students of other ability
levels. </P>

Assigned Evenly To All Classes?   </H3>



<P>When teachers try to meet the diverse learning needs of all students, it
becomes extremely difficult to provide adequately for everyone.  Often,
the highest ability students are expected to "make it on their own."  When
a teacher has several gifted students, taking the time to make appropriate
provisions for them seems more realistic.  Furthermore, gifted students
can better understand and accept their learning differences if there are
others just like them in the class. Finally, scheduling out-of-class
activities is easier when the resource teacher has only one cluster
teacher's schedule to work with. </P>

<a name="Learning"></a>
<H3>What Are The Learning Needs Of Gifted Students? </H3>



<P>Since these students have previously mastered many of the concepts they
are expected to "learn" in a given class, a huge part of their school time
may be wasted.  They need exactly what all other students need: consistent
opportunity to learn new material and to develop the behaviors that allow
them to cope with the challenge and struggle of new learning. It is very
difficult for such students to have those needs met in heterogeneous
classes. </P>

<a name="Elitist"></a>
<H3>Isn't Gifted Education Elitist?   </H3>


<P>Gifted students need consistent opportunities to learn at their challenge
level --just as all students do. It is inequitable to prevent gifted
students from being challenged by trying to apply one level of difficulty
for all students in mixed-ability classes.  When teachers can provide
opportunities for all students, including those who are gifted, to be
challenged by rigorous curriculum, there is nothing elitist about the
situation. </P>

<a name="Cooperative"></a>
<H3>Don't We Need Gifted Students In All Classes So They Can Help Others Learn
Through Cooperative Learning, Peer Tutoring, And Other Collaborative
Models?    </H3>




<P>When gifted students are placed in mixed-ability groups for cooperative
learning, they frequently become tutors.  Other students in these groups
may rely on the gifted to do most of the work and may actually learn less
than when the gifted students are not in their groups.  When gifted
students work in their own cooperative learning groups from time to time
on appropriately challenging tasks, they are more likely to develop
positive attitudes about cooperative learning.  At the same time, other
students learn to become more active learners because they are not able to
rely so heavily on the gifted students.  When the learning task focuses on
content some students already know, those students should be learning how
to cooperate in their own groups on extension tasks that are difficult
enough to require cooperation.  When the cooperative task is open-ended
and requires critical or divergent thinking, it is acceptable to include
the gifted students in heterogeneous cooperative learning groups. </P>

<HR>

<a name="Role"></a>
<H3>If Gifted Students Are Not Placed In Some Classes, Won't Those Classes
Lack Positive Role Models For Academic And Social Leadership?
</H3>



<P>Research on role modeling (Schunk, 1987) indicates that to be effective,
role models cannot be drastically discrepant in ability from those who
would be motivated by them.  Teachers overwhelmingly report that new
leadership "rises to the top" in the non-cluster classes. There are many
students, other than identified gifted students, who welcome opportunities
to become the new leaders in groups that no longer include the top 5% of a
grade level group.  This issue becomes a problem only when more than 5 to
10% of students are clustered. As classes are formed, be sure the classes
without clusters of gifted students include several highly capable
students. </P>

<a name="Inclusion"></a>
<H3>How Does The Cluster Grouping Concept Fit In With The Inclusion Models
That Integrate Students With Exceptional Educational Needs Into Regular
Classes? </H3>


<P>The Inclusion model, in which students with exceptional learning needs are
integrated into regular classrooms, is compatible with the concept of
cluster grouping of gifted students, since both groups have exceptional
educational needs.  The practice of cluster grouping allows educators to
come much closer to providing better educational services for groups of
students with similar exceptional learning needs.  In non-cluster
classrooms, teachers report they are able to pay more attention to the
special learning needs of those for whom learning may be more difficult.
Some schools choose to avoid placing students with significant learning
difficulties in the same class that has the cluster group of gifted
students.  A particular class may have a cluster of gifted students and a
cluster of special education students as long as more than one adult is
sharing the teaching responsibilities. </P>

<a name="Presence"></a>
<H3>Won't The Presence Of The Clustered Gifted Students Inhibit The
Performance Of The Other Students In That Class, Having A Negative Effect
On Their Achievement?  </H3>


When the cluster group is kept to a manageable size, many cluster teachers
report that there is general improvement in achievement for the entire
class.  This suggests the exciting possibility that when teachers learn
how to provide what gifted students need, they also learn to offer
modified versions of the same opportunities to the entire class, thus
raising the level of learning for all students, including those who are
gifted. The positive effects of the cluster grouping practice may be
shared with all students over several years by rotating the cluster
teacher assignment among teachers who have had gifted education training
and by rotating the other students so all students eventually have a
chance to be in the same class with a cluster group.
<HR>

<a name="Identified"></a>
<H3>How Should Students Be Identified For The Cluster Group?   </H3>


<P>If there will be one cluster, its highly capable students should be those
who have demonstrated that they will need curriculum that exceeds grade
level parameters.  Traditional measures, such as standardized tests may
also be used, but not as the sole criteria.  If there will be more than
one cluster, those highly capable in specific subjects might be grouped
together in separate clusters.  Profoundly gifted students should always
be grouped together, since there will rarely be more than two such
students in any grade level.  Identification should be conducted each
spring with the help of someone with training in gifted education. </P>

<hr>


<a name="Specific"></a>
<H3>What Specific Skills Are Needed By Cluster Teachers?   </H3>


<P>Since gifted students are as far removed from the "norm" as are students
with significant learning difficulties, it is necessary for teachers to
have special training in how to teach children of exceptionally high
ability.  Cluster teachers should know how to: </P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> recognize and nurture behaviors usually demonstrated by gifted students.
	<LI> create conditions in which all students will be stretched to learn.
	<LI> allow students to demonstrate and get credit for previous mastery of
concepts.
	<LI> provide opportunities for faster pacing of new material.
	<LI> incorporate students' passionate interests into their independent
studies.
	<LI> facilitate sophisticated research investigations.
 	<LI> provide flexible grouping opportunities for the entire class.

<P>The following information was excerpted from a speech entitled, "Using
Accurate Information,"  presented on January 29, 1983 at a workshop for
parent contacts, "Healing Grief: Helping the Survivors of Sudden Infant Death." 
The information was updated by Dr. Beckwith in January 1996.</P>

<P>Dr. Beckwith is a pediatric pathologist and was a principal member of the SIDS
Research Team at Children's Hospital and the University of Washington, Seattle,
from 1964 to 1984. He has authored or co-authored numerous research publications
on SIDS. He is currently Head of the Division of Pediatric Pathology at Loma Linda
University, Loma Linda, CA.</P>

<hr>
<a name="cause"></a>
<H3>I. What Is The Cause Of SIDS?</H3>


<P>It is common for the daily media to gleefully report that "the cause" for SIDS has been
discovered. Over the years I have worked with SIDS, literally hundreds of such reports
have appeared, and to date not one of them has passed the test of time. One of the
most common causes for misunderstanding is the failure to distinguish risk factors
from causes. For example, maternal smoking, viral infections, tummy sleeping, or
prematurity have all been touted as "causes" for SIDS. Yet, most infants exposed to
these risk factors will live, and many SIDS victims will have none of these risk
factors.</P>

<P>I think of SIDS, not as a disease, but as a manner of dying. It is the result of an
episode that likely occurs very rapidly, perhaps over just seconds or minutes, that
results in death of the infant. This episode seems to be something to which the
developing human is at risk over a relatively short period of time, perhaps related to
critical maturational stages that the infant passes through after the neonatal period,
but during the early months of postnatal life.</P>

<P>I have long believed that the answer to SIDS will come, not by looking at
predisposing factors, but by working backwards from the moment of death. What
exactly is the mechanism of death? Is it due to airway obstruction, cessation of the
drive to breathe, stoppage of the heart, or some catastrophic event in the developing
brain? By answering the question about exact mechanism of death, we can work
backwards more efficiently to causes for that type of event, and from those to
predisposing factors.</P>

<P>I spent many years presenting evidence that suggests the mechanism of death may be
a sudden internal obstruction of the upper airway, probably at the very end of a
breath. The sleeping baby lets out air, and something closes down inside the throat
that prevents the intake of the next breath. The infant cannot cry out, but may
change position as a result of this event. The baby may get into situations
suggesting external suffocation during this episode - the face becomes straight down
into the bedding, or wedged into a corner of the crib, or blankets are pulled up over
the face. This findings may lead to a false suggestion that the cause of death is
external suffocation. But they are not the cause of death, they are the result of the
dying episode.</P>

<P>If the autopsy suggests airway obstruction, how can we so confidently rule out
external suffocation as the cause for SIDS? One of the most compelling arguments is
that the autopsy findings are identical in babies dying of SIDS with the face entirely
uncovered to those where the face is covered.</P>

<P>The main evidence for airway obstruction is the presence of tiny hemorrhages, called
<I>petechiae</I>, which are present over the surfaces of the organs inside the chest cavity,
but not elsewhere, in the great majority of SIDS victims. Such petechiae are present
in nearly 90 percent of SIDS victims. They are far less common in infants or children 
dying of external suffocation. Our research indicates a potential reason for the
hemorrhages seem to be the result of suction pressures inside the chest that can only</P>
achieve the required force when obstruction occurs at the instant of full expiration
(letting out of a breath). At this moment, the respiratory muscles are in a position
to generate strong efforts to breathe in, which can generate high suction pressures
in the chest cavity. Strangulation, or external suffocation, will occur at random
points in the respiratory cycle, only occasionally happening at the instant when
we suspect the obstruction of SIDS may occur.</P>

<P>In conclusion, I do not know the cause of SIDS, though I believe the mechanism may
be a sudden internal obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. There may never be
a single "cause" that can be identified.</P>

<hr>

<a name="Healthy"></a>
<H3>II. Why Can A Healthy Baby Die So Suddenly</H3>

<P>Why would the airway become obstructed during sleep in a healthy and thriving
baby? Nobody knows for sure. If one accepts that we understand how they die, the
next question is why do they die? A concept that I have found appealing for many
years is that this stoppage, or obstruction, of the airway is not due to a disease
process or abnormality of the baby, but is a reflection of the fact that babies at this
time of life are undergoing an incredibly rapid state of growth and maturation.</P>

<P>Many important changes are occurring at the age when most SIDS occur. The infant
is, among other things, coming into an age where he is beginning to sleep through
the night. That's not just a simple change in habit pattern, but a change that is very
fundamental and has to do with control mechanisms in the brain. Centers that are
beginning to be active in the baby's brain didn't even exist when that infant was
born. Virtually all of brain growth occurs in the first two years of life and the growth
rate in the first six months is the most rapid of any time in life. During the time
when these important control centers are in a period of transition, abnormal
messages might come down to the organs of respiration, one of which is to "close
off" rather than "open up." Normally, at the end of a breath, the throat collapses or
closes, then opens up prior to a new breath being taken. But, if the wrong message
comes down from the brain, the throat may stay closed instead of opening. That
wrong message isn't necessarily a result of this baby being abnormal, but occurs in a
normal baby whose brain is growing at a tremendously rapid pace.</P>

<P>This view of SIDS is certainly one person's view, it's not shared by everybody who
works in SIDS. It's a view which I find very reasonable and helpful; the concept is
that the baby was normal when it dies, not abnormal. There is no way for anyone to
predict that a normal baby is going to have this kind of abnormal event. Many
factors may contribute to that event. Minor irritation of the airway may, by
increasing the sensory input coming up the nerves from the throat to the brain,
increase the likelihood of abnormal messages to come down. Thus, perhaps we have
a connection with the minor respiratory infections which are present in many cases.</P>

<h3>Concerns You May Have
And The Facts About
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome</h3>

<P>	As an expectant or new parent, friends or relatives may have mentioned
something to you about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (or SIDS) or you might
have read or heard something in the media. In either case, your concerns can
probably be summed up by saying that you are frightened and full of questions
about this strange syndrome. In many cases, what is passed on regarding SIDS
can be loaded with misinformation.</P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Facts"></a>
<H3>May We Share With You These Facts?</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Since the cause or mechanism of death in SIDS is not yet known, there
 is no specific means of predicting it.

	<LI>Nearly 6,000 babies die as a result of SIDS every year in the USA.

	<LI>Peak incidence of SIDS is 2 to 4 months of age, but it can occur
	 between one week and one year of life.

	<LI>A minor illness, such as a common cold, may be present but most
	 victims appear to be healthy prior to death.

	<LI>There appears to be no suffering, death occurs very rapidly, usually during
	 sleep.

	<LI>Research to date shows that the cause of SIDS is not suffocation,
	 aspiration or regurgitation.

	<LI>SIDS is NOT contagious.

	<LI>SIDS is not hereditary.

	<LI>SIDS occurs in families at all social and economic levels.

	<LI>SIDS is not caused by immunizations
	
</UL>

<P>One day researchers will find the causes and possible means of preventing SIDS,
but until then we, at the SIDS Foundation of Washington offer emotional and
informational support to bereaved families. Your donation can help us continue
our programs and can be a wonderful way to honor the birth of your baby.</P>

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<hr>
<a name="Reduce"></a>

<H3>What We Can Do To Reduce The Risk </H3>

<P>Parents need to remember reducing the risk will not guarantee the prevention of
SIDS; but, there are some things parents can do to provide their babies with the
best start in life.</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that "apparently
 healthy" infants sleep on their back or side. Consult with your
	 baby's doctor first to insure that this position is appropriate for your
	 baby.

	<LI>Avoid smoking, alcohol and drugs during pregnancy.

	<LI>Do not allow the baby to get too hot or too cold.

	<LI>Provide a smoke free environment after birth.

	<LI>Breastfeed or provide breast milk, if possible.

	<LI>Baby's bed should be a firm mattress or other firm surface. Do not
	 use fluffy blankets or comforters under your baby.

	<LI>Avoid becoming pregnant during the teen years.

	<LI>Try to space 18-24 months between the birth of your children.

	<LI>Obtain prenatal care and proper nutrition.

	<LI>Obtain postnatal care, including immunizations.

	<LI>Avoid crowds or individuals with colds.

	<LI>Wash hands before handling the baby.
	 
</UL>

<P>Checking your baby dozens of times as it sleeps will only serve to tire you more
and feed your inclination to worry. Concentrate, instead on the fact that the
weeks and months of your baby's first year of life are an exciting and wonderful
time. Try to forget the "what if questions that can plague all of us at one time or
another.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Radio Flyer Inc. of Chicago, Ill., is voluntarily
recalling 14,000 children's toy Little Wood Wagons. The wagons contain a
prohibited level of lead in the red painted sides that can cause lead
poisoning in young children, who may ingest the paint.
    </P> 
<P>The body of the Little Wood Wagon (model 6), which comes with a pull
handle, measures 12.5 inches by 7.5 inches by 4 inches with wheels
measuring 3 inches by 1 inch. Retailers, including Mills Fleet Farm, The
Right Start Catalog and Stores, and True Value Hardware, sold the wagons
nationwide from June 1996 through September 1996 for between $20 and $25
each. This recall does not involve any other wagon sold by Radio Flyer.</P>

<P>Consumers should immediately take the wagons away from children and look
for a manufacturing date decal on the bottom of the wagon. If there is no
decal, consumers should return the wagon to the store where purchased for
an exchange or refund. Consumers may also call Radio Flyer at (800)
621-7613, 24 hours a day, to receive free-of-charge a replacement wagon
without leaded paint. Wagons having a date-of-manufacture decal are not
subject to this recall.  </P>

<P>Radio Flyer Inc. and CPSC are not aware of any injuries involving the
wagons. This recall is being conducted to prevent the possibility of
injury.</P>

<P>The U.S. Customs Service cooperated with CPSC in this investigation.</P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from
unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or
a product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand
service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at
(800) 638-8270. To order a press release through fax-on-demand, call (301)
504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at CPSC's
web site at http://www.cpsc.gov or via Internet gopher services at
cpsc.gov. Consumers can report product hazards to info@cpsc.gov.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), Direct Source International Inc. of Blue Ash, Ohio, is
voluntarily recalling 11,700 packages of small plastic halloween candy
buckets. Dillon Stores of Hutchinson, Kan., and CPSC found prohibited
levels of lead in the black, red, and yellow paint, which peels readily
from the buckets. The lead paint can cause lead poisoning in young
children, who may ingest the paint from the banned buckets.</P>

<P>The buckets come in three styles: as orange pumpkins, white skulls, and
green Frankenstein heads, measuring 2.75 inches in diameter by 2.25 inches
high. They are packed six to a cellophane package with an orange cardboard
header labeled on the front, "HAPPY HALLOWEEN... 6 Halloween Buckets," and
on the back, bar code number "43748 88014...Direct Source International
Inc...Made in China." Some of the packages also include "Item NO. FF-014"
on the back of the label.</P>

<P>Various retail stores, including Dillon Stores and Kroger Company, sold
the buckets from August 1996 to October 1996 for about $1 per package.</P>

<P>CPSC received one report of a child who may have ingested some of the
paint from the buckets.</P>

<P>Consumers should take the buckets away from children immediately and
return them to the store where purchased for a full refund of the purchase
price. Consumers who have questions about this recall may call Direct
Source International Inc. at (513) 793-9379.</P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from
unreasonable risks of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer
products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or
a product-related injury and for information on CPSC's fax-on-demand
service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at

504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release
number. Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at

"Dogs and cats are creatures of habit and areliable to become frightened or agitated by the unaccustomed sights and soundsof trick-or-treaters.  And avoid the temptation to dress up your dog and sendhim trick-or-treating with the kids."</P>     <p>  Instead, Armstrong suggests secluding your pets in a quiet room away fromthe Halloween activities.  This will ensure that your pets won't panic andescape when bell-ringing trick-or-treaters arrive, nor will they becomethreatened or aggressive at the sight of costumed, little people.</P>    <p>   Halloween poses some other real dangers for pets, says Armstrong.  Sadly,during Halloween, pets are often the victims of pranksters' cruel tricks.  Notquite so sinister, but, dangerous nonetheless, is candy, especially chocolate,which can be harmful, even fatal to pets.  Secure all candy safely away frompets.</P>   <p>    Restrict your pet's access to jack o'lanterns and candles, for their sakeand yours.  Decorations with live flames are obvious hazards, but cats canalso get tangled in streamers.  And dogs -- who have a proclivity to chew justabout anything -- can become ill from eating holiday decorations.</P>    <p>   Finally, some humane organizations fear that certain pets, primarily blackcats, are at risk of becoming unwilling participants in the darker side ofHalloween activities, and elect to halt adoptions of these animals until afterthe holiday.  For safety reasons, Armstrong urges owners of all pets,particularly owners of black cats, to keep an especially close eye on theirpets around Halloween.</P>  <p>     "Halloween can be fun for all members of your family -- both two- andfour-legged members -- if you take some simple precautions which includekeeping your pets safely inside," adds Armstrong.  "Happy Halloween."</P><P>    CONTACT:  Joan Witt of the Humane Society of the United States, 301-258-3072</P></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

His call for a nationalliteracy program echoed a concern that has engaged educators, policymakers,and school board members across the country -- are enough of our childrenlearning to read?</P><P>    It is fitting that the poll is being released in California, a state whichhas seen its national reading scores fall over the last few years.  Though thereasons are hotly debated among educators and reading specialists, parents inCalifornia are demanding changes in reading instruction, textbook adoptionsand reading standards for all children.  With this poll, NASBE and Scholastichave given parents -- and other concerned adults -- the opportunity to maketheir opinions known about the importance of reading to our nation's economicand social health.</P><P>    Brenda Welburn, Executive Director of NASBE, stated her reason forcommissioning this poll with Scholastic: "We feel that we must listen toparents in order to shape the states' standards-based reform efforts.  Parentsprovide a valuable indicator of what is going right and what needs to beamended.  With their input, we can work to give all children the tools theyneed to read and succeed."</P><P>    "This study shows the high interest parents have in reading and theimportance they place on their own role in helping their children perform,"said Margery Mayer, Executive Vice President for Instructional Materials atScholastic.  "We at Scholastic feel that our own role is to support parents intheir efforts to shape their children's academic success."</P><H3> Parents Don't Believe They are Making the Grade</H3><P>The poll results reinforce the importance of good reading programs andinteresting instructional materials, as well as the need for schools toemphasize basic academic skills.  The poll also provides insight into somesurprising attitudes parents hold about their children's reading levels andtheir own responsibility to ensure that reading success begins in the home.</P><P>    Almost a third of those with school-age children surveyed would gradetheir child's reading program no better than a "C."  But while parents believethat schools could do better, they also believe they should be doing muchmore.  In an indication that parents understand their own responsibility toteach children to read, 82% stated that children may not be learning to readas well as they should because parents are not encouraging their children toread at home.  And 75% of parents also believe that children are beingdistracted by too much television and too many video games.</P><P>    Carol Ruley, President of the California Parent-Teacher Association, saidthat the study "corresponds closely with the recommendation from the recentreport of the California Reading Task Force which said: 'Teachers in earlychildhood programs need to develop strong links with families to help themreinforce early reading skills'."</P><P>    The polling data indicates that the nationwide call for greater parentalinvolvement is being heeded.  Fully 77% of all respondents believe thatparents should be very involved in deciding how their children should betaught to read at school.  Furthermore, parents ranked parental involvement asone of the most important things they would change about schools in order toimprove reading.</P><H3>Parents Call for Well-Rounded Reading Instruction that Focuses on Basic Academic Skills</H3><P>    A study released earlier this week by the U.S. Department of Education andthe National Assessment Governing Board reported that math and science scoresfor U.S. students have gradually improved over the last four years, whilestudents have made little progress in reading -- a fact which causes concernamong education leaders and policymakers.  Paradoxically, a sizable number ofparents with children -- 49% -- believe that their child is reading aboveaverage, while only 10% believe that their child is reading below average.</P><P>    According to the NASBE/Scholastic survey, parents firmly believe thatwell-grounded reading programs should emphasize a combination of phonics andliterature-based instruction.  An overwhelming 86% of those surveyed believethat the foundation of reading should be based on learning phonics as well asreading children's books and stories.  Altogether, 52% believe that a majorreason that children may not be reading as well as they should is thatteachers are not placing enough emphasis on phonics and skills.</P><P>    Parents also understand how important the ability to read well is to ourchildren's futures.  93% believe that reading is critically important to thefuture success of a child.  Parents, however, split on what is the mostimportant benefit of being able to read well, with 49% saying that "being aninformed citizen" is the most important benefit, while 44% believe that"getting a good job" is the greater benefit.  Only 6% of those surveyed cited"reading for pleasure" as the most important advantage.</P><P>    NASBE and Scholastic commissioned the survey for release at the NASBEannual conference.  Harris polled over 1,000 adults, almost half of whom hadschool-age children in their household.</P><P>    The National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE) representsstates and territorial boards of education in development and implementationof national, state and local education policy.  NASBE represents aninformation and leadership resource for its 600 members across the country.</P><P>    For three quarters of a century, Scholastic Inc. has introduced youngpeople to the joys of reading and has enlarged their understanding of, andparticipation in, our world.  Today the company continues that mission throughits books, classroom magazines and instructional materials -- and now throughtelevision and computers -- and continues to embrace new ways of learning inits ongoing effort to meet the diverse needs of students in the United Statesand around the world.  Recently Scholastic launched an innovative readingprogram called "Literacy Place" that seeks to fulfill Scholastic's goal ofhaving every child become a fluent reader by the end of the third grade andcontinue to make steady progress thereafter.</P><P>     For more information on NASBE, please access NASBE's web site at<A HREF="http://www.NASBE.org">www.NASBE.org</A>.

"The Role of Online Communications in Schools:A National Study," conducted by the Center for Applied Special Technology(CAST), a nationally recognized, independent research organization -- clearlydemonstrates that students with online access perform better on keycomprehension, communication and presentation skills.</P><P>    The study, sponsored by the Council of the Great City Schools andScholastic Network, the largest online subscription service for teachers andstudents in elementary and middle schools, is the first controlled study toisolate the impact of online use and measure its effect on student learning inthe classroom.  The study shows that students with access to ScholasticNetwork and the Internet excelled in finding, comprehending and evaluatinginformation, and presenting information and ideas effectively.  In the study,students with online access achieved significantly higher scores on measuresof information management, communication and presentation skills than thosewho had no online access.  The study compared the work of 500 students infourth- and sixth-grade classes in seven urban school districts (Chicago,Dayton, Detroit, Memphis, Miami, Oakland, and Washington D.C.) -- half withonline access to Scholastic Network and the Internet and half without.</P><P>    "In addition to basic skills such as reading, writing and mathematics, itis critical that today's students also acquire the thinking, informationmanagement and problem-solving skills necessary for success in the realworld," said Ruth Otte, executive vice president of Scholastic New Media, adivision of Scholastic Inc.  This study offers evidence that using ScholasticNetwork and the Internet helps students become independent, critical thinkers,able to find information, evaluate it and then effectively express their newknowledge and ideas in compelling ways."</P><P>    The study results were announced at a briefing today at Murch ElementarySchool in Washington, D.C., where Reed Hundt, Chairman of the FederalCommunications Commission, spoke to the importance of online access for allstudents.</P><P>    FCC Chairman Hundt said, "The dawning of the information age represents anopportunity for equality that we have not enjoyed since Horace Mann firstchampioned the idea of the free public school.  In the true 21st-centuryclassroom without walls, all children can travel as far as their thirst forknowledge will take them."</P><P>    "This study dramatically illustrates the positive effects of online use onlearning.  Now we must ensure that all students benefit equally from thispowerful educational medium," said Michael Casserly, executive director of theCouncil of the Great City Schools.  "Our urban schools need up-to-datehardware, online access and the teacher training necessary to implement onlinecommunications successfully."</P>   <H3> Goals of the Study</H3><P>    The study conducted by CAST is a landmark piece of research because itsystematically investigates the effects of online use, as distinct fromtechnology and curriculum reforms, on student learning.  The goals of thestudy were: (1) to measure the impact of online use on student ability toperform real-world skills such as researching, analyzing and synthesizinginformation, and developing a point of view and effectively presenting it;(2) to gain insights into what it takes to effectively use onlinecommunications in school.</P>    <H3>Research Design</H3><P>    The study included 500 students in 14 schools, comparing results in14 experimental classes with online access and 14 control classes withoutaccess.  Civil rights, a common interdisciplinary topic for schools, wasselected as the instructional focus for the study.  After working in smallgroups for two months, fourth- and sixth-grade students submitted projectscreated from their research and collaboration on civil rights issues.Students engaged in three major learning phases: communications (discussingcivil rights issues with students, teachers, family members, neighbors, peoplein the community), research (using a variety of media to explore andsynthesize information from multiple sources) and creation of the finalportfolio projects.  A student research project was chosen as a final productfor the study because it is typically part of the curriculum in both fourthand sixth grades, and it provides the material for performance assessment.</P><P>    The unit was designed to be implemented by teachers in both experimentaland control groups in their existing classrooms.  Teachers in the controlgroups employed traditional methods (including multimedia resources andcomputer software) while teachers in the experimental group added onlineresources and activities.  In both groups, the emphasis was on integratedlearning and helping students to see connections among people, their actionsand the real world.</P>    <H3>How Student Work Was Evaluated</H3><ul>    <li>  Effectiveness of synthesizing different points of view    <li>  Presentation of a full picture (e.g., who, what, when, where, why, and how)    <li>  Effectiveness of presenting of ideas and information (e.g.,       interesting, informative, creative)    <li>  Effectiveness of stating an issue    <li>  Completeness of assignment    <li>  Demonstration of insight into the topic    <li>  Accuracy of information    <li>  Taking initiative to demonstrate "best work" (e.g., well planned, neat,       showing initiative)    <li>  Organization of ideas and information</ul><P>    Independent evaluators, experienced school teachers trained in assessmentmethods, scored the projects.  The evaluators had no prior knowledge of eitherthe study or any of the participating schools, and had no investment in theresults other than a fair scoring of the projects.</P>    <H3>The Results</H3><P>    Overall, students with online access to Scholastic Network and theInternet produced "better" projects than students without access.  Theirprojects scored higher in all nine learning criteria, and those higher scoreswere statistically significant for five of the nine learning measures.  Inparticular, students with online access demonstrated greater ability toeffectively bring together different points of view, present a full picture(who, what, when, where, why, how), effectively present their work,effectively state a civil rights issue and produce a complete project.</P><P>    The phone interviews with teachers also provide rich evidence of greaterlearning for students with online access.  These teachers reported that duringthe study their students found information more quickly, drew resources from alarger number sources in a wider variety of formats and dealt with informationin ways that made the material more relevant to their lives.  Teachers feltthat e-mail and message boards helped their students learn from otherstudents, teachers and the community-at-large.</P> <H3>Online Use Improved Student Learning</H3><table border =2> <tr>      <th> Student Project Learning    Criteria  </th>                          <th>  Classes with Online Access </th>                                                                 <th>   Classes w/o Online Access</th>           </tr>                             <tr><td>    Effectiveness of synthesizing     different points of view    </td>         <td>          0.57      </td>     <td>    0.29 </td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Presentation of a full picture     (who, what, when, where, why, how)    </td>       <td>       1.31      </td>     <td>    0.87</td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Effectiveness of presenting ideas     and information     </td>                     <td>           1.42    </td>       <td>    1.11</td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Effectiveness of stating an issue     </td>    <td>          1.26    </td>     <td>     1.00 </td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Completeness of assignment     </td>     <td>                 1.41      </td>   <td>     1.18 </td>    </tr>         <tr>  <td>  Demonstration of insight into the topic   </td>       <td>    0.82        </td>   <td>   0.74 </td>    </tr>         <tr><td>    Accuracy of information       </td>              <td>         1.70   </td>     <td>      1.61 </td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Taking initiative to demonstrate "best work"   </td> <td>     1.95      </td>    <td>    1.87 </td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Organization of ideas and information    </td>       <td>     1.27       </td>     <td>  1.26 </td>    </tr>         <tr> <td>   Aggregate of scores                 </td>        <td>       11.73      </td>    <td>    9.92 </td>    </tr>          </table><br><br><table border =2><tr><th>    Student Project Learning   Criteria <br>    (scale 0 to 3) </th><th>Percentage Difference</th> </tr><tr><td>    Effectiveness of synthesizing     different points of view       </td>                 <td>       97%* </td>      </tr>  <tr> <td>    Presentation of a full picture     (who, what, when, where, why, how)      </td>                <td>      51%* </td>      </tr><tr><td>      Effectiveness of presenting ideas     and information            </td>                             <td>      28%* </td>      </tr><tr><td>      Effectiveness of stating an issue   </td>                  <td>         26%* </td>      </tr> <tr><td>     Completeness of assignment       </td>                   <td>           19%* </td>      </tr> <tr> <td>    Demonstration of insight into the topic    </td>            <td>        11% </td>      </tr><tr> <td>     Accuracy of information          </td>                     <td>          6% </td>      </tr> <tr> <td>    Taking initiative to demonstrate "best work"   </td>        <td>         4% </td>      </tr> <tr> <td>    Organization of ideas and information   </td>            <td>            1% </td>      </tr><tr> <td>     Aggregate of scores          </td>                        <td>         18%* </td>      </tr></table><P>    * Difference is statistically significant</P><P>    "This study goes beyond the simple popularity factor of the Internet,"said Sari Follansbee, director of curriculum at CAST.

In addition to support at the school toinsure that new technologies such as online access are actually working,teachers need training to help them use this technology.

The Governor's kick-off will take placeMonday, October 21st at 1 pm at the Governor's Mansion.</P><P>    The week is sponsored by the North Carolina Coalition for Pulling the Plugon Media Violence.  The Coalition is a grassroots non-profit organization madeup of more than 35 child advocacy groups throughout the state.  Its goal is toraise awareness about the negative impact of violence on TV and in videogames.</P><P>    The Coalition does not advocate or oppose specific programs.  Instead,during the "Pull the Plug Week," the Coalition offers common-sense suggestionsreviewing family use of television and video games.  Flyers and bookmarks withthose suggestions will be distributed to more than 800,000 K-5 public schoolstudents and their parents throughout the state.</P>           <H3>Suggestions From The American Academy Of Pediatrics:</H3><ol>   <li> <B>Set Limits</B>:  Be aware of how much television your children are        watching.  Then limit viewing to 1-2 hours each day.  Take time        together to talk about how violence and guns are glamorized on TV and        in video games. <br><Br>   <li> <B> Plan</B>:  After limiting TV use, families can work together to choose        appropriate programs.  Pediatricians recommend using a TV guide or        newspaper to help with selections.  The set should be turned on only        for quality programs and turned off then they're over.<br><Br>   <li> <B> Participate</B>:  Parents are the most important role models for their        children.  In our society, television is the second most important        source of information.  Watch shows together and review what video        games the kids are playing.  Let them know your feelings about        violence on TV and seek their help in making a change in your family's        TV and video game use.<br><Br>   <li> <B>Get Help</B>:  Many groups help raise awareness about the impact of        violent programming on TV.  Contact local PTA to find out about        National PTA programs and pamphlets addressing television viewing.</ol>                  <H3> The Effects of Violent Television Viewing</H3> <ul><li> 22-34% of young male felons imprisoned for committing violent crimes       (homicide, rape, assault) report having consciously imitated crime       techniques watched on TV.       (Journal of American Medical Association - Studies in Violence and       Television)    <br><br><li> All Canadian and US studies of the effect of prolonged childhood       exposure to television show a positive relationship between earlier       exposure to TV violence and later physical aggressiveness.       (Public communication and behavior - Academic Press)    <br><br><li> The critical period of exposure to television is pre-adolescent       childhood.       (American Academy of Pediatrics)    <br><br><li> Investigators at four Universities randomly sampled 2,500 hours of       fictional entertainment from 2,693 cable network programs over 20 weeks       in 1994-1995.  57% of programs studied had harmful depiction of       violence.       (Mediascope study by Cable Industry)    <br><br><li> Studies conclude viewing certain programs of violence can increase       aggression in children, make them more fearful and less trusting, and       desensitize them to violent behavior by other people.       (National TV Violence Study)</ul><P>    Although Media violence is not the only cause of violence in our state, itis the single most easily remediable contributing factor.</P><P>    For further information on "Pull the Plug Week," contact the NorthCarolina Coalition for Pulling the Plug on Media Violence.

If parents, caregiversand policymakers are to understandstandards of quality, they must firstunderstand the development ofattachment, the effects of early separations,parent characteristicsand family circumstances that may contribute toinsecurity, and thepotential benefits of secure attachment to a caregiver.This digestdiscusses infant care quality and the debate on infantattachment.</P><HR> <a name="Infant"></a><H3>Infant Day Care Today</H3><P>In March 1970, 24% of mothers with children under 2 years oldwere inthe labor force. By March 1984, the figure was 46.8% (U.S. Dept.ofLabor, 1984). Who takes care of the babies while the mothers work?Someinfants (25%) are cared for in their own homes. Others (75%) arecared foroutside the home by a baby-sitter, or in family day care(group care by anindividual in her home). Only 6% of infants under ayear old and 12% ofthose under 2 are cared for in licensedcenter-based care (U.S. Dept. ofCommerce, June 1982). Although statelicensing standards apply tocenter-based and family day care, mostfamily day care programs remainunlicensed. The crisis in day care issuch that the choice of care is oftendetermined by cost andavailability, rather than quality.</P><HR> <aname="Quality"></a><H3>What Do We Know About Quality?</H3><P>Researchon university-based day care models and a growing number ofstudies oncommunity-based caregiving arrangements (baby-sitters,family day care) areidentifying indices of quality care. Phillips andHowes (Phillips, 1987)organize information on infant day care qualityinto three categories: (1)structural features (group size,staff-child ratios, caregiver training,equipment, space); (2) dynamicaspects (experiences and interactions); and(3) contextual  features (staff stability and turnover, type ofsetting).</P><P><B>STRUCTURAL FEATURES:</B> The National Day Care Study(Roupp, Travers,Glantz and Coelen, 1979) found that for children under 2,small groupsize, low staff-infant ratios, and strong caregiverqualifications,predicted positive outcomes. Caregivers with larger groupsspent moretime in management tasks and restricting behavior, and less timeinone-to-one interaction and cognitive-language stimulation.Highadult-infant ratios were associated with increased apathy anddistressin infants. Caregivers with little child-related formaleducationengaged in less frequent positive adult-infant interactions andwereless likely to have a developmentally appropriate program.</P><P>Theoptimum standards of the Accreditation Criteria of the NationalAcademy ofEarly Childhood Programs (Bredekamp, 1984) specifies amaximum group sizeof 8 and a staff-child ratio of 1:4 for infantsunder 12 months. Forinfants of 1 to 2 years, maximum group sizeshould be 12, and staff-childratio 1:4. The lead teacher in an infantcenter should have a baccalaureatedegree in early childhood educationor childdevelopment.</P><P><B>DYNAMIC FEATURES:</B> Quality and frequency ofadult-child interactionsare critical variables in infant care. Childrenunder two rely on andlearn from interactions with adults. Adults are thesecure base fromwhich infants explore the environment and develop socialcompetencewith peers. Adults who talk to infants encourage languagedevelopment.Adults who respond to infant signals and needs buildinfants'self-esteem and physical and cognitive abilities (Bredekamp,1986).</P><P><B>CONTEXTUAL FEATURES:</B> Studies contrasting types ofcaregiving arelimited in number and report mixed results. Most confirmthatstaff-child ratios, group size, and caregiver stability definequalityin infant care. In each type of care, there is great variabilityinenvironment and caregiver qualities. Thus child outcomes depend lessonform of care than on characteristics of the setting (Phillips,1987,Clarke-Stewart and Fein, 1984).</P><P>Caregiver stability is of concernbecause of the high turn-over rate:40% in centers and 60% in family daycare and out-of-home babysitting(U.S. Dept. of Labor, 1984). Low salariesand inadequate benefits makeit difficult to attract and maintain qualifiedcaregivers. Constantchanges of caregiver or caregiving arrangement inhibitbenefits ofcare (Ainslie and Anderson, 1984; Phillips and Howes,1987).</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><HR> <a name="Infant"></a><H3>Effects Of InfantCare</H3><P>Several studies show that day care may benefit low-incomechildren andhave benign, if not beneficial, effects on middle-classchildren. Highquality care can prevent the drop in IQ that often occursbetween 12and 30 months in home-reared, low-income children, and enhancetheirlanguage and problem-solving skills. Greater curiosity,betterconcentration, and improved on-task behavior have been associatedwithday care experience in all income groups. Day care children arealsoseen as being more socially competent and independent(Clarke-Stewartand Fein, 1984; Belsky and Steinberg,1987).</P><P>Research findings on socioemotional development are notunanimous.Several recent studies suggest that development outcomes arerelatedto the infant's experience in a particular caregivingenvironment(Phillips, 1987). Structural, dynamic, and contextual aspectsmaydetermine the infant's quality of life in care, and thus the effectsofcare. Another concern is age of entry. Some studies indicate thatday carechildren who appear more assertive, less responsive toadults, and moreavoidant in reunions with parents, frequently havebegun day care beforetheir first birthday.</P><HR> <a name="Attachment"></a><H3>InfantCare: The Issue Of Attachment </H3><P>Some researchers suggest that forinfants under 1, separation frommother for over 20 hours a week maydisrupt development of attachmentand thus put some children at-risk forsocial and emotional problems.Daily separations may represent the kind ofunavailability thatinfants experience as maternal rejection. Maternalrejection orunpredictability are associated with insecure attachment ininfants.Other researchers argue that these conclusions are premature,theeffects reported are weak, and the studies have seriousmethodologicalproblems. Critics challenge definitions of negative socialbehaviors(e.g., aggression, which may really be assertiveness) andindicatorsof insecurity (e.g., avoidance of mother, which may reallyindicateprecocious independence). These positions have been presented inthespecial infant day care issues of the EARLY CHILDHOOD.</P><HR> <aname="Research"></a><H3>Research Quarterly </H3><P>Studies comparinghome versus employed mothers do not tell us whatfactors affect parents'ability to offer infants the kind ofenvironment associated with secureattachment. For example, stressfrom balancing work and family isparticularly evident in single,adolescent, and low-income families(Ainslie, 1984). In one study,families under stress reported that theyspent less time researchingday care options, needed longer hours, and usedpoorer quality care(Phillips, 1987). A satisfactory support system may beimportant forparents and essential to parents experiencing stress. Mothersofinsecurely attached infants may have less harmonious marriagesandreceive less support from spouses and community. Mothers who prefertowork or to stay at home and do so may have more secure infantsthanthose whose work status is at odds with their preference.Workpreference is linked to mothers' anxiety about leavingchildren.Stress and parent anxiety may make separation and adjustment tocaredifficult. On the other hand, secure attachment to the caregivermayoffset damaging effects on the infant. Quality day care canreducestress by providing a support system for parents and allayingtheirconcerns about their infant (Ainslie, 1984).</P><HR> <aname="Information"></a><H3>For More Information </H3><P>Ainslie,Ricardo (Ed.).

<P>Imagine living in a fast-moving kaleidoscope, where sounds, images, and
thoughts are constantly shifting.  Feeling easily bored, yet helpless to
keep your mind on tasks you need to complete.  Distracted by unimportant
sights and sounds, your mind drives you from one thought or activity to
the next.  Perhaps you are so wrapped up in a collage of thoughts and
images that you don't notice when someone speaks to you.</P>

<P>For many people, this is what it's like to have Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD.  They may be unable to sit still, plan
ahead, finish tasks, or be fully aware of what's going on around them.
To their family, classmates or coworkers, they seem to exist in a
whirlwind of disorganized or frenzied activity.  Unexpectedly--on some
days and in some situations--they seem fine, often leading others to
think the person with ADHD can actually control these behaviors.  As a
result, the disorder can mar the person's relationships with others in
addition to disrupting their daily life, consuming energy, and
diminishing self-esteem.</P>

<P>ADHD, once called hyperkinesis or minimal brain dysfunction, is one of
the most common mental disorders among children.  It affects 3 to 5
percent of all children, perhaps as many as 2 million American children.
Two to three times more boys than girls are affected.  On the average,
at least one child in every classroom in the United States needs help
for the disorder.  ADHD often continues into adolescence and adulthood,
and can cause a lifetime of frustrated dreams and emotional pain.</P>

<P>But there is help...and hope.  In the last decade, scientists have
learned much about the course of the disorder and are now able to
identify and treat children, adolescents, and adults who have it.  A
variety of medications, behavior-changing therapies, and educational
options are already available to help people with ADHD focus their
attention, build self-esteem, and function in new ways.</P>

<P>In addition, new avenues of research promise to further improve
diagnosis and treatment.  With so many American children diagnosed as
having attention disorder, research on ADHD has become a national
priority.  During the 1990s--which the President and Congress have
declared the "Decade of the Brain"--it is possible that scientists will
pinpoint the biological basis of ADHD and learn how to prevent or treat
it even more effectively.</P>

<P>This booklet is provided by the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), the Federal agency that supports research nationwide on the
brain, mental illnesses, and mental health.  Scientists supported by
NIMH are dedicated to understanding the workings and interrelationships
of the various regions of the brain, and to developing preventive
measures and new treatments to overcome brain disorders that handicap
people in school, work, and play.</P>

<P>The booklet offers up-to-date information on attention deficit disorders
and the role of NIMH-sponsored research in discovering underlying causes
and effective treatments.  It describes treatment options, strategies
for coping, and sources of information and support.  You'll find out
what it's like to have ADHD from the stories of Mark, Lisa, and Henry.
You'll see their early frustrations, their steps toward getting help,
and their hopes for the future.</P>

<P>(The individuals referred to in this brochure are not real, but their
stories are representative of people who show symptoms of ADHD.)</P>

<H3>Understanding The Problem</H3>

<H4>Mark</H4>

<P>Mark, age 14, has more energy than most boys his age.  But then, he's
always been overly active.  Starting at age 3, he was a human tornado,
dashing around and disrupting everything in his path.  At home, he
darted from one activity to the next, leaving a trail of toys behind
him.  At meals, he upset dishes and chattered nonstop.  He was reckless
and impulsive, running into the street with oncoming cars, no matter how
many times his mother explained the danger or scolded him.  On the
playground, he seemed no wilder than the other kids.  But his tendency
to overreact--like socking playmates simply for bumping into him--had
already gotten him into trouble several times.  His parents didn't know
what to do.  Mark's doting grandparents reassured them, "Boys will be
boys.  Don't worry, he'll grow out of it."  But he didn't.</P>

<H4>Lisa</H4>

<P>At age 17, Lisa still struggles to pay attention and act appropriately.
But this has always been hard for her.  She still gets embarrassed
thinking about that night her parents took her to a restaurant to
celebrate her 10th birthday.  She had gotten so distracted by the
waitress' bright red hair that her father called her name three times
before she remembered to order.  Then before she could stop herself, she
blurted, "Your hair dye looks awful!"</P>

<P>In elementary and junior high school, Lisa was quiet and cooperative but
often seemed to be daydreaming.  She was smart, yet couldn't improve her
grades no matter how hard she tried.  Several times, she failed exams.
Even though she knew most of the answers, she couldn't keep her mind on
the test.  Her parents responded to her low grades by taking away
privileges and scolding, "You're just lazy.  You could get better grades
if you only tried." One day, after Lisa had failed yet another exam, the
teacher found her sobbing, "What's wrong with me?"</P>

<H4>Henry</H4>

<P>Although he loves puttering around in his shop, for years Henry has had
dozens of unfinished carpentry projects and ideas for new ones he knew
he would never complete.  His garage was piled so high with wood, he and
his wife joked about holding a fire sale.</P>

<P>Every day Henry faced the real frustration of not being able to
concentrate long enough to complete a task.  He was fired from his job
as stock clerk because he lost inventory and carelessly filled out
forms.  Over the years, afraid that he might be losing his mind, he had
seen psychotherapists and tried several medications, but none ever
helped him concentrate.  He saw the same lack of focus in his young son
and worried.</P>

<a name="Symptoms"></a> 
<H3>What Are the Symptoms of ADHD?</H3>

<P>The three people you've just met, Mark, Lisa, and Henry, all have a form
of ADHD--Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  ADHD is not like a
broken arm, or strep throat.  Unlike these two disorders, ADHD does not
have clear physical signs that can be seen in an x-ray or a lab test.
ADHD can only be identified by looking for certain characteristic
behaviors, and as with Mark, Lisa, and Henry, these behaviors vary from
person to person.  Scientists have not yet identified a single cause
behind all the different patterns of behavior--and they may never find
just one.  Rather, someday scientists may find that ADHD is actually an
umbrella term for several slightly different disorders.</P>

<P>At present, ADHD is a diagnosis applied to children and adults who
consistently display certain characteristic behaviors over a period of
time.  The most common behaviors fall into three categories:
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.</P>

<P>Inattention.  People who are inattentive have a hard time keeping their
mind on any one thing and may get bored with a task after only a few
minutes.  They may give effortless, automatic attention to activities
and things they enjoy.  But focusing deliberate, conscious attention to
organizing and completing a task or learning something new is difficult.</P>

<P>For example, Lisa found it agonizing to do homework.  Often, she forgot
to plan ahead by writing down the assignment or bringing home the right
books.  And when trying to work, every few minutes she found her mind
drifting to something else.  As a result, she rarely finished and her
work was full of errors.</P>

<P>Hyperactivity.  People who are hyperactive always seem to be in motion.
They can't sit still.  Like Mark, they may dash around or talk
incessantly.  Sitting still through a lesson can be an impossible task.
Hyperactive children squirm in their seat or roam around the room.  Or
they might wiggle their feet, touch everything, or noisily tap their
pencil.  Hyperactive teens and adults may feel intensely restless.  They
may be fidgety or, like Henry, they may try to do several things at
once, bouncing around from one activity to the next.</P>

<P>Impulsivity.  People who are overly impulsive seem unable to curb their
immediate reactions or think before they act.  As a result, like Lisa,
they may blurt out inappropriate comments.  Or like Mark, they may run
into the street without looking.  Their impulsivity may make it hard for
them to wait for things they want or to take their turn in games.  They
may grab a toy from another child or hit when they are upset.</P>

<P>Not everyone who is overly hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive has an
attention disorder.  Since most people sometimes blurt out things they
didn't mean to say, bounce from one task to another, or become
disorganized and forgetful, how can specialists tell if the problem is
ADHD?</P>

<P>To assess whether a person has ADHD, specialists consider several
critical questions:  Are these behaviors excessive, long-term, and
pervasive?  That is, do they occur more often than in other people the
same age?  Are they a continuous problem, not just a response to a
temporary situation?  Do the behaviors occur in several settings or only
in one specific place like the playground or the office?  The person's
pattern of behavior is compared against a set of criteria and
characteristics of the disorder.  These criteria appear in a diagnostic
reference book called the DSM (short for the "Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders").</P>

<P>According to the diagnostic manual, there are three patterns of behavior
that indicate ADHD.  People with ADHD may show several signs of being
consistently inattentive.  They may have a pattern of being hyperactive
and impulsive.  Or they may show all three types of behavior.</P>

<P>According to the DSM, signs of inattention include:</P>
<ul>
  <li>  becoming easily distracted by irrelevant sights and sounds
  <li>  failing to pay attention to details and making careless mistakes
  <li>  rarely following instructions carefully and completely
  <li>  losing or forgetting things like toys, or pencils, books, and
      tools needed for a task
</ul>

<P>Some signs of hyperactivity and impulsivity are:</P>

 <ul> <li>  feeling restless, often fidgeting with hands or feet, or squirming
  <li>  running, climbing, or leaving a seat, in situations where sitting
      or quiet behavior is expected
  <li>  blurting out answers before hearing the whole question
  <li>  having difficulty waiting in line or for a turn
</ul>
<P>Because everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, the DSM
contains very specific guidelines for determining when they indicate
ADHD.  The behaviors must appear early in life, before age 7, and
continue for at least 6 months.  In children, they must be more frequent
or severe than in others the same age.  Above all, the behaviors must
create a real handicap in at least two areas of a person's life, such as
school, home, work, or social settings.  So someone whose work or
friendships are not impaired by these behaviors would not be diagnosed
with ADHD.  Nor would a child who seems overly active at school but
functions well elsewhere.</P>

Ifall states continue toparticipate in the program mandated by P.L. 99-457,the followingcomponents and services must be provided by eachstate:</P><P>1987-1988: The Governor must designate a lead agency. Thereis statediscretion with respect to which agency is designated foroveralladministration of the program. The Governor must also establishaninteragency coordinating council composed of relevantagencies,consumers, and providers. This Council is to assist in thedevelopmentand implementation of state applications, as well asinteragencyagreements and the identification of resources, and tootherwiseadvise the state. In some states, the Council also serves as theleadagency.</P><P>1988-1990: The state must adopt a public policy whichincludes all ofthe components of a statewide system for providing earlyinterventionservices to eligible infants and toddlers.</P><P>1990-1991:The state must demonstrate that it has in effect astatewide system forproviding early intervention services.

Laymen may see it as &quot;dieting gone wild.&quot; Individuals with anorexianervosa have an intense fear of becoming obese, even as weight loss progresses.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Anorexia Nervosa is a &quot;weight loss&quot; method. Weight loss is achieved through a variety ofmethods including severe caloric restriction, fasting, relentless exercising, use of over-the-counterand prescription diet aids, diuretic and laxative use, and in some cases, self-induced vomiting. Mostindividuals suffering from anorexia nervosa strongly deny the disorder. They often &quot;feel fat&quot;even when emaciated. Anorexics experience a sense of control by restricting food intake and often turnaway from food in an attempt to cope with life's stresses.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Studies suggest 1 in 250 young women may be suffering from anorexia nervosa. Approximately 90 percentof the persons suffering from this eating disorders are women. Age of onset varies, though symptoms ofanorexia nervosa usually appears in early-to-middle adolescence.</P><H4>Eating Disorders Warning Signs</H4> <UL>	<LI>Abnormal weight loss of 25% of more with no know medical illness accounting for the loss.<BR><BR>	<LI>Reduction in food intake, denial of hunger and decrease in consumption of high carbohydrate andfat-containing foods.<BR>	<BR>	<LI>Prolonged exercising despite fatigue and weakness.<BR>	<BR>	<LI>Intense fear of gaining weight.<BR>	<BR>	<LI>Peculiar patterns of handling food.<BR>	<BR>	<LI>Amenorrhea in women.<BR>	<BR>	<LI>Some exhibit bulimic episodes of binge-eating followed by vomiting and/or laxative and diureticabuse.<BR>	</UL><a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr><a name="bulimia"></a><H3>Bulimia Nervosa </H3><BR><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Bulimia is an emotional disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by some form ofpurging or restriction. Binges are the secretive, rapid consumption of high-caloric foods over adiscrete period of time. Most bulimics follow the binge by self-induced vomiting. However,&quot;purging&quot; may take the form of laxative or diuretic abuse, fasting, or strenuous exercising.This binge-purge cycle is normally accompanied by self- deprecating thoughts, depressed mood, and anawareness that the eating behavior is abnormal and out of control.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Bulimia is a method of &quot;weight control&quot; rather than &quot;weight loss.&quot; Most individualssuffering from this disorder are frequent dieters but remain within a normal weight range. Food takeson a symbolic meaning for the bulimia, and the binge-purge cycle may be an outlet for feelings offrustration, disappointment, anger, loneliness, and boredom. Bulimics turn to food in an attempt tocope with life stresses. Bulimia may be accompanied by other impulsive behaviors such as shopliftingand/or alcohol and drug abuse.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Most individuals with this disorder are women, though bulimia has been diagnosed in men. Researchersestimate that as many as 20-30% of college-age women may display bulimic behaviors. Bulimia tends todevelop in late adolescence and early adulthood. Bulimics may have been previously anorexic or displaysymptoms of anorexia nervosa simultaneously.</P><BR><H4>Eating Disorders Warning Signs</H4><UL>	<LI>Exhibit concern about their weight and make attempts to control weight by diet, vomiting orlaxative and diuretic abuse.<br>	<BR> 	<LI>Eating pattern may alternate between binges and fasts<br>	<BR> 	<LI>Most are secretive about binges and vomiting<br>	<BR> 	<LI>Food consumed during a binge has a high caloric content<br>	<BR> 	<LI>Majority of individuals are within a normal weight some may be slightly underweight oroverweight<br>	<BR> 	<LI>Depressive moods and self-deprecating thoughts following a binge<br></UL><BR><BR><a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr><a name="Physical"></a><H3>Some Physical Problems Associated With Eating Disorders </H3><UL>	<LI>Cessation of menstruation<BR>	<LI>Chronic kidney problems<BR>	<LI>Irregular heart rhythms<BR>	<LI>Irritation and tears in the esophagus<BR>	<LI>Parotid gland swelling (under jawline)<BR>	<LI>Erosion of tooth enamel and increased cavities<BR>	<LI>Electrolyte imbalance<BR>	<LI>Low potassium<BR>	<LI>Lightheadedness and dizziness or fainting<BR>	<LI>Sensitivity to cold<BR>	<LI>Dry skin and thinning scalp hair<BR>	<LI>Stomach and intestinal problems<BR>	<LI>Growth of lanugo (fine hair on body surface)<BR>	<LI>Mortality rate is 5-15% (lower with treatment)<BR></UL><BR><a href="#top">Back to top</a><hr><a name="Help"></a><H3>How To Help The Person With An Eating Disorder</H3> <BR><P>If you are close to someone who you suspect has an eating disorder: </P><UL>	<LI>Collect information.

Do your children know the facts about fire? According tothe United States Fire Administration (1), over 65 percent of children who die in home fires areunder age five -1,200 children age 14 and under die in home fires each year.</P><P> &quot;Many adults mistakenly believe that in a fire, children will run to or call a parent,&quot;said Richard Timmons of First Alert(R), leaders in home fire safety. &quot;Others wrongly believe achild will instinctively know to leave a burning home. Tragically, this is not the case,&quot;Timmons continued. &quot;Young children often hide under beds or in closets, thinking they are safe,while older children think they can control the fire,&quot; he said.</P><P> First Alert recommends that parents and caregivers prepare children to increase their chances ofsurviving a residential fire.</P><P>Follow these helpful fire safety suggestions for children:</P><UL>	<LI> Have a working smoke detector on every floor of your home and in every sleeping room. Testeach detector monthly. Change batteries at least once per year (unless the battery is specificallydesigned for long life, such as the batteries in First Alert's 10 Year Lithium Power Battery SmokeDetector) and never remove them except when replacing.	<br><br><LI> Teach your child what the smoke detector alarm sounds like and what to do when itgoes off.	<br><br><LI> Plan two escape routes out of the home and practice fire drills with children untilthey can escape the home from every room, especially bedrooms. Store portable ladders, such as FirstAlert's Fire Escape Ladder, in easily accessible locations in second-story bedrooms.	<br><br><LI> If children are too young to escape on their own, designate family members to beresponsible for them. This is also a good plan to follow for immobile family members.	<br><br><LI> Since most residential fire deaths occur between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., practice firedrills at night.	<br><br><LI> Explain that in a fire it is extremely dangerous to stand up because of the toxicsmoke and intense heat. Teach children to crawl along the floor to safety.	<br><br><LI> Teach children to touch doors before opening them and to use and alternate exit ifthe door is hot. If they exit through the door, teach them to close it  this could help save otherfamily members by containing the fire.	<br><br><LI> Designate a meeting place outside the house, such as a tree, street lamp orneighbor's home.	<br><br><LI> Teach children never to re-enter a burning building.	<br><br><LI> Take children to a local fire station so they will recognize firefighters as sourcesof help in a fire. Many stations have fire safety education classes for children.	</UL><P>(1) &quot;How Fire Safe is Your Home?,&quot; a brochure sponsored by the USFA.</P><P>CONTACT: Cathy Berner or Gigi Lubin of Wheatley Blair, Inc. 312-337-7773.</P></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/products.html"> Products </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

His frequentangry outbursts occasionally turnedviolent. As you might expect, he didpoorly in school and his teacherspredicted that he would amount to"nothing good." But when taught howto make buildings from playing cards,he spent countless hours at it,constructing some structures 14 storieshigh. He also enjoyed makingjigsaw puzzles and constructing buildings fromprefabricated blocks.By the age of 10, his skill in building elaboratestructures wasrecognized, and at age 15 he was put into a special schoolthatstressed learning through observation and doing. Theseearlyexperiences, combined with his unique intellectual gifts, helpedthisyoung man--Albert Einstein--to become one of the mostcreativescientists ever to expand our knowledge of the world.   </P><HR><a name="Science"></a><H3>The Meaning Of Science   </H3><P>You do notneed to be an Einstein to value and use science. Most of usgrew upbelieving that science is an organized collection of facts.However,science is better defined as a way of observing and thinkingabout theworld, and communicating these thoughts to others.Experience and researchshow that young children are excited aboutscience when they are given thechance to "do" science. To give yourchildren a firm foundation in sciencethey should be encouraged tothink about and interact with the world aroundthem. Concreteexperiences that require the use of children's senses, suchasplanting and watching a seed germinate, provide a strong frameworkforabstract thinking later in life.   </P><P>Many skills that help yourchildren succeed in science also help ineveryday life. Observing,inferring, measuring, communicating,classifying, predicting, controllingvariables, interpreting data, anddeveloping models are important scienceprocess skills recentlyidentified by the National Science TeachersAssociation. These skillsare not just essential for careers in science,but they are importantfor almost any career, as well as in daily life.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR><a name="Instruction"></a><H3>When Should Science Instruction Begin?</H3>  <P>As a parent, you are your children's first and mostinfluentialteacher. The best time to introduce children to science is whentheyare curious about the world around them. From their first momentsofconsciousness, children are on a passionate quest to understandtheirworld. Placing interesting mobiles over your child's crib helpsfocusthe infant's attention, spurring the development ofobservationskills. As children mature, they naturally become more curiousabouttheir environment and begin to interact with their surroundings.Fromsimply touching things with their hands, feet, or mouth, theyprogressto moving objects, twirling spinners, and dropping food from thehighchair to enjoy the effects these actions produce.   </P><P>Sciencein the early years should be an extension of these naturalbehaviors. Richsensory experiences (seeing, hearing, tasting,touching, and smelling) canhelp children become more observant andcurious. Exploring thecharacteristics of objects and living thingscan help them learn how toclassify or group things based on theircharacteristics. By playfullyinteracting with their environment,children understand how they aredistinct from the world around themand how they can influence aspects ofit. Science begins for childrenwhen they discover that they can learnabout the world through theirown actions, such as blowing soap bubbles,adding a block that causesa structure to collapse, or refracting lightthrough a prism. A childbest learns to swim by getting into the water;likewise, a child bestlearns science by doing science. Hands-on scienceexperiences,together with conversations about what is occurring, are thebestmethod for developing children's science process skills.Theseexperiences go beyond improving science skills to improvingreadingskills, language skills, creativity, and attitudes towardscience.Fortunately, these hands-on science experiences are ones thatmostchildren enjoy.   </P><HR> <a name="Home"></a><H3>Science AroundThe Home And Community</H3>  <P>There are many activities you can dowith your children to help themdevelop skills related to science.Opportunities for positive scienceexperiences can be found in kitchens,yards, parks, science museums,beaches, nature centers, and even toy boxes.While many aspects ofscience can be very intricate and intellectuallydemanding, it isimportant to remember that often the simplest experiencesmay producethe most profound learning.   </P><P>Some general guidelinescan help you do science with your children:    </P><OL TYPE=1START="1">	<LI> Introduce your children to stimulating environments.Oceans,swamps, parks, airports, and even kitchens, bathrooms, andbackyardsoffer chances for observing and discussing science. Provideyourchildren with situations that encourage playful exploration, anaturalway for children to learn. Toys can be an important part ofastimulating environment. A child's intellectual and social developmentisnot related to the number of toys or materials present, but to thekind oftoys and materials. Children develop better skills if theirtoys are variedand educational. The more things a child can do with atoy, the more likelyit is to be educational. Children can engage inmany creative,constructive, and thought-provoking activities with toybuilding materials,for example.    <BR><BR><LI> Become interested in your children's scienceinterests. Identifyaspects of science that your children enjoy. Fuel thesefires. Talk toyour children about their science interests and encouragetheirefforts. If they are intrigued by dinosaurs, read dinosaurbooks,discuss dinosaurs, construct dinosaur models, and visit museums toseedinosaur fossils and models. Your understanding of yourchildren'sinterests and abilities will help you personalize theirlearningexperiences.    <BR><BR><LI> Seize the teachable moments. Yourchild sees a beautiful tulipflower in the spring and asks about it. Usethat opportunity todiscuss flowers and bulbs. You can follow up byplanting bulbs orflower seeds in the garden or in the house and watchingthem grow. Thehome environment is familiar to your children and fostersteachablemoments that classroom teachers can only dream about; you canusethese teachable moments to help your children become fascinatedwithscience.    <BR><BR><LI> Provide hands-on experiences. Give childrenthe chance to "do"science. Use the aforementioned suggestions as astarting point forfurther hands-on exploration of a scientific concept.Not only arehands-on experiences a great way to learn, but they are also agreatway to get children excited about science. The resource list attheend of this digest contains many ideas for intriguingscienceactivities. The best way to tell if an activity is appropriate forachild is to see if the child is interested while doing it.Activitiesshould challenge, but not overly frustrate. If your child doesnotseem interested in doing a particular activity, suggest another one,ortry it again at another time. Keep children's natural yearning forlearningburning by not forcing them to do something they are notinterested indoing, but by engaging them in motivating activities.  <BR><BR>  <LI>Share your science interests. If you have a science-related job orhobby,such as keeping a fish tank, repairing cars, or feeding birds,share theexcitement. Nothing is as contagious as honest enthusiasm.Do activitiestogether.   <BR><BR> <LI> Bridge from the media. Movies, televisionspecials, magazines,newspapers, books, and computer programs frequentlypresentscience-related topics (see resource list). Talk with yourchildrenabout the science they encounter: What interested them?  What didtheylearn?  Older students may enjoy discussing whether thesciencepresented in science fiction stories was real or fictional.Forexample, could a space traveler hear the whoosh of a space craft asitpassed by in space?  Answer: In outer space there is a vacuum.Sincesound waves cannot travel in a vacuum, space travelers wouldneverhear the sound of a space craft as it passed by them.<BR><BR><LI> Set aside time for discussion. One of the key components ofall theprevious guidelines is discussion--a powerful tool for makingchildrenthink and refocus their ideas. Doing one activitywithdiscussion--either before, during, or after the experience--isbetterthan doing four activities with no discussion. In fact, apowerfulpredictor for determining whether a child will attend collegeiswhether or not the family eats dinner together in a settingthatpromotes discussion. Encourage your children to talk at dinner,onoutings, and during activities. Through the effort tocommunicate,children are forced to construct thoughts, form concepts, andexamineinterrelationships among ideas. The measure of a good discussionisnot how much an adult explains to a child, but how much the childisinduced to think.   <BR><BR></OL><HR> <aname="Connections"></a><H3>Science Connections: Home and School  </H3><P>Research on families and student learning has shown that studentsatall grade levels do better work in school, feel better aboutthemselvesas learners, set higher goals, and dream bigger dreams whentheir parentsare knowledgeable, supportive, encouraging, and involvedwith theireducation. Parent involvement in education can take avariety of forms,including volunteering to help in the school, doinga presentation for aclass, helping chaperone field trips, andsupplying materials. The mostimportant type of involvement, however,is encouraging, monitoring, andhelping your children with theirschoolwork. When parents and schools worktogether, children grow inan environment of consistent expectations andshared purpose, wherechildren become better students, and parents becomebetter teachers.   </P><HR> <a name="Conclusion"></a><H3>Conclusion</H3>   Helping your children acquire skills for understanding the worldwillenhance their success in science. Being excited about yourchildren'sscience interests and schoolwork can promote further growth andquestsfor knowledge. Exposing children to your science-relatedinterests,providing hands-on opportunities for building and exploring, andusingexperiences as a springboard for discussion are powerful methodsforhelping children develop process skills and enthusiasm for science.Theskills your children develop will be important no matter whatcareers theypursue. The shared science experiences in which you andyour childrenparticipate will create wonderful memories to last alifetime.   <HR><a name="References"></a><H3>References </H3>   <B>SCIENCE EDUCATIONRESOURCES FOR FAMILIES  </B> <P>The following items have been selectedfrom a longer annotatedbibliography of science education resourcematerials available for$1.95 from ERIC/CSMEE, 1929 Kenny Road, Columbus,OH 43210-1080.Sources of Science Activities   </P><P>Baldwin, M.

This digest discusses children'splay and itsrelationship to developmental growth from infancy tomiddle childhood. Thedigest also suggests ways in which educators andother adults can supportchildren's play.</P><hr><a name="Sensorimotor"></a><h3>SensorimotorPlay</h3><P>In what Piaget (1962) aptly described as sensorimotorpractice play,infants and toddlers experiment with bodily sensation andmotormovements, and with objects and people. By 6 months of age,infantshave developed simple but consistent action schemes through trialanderror and much practice. Infants use action schemes, such aspushingand grasping, to make interesting things happen. An infant willpush aball and make it roll in order to experience the sensationandpleasure of movement.</P><P>As children master new motor abilities,simple schemes are coordinatedto create more complex play sequences. Olderinfants will push a ball,crawl after it, and retrieve it. When infants of9 months are given anarray of objects, they apply the same limited actionsto all objectsand see how they react. By pushing various objects, aninfant learnsthat a ball rolls away, a bile spins, and a rattle makesnoise. Atabout 12 months, objects bring forth more specific anddifferentiatedactions. At this age, children will throw or kick a ball,but willshake rattles.</P><P>In a toddler's second year, there isgrowing awareness of thefunctions of objects in the social world. Thetoddler puts a cup on asaucer and a spoon in her mouth. During the lasthalf of this year,toddlers begin to represent their world symbolically asthey transformand invent objects and roles. They may stir an imaginarydrink andoffer it to someone (Bergen, 1988). Adults initiate and supportsuchplay. They may push a baby on a swing or cheer its firstawkwardsteps. Children's responses regulate the adult's actions. If theswingis pushed too high, a child's cries will guide the adult towardagentler approach. In interactions with adults such as peekaboo,childrenlearn to take turns, act with others, and engage othersinplay.</P><hr><a name="Pretend"></a><h3>Pretend Play</h3><P>Aschildren develop the ability to represent experience symbolically,pretendplay becomes a prominent activity. In this complex type ofplay, childrencarry out action plans, take on roles, and transformobjects as theyexpress their ideas and feelings about the socialworld (Garvey,1984).</P><P>Action plans are blueprints for the ways in which actionsand eventsare related and sequenced. Family-related themes in action plansarepopular with young children, as are action plans for treatingandhealing and for averting threats.</P><P>Roles are identities childrenassume in play. Some roles arefunctional: necessary for a certain theme.For example, taking a triprequires passengers and a driver. Family rolessuch as mother, fatherand baby are popular, and are integrated intoelaborate play withthemes related to familiar home activities. Childrenalso assumestereotyped character roles drawn from the larger culture, suchasnurse, and fictional character roles drawn from books andtelevision,such as He-Man. Play related to these roles tends to bemorepredictable and restricted than play related to directexperiencessuch as family life (Garvey, 1984).</P><P>As sociodramaticplay emerges, objects begin to influence the roleschildren assume. Forexample, household implements triggerfamily-related roles and actionplans, but capes stimulate superheroplay. Perceptually bound youngerchildren may be aided by theprovision of realistic objects (Fein, 1981).Even three-year-olds caninvent and transform objects to conform toplans.</P><P>By the age of four or five, children's ideas about thesocial worldinitiate most pretend play. While some pretend play issolitary orshared with adults, preschoolers' pretend or sociodramatic playisoften shared with peers in the school or neighborhood. To implementandmaintain pretend play episodes, a great deal of shared meaningmust benegotiated among children. Play procedures may be talked aboutexplicitly,or signaled subtly in role-appropriate action or dialogue.Players oftenmake rule-like statements to guide behavior ("You haveto finish yourdinner, baby"). Potential conflicts are negotiated.Though meanings in playoften reflect real world behavior, they alsoincorporate children'sinterpretations and wishes. The child in a rolewho orders a steak andpiece of candy from a pretend menu is notdirectly copying anything he hasseen before.</P><P>Construction play with symbolic themes is also popularwithpreschoolers, who use blocks and miniature cars and people tocreatemodel situations related to their experience. A kind of playwithmotion, rough and tumble play, is popular in preschool years. Inthisplay, groups of children run, jump, and wrestle. Action patternscallfor these behaviors to be performed at a high pitch. Adults mayworrythat such play will become aggressive, and they shouldprobablymonitor it. Children who participate in this play become skilledintheir movements, distinguish between real and feigned aggression,andlearn to regulate each other's activity (Garvey, 1984).</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><aname="Games"></a><h3>Games With Rules</h3><P>Children become interestedin formal games with peers by age five oryounger. Older children's morelogical and socialized ways of thinkingmake it possible for them to playgames together. Games with rules arethe most prominent form of play duringmiddle childhood (Piaget,1962).</P><P>The main organizing element ingame play consists of explicit ruleswhich guide children's group behavior.Game play is very organized incomparison to sociodramatic play. Gamesusually involve two or moresides, competition, and agreed-upon criteriafor determining a winner.Children use games flexibly to meet social andintellectual needs. Forexample, choosing sides may affirm friendship and apecking order.Games provide children with shared activities and goals.Childrenoften negotiate rules in order to create the game they wish toplay(King, 1986). They can learn reasoning strategies and skillsfromstrategy games like checkers. In these games, children mustconsiderat the same time both offensive alternatives and the need fordefense.Many card games encourage awareness of mathematics and ofthepsychology of opponents. Such games can be intellectuallymotivatingparts of pre- and primary school curriculum (Kamii &amp;DeVries, 1980,Kamii, 1985).</P><hr><a name="Adult"></a><h3>The AdultRole In Children's Play</h3><P>These general guidelines may behelpful:</P><UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI> Value children's play and talk tochildren about their play. Adultsoften say "I like the way you'reworking," but rarely, "I like the wayyou're playing."<LI> Play withchildren when it is appropriate, especially during theearly years. Ifadults pay attention to and engage in children's play,children get themessage that play is valuable.<LI> Create a playful atmosphere. It isimportant for adults to providematerials which children can explore andadapt in play.<LI> When play appears to be stuck or unproductive, offer anew prop,suggest new roles, or provide new experiences, such as a fieldtrip.<LI> Intervene to ensure safe play. Even in older children's play,socialconflicts often occur when children try to negotiate. Adults canhelpwhen children cannot solve these conflicts by themselves(Caldwell,1977). Adults should identify play which has led to problemsforparticular children. They should check materials and equipmentforsafety. Finally, adults should make children aware of any hiddenrisksin physical challenges they set for themselves.</UL><hr><aname="More"></a><h3>For More Information</h3><P>Bergen, D.

Ranging in agefrom birth to 21, these children and youth withexceptionalitiesrequire the assistance of special educators in order tobenefit fromeducation. A dynamic concept of exceptionality encompassesallchildren who need a specially tailored education program to achieveinaccordance with their potential.</P><HR> <aname="Federal"></a><H3>Federal Legislation </H3><P>In 1975 the U.S.Congress passed the Education for All HandicappedChildren Act, whichguarantees a free and appropriate public educationto all children in theUnited States between the ages of 3 and 21. Thelaw provides funds forspecial education programs to states and localdistricts that comply with aset of regulations. These regulationsmandate provision of specialeducation services including anindividualized educational program to becarried out in the leastrestrictive environment, a comprehensive diagnosisof each child'sdisabilities by a qualified professional team, an annualreview ofeach child's progress, and the involvement of parents ineducationaldecisions. Amendments to the law, P.L. 98-199 and P.L. 99-457,alsorequire that the local school districts actively search forandprovide services to children between the ages of 3 and 5 whohavedisabilities.</P><P>States are also required to develop systems toprovide earlyintervention services for infants from birth to age 3 whoaredevelopmentally delayed or at risk of becomingdevelopmentallydelayed.</P><HR> <a name="Gifted"></a><H3>Programs ForGifted Students </H3><P>Although an increasing number of programs isavailable to meet theneeds of students with special gifts and talents, theeducation ofthese students is still largely ignored. Approximately halfthe statesnow mandate some form of special services for these students.Giftsand talents may be in academic, intellectual, creative, artistic,orleadership abilities. In addition to the traditional practiceofallowing academically talented students to skip grades, theeducationalneeds of gifted and talented students may be served by theprovision ofenrichment experiences, instructional grouping byintellectual abilityrather than by chronological age, and, to alesser extent, counseling tosupport the development of personal andsocial skills.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <aname="Physical"></a><H3>Programs For Children With Physical Handicaps</H3><P>About 1% of the preschool- and school-aged children in theUnitedStates have physical handicaps. These handicaps include blindnessandvisual impairments, deafness and hearing impairments, andorthopedicdisabilities. Depending on the degree of the disability andonindividual characteristics, these children may be educatedinresidential schools, separate classes, or regular classes withsupportservices provided by special teachers.</P><P>For children who areblind, instruction in braille and mobility isrequired. Children withvisual impairments need materials such aslarge-type books, specialtypewriters, and proper lighting. Childrenwho are deaf require languageinstruction that often combines signing,lip-reading, intensive work inspeech production, and amplified auraltraining. Children with orthopedichandicaps may need the services ofa speech pathologist, physical oroccupational therapist,psychologist, or social worker. They may alsorequire modifications intheir surroundings such as wide doorways toaccommodate wheelchairs,toilets at appropriate heights, and ramps orelevators.</P><HR> <a name="Mentall"></a><H3>Programs For ChildrenWith Mental Handicaps </H3><P>Slightly less than 2% of the preschool-and school-aged children inthe United States are classified as mentallyhandicapped. Childrenwith severe mental handicaps often have multipledisabilities. Avariety of educational options are available for thesechildrenincluding residential schools, special day schools, separateclasses,and regular classes with special education support services.Theappropriate option for each child depends on thechild'scharacteristics and individual abilities.</P><HR> <aname="Behavior"></a><H3>Programs For Children With Behavior Disorders</H3><P>Children with emotional disorders constitute about 1% ofthepreschool- and school-aged population. These children may bewithdrawnor overly aggressive. Their education is usually provided inregularor special classes with support services provided bypsychiatrists,psychologists, social workers, and speech-languagepathologists.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <a name="Speech"></a><H3>Programs For ChildrenWith Speech And Language Disabilities</H3><P>Nearly 3% of the preschool-and school-aged population have speech orlanguage impairments, includingproblems in articulation, language,fluency, or voice, that affect theirability to learn or communicateeffectively with others. The educationaltreatment provided to thesechildren depends on the severity of theimpairment and may include theservices of special education teachers andspeech/languagepathologists.</P><HR> <aname="Learning"></a><H3>Programs For Children With Learning Disabilities</H3><P>The largest group of exceptional children, slightly less than 5%ofthe population, have learning disabilities. There is adiscrepancybetween their measured ability to learn and their actualachievementthat is not due to intellectual retardation, emotionaldisorder, orsensory impairment. Intelligence scores for children withlearningdisabilities range from average to gifted levels. These childrenmaybe educated in self-contained classes if their problems are severe,butmore often they remain in regular classes with the support ofspecialeducators.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <a name="Health"></a><H3>Services For Children WithSpecialized Health Care Needs </H3><P>Specialized health care needs isa relatively new term applied to agroup of students who previously wereunserved in educationalsettings. Although these students are oftenconsidered similar tostudents with other health impairments, theireducational needs arecomplicated by extreme medical needs. Other termssometimes used aremedically fragile andtechnologically dependent. Many ofthesestudents have survived catastrophic medical events thatrequireintensive and prolonged health care.</P><P>Because classificationof this group of students does not exist ineducational databases,estimation of numbers is difficult. However,the Office of TechnologyAssessment (OTA) has estimated that as manyas 100,000 infants and childrenmay be technologically dependent insome way. OTA defines this group asrequiring a medical device tocompensate for the loss of a vital bodyfunction and substantial andongoing nursing care to avert furtherdisability or death.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <a name="Special"></a><H3>Trends InSpecial Education </H3><P>Two trends are apparent in special educationtoday. First, childrenwith disabilities are receiving special educationservices earlier.This trend reflects the recognition that a child'sability to learn inschool depends on skills learned as a toddler, such ascommunicatingwith others or exploring the environment. Since disabilitiescan delaythe acquisition of these skills, early special education isneeded toprovide a foundation for future learning. To identify theseyoungchildren and treat their disabilities, special educators areworkingclosely with hospitals, medical personnel, therapists, andsocialworkers. Family services are being provided to help parentsunderstandtheir child's disability and its treatment, and preschooleducation isbeing provided in homes and in preschool education centers.For manychildren, early educational treatment of handicapping conditionscanreduce or eliminate the need for intensive special serviceslater.</P><P>Young gifted children are also receiving more attention. Itis notuncommon to find such children experiencing a vast gap betweentheiradvanced intellectual skills and their less advanced physicalandemotional competencies. Understanding the unique developmentalpatternsthat are often present in gifted children can help parentsand teachersadjust their expectations of academic performance to amore realisticlevel. Young gifted children who find that theirlimited physical skillsare not sufficiently developed to carry outthe complex projects theyimagined must be helped to develop copingskills to deal with theirfrustrations.</P><P>The second trend is a change in the public's attitudetowardemployment of people with handicaps. Today it is recognizedthatvaluable contributions may be made even by people withseverehandicaps.

<P>The Consumer Product Safety Commission is aware of deaths and 
non-fatal injuries associated with baby "supporting ring"
devices. These bath rings usually contain three or four legs with
suction cups that attach to the bottom of the tub. However, the
suction cups may suddenly release allowing the bath ring and baby
to tip over. A baby may also slip between the legs of the bath
ring and become trapped under it.</P>

<P>Do not rely on these devices to keep baby safe in the bath.
Parents or other attendants must never leave a baby alone in
these bath support rings. Even turning away to answer the
doorbell or telephone could result in injury or drowning of the
baby.</P>

<P>The Commission urges parents not to place infants to sleep on
soft bedding products, including those products intended for use
by infants. Some infants placed on fluffy, plush products such as
sheepskins, quilts, comforters, and pillows have been found on
their stomach (the prone position) with their face, nose, and
mouth covered by the soft bedding. Such soft products may cause
infants to rebreathe exhaled air and suffocate.</P>

<P>The Commission recommends that parents place infants in a crib on
a firm, flat infant mattress to sleep. No soft, fluffy products--
pillows, sheepskins, quilts, comforters, toys--should be under
infants while they sleep.</P>

<P>Results of Commission studies also support the American Academy
of Pediatrics' recommendation that healthy infants be placed on
their back or side to sleep.</P>

<P>To help prevent a suffocation death, place infant on back or side
to sleep on a firm, flat crib mattress. Remove pillows,
sheepskins, and toys from under baby while sleeping.</P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends
that parents keep a close watch when a child is in an infant
carrier seat because the seat can fall or turn over and the child
can be injured or killed. CPSC has reports of over 20 deaths
since 1986 associated with infant carrier seats. The deaths
happened when infants became entangled in restraining straps,
when carrier seats toppled over on soft surfaces such as beds, or
when unrestrained children fell from the carrier seat to the
floor. In almost all of the cases, infants were left unattended
in the infant carrier seat. Active infants can move or tip
carrier seats by their movements or by pushing off on other
objects with their feet.</P>

<P>To prevent injuries and deaths with infant carrier seats, CPSC
recommends that parents:</P>

<ul>
<li> Choose a carrier with a wide, sturdy base for stability.

<br><br><li> Stay within arm's reach of the baby when the carrier seat is on
tables, counters, couches, and chairs. Never place a carrier seat
on soft, plush surfaces that will make it unstable.

<br><br><li> Always use the safety belts and watch the child carefully, even
when strapped in.

<br><br><li> Do not use infant carriers as a substitute for infant car
seats.

</ul>

<P>To prevent injuries and deaths with infant carrier seats, always
use restraining straps and watch the child carefully, even when
strapped in.</P>

<P>    WASHINGTON, Oct. 1, 1996 -- Three toddlers died within hours of
eating small amounts of over-the-counter pain medications containing
dibucaine, an anesthetic often found in ointments for skin pain caused by such
things as sunburn, cuts, hemorrhoids, and episiotomies.</P>
<P>    Minutes after eating the medicine, the children, who ranged in age from 18
months to two years, became limp and listless, and then had seizures.  Each
child was rushed to the emergency department, but despite extensive treatment,
all suffered cardiac arrest.</P>
<P>    "Dibucaine is more potent than other topical anesthetics, so children only
need to swallow small amounts to become seriously ill," says Peter Dayan, MD,
an emergency physician in New York, and lead author of the study.  "Although
dibucaine is not often used, the products it is in are commonly found in
homes, and parents often are unaware of the danger."</P>
<P>    Only recently has there been an increased awareness of the danger of
topical anesthetics.  In April 1995, the Consumer Product Safety Commission
required child-resistant packaging for products containing dibucaine and
lidocaine.</P>
<P>    "Parents need to be educated about toxic medications such as dibucaine
which are available over-the-counter, and then check to see if any products in
their household contain these ingredients," warned Dr. Dayan.  "If there are
any such products, they should be locked away, inaccessible to children."</P>

    

<P>    Annals of Emergency Medicine is the peer-reviewed journal of the American
College of Emergency Physicians, a national medical specialty society
representing nearly 19,000 physicians who specialize in emergency medicine.
The College is committed to improving the quality of emergency care through
continuing education, research, and public education.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - As Halloween approaches, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
warns parents and caregivers that as with trick-or-treaters, Halloween's hazards to children also come in disguise.</P>

<P>CPSC Chairman Ann Brown said, "This holiday is a favorite for children who love to use their imagination and
creativity. By using CPSC's safety suggestions, consumers can help ensure that their little Halloween ghosts and
goblins will have a bag of goodies to show for their fun and will not be haunted by unnecessary injuries."</P>

<P>Halloween-related injuries may involve 
<ol>
<li> eye abrasions from sharp objects attached to masks or costumes, ]
<li> skin irritations or rashes from decorative face paints or creams, and 
<li> burns from flammable costumes ignited by
open flames from items such as candles and Jack O'Lanterns. 
</ol>

<P>CPSC is releasing safety suggestions for consumers to ward off injury-demons by making this ghoulish holiday a safe and happy one.</P>


<P>Treats:Warn children not to eat any treats before an adult has examined them carefully for evidence of tampering.</P>

<P>Flame Resistant Costumes: When purchasing costumes, masks, beards, and wigs, look for the label Flame
Resistant. Although this label does not mean these items won't catch fire, it does indicate the items will resist
burning and should extinguish quickly. To minimize the risk of contact with candles and other fire sources, avoid
costumes made with flimsy materials and outfits with big, baggy sleeves or billowing skirts.</P>

<P>Costume Designs:Purchase or make costumes that are light, bright, and clearly visible to motorists. </P>

<P>For greater visibility during dusk and darkness, decorate or trim costumes with reflective tape that will glow in the beam of a car's headlights. Bags or sacks should also be light colored or decorated with reflective tape. Reflective tape is usually available in hardware, bicycle, and sporting goods stores. </P>

<P>Children should carry flashlights to see easily and be seen.</P>

<P>Costumes should be short enough so that children won't trip and fall.</P>

<P>Children should wear well-fitting, sturdy shoes. Mother's high heels are not a good idea for safe walking.</P>

<P>Tie hats and scarfs securely to prevent them from slipping over children's eyes.</P>

<P>If your child wears a mask, make sure it fits securely and has eyeholes large enough to allow full vision.</P>

<P>Swords, knives, and similar costume accessories should be made of soft, flexible material. </P>

<P>CPSC encourages parents to follow these safety tips to ensure a happy and safe Halloween. </P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for information on

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Baby Trend, Inc., are
urging consumers to stop using Home and Roam or Baby Express portable crib/playpens manufactured before
1995. The sides of the crib/playpens may appear to be securely locked in place when they are not. As a result, the
sides could collapse in a "V" shape. Children can strangle or suffocate if they get entrapped in the "V."</P>

<P>CPSC and Baby Trend recalled the products last year because two babies died and two others were found not
breathing when their crib/playpens collapsed. A third death recently occurred in California.</P>

<P>CPSC and Baby Trend announced the recall of the crib/playpens in January 1995. CPSC is issuing this safety alert
to reemphasize the importance of returning these products. CPSC and Baby Trend are concerned that some of these
crib/playpens remain in use and continue to present a serious risk to children.</P>

<P>The Baby Trend playpens now on the market are not subject to the recall and have a new lock designed to prevent
the collapsing risk. To find out if they have one of the recalled Baby Trend playpens, and to obtain a free
repair,consumers should call (800) 421-1902. </P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects the public from the unreasonable risk of injury or death from 15,000 types of
consumer products under the agency's jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury and for information on
CPSC's fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772 or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press
release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the handset of your fax machine and enter the release number. Consumers can

They appear todo equally well in bothsubjects in elementary school. Once courses becomeoptional insecondary school, the down hill spiral in enrollment offemalestudents in mathematics and physical science begins, accompaniedbydecreases in achievement and interest. This means that womenareinadequately prepared for most college majors as well as thoseintechnical fields.   </P><P>Technology is becoming an increasinglyimportant factor in thenation's economy, and participation and achievementin science is alsobecoming increasingly important. As a result of thedecline in thebirthrate since 1964, the size and composition of thepopulationentering the workforce has changed. Women will represent 47percent ofthe total workforce and half of those pursuing professionalcareers.Estimates from the U.S. Department of Labor indicate thatwomen,minorities, and immigrants will make up 80 percent of thenetadditions to the labor force between 1987 and 2000 (Oakes, 1990:v).</P><HR><a name="Important"></a><H3>What Does The Research Say?</H3> <P>"Lost Talent," recent publication written by Jeannie Oakes(1990),contains a review of current research on the relationshipbetweeneducational practices and policies and low rates of participationofwomen, minorities, and disabled persons in science-relatedcareers.Oakes has two central messages for her readers: (1) there is muchwedo not understand about the low participation rates of these groups,and(2) what we do know suggests that there are alterable features ofschoolsthat appear to constrain participation. Attainment inscientific fields isgoverned by three factors: (1) opportunities tolearn science (andmathematics), (2) achievement in science (andmathematics), and (3)students' decisions to pursue science (ormathematics-related) careers.Unfortunately, there is littletheoretical research on how these factorswork together or therelative contribution of each factor to participation(1990:26).   </P><HR> <a name="Lost"></a><H3>Where Are Women Lost?</H3>  <P>Gender differences do not appear at the elementary level inscience.In middle school, girls hold more negative attitudes aboutsciencethan do boys, and they report having fewer science experiencesthanboys. Students in grades 7 and 11 were asked, as part of theNationalAssessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), how often they hadtried tofix something electrical, fix something mechanical, or figure outwhatwas wrong with an unhealthy plant or animal. Female students ingrade7 were three times more likely than males to report that theyhadnever  fixed something electrical or mechanical; in grade 11,thedifferences were even greater. Ninety-three percent of 11th grademalesbut only 66 percent of 11th grade females reported having triedto"fix something electrical" at least once. Sex differences werereversedfor the unhealthy plant or animal question, with femalestudentssignificantly more likely than males to have tried todetermine what waswrong with an unhealthy plant (Weiss, 1989:Attitude Graph 11). Experiencesstudents have had are closely linkedto their interests.   </P><P>Insenior high school, relatively equal numbers of boys and girlsenroll inacademic and nonacademic curricula; therefore, similarscience courses areavailable to them. However, girls choose to takethese courses at lowerrates than boys (Oakes, 1990:18). Armstrongfound that motivation to enrolldiffered among males and females. Formales, parental expectations forscientific and technical careers fortheir sons are the motivating forceswhile, for females, their owneducation aspirations provided the drive toenroll. So, women have tobe more self-motivated to choose these courses(Armstrong in Tsuji andZiegler, 1990:l).   </P><P>Studies of junior highschool students have shown that both sexes areunaware of career optionsand the educational requirements involved.If male students take coursesdue to parental pressure, they havestill made the "right" choices. Femalestudents, who need intrinsicreasons, would be less likely to have adequateinformation to guidetheir course-taking. Therefore, educators need tostress the relevanceof mathematics to students' career goals. If this isnot done, highschool girls tend to avoid taking the advanced mathematicsnecessaryfor careers in science and engineering (Tsuji and Ziegler,1990:1).   </P><HR> <a name="Situation"></a><H3>What Can Be Done ToImprove The Situation? </H3>  <P>Intervention programs are needed.Intervention strategies vary. Theymay be designed to appeal to students atone or more levels: cognitive, affective, and ability or achievement.Those at thecognitive level are designed to provide information, toincreaseawareness; while interventions at the affective level may befocusedon increasing self-confidence or relieving anxiety. Those attheability or achievement level are designed to result inincreasedability, leading to improved achievement. Interventions aimedataffective or achievement levels appear to have more impact onbehaviorthan do those aimed at the cognitive level (Tsuji andZiegler,1990:1).   </P><P>When interventions are attempted, a range ofpossibilities for careersshould be included. Careers in medicine, science,and engineeringshould be discussed, but so should careers in skilledtrades andtechnological industries (1990:2).   </P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <aname="Interventions"></a><H3>What Kinds Of Interventions ArePossible?</H3>   <P>Several kinds of intervention programs exist. Theseprograms, as wellas methods for evaluating their effectiveness, arediscussed by Davisand Humphreys in their book, "Evaluating InterventionPrograms,Applications from Women's Programs in Math and Science" (1985).Davisand Humphreys group intervention programs into five types:short-term,audiovisual and printed products, experiential learning,long-term,and teacher education.   </P><P>Short-term programs serve toraise awareness and change attitudes.They may consist of a speakersseries, one-day conferences, orworkshops.   </P><P>Audiovisual andprinted products are used as interventions to raiseawareness, changeattitudes, or increase knowledge. Films, filmstrips,videotapes, books,puzzles, exhibits, videodiscs, and career postersmay be  used to provideinformation about science careers in a concisemanner.</P><P>Experiential learning is used to give participants ahands-onexperience in science or a science-related field.   </P><P>Longterm interventions consist of courses and curricula. They aredesigned toincrease learning as well as to change attitudes.   </P><P>Teachereducation intervention programs may consist of summerinstitutes orinservice programs. Their purpose is to modify teachers'behaviors andimprove their skills so that, ultimately, the learningand attitudes oftheir students are improved  (Davis and Humphreys,1985: 115-121).</P><HR> <a name="Reform"></a><H3>How Do Intervention Programs FitInto The Educational Reform   Movement In Science Education? </H3><P>Persons interested in reforming science education areadvocatingmeasures that Oakes considers beneficial to all students -therefore,such moves should help increase the number of womenconsideringscience-related careers. Reformers advocate the abolition oftrackingbecause track placements in curriculum tend to be fixed andlong-term.Although tracking may be done to accommodate differences instudentability, it exacerbates differences among students bylimitingopportunities to learn. Lower-track science courses may actuallylimitstudents' opportunities to learn the subject because ofrestrictedcontent and diminished outcomes. Reformers are urging thatsciencecurricula focus on personal needs, create career awareness,andinclude the study of science-technology-society in terms ofproblemsand issues found in the community or discussed through themedia.Reformers also advocate that more hands-on activities be usedinscience, preferably in a cooperative learning situation. Girlsbenefitfrom such instructional tactics. If, as some research dataimply,current teaching strategies have led to early gender differencesinattitudes, which then lead to differences in participation,changingteaching methods as well as revising the curriculum should helptodecrease this trend.   </P><P>Klein (1990) has identified 10 "commonground science process goals"addressed in current science education reformreports: enabling all toexperience success in science; making the totalscience curriculummore unified and flexible; establishing requirements andprocedures sothat students will take more mathematics, science andtechnologycourses; making science curricula personally meaningful;ensuring thattests and assessment procedures are unbiased and supportiveofmeaningful science instruction; using heterogeneous andcooperativegroups to promote a high level of participation for allstudents;arranging for meaningful science role models; supportingenrichingscience education opportunities rather than ineffectiveremedialscience education programs; increasing cultural sensitivityininstructional materials and classroom interactions; andincreasingsupport for science achievement from parents, peers and thecommunity(1990:5-11). Such goals, Klein believes, will work toward equityaswell as educational reform.   </P><HR> <aname="Resources"></a><H3>What Are Some Resources For The Identification OfIntervention Programs?</H3>   <P>"Equity and Excellence: CompatibleGoals" (Malcolm, 1984) contains alisting of over 300 interventionprograms. Rather than attempting tosingle out several of these programsfor inclusion here, it ispreferable that ERIC users decide for themselveswhat best suits theirneeds.   </P><P>Most professional science andengineering societies have careerbrochures. Many are targeted at women andminorities. A listing ofsuch brochures may be obtained by writing theOffice of Opportunitiesin Science, AAAS, 1333 H Street, NW, Washington, DC20005.   </P><P>Also there are several national networks of women inscience andengineering.

<P>CHARLOTTE, N.C., Sept. 30, 1996 -- A new way to help children 5 through 12 stop thumbsucking is gaining ground in the nation's dental offices, one that is safe, easy and involves no fear or discomfort for the child.</P>

<P>It's called T-Guard(TM), a thumb cover of FDA-approved, medical-grade material, attached by a parent to a child's wrist using a colorful, lock-band bracelet.</P>

<P>T-Guard doesn't keep children from putting their thumbs in their mouths, but it makes it impossible for their lips to form the tight seal around the thumb that generates the soothing suction sensation to which children are drawn.</P>

<P>While child health experts don't consider thumbsucking a problem in very young children carried over into preschool and grade school it can hinder social development and cause severe dental problems affecting the child's physical health and appearance.</P>

<P>For pediatric dentists, long dissatisfied with putting children through extensive fittings and impressions necessary to create preventive intraoral devices, T-Guard is a welcome alternative. It often eliminates thumbsucking in a few weeks, as compared to the six months or more typical of cemented mouth appliances.</P>

<P>"Parents often ask me to help an older child stop thumbsucking," said Dr. Martha Dawson, a Sandston, Virginia pediatric dentist who has used T-Guard for eight months. "Before T-Guard, the best I could offer was a cemented mouth appliance, which the child wears 24 hours daily for many months. With T-Guard, I send a kit home, the child wears the bracelet at bedtime or whenever sucking is most tempting, and there is an immediate solution to the problem.</P>

<P>Dr. Kyle Jackson, a Dayton, Ohio pediatric dentist, discovered T-Guard last year and first used it to help his 6-year-old break her thumbsucking habit. It stopped completely in three weeks."</P>

<P>Dentists surveyed by Med et.al., the company that created T-Guard, believe children like the product because it's fun to wear and, since it's rarely worn all the time, no one in their peer group necessarily has to know about it.</P>

<P>The dentists' impressions are borne out in independent testing by Clinical Research Associates, a dental research organization, which found T-Guard, 90% successful in a test group, to be a safe, kind, low-cost way to help children overcome thumbsucking.</P>

<P>For more information about T-Guard, contact your dentist, or call 1-800-964-5704.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Gerry Baby Products
Company, of Thornton, Colo., is announcing a voluntary
recall of approximately 990,000 Model 602 Gerry Deluxe Baby
Monitors.  Wires inside the monitor may be improperly
connected, resulting in  the product overheating with the
possibility of the monitor causing fire.  Another
contributing factor is when blankets or other bedding are
placed around or on top of the monitor blocking ventilation.</P>

<P>     Gerry urges consumers to read all product warnings and
instructions accompanying all monitors.  Consumers should
not place any monitor in the crib, among blankets or
bedding, or in any position that interferes with ventilation
for the monitor.</P>

<P>     Gerry is aware of one fire without injuries involving a
Model 602 monitor with this manufacturing error.  This
information was brought to CPSC's attention by a member of
the International Association of Arson Investigators (IAAI). 
In addition, CPSC has also received reports alleging Model
602 Baby Monitor involvement in two other fires, including
one with a fatality and an injury, and 13 incidents of the
monitors getting warm to the touch, including
one skin burn.  Gerry stated that only one report (no
injuries) of these 16 claims was conclusively determined to
have been caused by the Model 602 monitor.</P>

<P>     The two-piece monitor sets resemble walkie-talkies. 
The monitors have pale gray and royal blue plastic casing. 
A red "on" light and a blue "Gerry" label appear on the
front of each monitor.  The back of the monitors are
embossed with "GERRY DELUXE BABY MONITOR MODEL 602" and the
manufacturer's date code.  The date code appears as a
circle of numbers, with an arrow pointing to the number of
the month and the two-digit year number on either side of
the arrow.  This recall involves monitors with date codes
"8806" (June 1988) through "9005" (May 1990).</P>

<P>     Juvenile product and baby supply stores and department
stores sold the recalled monitors nationwide from June 1988
through May 1990.  The monitors were packaged in blue
cardboard boxes labeled in part, "Gerry Deluxe Baby
Monitor...Listen to Your Baby from any Home Location...Gerry
Baby Safetronics..." </P>

<P>     Consumers who own Model 602 monitors should contact
Gerry toll-free at (800) 672-6289  for instructions on how
to return the recalled monitors for a free replacement
monitor.  For more information, consumers should call Gerry,
or write to the company at Attn: 
Building R-602 Recall, 1500 East 128th Avenue, Thornton, CO 
80241.</P>

<P>     The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission protects
the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death from
15,000 types of consumer products under the agency's
jurisdiction. To report a dangerous product or a
product-related injury and for information on CPSC's
fax-on-demand service, call CPSC's hotline at (800) 638-2772
or CPSC's teletypewriter at (800) 638-8270. To order a press
release through fax-on-demand, call (301) 504-0051 from the
handset of your fax machine and enter the release number.
Consumers can obtain this release and recall information at
CPSC's web site at <A HREF="http://www.cpsc.gov">http://www.cpsc.gov</A> or via Internet
gopher services at <A HREF="gopher://cpsc.gov">cpsc.gov</A>. Consumers can report
product hazards to <a href="mailto:info@cpsc.gov">info@cpsc.gov</a>.</P>

Estimates are that by1995, the mothers of 2/3 of preschoolersand 3/4 of school-agedchildren will work outside the home (Hofferth &amp;Phillips, 1987). Withthe baby boom generation at child bearing age, therehas been a markedincrease in the absolute number of children. Change onthis scale hasgenerated discussion of a national, publicly supported childcaresystem.</P><P>This digest addresses public schooling forfour-year-olds andpreschoolers, structural and demographic trends,research results, ageand child and family characteristics, subgroups thatmight be served,types of programs, and location of programs.</P><HR><a name="Child Care"></a><H3>Why Child Care And Early EducationNow?</H3><P>Economic trends have increased the likelihood that familieswillrequire two incomes to maintain family comfort. A third of thenewfull-time jobs created since 1978 have paid an annual wage belowthepoverty line for a family of four (Bluestone &amp; Harrison,1986).According to a recent report, 59% of women with children 5-13 wereinthe labor force (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1987). The numberoffemale-headed households is increasing. A majority of childreninhouseholds dependent on women live in poverty. Child supportpaymentsare frequently inadequate or nonexistent, and welfare andsocialsecurity payments remain insufficient.</P><P>A body of literaturesupports programs for young children fromlow-income families on thegrounds that such programs have long-termbenefits for many participants.The Perry Preschool Program inYpsilanti, Michigan made the case thatchildren who attended theproject's preschool program were less likely thanothers to experiencedifficulties in life. They were more likely to finishhigh school,attend college, and hold jobs (Berrueta-Clement, and others,1984).Such evidence has consistently been cited to supportpolicyinitiatives for the development or expansion of preschoolprograms.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table ofContents</a><BR><BR><HR> <a name="Served"></a><H3>Who Should BeServed?</H3><P>A public program for preschoolers can serve allpreschoolers orselected subgroups. The former strategy has rarely beenfollowed inrecent legislation. The tendency is to focus on a target groupofchildren with special needs and provide resources only to thatgroup.This tendency has arisen because a case can be made that aparticularsubgroup of children is especially deserving of help andthatprovision to a target group keeps costs from rising topoliticallyfrightening heights.</P><P>Preschool subgroups with special needs have been defined in terms ofage, child, or family characteristics.Although attention now centerson 4-year-olds, younger children also needcare. Currently, childrenqualify for preschool programs if they arehandicapped or, in somestates, if they score low on screening tests, speaka language otherthan English, or come from low-incomefamilies.</P><P>Over the last 25 years, much legislation has beendesigned to benefitsubgroups with special needs. The philosophy ofVERTICAL EQUITY--theunequal treatment of unequals in order to make themmore equal--hasbeen supported by the American public (Gallagher, 1984).But policy isnot made on this basis alone. If public programs are only forthepoor, they will foster racial and income segregation. Ifpublicprograms are only for the handicapped, these children will beisolatedfrom their nonhandicapped peers. Clearly, many criteria need tobeconsidered when one addresses the question "Who should beserved?"</P><HR> <a name="What"></a><H3>What Type OfProgram?</H3><P>Should programs be part of general social services tofamilies, andthus housed in departments of human resources or socialservices? Orshould they be educational programs for the young and,therefore,governed by departments of education? Is the principal objectiveof aprogram the provision of care while parents work, or the creationofopportunities for children to develop socially and emotionally or tobeprepared for formal schooling?</P><P>Research on programs and curriculummodels identify three generictypes: the traditional preschool, theacademic preschool, and a hybridform.</P><P>The Traditional Preschool.The traditional preschool was historicallya part-day program formiddle-class children. Today, the program ischaracterized by a teacher whois indirect, an environment that iscarefully planned (but allows childrento learn through activeexploration and discovery), an emphasis on learningat one's own pace,and an appreciation for developmentally appropriateactivities.</P><P>The Academic Preschool. Academic programs forpreschoolers frequentlyinvolve efforts to help low-income children catchup to theirmiddle-class peers. The academic preschool shares manycharacteristicsof public schooling for older children: teacher-directedinstruction,clear goals and expectations, tight scheduling, and theteaching ofskills for school success. A major concern amongchilddevelopmentalists is that school-based early education programswill,like many kindergartens, become junior first grades.</P><P>TheHybrid Form. Efforts have been made to blend aspects of each oftheseforms, primarily by including both structured andunstructuredactivities.</P><HR> <a name="Where"></a><H3>Where ShouldPrograms Be Offered?</H3><P>Should a child be nurtured in a familysetting or an educationalsetting? Most working parents use one or more ofthese choices: homecare by a family member, care in another's home, carein or throughthe worksite, center-based and school-based care.</P><HR><a name="Public"></a><H3>Child Care In Public Schools</H3><P>Thedownward extension of schooling to younger children is evident.More5-year-olds are attending kindergarten more hours each day thaneverbefore, and public school-based programs for threes and foursseem to beincreasing. State initiatives and contributions to HeadStart-funded,school-based programs served about 139,000 children of3-5 in 1987-88 (Marx&amp; Seligson, 1988).</P><P>Those who favor expansion of publicschool-based programs argue thatschools are universally available, safe,and convenient. A preschoolercould attend school with friends and siblingsin the neighborhood.Programs would be guaranteed a steady source offunding. Standardscould be set; programs monitored; staff salariesincreased; andbenefits guaranteed. Those who question the efficacy of aschool-basedsolution note that schools have never been equal. Moreover,aschool-based child care system would be centralized, bureaucratized,andexpensive. Some say it would result in a regimented program.</P><P>Zigler(1987) has presented a plan for a national, school-based systemin whichschool buildings house both the educational and child caresystem. Childcare would include before- and after-school care;vacation programs forschool-aged children; half-day care forkindergartners; and developmentalcare for children of 3-5. Costswould be contained by a two-tier system ofstaffing in whichcredentialed teachers taught part of the day and thosewith lessformal training and lower salaries taught the rest. The expenseofsuch a system is not known, but Zigler estimates it at $75-100 billionayear.

<h3>Teacher Leadership</h3>

<p>The U.S. Department of Education is asking for our thoughts on teacher leadership. The results from their survey will shape their thinking and the direction of a future publication. You are invited to answer their four questions at <a href="http://www.ed.gov/comments/TeachLeader/index.html"> http://www.ed.gov/comments/TeachLeader/index.htm </a>.  On their web site you may notice an expiration date of late October.  We asked and this date is being extended for several more weeks, so there is time if you wish to participate. </P>

<p> The four questions are:

<ol>
<li> Think of a time or situation where you or another teacher
     provided leadership that was needed outside the classroom
     (or at least, outside the traditional role of teachers).
     Please describe this situation, what you (or the other
     teacher) did to provide this leadership, and why this kind
     of leadership is important. </p>

<li> Please set aside your own personal experience for this
     question. In an ideal world -- given adequate time and
     resources -- what kind of leadership from teachers do you
     feel is most needed (outside the classroom), and why? </p>

<li> What can be done to help more teachers step into these
     kinds of leadership roles? </p>

<li> What can you and other teachers do to help more teachers
     step into these kinds of leadership roles?</p>
     </ol>


<p> You can respond to the questions either by filling out the web form on the homepage, or by
sending your response (to one or more of the questions) in an email message to:  
<a href="mailto:teacherleadership@inet.ed.gov">teacherleadership@inet.ed.gov</a>. 
Please include your name, school, city, state &amp;email address at the end of your email message.</p>

<h3>American Academy of Pediatrics Updates Recommendation for Sleeping Position and SIDS </h3>

<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics is updating its recommendation for which sleeping position  reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).  The report, which is expected to be final shortly, will contain the following key points. These are an update from the Academy's previous position: </p>

<ul>
<li>Infants should be placed down for sleep in a position other than on their stomachs:
	<ul>
	<li>Placing infants wholly on their backs, has the lowest risk, and is preferred.
	<li>Placing infants on their sides is a reasonable alternative, and has significantly lower risk than placing infants on their stomachs (or prone).
</ul>
<li>Soft surfaces and gas-trapping objects (i.e. pillows) should not be placed near the infant when s/he is sleeping </p>
<li>This recommendation is for healthy babies.  If your infant has certain medical conditions, as specified by a pediatrician, it may be appropriate for the infant to sleep on their stomach. Talk with your pediatrician about this. </p>
<li>This recommendation is for sleeping infants. When an infant is awake and is being watched, it is okay to put the infant on their stomach.</p>
</ul>
<p>When the report is final, it will be on the Academy's website.   We'll let you know when this happens, and we'll provide a link to it from here. In the meantime, if you have questions regarding which sleeping position is best for your infant, please see your pediatrician.</p>


<hr>

<H3>New Product Announcements</h3>

<ul> <li> For Incontinence Sufferers, New Washable, Reusable Briefs Offer Relief  

<P>Now new washable, reusable briefs that look and feel like regular underwear are improving incontinence suffers' comfort and dignity. These briefs are available for children who may suffer from disabilities, bed-wetting, or who are recovering from medical procedures. The briefs can be washed and reused up to 200 times.  They are available at drug stores nationwide or from WEAREVER Health Care Products, 202 Red Mountain Road, Rougemont, N.C. 27572, (800)307-4968.</P>


<li>New Report Helps Parents Understand Adolescent Girls

<p> For anyone dealing with girls in the difficult middle school years, there is a new report from the American Association of University Women (AAUW Educational Foundation) that offers parents and teachers practical recommendations to help girls succeed in school. The report focuses on middle schools, where girls in particular struggle with painful contradictions in gender roles.  For information on "Girls in the Middle: Working to Succeed in School," call AAUW at 1-800-225-9998, ext. 386  or visit their website at <a href="http://www.aauw.org/">http://www.aauw.org/</a> </p>

</ul>

<h3>Project KidCare -  Nationwide Child Safety Program</h3>

<P>Project KidCare, a national standardized child photo identification program, was created by Polaroid Corporation and the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC).  The program promotes greater child safety awareness and provides law enforcement authorities with a very important tool to help find a missing child -- a high quality photograph. Through Project KidCare events, the program has already issued five million photo IDs to children nationwide.</P>

<P>Major corporate sponsors, including Ford and Home Depot, will host more than 300 Project KidCare ID events in recognition of issuing the five millionth Project KidCare ID on or around October 19th.</P>

<P>Any company, organization or civic group can purchase a Project KidCare event kit from Polaroid and arrange an event in their area. For more information on Project KidCare or to purchase an event kit, contact Polaroid at 1-800-662-8337 (extension 550).</p>

<h3> Interesting Web Sites </h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.add.org/">National Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA) </a>

<P>Here is the new website for the NADDA. Here you'll find many interesting articles on ADD, including:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.add.org/meds/ratey_med.html">John J. Ratey, M.D. discusses ADD medications</a> <br> This page is a good description of various medications used to treat ADD, listed by name and category.
<li> <a href="http://www.add.org/meds/overview.html">Overview of medications</a>
 commonly used in the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder.
<li><a href="http://www.add.org/groups/supt_list.html">Listing of Adult ADD Self-Help and Support Groups </a>
</ul>
<br><br>
 <li><a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)</a>

<p> The NHTSA is responsible for reducing deaths and injuries resulting from motor vehicle  crashes. As part of this responsibility, they oversee issues regarding child safety seats.  When you visit their website, not only can you check on your child's car seat, you can register your car seat and the NHTSA will send your name to the car seat's manufacturer.  In case of a safety recall, the manufacturer can use that information to send recall letters to owners. 
Specifically, look at these pages:
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://www-nsa.nhtsa.dot.gov/rquery.shtml">NHTSA Recalls Query Form - Request Model Year </a> Use this page to see if your car seat has been recalled.
 
<Li><a href="http://www-nsa.nhtsa.dot.gov/cssr_form.html"> Child Safety Seat Registration  </a> Use this page to register your car seat.

<li><a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/airbag2/FAQ's/FAQs.htm"> Frequently Asked Questions about Child Safety in cars </a>.  This is a must read for any caregiver wondering about how to protect a child in an automobile.
</uL>
</p>
<p>You may need to try these pages a few times before you can get in. (It took us 5 tries to get to the car seat page, but it is worth it to check to see if your car seat has been recalled.)
<p>
If you have any questions, or need help with any child safety seat or motor vehicle safety issue, call the U.S. Department of Transportation's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 1-800-424-9393.
Washington D.C. area residents may call 202-366-0123. </p>

<li><a href="http://www.cochran.com/theosite/KSites.html">Berit's Best Sites for Children </a>

<P>Here is a good site to visit if you're looking for fun web-sites for your elementary-school kids. Each site has been carefully selected, reviewed and rated.  The topics include Halloween, Creatures,  
Creepy Crawlies, Dinosaurs ,Fish and Ships, Frogs, as well as serious sites including Art Galleries, Astronomy, Environment, Health and Safety, History, Science and Math, World Travel and more.

<H3>Our Favorite Children's Books</H3>
<H4>Stellaluna by Janell Cannon</H4>

<P>Several weeks ago a friend introduced us to a beautiful children's book entitled Stellaluna.   My preschool son fell in love with it immediately and it is now one of his favorites.</P>

<P>This book, ideal for young children, tells how a young bat, separated from her mother, grows up amongst a family of birds.  Not only does she learn how to survive in a very different environment, she learns about the essence of friendship. On the last page, Stellaluna and her bird friends wonder "how can we be so different and feel so much alike?" and at the same time "how can we feel so different and be so much alike?"   The book is filled with beautiful pencil sketches and rich color illustrations that add much to the beautiful story line.  </P>

<P>Stellaluna, published by Harcourt Brace & Company, has a suggested retail price of $15.00.</P>

<hr>

<h3> Interesting Web Sites </h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://128.252.223.239/~ysp/MSN/">MAD Scientist Network</a>

seven years ago in the wild. Fingering old photographs and paging through
her personal journal, Hawn reminisces about her first encounter with a wild
Asian elephant herd. (CC, Stereo) </P>

<li><B>"Sperm Whales: The Real Moby Dick"</B> <br>
Sunday, 10/13 (8-9:00 pm ET)
<P>High-tech science meets the lore of the sea in the modern quest for Moby
Dick. New technologies have resulted in closer study of a sperm whale, in
the process shattering myths and half-truths that have long surrounded the
elusive creature.</P>

The format is rich, and contains everything from safety tips to lists of great web sites to how to find what you're looking for on the web.

<h3>September 26th - Total Eclipse of the Moon</h3>

<blockquote>

<P>On the night of September 26th to 27th, almost everyone in the Americas and Western Europe will have a great view of a total lunar eclipse.   And for most of North America, the eclipse begins early in the evening, so young children can also enjoy this interesting event!  </P>

<P>At the same time, Saturn will be very bright and will be positioned close to the Moon. Jupiter and the Comet Hale-Bopp will also be visible.  With a telescope you'll be able to see this new comet and view the rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. </P>

<P>Many observatories and local astronomy clubs are having special events that evening.  This is a great chance to introduce your child to astronomy and encourage their interest in science!   </P>

They appear todo equally well in bothsubjects in elementary school. Once courses becomeoptional insecondary school, the down hill spiral in enrollment offemalestudents in mathematics and physical science begins, accompaniedbydecreases in achievement and interest. This means that womenareinadequately prepared for most college majors as well as thoseintechnical fields.   </P><P>Technology is becoming an increasinglyimportant factor in thenation's economy, and participation and achievementin science is alsobecoming increasingly important. As a result of thedecline in thebirthrate since 1964, the size and composition of thepopulationentering the workforce has changed. Women will represent 47percent ofthe total workforce and half of those pursuing professionalcareers.Estimates from the U.S. Department of Labor indicate thatwomen,minorities, and immigrants will make up 80 percent of thenetadditions to the labor force between 1987 and 2000 (Oakes, 1990:v).</P><HR><a name="Important"></a><H3>What Does The Research Say?</H3> <P>"Lost Talent," recent publication written by Jeannie Oakes(1990),contains a review of current research on the relationshipbetweeneducational practices and policies and low rates of participationofwomen, minorities, and disabled persons in science-relatedcareers.Oakes has two central messages for her readers: (1) there is muchwedo not understand about the low participation rates of these groups,and(2) what we do know suggests that there are alterable features ofschoolsthat appear to constrain participation. Attainment inscientific fields isgoverned by three factors: (1) opportunities tolearn science (andmathematics), (2) achievement in science (andmathematics), and (3)students' decisions to pursue science (ormathematics-related) careers.Unfortunately, there is littletheoretical research on how these factorswork together or therelative contribution of each factor to participation(1990:26).   </P><HR> <a name="Lost"></a><H3>Where Are Women Lost?</H3>  <P>Gender differences do not appear at the elementary level inscience.In middle school, girls hold more negative attitudes aboutsciencethan do boys, and they report having fewer science experiencesthanboys. Students in grades 7 and 11 were asked, as part of theNationalAssessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), how often they hadtried tofix something electrical, fix something mechanical, or figure outwhatwas wrong with an unhealthy plant or animal. Female students ingrade7 were three times more likely than males to report that theyhadnever  fixed something electrical or mechanical; in grade 11,thedifferences were even greater. Ninety-three percent of 11th grademalesbut only 66 percent of 11th grade females reported having triedto"fix something electrical" at least once. Sex differences werereversedfor the unhealthy plant or animal question, with femalestudentssignificantly more likely than males to have tried todetermine what waswrong with an unhealthy plant (Weiss, 1989:Attitude Graph 11). Experiencesstudents have had are closely linkedto their interests.   </P><P>Insenior high school, relatively equal numbers of boys and girlsenroll inacademic and nonacademic curricula; therefore, similarscience courses areavailable to them. However, girls choose to takethese courses at lowerrates than boys (Oakes, 1990:18). Armstrongfound that motivation to enrolldiffered among males and females. Formales, parental expectations forscientific and technical careers fortheir sons are the motivating forceswhile, for females, their owneducation aspirations provided the drive toenroll. So, women have tobe more self-motivated to choose these courses(Armstrong in Tsuji andZiegler, 1990:l).   </P><P>Studies of junior highschool students have shown that both sexes areunaware of career optionsand the educational requirements involved.If male students take coursesdue to parental pressure, they havestill made the "right" choices. Femalestudents, who need intrinsicreasons, would be less likely to have adequateinformation to guidetheir course-taking. Therefore, educators need tostress the relevanceof mathematics to students' career goals. If this isnot done, highschool girls tend to avoid taking the advanced mathematicsnecessaryfor careers in science and engineering (Tsuji and Ziegler,1990:1).   </P><HR> <a name="Situation"></a><H3>What Can Be Done ToImprove The Situation? </H3>  <P>Intervention programs are needed.Intervention strategies vary. Theymay be designed to appeal to students atone or more levels: cognitive, affective, and ability or achievement.Those at thecognitive level are designed to provide information, toincreaseawareness; while interventions at the affective level may befocusedon increasing self-confidence or relieving anxiety. Those attheability or achievement level are designed to result inincreasedability, leading to improved achievement. Interventions aimedataffective or achievement levels appear to have more impact onbehaviorthan do those aimed at the cognitive level (Tsuji andZiegler,1990:1).   </P><P>When interventions are attempted, a range ofpossibilities for careersshould be included. Careers in medicine, science,and engineeringshould be discussed, but so should careers in skilledtrades andtechnological industries (1990:2).   </P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <aname="Interventions"></a><H3>What Kinds Of Interventions ArePossible?</H3>   <P>Several kinds of intervention programs exist. Theseprograms, as wellas methods for evaluating their effectiveness, arediscussed by Davisand Humphreys in their book, "Evaluating InterventionPrograms,Applications from Women's Programs in Math and Science" (1985).Davisand Humphreys group intervention programs into five types:short-term,audiovisual and printed products, experiential learning,long-term,and teacher education.   </P><P>Short-term programs serve toraise awareness and change attitudes.They may consist of a speakersseries, one-day conferences, orworkshops.   </P><P>Audiovisual andprinted products are used as interventions to raiseawareness, changeattitudes, or increase knowledge. Films, filmstrips,videotapes, books,puzzles, exhibits, videodiscs, and career postersmay be  used to provideinformation about science careers in a concisemanner.</P><P>Experiential learning is used to give participants ahands-onexperience in science or a science-related field.   </P><P>Longterm interventions consist of courses and curricula. They aredesigned toincrease learning as well as to change attitudes.   </P><P>Teachereducation intervention programs may consist of summerinstitutes orinservice programs. Their purpose is to modify teachers'behaviors andimprove their skills so that, ultimately, the learningand attitudes oftheir students are improved  (Davis and Humphreys,1985: 115-121).</P><HR> <a name="Reform"></a><H3>How Do Intervention Programs FitInto The Educational Reform   Movement In Science Education? </H3><P>Persons interested in reforming science education areadvocatingmeasures that Oakes considers beneficial to all students -therefore,such moves should help increase the number of womenconsideringscience-related careers. Reformers advocate the abolition oftrackingbecause track placements in curriculum tend to be fixed andlong-term.Although tracking may be done to accommodate differences instudentability, it exacerbates differences among students bylimitingopportunities to learn. Lower-track science courses may actuallylimitstudents' opportunities to learn the subject because ofrestrictedcontent and diminished outcomes. Reformers are urging thatsciencecurricula focus on personal needs, create career awareness,andinclude the study of science-technology-society in terms ofproblemsand issues found in the community or discussed through themedia.Reformers also advocate that more hands-on activities be usedinscience, preferably in a cooperative learning situation. Girlsbenefitfrom such instructional tactics. If, as some research dataimply,current teaching strategies have led to early gender differencesinattitudes, which then lead to differences in participation,changingteaching methods as well as revising the curriculum should helptodecrease this trend.   </P><P>Klein (1990) has identified 10 "commonground science process goals"addressed in current science education reformreports: enabling all toexperience success in science; making the totalscience curriculummore unified and flexible; establishing requirements andprocedures sothat students will take more mathematics, science andtechnologycourses; making science curricula personally meaningful;ensuring thattests and assessment procedures are unbiased and supportiveofmeaningful science instruction; using heterogeneous andcooperativegroups to promote a high level of participation for allstudents;arranging for meaningful science role models; supportingenrichingscience education opportunities rather than ineffectiveremedialscience education programs; increasing cultural sensitivityininstructional materials and classroom interactions; andincreasingsupport for science achievement from parents, peers and thecommunity(1990:5-11). Such goals, Klein believes, will work toward equityaswell as educational reform.   </P><HR> <aname="Resources"></a><H3>What Are Some Resources For The Identification OfIntervention Programs?</H3>   <P>"Equity and Excellence: CompatibleGoals" (Malcolm, 1984) contains alisting of over 300 interventionprograms. Rather than attempting tosingle out several of these programsfor inclusion here, it ispreferable that ERIC users decide for themselveswhat best suits theirneeds.   </P><P>Most professional science andengineering societies have careerbrochures. Many are targeted at women andminorities. A listing ofsuch brochures may be obtained by writing theOffice of Opportunitiesin Science, AAAS, 1333 H Street, NW, Washington, DC20005.   </P><P>Also there are several national networks of women inscience andengineering.

<P>This issue of NEWS DIGEST focuses on some of the realities parents must face in helping their daughters with disabilities to become more self-reliant and, ultimately, independent. You may ask, "Why a special issue on gender? Are the issues really that different for boys and girls?" The answer is: Yes. While the issues of independence and self-determination obviously apply to sons with disabilities as well as to daughters, the degree to which daughters with a disability are encouraged to strive for an independent life may be critically less. The psychological and feminist literature inform us that these are issues of society in general, with important differences existing in how males and females are socialized, counseled, and educated. These differences have far-reaching implications for how males and females view themselves and what they achieve.</P>

<P>Statistics tell us that females with disabilities are achieving less in terms of employment and socialization into the mainstream of life than men with disabilities, with the vast majority of women living in dependent and comparatively impoverished circumstances. Yet, there are many girls and women with disabilities who flourish and succeed. What are the reasons for their success, when others do not succeed?  How can parents and professionals foster self-confidence and aspirations to employment and independence in young women with disabilities?</P>

<P>Within this NEWS DIGEST you are given a general overview of gender issues and some suggestions for promoting self-sufficiency and independence. But most of all, this NEWS DIGEST is intended to increase awareness. The issue concludes with a bibliography of readings, organizations, and other sources of further information.</P>

<P><B><I>"I try not to think about Sarah having an apartment, being independent."</I></B></P>

<P><B><I>"My daughter is real slow, you know, and she wants to get a job. I know I should encourage her, but I can't sleep nights worrying about what might happen. Someone could easily take advantage of her. What if she were attacked, or worse, raped ? There is so much bad out there. I pray that I will have the courage to do what is best for her."</I></B></P>

<P><I><B>"From the things I've read and the people with disabilities I've talked to, the one thing that stands out is that their parents or teachers expected them to succeed and did not treat them as if they had a disability. I try to do this for my daughter."</B></I></P>

<P><B><I>"The idea of Marsha riding the
bus scares me to death. She's so
small, what if she gets hurt?"</I></B></P>

<P><B><I>"Look, I know what I should do, but the bottom line is that this is my daughter. I don't think I can take the pain of always worrying about her. People are not always kind; she could be rejected, laughed at, or even hurt. She's my responsibility, and I don't take that lightly. I love her too much to ever have her hurt."</I></B></P>

<P><I><B>"My daughter is deaf I don't want her riding the METRO alone. What if she needed help? People wouldn't be able to understand her. They might not even understand that her cry for help was a cry for help!"</B></I></P>

<P>The above are comments by parents of daughters with disabilities. They reflect the very real concerns of parents and the conflicts that all parents have between wanting their children to be independent and also wanting to shield them from possible pain. The urge to protect children is natural and normal. But protection can sometimes work against promoting maturity and self-reliance. All parents, whether their child has a disability or not, need to search for, and hopefully find, that area between too much and too little protection.</P>

<P>We are committed to helping all persons with disabilities eventually live as independently and with as much self-reliance as possible, but we know that independence, particularly for girls, is a troublesome issue. It does not happen overnight. Fostering a person's ability and desire to live independently most begin early and be a part of the daily consciousness of significant caregivers. Therefore, it must begin at home and continue to be fostered at school and by society in general. Becoming aware of the issues related to self-determination, which incorporates independence and self-sufficiency, and the factors that contribute to it, is an essential first step for families and professionals to take.</P>

<a name="Why"></a>
<P><H3>Why is Independence So Important?</H3></P>

<P>Our society was founded upon a belief in personal freedom, meaning that all of us have the right to make our own life choices about education, work, religion, relationships, and so forth. We also believe that a person should be given opportunities to succeed to the extent of his or her abilities and desires. People with disabilities have been long denied the rights of personal freedom and opportunity. Today, through research, education, and exposure to successful people with disabilities, we, as a nation, are realizing that individuals with disabilities have the same rights as the rest of society. They must be allowed to make personal choices. And with opportunities, the proper training and education, and guidance from families and service providers, we are seeing people with disabilities participating in the American dream of independence, personal fulfillment, and achievement. No longer do we hold up the lone achiever, the exceptions; we are beginning to expect it of all people with disabilities. "<B>Remember that persons with disabilities are <I>persons</I> first and disabled individuals secondly.</B> These persons have the same right to self-actualization as any others: at their own rate, in their own way, and by means of their own tools. Only they can suffer their nonbeing or find <I>their</I> 'selves.'" (Buscaglia, 1983, p. 18)</P>

<P>For boys and girls alike, developing independence is a natural rite of passage from youth to adulthood (Corbett, Froschl, Bregante,&amp; Levy,1983). Being independent creates positive self-esteem. But independence does not develop in a vacuum. People cannot make reasonable decisions without experience in decision-making, without testing themselves in the world, trying and failing, and trying and succeeding. People do not work if they have had no job training, or become economically self-sufficient if they have been channeled into a job which only minimally uses their capabilities and strengths. People may not aspire without knowing that others with disabilities like their own have aspired and achieved. And perhaps most importantly, individuals with a disability cannot achieve independence if <I>the expectation is that they won't or can't.</I></P>

<P>Independence, however, does not necessarily mean that the individual must perform all tasks alone, without help from another human being. Few of us, in fact, could be called independent according to such a standard. For example, achieving independence may require transportation or basic living support, or other types of assistance and accommodation (Litvak, Zukas, &amp; Heumann, 1987). With proper assistance, however, many people with disabilities are quite capable of supporting themselves, living outside the family home, developing enriching relationships, and becoming proud, productive contributors to society (Rousso,1988). Others might not achieve total independence, but can look after and care for themselves to an extent unthought of ten years ago.</P>

<P>The process of developing a level of independence, the ability to make decisions and manage one's self is life-long, with the foundations laid long before a person reaches adulthood. Thus, as concluded by Buscaglia (1983), the family's role becomes one of encouraging emerging individuality for special children, permitting them to make their own choices, and to exert and express themselves. In order to do this, the family will have to rid themselves of any
preconceived notions of the child's dependence, limited abilities, and inferior family status and allow the child to reveal his or her own needs and abilities (p.117).</P>

<P>The major issues addressed in this NEWS DIGEST are those of boys as well as girls, or men as well as women; however, we don't seem to be as successful in fostering independence and self-reliance in women as in men. Likewise, all the suggestions given would apply to boys as well as girls. For whatever reasons, however, we do not seem to be applying them to girls as frequently as to boys. With opportunities for and protections of the rights of all individuals with disabilities, we must ensure that these rights are extended to all women with disabilities to the same degree as to men. The issue of women and girls with disabilities and their right to self-determination is a complex one. The following statistics under-score the need for families and schools to work together to promote positive outcomes for this nation's women with disabilities.</P>

<P><H3>Some Recent
Research on
Women and Men
With Disabilities</H3></P>

<P>The National Longitudinal Transition Study (Wagner &amp; Shaver, 1989) conducted by SRI international examined several aspects of the employment experiences of young people with disabilities and found that males with disabilities out of school for two years were most likely to work as semiskilled or unskilled laborers (26%) or in service occupations (27%). Women were most commonly employed in service (58%) or clerical jobs (21%). in addition, it was found that being male, older, white, and from a higher socioeconomic background were factors linked to a higher probability of competitive employment. Youth with higher functional abilities, those who had graduated from high school, and those who had participated in occupationally-specific vocational education and in work experience programs in high school also were significantly more likely than others to be employed after high school.</P>

<P>Hazasi and her colleagues (Hazasi, Johnson, Hazasi, Gordon, &amp; Hull, 1989) have summarized some of the major studies that have followed-up special education students after they have left public school. Overall, these studies have found that, in the first year after school, males are more likely than females to be employed, to be employed full-time, and to remain employed full-time during  the next two or three years, when the follow-up stopped. In addition, all of the women students with disabilities were employed in unskilled jobs. These outcomes were the same across different studies, in different areas, with different employment opportunities.</P>

<P>Based on labor force statistics for the 1988 work year, 23% of the working age men with a disability had full-time jobs compared to 13% of working age women with a disability. The income of individuals with disabilities who worked, either full or part time, in the year 1987, showed similar disparities for men and women. The mean income for men with disabilities who worked in 1987 was $12,377, compared with $6,355 for women with disabilities (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1989).</P>

<P>"Not working is perhaps the truest definition of what it means to be disabled," report Harris and Associates (1986, p. 4), following their survey of disabled Americans. Over 64% of all men with disabilities were totally out of the labor force in 1988; this compares to almost 73% of all women with disabilities (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1989). Harris and Associates (1986) also report that the majority of those with disabilities and out of the labor force depend on either government benefits or insurance payments for their support, and 40% receive no benefits of any kind. The latter are mostly women who must depend on someone else for their support. Since a desirable outcome of the education experience is paid employment, these and other statistics on the employment of those with disabilities are very troubling.</P>

<H3>What Is Meant By Academic Creativity?</H3>

<P>Academic creativity is a way of thinking about, learning, and
producing information in school subjects such as science, mathematics,
and history. Few experts agree on a precise definition, but when we
say the word, everyone senses a similar feeling. When we are creative,
we are aware of its special excitement.</P>

<P>Creative thinking and learning involve such abilities as evaluation
(especially the ability to sense problems, inconsistencies, and
missing elements); divergent production (e.g., fluency, flexibility,
originality, and elaboration); and redefinition. Creative learning is
a natural, healthy human process that occurs when people become
curious and excited. In contrast, learning by authority requires
students to use thinking skills such as recognition, memory, and
logical reasoning--the abilities most frequently assessed by
traditional tests of intelligence and scholastic aptitude. Children
prefer to learn in creative ways rather than just memorizing
information provided by a teacher or parents. They also learn better
and sometimes faster.</P>

<P>Three questions illustrate the difference between learning information
provided by an adult or textbook and creative learning:</P>
<OL Type=1>
<LI> In what year did Columbus discover America? (The answer, 1492,
requires recognizing and memorizing information.)<BR><BR>

<LI> How are Columbus and an astronaut similar and different? (The
answer requires more than memorization and understanding; it requires
students to think about what they know.)<BR><BR>

<LI> Suppose Columbus had landed in California. How would our lives and
history have been different? (The answer requires many creative
thinking skills including imagining, experimenting, discovering,
elaborating, testing solutions, and communicating discoveries.)<BR><BR>
</OL>

<a name="Creativeyoung"></a>
<H3>Creative Behavior of Young Children</H3>

<P>Young children are naturally curious. They wonder about people and the
world. By the time they enter preschool, they already have a variety
of learning skills acquired through questioning, inquiring, searching,
manipulating, experimenting, and playing. They are content to watch
from a distance at first; however, this does not satisfy their
curiosity. Children need opportunities for a closer look; they need to
touch; they need time for the creative encounter.</P>

<P>We place many restrictions on children's desire to explore the world.
We discourage them by saying "Curiosity killed the cat."  If we were
honest, we would admit that curiosity makes a good cat and that cats
are extremely skilled in testing the limits and determining what is
safe and what is dangerous. Apparently children, as well as cats, have
an irresistible tendency to explore objects, and this very tendency
seems to be the basis for the curiosity and inventiveness of adults.
Even in testing situations, children who do the most manipulating of
objects produce the most ideas and the largest number of original
ideas.</P>

<a name="Creativeschool"></a>
<H3>Creative Behavior of School-Age Children</H3>

<P>Until children reach school age, it is generally assumed that they are
highly creative, with vivid imaginations, and that they learn by
exploring, risking, manipulating, testing, and modifying ideas.
Although teachers and administrators sometimes believe that it is more
economical to learn by authority, research suggests that many things
(although not all) can be learned more effectively and economically in
creative ways rather than by authority (Torrance, 1977).</P>

<H3>What Can Teachers Do?</H3>

<P>Wise teachers can offer a curriculum with plenty of opportunities for
creative behaviors. They can make assignments that call for original
work, independent learning, self-initiated projects, and
experimentation. Using curriculum materials that provide progressive
warm-up experiences, procedures that permit one thing to lead to
another, and activities that make creative thinking both legitimate
and rewarding makes it easier for teachers to provide opportunities
for creative learning.</P>

<P>The following are some things caring adults can do to foster and
nurture creativity:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  We can teach children to appreciate and be pleased with their own
 creative efforts.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  We can be respectful of the unusual questions children ask.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  We can be respectful of children's unusual ideas and solutions, for
	 children will see many relationships that their parents and teachers
	 miss.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  We can show children that their ideas have value by listening to
	 their ideas and considering them. We can encourage children to test
	 their ideas by using them and communicating them to others. We must
	 give them credit for their ideas.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  We can provide opportunities and give credit for self-initiated
	 learning. Overly detailed supervision, too much reliance on prescribed
	 curricula, failure to appraise learning resulting from a child's own
	 initiative, and attempts to cover too much material with no
	 opportunity for reflection interfere seriously with such efforts.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  We can provide chances for children to learn, think, and discover
	 without threats of immediate evaluation. Constant evaluation,
	 especially during practice and initial learning, makes children afraid
	 to use creative ways to learn. We must accept their honest errors as
	 part of the creative process.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  We can establish creative relationships with children--encouraging
	 creativity in the classroom while providing adequate guidance for the
	 students.<BR><BR>

<H3>What Can Parents Do?</H3>

<P>It is natural for young children to learn creatively by dancing,
singing, storytelling, playing make-believe, and so forth. One of the
first challenges to creativity may be formal schooling. By this time
parents, as well as teachers, appreciate conforming behaviors such as
being courteous and obedient, following rules, and being like others.
While these are desirable traits to some extent, they may also destroy
a child's creative potential.</P>

<P>The following are some positive ways parents can foster and nurture
the growth of creativity:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Encourage curiosity, exploration, experimentation, fantasy,
	 questioning, testing, and the development of creative talents.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Provide opportunities for creative expression, creative
	 problem-solving, and constructive response to change and stress.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Prepare children for new experiences, and help develop creative ways
	 of coping with them.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Find ways of changing destructive behavior into constructive,
	 productive behavior rather than relying on punitive methods of
	 control.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  Find creative ways of resolving conflicts between individual family
	 members' needs and the needs of the other family members.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI> Make sure that every member of the family receives individual
	 attention and respect and is given opportunities to make significant,
	 creative contributions to the welfare of the family as a whole.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Use what the school provides imaginatively, and supplement the
	 school's efforts.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  Give the family purpose, commitment, and courage. (Torrance, 1969, p.
	 59)<BR><BR>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How Adults "Kill" Creativity:</H3>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>  Insisting that children do things the "right way."  Teaching a child
	 to think that there is just one right way to do things kills the urge
	 to try new ways.<BR><BR>
 
	<LI>  Pressuring children to be realistic, to stop imagining. When we label
	 a child's flights of fantasy as "silly," we bring the child down to
	 earth with a thud, causing the inventive urge to curl up and die.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Making comparisons with other children. This is a subtle pressure on
	 a child to conform; yet the essence of creativity is freedom to
	 conform or not to conform.<BR><BR>
	 
	<LI>  Discouraging children's curiosity. One of the surest indicators of
	 creativity is curiosity; yet we often brush questions aside because we
	 are too busy for "silly" questions. Children's questions deserve
	 respect.<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+3">W</FONT>hen parents help their children learn to read, they open the
door
to a big, exciting world. As a parent, you can begin an endless
learning chain like this: You read to your children, they develop a
love of stories and poems, they want to read on their own, they
practice reading, and finally, they read for their own information
or pleasure. When children become readers, their world is forever
wider and richer.<P>

Here are some things you can do:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Read aloud to your child: books, newspaper and magazine articles,
the back of the cereal box, labels on cans, or directions.<P>

<LI>Read poems aloud together to learn about rhythm and repeated
sounds in language.<P>

<LI>Point to the words on the page when you read. Move your finger
from left to right.<P>

<LI>Listen to your child read homework or favorite stories to you
every day.<P>

<LI>Go to the library together and check out books. Be sure to ask
the librarian for good books or to help you find what you need.<P>

<LI>Have books, magazines, and papers around the house, and let your
child see that you like to read, too. <P>

<H2><A NAME="foreward">Foreword</A></H2>

     "Why?"<br><br>

     This is the question we parents are always trying to
answer. It's good that children ask questions: that's the best
way to learn. All children have two wonderful resources for
learning--imagination and curiosity. As a parent, you can
awaken your children to the joy of learning by encouraging
their imagination and curiosity.<br><br>

     Helping Your Child Learn to Read is one in a series of
books on different education topics intended to help you make
the most of your child's natural curiosity. Teaching and
learning are not mysteries that can only happen in school. They
also happen when parents and children do simple things
together.<br><br>

     For instance, you and your child can: sort the socks on
laundry day-sorting is a major function in math and science;
cook a meal together-cooking involves not only math and science
but good health as well; tell and read each other
stories--storytelling is the basis for reading and writing (and
a story about the past is also history); or play a game of
hopscotch together playing physical games will help your child
learn to count and start on a road to lifelong fitness.<br><br>

     By doing things together, you will show that learning is
fun and important. You will be encouraging your child to study,
learn, and stay in school.<br><br>

     All of the books in this series tie in with the National
Education Goals set by the President and the Governors, The
goals state that, by the year 2000: every child will start
school ready to learn; at least 90 percent of all students will
graduate from high school; each American student will leave the
4th, 8th, and 12th grades demonstrating competence in core
subjects; U.S. students will be first in the world in math and
science achievement; every American adult will be literate,
will have the skills necessary to compete in a global economy,
and will be able to exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship; and American schools will be liberated from drugs
and violence so they can focus on learning.<br><br>

     This book is a way for you to help meet these goals. It
will give you a short rundown on facts, but the biggest part of
the book is made up of simple, fun activities for you and your
child to do together. Your child may even beg you to do them.
At the end of the book is a list of resources, so you can
continue the fun.<br><br>

     Let's get started. We invite you to find an activity in
this book and try it.<BR><BR>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

     When parents help their children learn to read, they help
open the door to a new world. As a parent, you can begin an
endless learning chain: You read to your children, they develop
a love of stories and poems, they want to read on their own,
they practice reading, and finally they read for their own
information or pleasure. They become readers, and their world
is forever expanded and enriched. <br><br>

     This book focuses primarily on what you can do to help
children up to 10 years of age. During these years you can lay
the foundation for your child to become a lifelong reader. In
the first section, you will find some basic information about
reading to your child. This is followed by suggestions that
guide you to
<ul>
   <li>read with your child and make this all-important time
     together enjoyable;

   <li>stimulate your child's interest in reading and language;
     and

   <li>learn about your child's school reading programs and find
     ways to help.
</ul>
     While most of the book is for parents of children up to 10
years of age, there is a brief section for parents of older
children on how to help them continue to grow as readers.
<br><br>
     Finally, there is a resource section. As you make reading
with your child a routine part of your lives, this section will
help you to find new ideas and a variety of books you both
might like.

<br><br>

     You don't need to be an especially skillful reader
yourself to help your child. In fact, some public libraries
offer adult literacy programs that involve reading to children
as a way to improve literacy skills for the whole family. Nor
do you have to devote great amounts of time to reading with
your child. It's the quality of time that counts. Just be
consistent--give as much time as you can each day to help your
child. The activities suggested are designed to fit into busy
schedules.
<br><br>
     Helping your child become a reader is an adventure you
will not want to miss. The benefits to your child are
immeasurable, and in the process you will find your world
becoming richer as well.<BR><BR>

     There is no more important activity for preparing your
child to succeed as a reader than reading aloud together. Fill
your story times with a variety of books. Be consistent, be
patient, and watch the magic work.

     At just a few months of age, an infant can look at
pictures, listen to your voice, and point to objects on
cardboard pages. Guide your child by pointing to the pictures,
and say the names of the various objects. By drawing attention
to pictures and associating the words with both pictures and
the real-world objects, your child will learn the importance of
language.
<br><br>
     Children learn to love the sound of language before they
even notice the existence of printed words on a  page. Reading
books aloud to children stimulates their imagination and
expands their understanding of the world. It helps them develop
language and listening skills and prepares them to understand
the written word. When the rhythm and melody of language become
a part of a child's life, learning to read will be as natural
as learning to walk and talk.
<br><br>
     Even after children lean to read by themselves, it's still
important for you to read aloud together. By reading stories
that are on their interest level, but beyond their reading
level, you can stretch young readers' understanding and
motivate them to improve their skills.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="advertise">Advertise the Joy of Reading!</A></H3>

     Our goal is to motivate children to want to read so they
will practice reading independently and, thus, become fluent
readers. That happens when children enjoy reading. We parents
can do for reading what fast food chains do for hamburgers...
ADVERTISE! And we advertise by reading great stories and poems
to children.
<br><br>
     We can help our children find the tools they need to
succeed in life. Having access to information through the
printed word is an absolute necessity. Knowledge is power, and
books are full of it. But reading is more than just a practical
tool. Through books we can enrich our minds; we can also relax
and enjoy some precious leisure moments.
<br><br>
     With your help, your children can begin a lifelong
relationship with the printed word, so they grow into adults
who read easily and frequently whether for business, knowledge,
or pleasure.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="remember">Remember When You Were Very Young</A></H3>

     Between the ages of 4 and 7, many children begin to
recognize words on a page. In our society this may begin with
recognition of a logo for a fast food chain or the brand name
of a favorite cereal. But, before long, that special moment
when a child holds a book and starts to decode the mystery of
written words is likely to occur.
<br><br>
     You can help remove part of the mystery without worrying
about a lot of theory. Just read the stories and poems and let
them work their wonders. There is no better way to prepare your
child for that moment when reading starts to "click," even if
it's years down the road.
<br><br>
     It will help, however, if we open our eyes to some things
adult readers tend to take for granted. It's easier to be
patient when we remember how much children do not know. Here
are a few concepts we adults know so well we forget sometimes
we ever learned them.
<ul>
   <li>There's a difference between words and pictures. Point to
     the print as you read aloud.

   <li>Words on a page have meaning, and that is what we learn to
     read.

   <li>Words go across the page from left to right. Follow with
     your finger as you read.

   <li>Words on a page are made up of letters and are separated
     by a space.

   <li>Each letter has at least two forms: one for capital
     letters and one for small letters.
</ul>

     These are examples of hieroglyphics. <br><br>
[Graphic Omitted]<br><br>
     Imagine how you would feel if you were trying to interpret
a book full of such symbols. That's how young readers feel.
But, a little patience (maybe by turning it into a puzzle you
can solve together) is certain to build confidence.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="home">Home Is Where the Heart Is</A></H3>

     It's no secret that activities at home are an important
supplement to the classroom, but there's more to it than that.
There are things that parents can give children at home that
the classrooms cannot give.
<br><br>
     Children who are read to grow to love books. Over the
years, these children will have good memories to treasure. They
remember stories that made them laugh and stories that made
them cry. They remember sharing these times with someone they
love, and they anticipate with joy the time when they will be
able to read for themselves.
<br><br>
     By reading aloud together, by being examples, and by doing
other activities, parents are in a unique position to help
children enjoy reading and see the value of it.<BR><BR>

<H2><A NAME="important">Important Things To Know</A></H2>

     It is important to keep fun in your parent-child reading
and to let joy set the tone and pace. Here is a story to keep
in mind.
<br><br>
     Shamu is a performing whale, to the delight of many.
However, she sometimes gets distracted and refuses to do her
tricks. When that happens, her trainers stand around in
dripping wetsuits and wait for her stubbornness to pass. They
know that when a 5,000-pound whale decides she doesn't want to
flip her tail on cue, there is very little anyone can do about
it. But whales like to play, and sooner or later Shamu returns
to the game of performing for her audience. Shamu's trainers
know this so they're always patient, they're always confident,
and they always make performing fun.

<br><br>
     While helping your child become a reader is certainly
different from training a whale, the same qualities of
patience, confidence, and playfulness in your approach will get
results. If, from time to time, your child gets distracted and
loses interest, take a break. Children love to learn. Give them
a little breathing room, and their interest will always be
renewed.


<H3><A NAME="part">It's Part of Life</A></H3>


     Although the life of a parent is often hectic, you should
try to read with your child at least once a day at a regularly
scheduled time. But don't be discouraged if you skip a day or
don't always keep to your schedule. Just read to your child as
often as you possibly can.
<br><br>
     If you have more than one child, try to spend some time
reading alone with each child, especially if they're more than
2 years apart. However, it's also fine to read to children at
different stages and ages at the same time. Most children enjoy
listening to many types of stories. When stories are complex,
children can still get the idea and can be encouraged to ask
questions. When stories are easy or familiar, youngsters enjoy
these "old friends" and may even help in the reading. Taking
the time to read with your children on a regular basis sends an
important message: Reading is worthwhile.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="one">One More Time</A></H3>

     You may go through a period when your child favors one
book and wants it read night after night. It is not unusual for
children to favor a particular story, and this can be boring
for parents. Keep in mind, however, that a favorite story may
speak to your child's interests or emotional needs. Be patient.
Continue to expose your children to a wealth of books and
eventually they will be ready for more stories.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="talking">Talking about Stories</A></H3>

     It's often a good idea to talk about a story you are
reading, but you need not feel compelled to talk about every
story. Good stories will encourage a love for reading, with or
without conversation. And sometimes children need time to think
about stories they have read. A day or so later, don't be
surprised if your child mentions something from a story you've
read together.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="more">The More the Merrier</A></H3>

     From time to time, invite other adults or older children
to listen in or join in reading aloud. The message is: Reading
is for everybody.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="how">How Do I Use This Book?</A></H3>


     There are two types of activities in this book to help
<ul>
   <li>make reading with your child enjoyable and 

   <li>increase writing, talking, and listening to boost your
     child's love of language.
</ul>
     Most of the activities are for children who range in age
from 3 to 10 years, with a few for babies. The symbols next to
the activities can guide you.

[Graphics below omitted]<br>

Infant up to 2 years<br>
Preschooler (ages 3-5)<br>
Beginning reader (ages 6-7)<br>

Developing reader (ages 8-10)<br><br>


     Enjoyment is essential in the process of helping your
child become a reader. All of the activities are written with
this thought in mind. So, if you and your child don't enjoy one
activity, move on to something else and try it again later.

<H2><A NAME="read">Read Along</A></H2>

     The following is intended to help you become a parent who
is great at reading with your child. You'll find ideas and
activities to enrich this precious time together.<br><br>

     Children become readers when their parents read to them.
It really is as simple as that. And here's the good news: It's
easy to do and it's great fun. With a little practice you will
be making the memories of a lifetime, memories both you and
your child will cherish.<br><br>

     It is best to read to your child early and often. But it's
never too late to begin. Start today. Although the activities
in this section are designed to enhance reading aloud with
preschoolers and beginning readers, a child is never too old to
be read to.<br><br>

     With youngsters, remember that reading is a physical act,
as well as a mental one. It involves hand-eye coordination. So,
when you read, involve your child by
<ul>
   <li>pointing out objects in the pictures;

   <li>following the words with your finger (so your child
     develops a sense that the words go from left to right on
     the page); and

   <li>having your child help turn the pages (to lean that the
     pages turn from fight to left).
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="look">Look for Books</A></H3>

     The main thing is to find books you both love. They will
shape your child's first impression of the world of reading.


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Ask friends, neighbors, and teachers to share the names of
     their favorite books.

  <li>Visit your local public library, and as early as possible,
     get your child a library card. Ask the librarian for help
     in selecting books. (Also see the resources section at the
     end of this book.)

  <li>Look for award-winning books. Each year the American
     Library Association selects children's books for the
     Caldecott Medal for illustration and the Newbery Medal for
     writing.

  <li>Check the book review sections of newspapers and magazines
     for recommended new children's books.

  <li> As soon as they're old enough, have your children join you
     in browsing for books and making selections.

  <li>If you and your child don't enjoy reading a particular
     book, put it aside and pick up another one.
</ol>

     Keep in mind your child's reading level and listening
level are different. When you read easy books, beginning
readers will soon be reading along with you. When you read more
advanced books, you instill a love of stories, and you build
motivation that transforms children into lifelong readers.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H3><A NAME="books">Books and Babies</A></H3>

     Babies love to listen to the human voice. What better way
than through reading!

<H4>What you'll need</H4>

Some baby books (books made of cardboard or cloth with flaps to
     lift and holes to peek through)<BR><BR>

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Start out by singing lullabies and folk songs to your
     baby. At around 6 months, look for books with brightly
     colored, simple pictures and lots of rhythm. (Mother Goose
     is perfect.) At around 9 months, include books that
     feature pictures and names of familiar objects.

  <li>As you read, point out objects in the pictures and make
     sure your baby sees all the things that are fun to do with
     books. (Pat the Bunny by Dorothy Kunhardt is a classic
     touch-and-feel book for babies.)

  <li>Vary the tone of your voice, sing nursery rhymes, bounce
     your knee, make funny faces, do whatever special effects
     you can to stimulate your baby's interest.

  <li>Allow your child to touch and hold cloth and sturdy
     cardboard books.

  <li>When reading to a baby, be brief but read often.
</ol>
     As you read to your baby, your child is forming an
association between books and what is most loved -- your voice
and closeness. Allowing babies to handle books deepens their
attachment even more.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<H3><A NAME="repetition">R and R: Repetition and Rhyme</A></H3>

     Repetition makes books predictable, and young readers love
knowing what comes next.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>

<ul>
<li>Books with repeated phrases*
<li>Short rhyming poems
</ul>
   * A few favorites are: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible.
     No Good , Very Bad Day by Judith Viorst; Brown Bear, Brown
     Bear, What Do You See? by Bill Martin, Jr.; Horton Hatches
     the Egg by Dr. Seuss; and The Little Engine That Could by
     Watty Piper. There are many good booklists that highlight
     those books with repetitive refrains. (See the resources
     section.)


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Pick a story with repeated phrases or a poem you and your
     child like.

  <li>For example, read:
<ul>
     <li>Wolf Voice:       Little pig, little pig,
                       Let me come in.

     <li>Little Pig:       Not by the hair on my
                       chinny-chin-chin.

     <li>Wolf Voice:       Then I'll huff and I'll puff,
                       And I'll blow your house in!
</ul>
     <li>After the wolf has blown down the first pig's house, your
     child will soon join in with the refrain.

  <li>Read slowly, and with a smile or a nod, let your children
     know you appreciate their participation.

  <li>As children grow more familiar with the story, pause and
     give them the chance to "fill in the blanks."

  <li>Encourage your children to pretend to read, especially
     books that contain repetition and rhyme. Most children who
     enjoy reading will eventually memorize all or parts of a
     book and imitate your reading.
</ol>

     When youngsters anticipate what's coming next in a story
or poem, they have a sense of mastery over books. When children
feel power, they have the courage to try. Pretending to read is
an important step in the process of learning to read.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<H3><A NAME="poetry">Poetry in Motion</A></H3>

     When children act out a good poem, they love its rhyme,
rhythm, and the pictures it paints with a few well-chosen
words. They grow as readers by connecting emotion with the
written word.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


Poems that rhyme, tell a story, and are written from a child's
     point of view


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Read a poem slowly to your child, and bring all your
     dramatic talents to the reading. (In other words, ham it
     up.)

  <li>If there is a poem your child is particularly fond of,
     suggest acting out a favorite line. Be sure to award such
     efforts with delighted enthusiasm.

  <li>Then suggest acting out a verse, a stanza, or the entire
     poem. Ask your child to make a face of the way the
     character in the poem is feeling. Remember that facial
     expressions bring emotion into the performer's voice.

  <li>Again, be an enthusiastic audience for your child.
     Applause is always nice.

  <li>If your child is comfortable with the idea, look for a
     larger setting with an attentive, appreciative audience.
     Perhaps an after-dinner "recital" for family members would
     appeal to your child.

  <li>Mistakes are a fact of life, so ignore them.
</ol>

     Poems are often short with lots of white space on the
page. This makes them manageable for new readers and helps to
build their confidence.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<H3><A NAME="readtome">Read to Me</A></H3>

     It's important to read to your children, but equally
important to listen to them read to you. Children thrive on
having someone appreciate their developing skills.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>

Books at your child's reading level

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Listen attentively as your child reads.

  <li>Take turns. You read a paragraph and have your child read
     the next one. As your child becomes more at ease with
     reading aloud, take turns reading a full page. Keep in
     mind that your child may be focusing on how to read, and
     your reading helps to keep the story alive.

  <li>If your children have trouble reading words, you can help
     in several ways.
<ul>
   <li>Tell them to skip over the word, read the rest of the
     sentence, and ask what word would make sense in the story.

   <li>Help them use what they know about letters and sounds.

   <li>Supply the correct word.
</ul>
  <li>Tell children how proud you are of their efforts and
     skills.
</ol>

     Listening to your children read aloud provides
opportunities for you to express appreciation of their new
skills and for them to practice their reading. Most
importantly, it's another way to enjoy reading together.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="family">Family Reading Time</A></H3>

     A quiet time for family members to read on their own may
be the only chance a busy parent gets to read the paper.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>

<ul>
<li>Your own reading materials
<li>Reading materials for your children
</ul>


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Both you and your child should pick out something to read.

  <li>Don't be concerned if your beginning readers pick
     materials that are easier than their school reading books.
     Practice with easy books (and the comics) will improve
     their fluency.

  <li>If you subscribe to a children's magazine, this is a good
     time to get it out. There are many good children's
     magazines, and youngsters often get a special thrill out
     of receiving their own mail.

  <li>Relax and enjoy while you each read your own selections.
</ol>

     A family reading time shows that you like to read. Because
you value reading, your children will too.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<H3><A NAME="story">Story Talk</A></H3>


     Talking about what you read is another way to help
children develop language and thinking skills. You don't need
to plan the talk, discuss every story, or expect an answer.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>

<ul>
<li>Reading materials
</ul>

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ul>
 <li>Read slowly and pause occasionally to think out loud about
     a story. You can speculate: "I wonder what's going to
     happen next!" Or ask a question: "Do you know what a
     palace is?" Or point out: "Look where the little mouse is
     now."

<li>Answer your children's questions, and if you think they
     don't understand something, stop and ask them. Don't worry
     if you break into the flow of a story to make something
     clear.

<li>Read the name of the book's author and illustrator and 
     make sure your children understand what they do.
</ul>

     Talking about stories they read helps children develop
their vocabularies, link stories to everyday life, and use what
they know about the world to make sense out of stories.<BR><BR>
<a href="#read_contents">Back to the <I>Read Along</I> Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<H2><A NAME="writeandtalk">Write and Talk, Too</A></H2>

     While reading with your child is most important, there are
other activities that help to get children ready to read. With
a solid foundation, your child will not only read, but will
read with enthusiasm.
<br><br>
     Learning to read is part of learning language. It's like a
little leaguer learning to hit a baseball. The young hitter must
learn to watch the ball when it is pitched, to step into it,
and to swing the bat to make the hit. It's a single event made
up of three acts. Baseball players learn to do all three at
once.
<br><br>
     The same is true of learning language. When we use
language, we speak words out loud, we read words on paper, and
we write. This section has activities that encourage your child
to
<ul>
  <li>speak

    <li>read

   <li>write

    <li>listen
</ul>


     Begin long before you expect your child actually to read,
and continue long after your child is an independent reader.
<br><br>
     Now, turn the page and start enjoying language.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="tot">Tot Talk</A></H3>

     What's "old hat" to you can be new and exciting to
preschoolers. When you talk about everyday experiences, you
help children connect their world to language and enable them
to go beyond that world to new ideas.



<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
 <li>As you get dinner ready, talk to your child about things
     that are happening. When your 2- or 3-year-old "helps" by 
     taking out all the pots and pans, talk about them. Which
     one is the biggest? Can you find a lid for that one? What
     color is this one?

   <li>When walking down the street and your toddler stops to
     collect leaves, stop and ask questions that require more
     than a "yes" or "no" answer. Which leaves are the same? 
     Which are different? What else grows on trees?

 <li>Ask "what if" questions. What would happen if we didn't
     shovel the snow? What if that butterfly lands on your
     nose?

  <li>Answer your children's endless "why" questions patiently.
     When you say, "I don't know, let's look it up," you show
     how important books are as resources for answering
     questions.

 <li>After your preschooler tells you a story, ask questions so
     you can understand better. That way children learn how to
     tell complete stories and know you are interested in what
     they have to say.

 <li>Expose your children to varied experiences--trips to the
     library, museum, or zoo; walks in the park; or visits with
     friends and relatives. Surround these events with lots of
     comments, questions, and answers.
</ol>

     Talking enables children to expand their vocabulary and
understanding of the world. The ability to carry on a
conversation is important for reading development. Remember, it
is better to talk too much than too little with a small child.<BR><BR>

</ul>

<H4>What to do</H4>

  <li>When you finish, say, "That's your name!"

    <li>Have your child draw a picture.

    <li>When finished, say, "I have an idea! Let's put your name
     on your picture." As you write the letters, say them out
     loud.

    <li>If you have magnetic letters, spell out your child's name
     on the refrigerator door.

   <li>Print your child's name on a card, and put it on the door

  <li>Let your child make lists, too. Help your child form the
     letters and spell the words.

  <li>Look at newspapers and magazines with your child. Find an
     interesting picture and show it to your child as you read
     the caption out loud.

  <li>Create a scrapbook. Cut out pictures of people and places
     and label them.
</ol>

     By exposing your child to words and letters often, your
child will begin to recognize the shapes of letters. The world
of words will become friendly.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="booknotes">Book Notes</A></H3>

     With very little effort, parents can introduce children to
the wide world of books.

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
 <li>Visit the library. Get a library card in your child's name
     and one for yourself if you don't have one. Go to the
     children's section and spend time reading and selecting
     books to take home. Check out books yourself to show your
     child everyone can use and enjoy books and the library. Be
     sure to introduce your child to the librarian and ask
     about special programs the library has for children.

  <li>Start your own home library. Designate a bookcase or shelf
     especially for your child. Encourage your child to arrange
     the books by some method--books about animals, holiday
     books, favorite books.

  <li>Keep an eye out for inexpensive books at flea markets,
     garage sales, used book stores, and discount tables at
     book stores. Many public libraries sell old books once a
     year. You will find some real bargains!

  <li>Make your own books. (See activity further on) Child-made
     books become lasting treasures and part of your home
     library.
</ol>

     When collecting books is an important family activity,
parent send the message that books are important and fun.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="familystories">Family Stories</A></H3>

     Family stories enrich the relationship between parent and
child.


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
 <li>Tell your child stories about your parents and
     grandparents. You might even put these stories in a book
     and add old family photographs.

 <li>Have your child tell you stories about what happened on
     special days, such as holidays, birthdays, and family
     vacations.

  <li>Reminisce about when you were little. Describe things that
     happened at school involving teachers and subjects you
     were studying. Talk about your brothers, sisters, or
     friends.

  <li>Write a trip journal with your child to create a new
     family story. Recording the day's special event and
     pasting the photograph into the journal ties the family
     story to a written record. You can also include everyday
     trips like going to the market or the park.
</ol>

     It helps for children to know that stories come from real
people and are about real events. When children listen to
stories, they hear the voice of the storyteller. This helps
them hear the words when they learn to read aloud or read
silently.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="nowhear">Now Hear This</A></H3>


     Children are great mimics. When you tell stories, your
child will begin to tell stories, too.


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
 <li>Have your child tell stories like those you have told.
     Ask: "And then what happened?" to urge the story along.

 <li>Listen closely when your child speaks. Be enthusiastic and
     responsive.

  <li>If you don't understand some part of the story, take the
     time to get your child to explain. This will help your
     child understand the relationship between a speaker and a
     listener and an author and a reader.

 <li>Encourage your child to express himself or herself. This
     will help your child develop a wide vocabulary. It can
     also help with pronouncing words clearly.
</ol>

     Having a good audience is very helpful for a child to
improve language skills, as well as poise in speaking. Parents
can be the best audience a child will ever have. <BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="ps">P.S. I Love You</A></H3>


     Something important happens when children receive and
write letters. They realize that the printed word has a
purpose.


<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>Paper
<li>Pencil, crayon, or marker
</UL>


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Send your child little notes (by putting them in a pocket
     or lunch box, for example). When your child shows you the
     note, read it out loud with expression. Some children will
     read the notes on their own.

 <li>When your child expresses a feeling or thought that's
     related to a person, have your child write a letter. Have
     your child dictate the words to you if your child doesn't
     write yet.
<br><br>
     For example:
<br><br>
     Dear Grandma,
<br><br>
     I like it when you make ice cream. It's better than the
     kind we buy at the store.
<br><br>
     Your grandson,
<br><br>
     Darryl
<br><br>
     P.S. I love you.

 <li>Ask the people who receive these notes to respond. An oral
     response is fine--a written response is even better.

 <li>Explain the writing process to your child: "We think of
     ideas and put them into words; we put the words on paper;
     people read the words; and people respond."
</ol>

     Language is speaking, listening, reading, and writing.
Each element supports and enriches the other. Sending letters
will help children become writers, and writing will make them
better readers.<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Paper

<LI>Cookbook or recipes
<li>Food supplies
</UL>


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
   <li>Ask children to help you prepare a grocery list.

   <li>Take them to the market and have them find items on the
     list.

   <li>Have them help put away the groceries and encourage them
     to read the labels, box tops, and packages as they store
     them.

  <li>Have them read the ingredients from a recipe.

   <li>Prepare a meal together and let them take needed items
     from shelves and storage areas.

  <li>Talk about the steps in preparing a meal--first, second,
     and so on.

  <li>Praise the efforts of your early reader and encourage
     other family members to do the same.
</ol>

     The purpose of reading is to get meaning from the page. By
using reading skills to prepare a meal, children see positive
results from reading.<BR><BR>

<H4>What you'll need</H4>


<UL>
<LI>Pencils, crayons, or markers
<LI>Paper or notebook
<li>Chalkboard
</UL>

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
   <li>Ask your preschooler to dictate a story to you.
     It could include descriptions of your outings and
     activities, along with mementos such as fall leaves,
     birthday cards, and photographs. Older children can do
     these activities on their own.

  <li>Use a chalkboard or a family message board as an exciting
     way to involve children in writing with a purpose.

  <li>Keep supplies of paper, pencils, markers, and the like
     within easy reach.

   <li>Encourage beginning and developing writers to keep
     journals and write stories. Ask questions that will help
     children organize the stories, and respond to their
     questions about letters and spelling. Suggest they share
     the activity with a smaller brother, sister, or friend.

   <li>Respond to the content of children's writing, and don't be
     overly concerned with misspellings. Over time you can help
     your child concentrate on learning to spell correctly.
</ol>

     When the children begin to write, they run the risk
criticism, and it takes courage to continue. Our job as parents
is to help children find the courage. This we can do by
expressing our appreciation of their efforts.<BR><BR>

<H3><A NAME="tv">TV</A></H3>

     Television can be a great tool for education too. The keys
are setting limits, making good choices, taking time to watch
together, discussing what you view, and encouraging follow-up
reading.


<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
  <li>Limit your child's television viewing time and make your
     rules and reasons clear. Involve your child in choosing
     which programs to watch. Read the TV schedule together to
     choose.

  <li>Monitor what your child is watching, and whenever
     possible, watch the programs with your child.

  <li>When you watch shows with your child, discuss what you
     have seen so your child can better understand the
     programs.

  <li>Look for programs that will stimulate your child's
     interests and encourage reading (such as dramatizations of
     children's literature and programs on wildlife, natural
     history, and science).

</ol>
     Many experts recommend that children watch no more than 10
hours of television each week. Limiting television viewing
frees up time for reading and writing activities.
<br><br>
     It is worth noting that captioned television shows can be
especially helpful with children who are deaf or
hard-of-hearing, studying English as a second language, or
having difficulty learning to read.<BR><BR>

<LI>Construction paper
<LI>Yarn or ribbon
<LI>Heavy paper or cardboard

<H4>What to do</H4>

<ol>
   <li>Paste pages of your child's writings onto pieces of
     construction paper.

 <li>Discuss the order the writings should go in. Should all
     the writings about animals go in one section and the
     writings about holidays in another? Which writings are the
     most important and where should they be placed in the
     book?

  <li>Number the pages.

   <li>Make a table of contents.

   <li>Make covers for the book with heavy paper or cardboard.
     You might want to paste colorful cloth or wrapping paper
     onto the covers.

   <li>Punch holes in the pages and the covers.

   <li>Bind the book together by lacing the yarn or ribbon
     through the holes. Make knots in the loose ends or tie
     them in a bow, so that the yarn or ribbon won't slip out.

   <li>Add pages to this book as more writings are completed or

<H2><A NAME="parents">Parents and the Schools</A></H2>


     Success in school depends, in large part, on your child's
ability to read, and your role in helping your child become a
reader extends into the classroom. The kind of support you
provide will, of course, change as your child grows older.
Your involvement and monitoring your child's progress in school
can help your child become a better reader.
<br><br>
     Involvement in school programs can take many forms, from
attending PTA meetings to volunteering in school activities.
Through action, not just words, you demonstrate to your child
that school is important.
<br><br>
     In monitoring your child's progress in learning to read,
you need to look at both the programs offered at school and
your child's performance. Below is a checklist for different
levels of schooling. There is much more information available
to help you evaluate school reading programs. (See the
Resources section, "For Parents.")


<H3>Kindergarten</H3>

<ul>
   <li>Do teachers frequently read aloud?

   <li>Are favorite stories read over and over again and is
     "pretend" reading encouraged?

   <li>Are there story discussions with opportunities for
     children to talk and listen?

  <li>Are there good materials available for children to read
     and have read to them?

   <li>Do teachers discuss with children the different purposes
     of reading?

   <li>Do children have opportunities to write? Do they compose
     messages to other people?
</ul>

<H3>Beginning Reading Programs</H3>


     When children start school, they receive their first
formal instruction in reading. At this stage, they learn to
identify words--by translating groups of letters into spoken
words.
<ul>
  <li>Does the program include teaching the relationship between
     letters and sounds (phonics)?

   <li>Are children reading stories that encourage them to
     practice what they are learning?

  <li>Are children's reading materials interesting? Do they
     accommodate a child's limited reading vocabulary and the
     need to practice word identification with exciting
     stories?

   <li>Are teachers still reading stories aloud to children and
     including good children's literature?
</ul>

<H3>Developmental Reading Programs</H3>

<ul>
   <li>Do reading and writing activities occur in every classroom
     and in every subject studied? As you walk through the
     school, do you see displays of children's writing on
     bulletin boards?

   <li>Are teachers providing direct instruction--teaching
     strategies that help students become better readers?

   <li>Are there plenty of opportunities for children to practice
     reading? (For third and fourth graders, this should
     include at least two hours a week of independent reading
     in school.)

  <li>Are there well-stocked school or classroom libraries?
     (Schools may enrich their collections by borrowing from a
     local public library.)

   <li>Are children encouraged to write meaningfully about what
     they read? It is not enough to fill in the blanks on
     worksheets; the point is to have children think about what
     they read, relate it to what they already know, and
     communicate these thoughts to others.
</ul>

<H3>Evaluating Your Child's Progress</H3>


     It is important to monitor your child's progress through
reports from the teacher. Also, it is important to attend
school open houses or similar events where teachers are
available to explain the program and discuss children's
progress with their parents.
<br><br>
     If you think your child should be doing better, consider
meeting privately with the teacher. In most cases, the teacher
and principal will be able to shed light on your child's
progress and what you might do to help. Your school system may
have access to special resources such as a reading specialist
and guidance counselor or to materials to address your child's
needs.
<br><br>
     You may want additional help for your child. A good
starting point is the nearest college or university. Most have
reading tutorial services that are available on a sliding-fee
scale. If not, there may be faculty or graduate students
interested in tutoring. Then monitor your child's progress the
same way you would his progress in school. If you do not see a
difference in performance in 6 to 8 weeks, discuss the program
with your child's tutor. Can the tutor explain the goals of the
program and document your child's progress? If not, you may
wish to consider another course of action.
<br><br>
     Some children struggle with reading problems where the
cause is readily identifiable. Some of the more widely
recognized causes of reading problems are vision and hearing
impairments and poor speech and language development.
But there are other schoolchildren who have problems reading
because of a learning disability. Whatever the cause or nature
of a child's reading problem, the earlier the difficulty is
discovered and additional help provided, the better the child's
chances are of becoming a successful reader. (See the Resources
section, "For Parents.")
<br><br>
     The good news is that no matter how long it takes, with
few exceptions, children can learn to read. One of the most
important roles you can play in relation to your children's
schoolwork is that of cheerleader. Applaud their efforts and
their successes. Help them have the courage to keep trying.<BR><BR>

<H2><A NAME="postscript">A Postscript about Older Children</A></H2>


     You can't put a teenager on your lap and read stories
every night. But you can still help older children become
enthusiastic and fluent readers by adapting many of the same
principles that work with the little ones. It is especially
important to continue the following efforts:

<ul>
   <li>Encourage reading for the fun of it and as a free-time
     activity.

   <li>Create an environment rich with books.

   <li>Talk and listen to your children. Language is like a
     four-legged stool: Speaking, listening, reading, and
     writing are its parts, and each supports the other.

   <li>Read with your children every chance you get--even if it's
     just part of a newspaper article at the breakfast table.

   <li>Encourage children to write by responding to the ideas
     they try to communicate in writing.

   <li>Set the example--put a book in your hands and be sure your
     children know you read for enjoyment and to get needed
     information.

   <li>Monitor your children's schoolwork and applaud their
     efforts.<BR><BR>

     What follows is a sampling from the wealth of children's
literature available.

     Listed by age groups are three kinds of children's
materials.
<ul>
  <li>Books that relate to real-life events

   <li>Poems

   <li>Magazines

     There are many other excellent lists of children's books.
For more information, see the next section, "Resources for
Parents."


<H3>Children's Books and Real-Life Events</H3>


     One sure way to get children to love to read is to make
connections between books and what happens in their lives. If
the book relates to what happened in real life and children see
themselves in it, both the story and the event take on greater
meaning. There are numerous books that deal with almost any
event in a child's life. We present here a few illustrative
topics to show the relation between books and life. Topics
chosen include celebrating family occasions; the very personal
experience of a loose tooth; a new baby; and knowing more about
explorations in outer space.

	An old Chinese proverb says, "A book is like a garden in the 
pocket."  Many of us who have valued reading in our early years derive 
enjoyment from reading to our children, and now, as I do, to our 
grandchildren.  Books are voyages of discovery and transforming 
instruments to all of us.
<br>
    A few years ago, the National Endowment for the Humanities asked 
schools around the country to send reading lists of their favorite 
books.  Noticing how often books that other generations have enjoyed 
appear on these lists, we decided to make this compilation of tried-and-
true titles.  The works herein, published in 1960 or earlier, have 
delighted generations of readers.  Some have asked, "Is the book dead?" as we move into new computer 
technologies.  Not at all.  Print text will co-exist with these new 
mediums.  

<br><br>
	As concerned parents, educators, and counselors, we must continue to 
emphasize the importance of access to good reading in order to shape our 
students' learning process, enhance their understanding of American 
heritage, and open up a new world of self-fulfillment.  As Aldous Huxley 
said, "The proper study of mankind is books."
<br><br>
	There are some excellent older books that are missing from the list, 
because they appeared too infrequently in the school selections:  Kate 
Douglas Wiggin's Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, for example; Dylan Thomas's 
A Child's Christmas in Wales; Frederick Douglass's Narrative of the Life 
of Frederick Douglass.  Despite the absences, we hope this compilation 
will nevertheless bring hours of pleasure and enlightenment.
<br><br>
	The titles presented for suggested extracurricular reading provide a 
solid foundation and hours of enjoyment for students and scholars of all 
ages.<br><br>
	We at NEH hope that the "Timeless Classics" booklist will continue 
to be a rich source of material for everyone.

The National Endowment for the Humanities solicited 
supplemental reading lists from public and private schools in 
every state.  Many of the schools had been chosen by the U.S. 
Department of Education as exemplary schools; others were 
known to have strong humanities programs.  Sixty of the 
extracurricular lists that NEH received were used to compile 
this list.  The list includes all titles published in 1960 or 
before that appeared on at least five of those reading lists. 
 The only exception is in the early grades:  Because many 
schools did not submit suggested readings for these grades, 
some titles that were mentioned fewer than five times have 
been added to the K-3 category.
<br> <br>

Overview.  Write to NEH, Room 402, Washington, D.C.  20506.<BR><BR>

That blast of energy can severely hurt orkill passengers and drivers who are too close to the air bag.  An infant's head in arear-facing safety seat is directly in front of the air bag as it breaks through thedashboard and instantly inflates.  Even some forward facing child safety seats could possiblyplace the child within range of  the air bag before it is fully inflated.  Also, if a childis unbelted, or too small for the lap and shoulder belt to fit properly, or wriggling aroundor leaning forward, there is a danger that the child will be too close to the dashboardduring that instant that the air bag begins to inflate.<hr><H3>Importance Of Safety Belts</H3><P><B>Question: </B>How can an air bag work so well for adults, but hurt children in the frontpassenger seat?<P><B>Answer: </B>An average size adult who is correctly belted is not likely to come incontact with the air bag until it is fully inflated. A fully inflated air bag spreads theforces of the crash across a wide area of the body.  Even an unbelted adult will probablycome in contact with the air bag at the chest area after the bag has at least partiallyinflated.  For greatest protection, both the driver and front passengers should be buckledup and the seats moved back as far as practical to allow ample space for the air bag toexpand.<p>Unbelted or improperly belted children can easily slide off the seat during pre-crashbraking, throwing them against the dashboard where the air bag can strike them on the heador neck with tremendous force before it is fully inflated.<p>The air bag only inflates in front end crashes and collapses immediately. For protectionin all types of collisions -- multiple, rollover, rear end, side and front end -- it isvery important to always use both lap and shoulder belts.<hr><H3>The Back Seat Is The Safest Seat</H3><P><B>Question: </B>Why are children safer in the back seat?</P><P><B>Answer: </B>The rear seat is the safest seat for any passenger. Head-on crashes causethe greatest number of serious injuries.  A person sitting in the back seat is farthestaway from the impact and less likely to be injured.  People sitting in the rear have thesoft back of the front seat in front of them, instead of hard surfaces like the windshield,mirror or dashboard.<p>If it is absolutely necessary for a child age 12 or under to ride in the front seat of acar with a passenger side air bag, secure the child in a restraint system that is correctfor the size of the child -- a front-facing child safety seat, a booster seat, or alap/shoulder belt -- AND move the front seat as far back away from the dashboard aspossible.<p>If the vehicle has no back seat, such as a pickup truck, an infant will be safe in arear-facing child seat only if the vehicle does not have a passenger side air bag or if ithas a cutoff switch for the passenger side air bag.<p>In summary, people riding in the front seat who are most likely to be injured or killedby an inflating air bag are:<UL><p><LI> infants riding in rear-facing car seats;<p><LI> children age 12 and under who are not properly secured in arestraint system that is appropriate for their size -- a forward facing safety seat,booster seat, or correct fitting lap and shoulder belt;<p><LI> children or adults who are not buckled up;<p><LI> children or adults who place the shoulder belt either behind theirback or under their arm; and<p><LI> persons sitting too close to the steering wheel or dashboard sothat they come into contact with the air bag before it is fully inflated. </UL><hr><H3>Being Smothered By an Air Bag is a Myth </H3><P><B>Question: </B>Is it true that a passenger can be smothered by an airbag?</P><P><B>Answer: </B>No! The injuries that occur are caused by the inflatingbag hitting the head and neck of an out-of-position passenger or the inflatingbag hitting the back of an infant seat behind a baby's head. The air bagloses its air right after it inflates, so the stiff fabric does not remainover the passenger's face. </P><hr><H3>Turning an Infant Seat Around</H3><P><B>Question:</B> When parents learn that an air bag can harm a baby ina rear-facing infant seat, many of them want to place the baby facing forward.Is this okay?</P><P><B>Answer:</B> No! Infants must always ride facing the rear in the backseat.</P><P>Both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) warn that babies should ride facingthe back until they are at least one year old and weigh at least 20 pounds.A child under age one does not have strong neck muscles; the head wouldsnap forward in a crash if the baby were facing forward. This could causeserious neck and spinal cord injury.</P><P>When the child is facing the back, the force of the crash is spread acrossthe whole body. The child seat harness must be snug, and the seat shouldbe at a 45-degree angle to support the baby's head and maintain an openairway. Some safety seats have an indicator on the side to show the correctangle. A child seat that installs in a position that is too upright canbe angled properly by using a firmly rolled sheet or towel under the footof the seat.</P><hr><H3>Need to Be Able to See Baby While Driving</H3><P><B>Question: </B>Many parents don't want to put their infants in theback seat because they cannot see them. Shouldn't a parent keep an eye onthe baby to make sure it is not choking or<BR>experiencing some other health problem?</P><P><B>Answer: </B>The risk of a serious injury in a crash is much greaterthan the risk of a healthy baby having a life-threatening problem duringa car ride. A healthy baby correctly buckled in a rear-facing child seatshould be as safe as a child placed in a crib for a nap or an overnightsleep. Parents do not stay in the room to watch a sleeping baby.</P><P>Drivers traveling with children should always allow plenty of time topull off the road if they are concerned about the baby or need to tend tothe child's needs.</P><hr><H3>Using Only the Lap Portion of a Lap/Shoulder BeltSystem</H3><P><B>Question:</B> If a child is too small to wear a shoulder belt correctly,will the lap belt protect the child from an air bag?</P><P><B>Answer:</B> No. If a child uses only the lap portion of a safety belt,his or her upper body will be thrown forward when the driver brakes or duringthe crash itself. The inflating bag will strike the child's head and neckvery hard.</P><P>Whether in the front seat or rear seat, children can suffer serious orfatal injuries if they wear a shoulder belt wrong, such as under the armor behind the back. A child who is too short for the shoulder belt (forexample, the belt cuts across the neck or face) should always use a convertibleor toddler safety seat (if the child is under 40 pounds and 40 inches) ora belt-positioning booster seat (if the child is over 40 pounds and 40 inches).Remember that a belt-positioning booster seat must be used with both thelap and shoulder belts, preferably in the rear seat, which is always saferthan the front seat.</P><hr><H3>Identifying Vehicles with Air Bags</H3><P><B>Question: </B>How can a driver or passenger tell whether a vehiclehas an air bag?</P><P><B>Answer:</B> Vehicles with air bags have one or more of the followingmarkings: </P><UL>  <LI>the words &quot;Air Bag&quot; or the letters &quot;SRS&quot; (Supplemental  Restraint System) or &quot;SIR&quot; (Supplemental Inflatable Restraint)  on the steering wheel and dashboard panel.</LI>  <LI>a warning label on the sun visors or on the sides of the open door  frame.</LI>  <LI>a warning in the vehicle owner's manual.</LI></UL><P>Consult the owner's manual to find information about carrying childrensafely in a vehicle equipped with an air bag.<hr><a name="credits"></a><h3>Credits</h3><P>This FAQ courtesy of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration </P><P> Consumers who have questions or concerns about air bags should contact theagency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 800-424-9393.

<P>	Never leave your child unattended. Never leave a child alone in a car. Remember, someone with experience can break into your car in less than thirty seconds.</P>

<P>	Listen when your child tells you he or she does not want to be with someone. Direct questioning may reveal something you should know about.</P>

<P>	Be involved in your child's activities. Know your child's friends.</P>

<P>	Pay attention when someone shows greater than normal interest in your child. Find out why. Be doubly cautious in this situation. Don't allow opportunities for that adult to have your child alone.</P>

<P>	Be sensitive to changes in your child's behavior or attitudes. Be especially alert for any talk betraying premature sexual understanding. Never belittle any fear or concern on the part of your children.</P>

<P>Avoid communicating hysteria or excessive fear for their safety.</P>

<P>	Be prepared to describe your children accurately; including clothing, visible identifying marks or special characteristics. Think of those items now and write them down. It may be more difficult to concentrate in a time of extreme stress.</P>

<P>	Develop a set procedure should you and your child become separated while away from home. (Example, both may call a trusted friend and leave an address and telephone number to call back. Then wait at the phone until reunited.)</P>

<P>	Do not buy items which visibly display your child's name. It could give an abductor the advantage of seeming to know your child. ("Hey, Billy, your Mom's been in an accident. We need to rush to the hospital. Jump in the car!")</P>

<P>	Take a photograph of your child each year (4 times each year if under age 2). Have several copies on hand in case your child turns up missing</P>

<P>	Be sure your child's school or day care center will not release him or her to anyone other than you or someone you officially designate.</P>

<P>	Instruct the school to contact you immediately if your child is absent, or if someone other than you arrives to pick up him or her without advance notice from you.</P>

<P>	Take a moment to determine whether or not your child is able to accomplish the following items.</P>

<ol>

<li>Recite his or her full name, address and telephone number including area code, city and state?

<br><br><li>Use a phone to make long distance call, dial direct or get operator assistance?

<br><br><li>Does your child know to never enter anyone's home without your permission?

<br><br><li>Knows of any certain home where they are not to enter under any circumstances?

<br><br><li>If separated from you in a store, would your child go to the nearest check-out clerk?

<br><br><li>Could he or she verify that the person is in fact an employee of the store?

<br><br><li>Would he or she go into the parking lot either alone or if encouraged by an adult?

<br><br><li>Knows always to play with others - to go places on the "buddy-system?"

<br><br><li>Knows that adults seldom ask for directions from children and that if approached by a car, they should never go near or get in an automobile with a stranger?

<br><br><li>Does your child know not to accept rides from a stranger or even acquaintances without your specific permission?

<br><br><li>If home alone, knows not to answer the door or tell anyone over the phone that they are alone?

<br><br><li>If followed by an adult or stranger, would your child know to proceed immediately to a place where there are other people; e.g., a store or a neighbor's house?

<br><br><li>Would your child yell "No" and create a scene in public if they were being subjected to bad touches?

<br><br><li>Do you and your child have a code word to exchange if your plans changes?

<br><br><li>Does your child know never to talk or accept gifts of any kind from strangers?

</ol>

<P>	Every "NO" answer indicates an area of risk for your child. It is probably a good idea to ask your child these questions in a modified form as an added precaution.</P>

<p>Children in the United States watch an average of 3 to 5 hours of
television every day.  Parents and teachers are concerned about the possible
effects of excessive television viewing on children. </p>

<p>There is reason for such concern.  Studies show that extensive television
viewing may be associated with violent or overly aggressive behavior, poor
academic performance, precocious sexuality, obesity, and the use of drugs or
alcohol.</p>

<h3>How Can Excessive Television Viewing Affect Children's Learning And
School Performance?</h3>

<p>Research on the effects of television viewing on children reveals a
number of possible problems.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="affects"></a>
<h3>TV Affects Social And Emotional Behavior</h3>

<p>Studies on television viewing reveal that the amount of violence on
television is increasing.  Viewing violent programs can make children
afraid, worried, or suspicious and may increase tendencies toward aggressive
behavior.  Parents should keep in mind that television often portrays sexual
behavior and the use of alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs in inviting terms.</p>

<a name="language"></a>
<h3>TV Affects Creativity And Language Skills</h3>

<p>Children who spend a great deal of time watching television have less
time for playing, reading, doing homework, and talking with other children
and adults.  Language skills are best fostered through reading and active
two-way participation in conversations and play activities.  Excessive TV
watching can interfere with growth in these areas.</p>

<a name="school"></a>
<h3>TV Affects School Achievement</h3>

<p>Research has found that the amount of time a child spends on  
homework is significantly related to how well he or she does in school.
Since television viewing can interfere with the completion of homework
assignments and reduce the amount of sleep a child gets, excessive viewing
could affect your child's grades and alertness in school. </p>

<h3>How Can Parents Guide Their Children's Television Viewing?</h3>

<p>Television viewing can have positive effects, if parents and
teachers:</p>
<UL>
<li>Set Limits.  Know how many hours of television your children
watch.  Limit your children's viewing to 1 to 2 hours a day. 
    Watching television is often more habit than choice.  Establish
    good viewing habits for your children.  Suggest and participate
    with your children in alternative activities such as reading,
sports, conversation, games, and hobbies.  Because children
model their behavior after their parents, consider your own
    viewing habits and set a good example.  Eliminate some television
viewing by setting a few basic rules, such as no television during
meals or before completing household tasks or homework. <br><br>

<li>Plan.  Encourage your children to plan their viewing by using a
    TV Guide or newspaper listing rather than flipping channels.
Help the children decide which show to see and encourage them to
    watch a variety of programs appropriate for their level of
    understanding.  The television should be turned on only for 
    specific programs; it should be turned off when they are over.  <br><br>

<li>Participate.  Know what your children watch on television.  Watch
with them and talk about the programs afterward.  Explain
situations that are confusing.  Ask why any violent scenes
occurred and how painful they were.  Ask your children for ideas
    about ways the conflict could have been resolved without violence. <br><br>

<li>Monitor.  Encourage children to watch programs about characters
who cooperate and care for each other.  Such programs can influence
children in positive ways by modeling desirable behavior and
setting good examples.<br><br>

<li>Analyze Commercials.  Children need your help to critically
    evaluate the validity of the many products advertised on
television.  Teach children to analyze commercials and recognize
    exaggerated claims.  Point out that the makers of the products
    pay for advertising.<br><br>

<li>Express Your Views.  Call your local television station when you
    are offended or pleased by something on television.  Stations,
    networks, and sponsors are all concerned about the effects of
    television viewing on children and are responsive to parents'
    concerns.<br><br>

<H3>When Buying Toys</H3>

<P>     Choosing toys with care.  Keep in mind the child's age,
interests and skill level.</P>

<P>     Look for quality design and construction in all toys for all
ages.</P>

<P>     Make sure that all directions or instructions are clear --
to you, and, when appropriate, to the child.  Plastic wrappings
on toys should be discarded at once before they become deadly
playthings.</P>

<P>     Be a label reader.  Look for and heed age recommendations,
such as "Not recommended for children under three".  Look for
other safety labels including:  "Flame retardant/Flame resistant"
on fabric products and "Washable/hygienic materials" on stuffed
toys and dolls.</P>

<H3>When Maintaining Toys</H3>

<P>     Check all toys periodically for breakage and potential
hazards.  A damaged or dangerous toy should be thrown away or
repaired immediately.</P>

<P>     Edges on wooden toys that might have become sharp or
surfaces covered with splinters should be sanded smooth.  When
repainting toys and toy boxes, avoid using leftover paint, unless
purchased recently, since older paints may contain more lead than
new paint, which is regulated by CPSC.  Examine all outdoor toys
regularly for rust or weak parts that could become hazardous.</P>

<H3>When Storing Toys</H3>

<P>     Teach children to put their toys safely away on shelves or
in a toy chest after playing to prevent trips and falls.</P>

<P>     Toy boxes, too, should be checked for safety.  Use a toy
chest that has a lid that will stay open in any position to which
it is raised, and will not fall unexpectedly on a child.  For
extra safety, be sure there are ventilation holes for fresh air. 
Watch for sharp edges that could cut and hinges that could pinch
or squeeze.  See that toys used outdoors are stored after play --
rain or dew can rust or damage a variety of toys and toy parts
creating hazards.</P>

<H3>Sharp Edges</H3>

<P>     New toys intended for children under eight years of age
should, by regulation, be free of sharp glass and metal edges. </P>

<P>With use, however, older toys may break, exposing cutting edges.</P>

<H3>Small Parts</H3>

<P>     Older toys can break to reveal parts small enough to be
swallowed or to become lodged in a child's windpipe, ears or
nose.  The law bans small parts in new toys intended for children
under three.  This includes removable small eyes and noses on
stuffed toys and dolls, and small, removable squeakers on squeeze
toys.</P>

<H3>Loud Noises</H3>

<P>     Toy caps and some noisemaking guns and other toys can
produce sounds at noise levels that can damage hearing.  The law
requires the following label on boxes of caps producing noise
above a certain level: "WARNING -- Do not fire closer than one
foot to the ear.  Do not use indoors."  Caps producing noise hat
can injure a child's hearing are banned.</P>

<H3>Cords And Strings</H3>

<P>     Toys with long strings or cords may be dangerous for infants
and very young children.  The cords may become wrapped around an
infant's neck, causing strangulation.  Never hang toys with long
strings, cords, loops, or ribbons in cribs or playpens where
children can become entangled.  Remove crib gyms for the crib
when the child can pull up on hands and knees; some children have
strangled when they fell across crib gyms stretched across the
crib.</P>

<H3>Sharp Points</H3>

<P>     Toys which have been broken may have dangerous points or
prongs.  Stuffed toys may have wires inside the toy which could
cut or stab if exposed.  A CPSC regulation prohibits sharp points
in new toys and other articles intended for use by children under
eight years of age.</P>

<H3>Propelled Objects</H3>

<P>     Projectiles -- guided missiles and similar flying toys --
can be turned into weapons and can injure eyes in particular. 
Children should never be permitted to play with adult lawn darts
or other hobby or sporting equipment that have sharp points. 
Arrows or darts used by children should have soft cork tips,
rubber suction cups or other protective tips intended to prevent
injury.  Check to be sure the tips are secure.  Avoid those dart
guns or other toys which might be capable of firing articles not
intended for use in the toy, such as pencils or nails.</P>

<H3>All Toys Are Not For All Children</H3>

<P>     Keep toys designed for older children out of the hands of
little ones.  Follow labels that give age recommendations -- some
toys are recommended for older children because they may be
hazardous in the hands of a younger child.  Teach older children
to help keep their toys away from younger brothers and sisters.</P>

<P>     Even balloons, when uninflated or broken, can choke or
suffocate if young children try to swallow them.  More children
have suffocated on uninflated balloons and pieces of broken
balloons than on any other type of toy.</P>

<H3>Electric Toys</H3>

<P>     Electric toys that are improperly constructed, wired or
misused can shock or burn.  Electric toys must meet mandatory
requirements for maximum surface temperatures, electrical
construction and prominent warning labels.  Electric toys with
heating elements are recommended only for children over eight
years old.  Children should be taught to use electric toys
properly, cautiously and under adult supervision.</P>

<H3>Infant Toys</H3>

<P>     Infant toys, such as rattles, squeeze toys, and teethers,
should be large enough so that they cannot enter and become
lodged in an infant's throat.</P>

<H3>Our Responsibility</H3>

<P>     Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and the Consumer
Product Safety Act, the Commission has set safety regulations for
certain toys and other children's articles.   Manufacturers must
design and manufacture their products to meet these regulations
so that hazardous products are not sold.</P>

<H3>Your Responsibility</H3>

<P>     Protecting children from unsafe toys is the responsibility
of everyone.  Careful toy selection and proper supervision of
children at play is still -- and always will be -- the best way
to protect children from toy-related injuries. To report a
product hazard or a product-related injury, write to
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, D.C.,
20207, or call the toll-free hotline: 1-800-638-2772.  A
teletypewriter for the deaf is available at 1-800-638-8270.</P>

<P>CPSC is aware of deaths to children under age six that involved
head entrapment under bunk bed guard rails. To reduce the risk of
your child slipping feet first into the space between the lower
edge of a guardrail and the top surface of the mattress, CPSC
advises:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Never allow children under 6 years-old on the upper bunk.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Close the space between the lower edge of the guardrail and
	upper edge of the bedframe to 3 1/2 inches or less.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>In addition, CPSC received reports that children, primarily age
one and under, died when they became entrapped between the bed
and the wall. A guardrail placed next to the wall, on the lower
bunk as well as the upper bunk, will help reduce this risk of
entrapment.</P>

<P>CPSC is also aware of young children who died when their bunk bed
mattress and mattress foundation collapsed while they were
playing on or under the beds. Mattresses and/or foundations
resting only on ledges need fastened cross wires, or other means
of support to help prevent dislodgement, even when beds are used
as twin beds.</P>


<P>Attach additional boards to the bunk bed to close up any space
more than three and one half inches between the lower edge of the
guardrails and the upper edge of the bed frame to prevent
possible entrapment and strangulation.</P>

<P>Securely fasten supports to ledges of both beds with screws or
bolts.</P>

<P>Supports can be provided by wood slats, metal straps, or sturdy
wires.</P>

<P>Falling mattresses or foundations can cause injury or even kill a
small child. Mattresses and/or foundations resting only on ledges
need cross wires, or other means of support to help prevent
dislodgement, even when beds are not stacked.</P>

<P>SECURELY FASTEN SUPPORTS TO LEDGES OF BOTH BEDS WITH SCREWS OR
BOLTS.</P>

<P>SUPPORTS CAN BE PROVIDED BY WOOD SLATS, METAL STRAPS, OR STURDY
WIRES.</P>

<P>If mattresses or foundations on either bunk bed rely on side rail
ledges as the only means of support, consumers should write to:
Bunk Bed Kit, P.O. Box 2436, High Point, NC 27261, and ask for a
free cross wire support kit.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission CPSC), five bunk bed manufacturers
are recalling approximately 100,000 wooden bunk beds.
The bunk beds have openings on the top bunk that present a
potential entrapment hazard to young children. The spaces can
be large enough for a child's body to pass through, but
small enough to entrap the child's head.</P>

<P>     Since November 1994, CPSC and 26 manufacturers have
announced recalls of more han 411,400 wooden bunk beds with
similar entrapment hazards.  In response to this action,
the manufacturers participating in this recall have also
identified bunk beds with similar entrapment hazards.</P>

<P>     Since 1990, CPSC has received reports of 32 children
who died from becoming caught in bunk beds with similar
spaces in the top bunk. Thirty-one of those children were
ages 3 and under. The most recent death occurred on
September 28, 1996. A 3-year-old boy died from becoming
caught in a bunk bed manufactured by the Bedder Bunk
Company.</P>

<P>     The ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials)
voluntary standard for bunk beds requires that, in addition
to having guardrails on both sides of the top bunk, all
spaces between the guardrail and bed frame, and in the head
and foot boards on the top bunk, should be less than 3.5
inches. Bunk beds currently made by the companies listed
below now meet the spacing requirement of the voluntary
standard. The companies are also providing permanent labels
or placing permanent labels on their bunk beds to warn that
children under the age of 6 be prohibited from the upper
bunk. CPSC and the manufacturers continue to urge parents
and caregivers not to put children under the age of 6 on the
top bunk.</P>

<P>     The manufacturers listed below are participating in
this recall to improve the safety of these beds and to meet
the requirements of the voluntary standard. Consumers should
stop using the recalled beds immediately and call the
company or contact the retailer for a replacement guardrail,
retrofit kit, or instructions to help eliminate the
potential entrapment hazard. If consumers are not sure of
the bunk bed manufacturer or have questions about this
recall, they should call CPSC's Hotline at (800) 638-2772. </P>

<H3>What is the CPSC</H3>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an
independent federal regulatory agency that was created in 1972 by
Congress in the Consumer Product Safety Act.  In that law,
Congress directed the Commission to "protect the public against
unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with
consumer products."</P>

<P>It has jurisdiction over about 15,000 types of consumer
products, from automatic-drip coffee makers to toys to lawn
mowers.  Some types of products, however, are covered by other
federal agencies.  For example, cars, trucks and motorcycles are
covered by the Department of Transportation; drugs and cosmetics
are covered by the Food and Drug Administration; alcohol, tobacco
and firearms are covered by the Department of the Treasury.</P>
<hr>
<H3>What the CPSC does</H3>

<P>CPSC works to reduce the risk of injuries and deaths from
consumer products by:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>developing voluntary standards with industry;

     	<LI>issuing and enforcing mandatory standards; banning
     	consumer products if no feasible standard would adequately
     	protect the public;

     	<LI>obtaining the recall of products or arranging for their
     	repair;

     	<LI>conducting research on potential product hazards; and

     	<LI>informing and educating consumers through the media, state
     	and local governments, private organizations, and by
     	responding to consumer inquiries.
</UL>
<hr>
<H3>How Can It Help You and Your Family</H3>

<P>If you've had a problem with a consumer product or you want
information, here's how to get in touch with the CPSC:</P>

<P>To report an unsafe consumer product or a product-related injury:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>call the CPSC toll-free Hotline at (800)638-2772; and
     	(800)638-8270 for the hearing impaired;

     	<LI>contact us via electronic mail on the Internet at
     	info@cpsc.gov

     	<LI>access the CPSC Internet gopher system at cpsc.gov;


     	<LI>write to request a free copy of a publication listing
     	at:

<P> This notice explains which Federal Agencies issue consumer product safety
warnings or recalls, the kinds of products each of them covers, and how to let
them know about product safety problems or find out about warnings or recalls
they have announced.</P>


<h3> <a name="FEDERAL RECALLS AND WARNINGS">Federal Recalls and
Warnings</a></h3>

<P>Every year, in order to prevent injury to consumers, Federal agencies
recall or
issue warnings about hundreds of products.  Product hazards may occur because
of design flaws, production defects, new scientific information about dangers
from materials previously thought safe, accidental contamination, tampering,
unforeseen misuse of products, or failure to meet safety standards.  Most
recalls are carried out voluntarily by manufacturers under the supervision of
the Federal agency responsible for the product category involved.</P>

<P>The consumer's part in these product safety efforts is crucial.
Unfortunately,
it is not widely understood.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>


<h3> <a name="CONSUMER ROLE IN PRODUCT SAFETY">Consumer Role in Product
Safety</a></h3>


<P>Consumers are critically important in two ways.  The first is in identifying
product safety problems.  Under U.S. law, the way product safety is regulated
by Federal agencies varies among types of products.  While meat and poultry
plants, for example, are under continuous Federal inspection, drugs and other
foods are produced according to Federal "Good Manufacturing Practices" with
random inspection of plants to assure they comply.  Although there are federal
safety standards for components of such products as toys and automobiles,
design flaws or quality control problems, among other things, can make them
unsafe in other ways.  Reports from consumers may be the first indication to
the agencies that safety problems exist.</P>

<P>The second is in responding to product safety problems.  Product recalls and
warnings protect consumers only if they react to them.  Usually, only about 2%
to 50% of recalled products in the hands of consumers are returned for refund,
replacement or remedy.  With products that are used up quickly or so
inexpensive they are more likely to be thrown away than returned, low response
may not be dangerous.</P>

<h4>MEAT AND POULTRY</h4>

<P>Food Safety and Inspection Service<BR>
U.S. Department of Agriculture<BR>
(FSIS/USDA):</P>

<P>The 7,800 inspectors of FSIS oversee the processing of meat and poultry in
6,500 plants that sell their products across state lines.  Although most
problems are corrected before products leave the plant, FSIS sometimes requests
a recall because, for example, of undercooking or harmful bacteria on ready to
eat products.  (Meat and poultry products for sale only within state boundaries
are state inspected; state health or agriculture departments are the best
source of information on them.)  FSIS recalls are classified according to the
potential danger to the public.  A Class I recall presents a reasonable
probability of death or serious harm to health; Class II and Class III are less
serious.  There are about 15 Class I recalls each year.  FSIS oversees company
recalls of the products it inspects, coordinates with state and local health
officials, and publicizes recalls to consumers through the media and via
messages on its tollfree Meat and Poultry Hotline.</P>

<P>For promptest action concerns about the safety of specific meat or poultry
products should be reported first to local health officials.</P>

<P>To learn about recalls of FSIS-inspected meat or poultry products, report
safety concerns or inquire about safe food-handling to prevent illness,

<h4>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD):</h4>

<P>Most housing in the U.S. must meet standards set by local government
agencies.
The exception is manufactured housing, often called "mobile homes."  All
manufactured housing in the U.S. must conform to Federal standards monitored by
HUD.  The agency keeps records which include the serial number, dealer and
state of destination for manufactured homes, and requires manufacturers to keep
the names of individual unit buyers.  If a safety problem is found with a
particular model or brand of manufactured home, a defect notification is
issued.  There are 100-120 defect notifications a year.  Consumers are notified
by letter from the manufacturer that includes a contact through which
arrangements can be made to have the defect corrected at no charge.</P>

<h4>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA):</h4>

<P>Automotive manufacturers must certify that their vehicles meet Federal
safety
standards and NHTSA tests to confirm that they do.  If a vehicle doesn't
comply, or has a defect affecting safety, the manufacturer recalls the vehicle
under NHTSA supervision.  In 1990, there were 205 recalls involving six million
vehicles, about three-fourths of them the result of NHTSA investigations.
Virtually all vehicles are registered--although not all registration
information is always up to date--and vehicle recall notices sent by
manufacturers reach about 90 percent of owners.  Consumer awareness of recalls
of such vital auto equipment as tires, child car seats and replacement parts is
low, however, because these items are not owner registered.  NHTSA publicizes
recalls to the media, issues a monthly list of recalls, and has begun a
rulemaking proceeding to require registration of child car seats.</P>

by
other federal agencies.  For example, cars, trucks and

<P>"My tummy hurts.  My tummy hurts.  My tummy hurts."  My three year old
daughter repeated this over and over again.  Until that Tuesday evening,
Anna had never complained about pain of any sort.  In fact, when she fell
down, she would leap up and say, "I'm OK," and run off.  Indeed, Anna was
one, healthy, big kid for her age at 35 pounds.  Though we eat out
frequently, we have always tightly restricted her intake of sweets and
pushed a lot of vegetables, fruits, legumes, and milk products like yogurt
and cheese.  She eats at fast food restaurants at most twice a year.</p>

<P>My husband and I had been on a rare Mommy-Daddy-only vacation when Anna
fell sick.  "I took her to the pediatrician's yesterday," Grandma said,
though it was clear that she was worried.  "He said it was probably flu,
and she should be better by tomorrow."  By the time we returned from
vacation, Anna had had chronic diarrhea with stomach cramps for four days,
day and night.  That night, I learned that the stomach cramps would even
awaken her from sleep.  Her diarrhea, at that point mostly fluid, was an
odd, orangeish color.  "By the way, I bought some of that Odwalla apple
juice at the grocery store.  She really loves it!  We went through a whole
jug of it and then I went back to the store to get more,"  my mother
added.  I frowned.  Apple juice is notoriously low in nutrition.  We
usually fed Anna strawberry/banana or sent her to nursery school with
Odwalla carrot juice in her lunch box, but Grandmas have privileges that
parents often don't.</P>

<P>We scheduled a second appointment with the pediatrician the next day, and
he was concerned it was food poisoning, either shegella, campylobacter or
salmonella.  It has recently become known that antibiotics given to kill
off the first two can drive salmonella into the gall bladder, so the
doctor wanted to be sure of the infectious agent.  Through the
stethoscope, the rumbling in her tummy was loud and clear.  He and I
agreed that her stool might have blood in it, but neither of us was sure.
We gave the lab a stool sample, which would take at least two days to
culture.  When Anna wasn't running to the bathroom, she was lying in my
arms, at times only whispering, "My tummy hurts.  My tummy hurts."
Because she had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the
bathroom, I slept in her room, awakening every two hours.</P>

<P>By Thursday, she had had diarrhea for six days straight and hadn't eaten
in four.  She was going through panties so often that I put her into
pull-ups at great offense to her ego.  That afternoon, when there was
still no sign of improvement, I took her to the doctor's office for an IV.
I thought I was being overly concerned; she'd never been this sick, and I
was overreacting.  My mother and I spoke frequently about where she might
have contracted it.  We reviewed what she had eaten.  We noted that she
had been to a petting zoo.  I asked at her nursery school whether any
other children had fallen similarly ill. There was no source.  Because
Anna was only drinking water, the doctor asked us to begin pushing fluids
such as apple juice.  I bought some more Odwalla apple juice and lots of
Gatorade, but Anna would only drink a couple of sips at a time.</P>

<P>On Friday, after seeing her again, and after the results of her stool
culture all came back negative, the doctor prepared me for the weekend.  I
should bring her in for a second IV if she didn't drink a certain amount
every hour.  I should also bring her in if she developed a fever or if she
didn't pee more than twice in 24 hours.  That night, Anna showed some
brief improvement. As we ate dinner, she asked for some pasta of her own
and ate a few pieces without anything on them.</P>

<P>Early Saturday morning, I thought we were making progress.  Anna was
drinking some fluids, and she hadn't had diarrhea or pee'd since late on
Friday.  By the middle of the afternoon though, she had fallen behind in
fluids and still had not pee'd.  I spoke to the doctor on call.  My
husband thought I was worrying too much; she just needed to be pushed
harder to drink fluids.  We went to the emergency room to get an IV, and
there, she vomited up all of the fluids she had consumed in the last five
hours.  The pediatrician on call took a sample of her blood before
starting the IV, and fairly quickly thereafter, Anna had to go pee again.</P>

<P>"We're admitting her," the pediatrician on call announced.  She went on to
describe Anna's blood counts were all slightly abnormal.  Her creatinine,
a measure of kidney function was not good.  A month before, my aunt had
died of complications resulting from chronic kidney disease.  "We're
familiar with creatinine," I said, explaining about my aunt.  "That's the
one we worry about."  Admitting Anna also seemed like an overreaction, but
she was clearly dehydrated.  Better to be watched carefully rather than
kicked out too soon.  I nominated myself to stay at the hospital.  That
night, the electronic thermometers were not working, and they took Anna's
temperature rectally.  By the time they came a third time, she yelled, "I
don't want them to put that stick in my bottom!"  They took blood every
four hours.  I think the only way Anna managed to sleep was through
exhaustion.</P>

<P>By 1:00 a.m., I had barely slept.  The bed I was given had loud squeaking
springs; at one point, it almost collapsed on me, and I was trying to not
wake Anna up.  The nurse put through a call from the pediatrician.  "We've
identified Anna's illness," she said.  "We think she has HUS."  I tried to
follow what she was saying, but it all seemed like jargon.  HUS was the
leading cause of acute renal (kidney) failure in children.  It crops up
most often in the summer and fall.  Children can get it from fast food
places and swimming in lakes, neither of which Anna had visited.  When
they see clusters of cases, the doctors presume it is an outbreak of E.
coli O157.  Children can recover in 2 to 3 weeks.  They were going to
transfer her to Stanford Children's Hospital, where the disease would be
treated aggressively.  She went on to talk about Anna's increasing anemia.
"Because you mentioned the creatinine and it's increasing, I thought about
this disease in particular.  That's why we checked under the microscope.
When we found broken red blood cells, I suspected HUS, so I called the
renal specialist at the Children's Hospital, and he agrees."  The doctor
closed with, "I'm very sorry that I have to tell you this. I told the
nurse, 'That poor mother...' getting news like this in the middle of the
night."</P>

<P>I couldn't understand the significance.  Were Anna's kidneys failing?  I
tried to call Scott, my husband, but our phones at home shut down at
night.  It was a long, lonely night.  How would they treat this?  What did
it mean?  Because I had received the early morning call about my aunt's
death, I knew the phones would turn back on at 6:00 a.m. and called Scott
promptly.  After repeating as much as I could remember, I asked, "Please
get on the Internet.  Look for "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome" and "E. coli
O157. "  Scott came about an hour later.</P>

<P>As I poured over the materials, tears welled up in my eyes. At the Synsorb
Biotech, Inc. site, it read: "Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a disease
that affects the kidneys and other organs.  It poses a threat...as one of
the leading causes of both acute and chronic kidney failure... The most
common symptoms of E. coli O157:H7 Gastroenteritis or Hamburger Disease
include: Diarrhea (often with blood in the stools), Vomiting, Abdominal
Cramps...E. Coli O157:H7 bacteria infect the intestine of cattle and less
frequently the intestines of other animals.  Typically carried in the
feces, it can contaminate the meat during and after slaughtering.  These
bacteria are associated mainly with consumption of undercooked ground
beef, unpasteurized milk and cheese, and contaminated water sources... If
HUS develops, children spend an average of 2 weeks in hospital mainly to
care for kidney problems of varying severity.  Depending on the severity
of the illness, a large majority will require some form of blood
transfusion and approximately 50% will need temporary kidney dialysis.
Modern medical care has allowed approximately 97% of the children to
survive the illness; however, long-term follow-up is very important."</P>

<P>The Lois Joy Galler Foundation was more dour, and I began to sob:  Only 1
in 10 children develop HUS following an E. coli infection.  "HUS is a
dramatic, explosive illness that most commonly develops within 2 to 4 days
after a bout of gastroenteritis that is accompanied by bloody diarrhea.
Children are hospitalized with obvious irritability, fatigue, pallor and a
noticeable decrease in urine production.  Some severely affected children
may have life-threatening gastrointestinal problems.  Neurological
dysfunction including lethargy, seizures, cerebral infarction, blindness
and coma can be present at disease onset or develop during the course of
the illness.  Profound gastrointestinal or neurological disease are
markers for more severe cases of HUS and may be harbingers of a poor
prognosis."</P>

<P>"Nearly 5-10% of children with HUS die during the acute phase of the
disease as a consequence of complete renal failure or multiple organ
complications.  A small majority of children with HUS experience a
complete recovery with full restoration of kidney function and almost no
risk of the disease recurring.  However, 10-30% of the children who
survive have permanent kidney damage and many of these children will have
progressive loss of kidney function over the next 5 to 10 years."</P>

<P>I went into the bathroom in Anna's room to take a shower.   With the water
falling all around me, I began to sob uncontrollably.  What had happened
to my little girl?  Why was this happening to us?  What lay ahead of us?
How bad was it going to get?  Would Anna ever come home with us?  What if
she were left blind or brain damaged?</P>

<P>As we waited for the ambulance to come, we watched a Sesame Street video
about Big Bird's trip to the hospital, which almost comically,
word-for-word mimicked much of the situation as Anna was seeing it.  We
talked up the ambulance trip between the two hospitals to Anna.  She
wanted to walk to the ambulance rather than ride on a gurney, and so, with
her IV bag attached, four ambulance people and a nurse, we went to the
ambulance outside.</P>

<P>At Stanford, we went to a special wing.  On the entrance doors to the
wing, there were large signs indicating that this was the Immunologically
Suppressant ward; here, children were awaiting transplants.  We walked
past some rooms, and on the outside of two, I saw photos of the children
as they had been before they got sick.  We were put in a special room with
air filtered as for transplant cases.  There was an anteroom for
observation; it was the biggest single hospital room I had ever seen.</P>

<P>Late in the day, Dr. Mak, the pediatric-neprhologist came to visit.   He
indicated that they had not found E. coli in Anna's stool back at the
original hospital, but in 50% of all cases, they never did find it;
sometimes, HUS can be caused by other agents.   E. coli, he believed, was
a reportable disease in the State of California, but HUS was not, and he
didn't believe Anna could be part of an epidemic because Stanford had not
seen any number of cases at a rate different than they usually did.</P>

<P>In HUS, the infectious agent spews toxins into the blood stream.  Because
it is not always known whether it is viral or bacterial, little is done to
the original agent after the onset of HUS, but the symptoms must be
monitored carefully to minimize damage.  As I best understand this, they
believe that toxins cause platelets to clump together and stick to the
sides of the blood vessels.  They also become "sharp," perhaps like a net
made up of knives, and they therefore cause the red blood cells to become
broken.  Most of the damage appears to occur in capillaries where the
passageways are "small" and the RBCs probably cannot "get by" without
brushing up against these.  The kidneys, because they filter blood on such
a detailed level, are a particularly sensitive organ to this type of
damage but the damage happens to all organs.</P>

<P>As a result, the symptoms resulting are anemia (e.g. loss of red blood
cells), loss of platelets, and micro-damage to blood cells.  As the
kidneys suffer damage and renal failure begins, the patient takes on
fluid, eventually no longer peeing on their own.  The fluid increases the
chances of high blood pressure.  Electrolytes become imbalanced, and if
potassium goes high, it can damage the heart.  Examples of extreme
symptoms are complete kidney failure, strokes causing brain damage, coma,
and blindness.  However, about 98% of Dr. Mak's patients had gone home
healthy.</P>

<P>The doctor described Anna's case as being "moderate."  He indicated that
Anna would get worse before she would get better, and they needed to watch
her carefully.  Indeed, she was up and acting like she was getting better
already--all this transplant ward stuff was really looking like throwing a
grenade when a water balloon would do.   As for transfusions, which were
likely given where her blood counts were going, we her parents were not
advised to donate our blood.  Because we were the best donors of kidneys
should she ever need a kidney, they didn't want her immune system to
develop antibodies to our blood which would down the line interfere with
her ability to accept a kidney from us.</P>

<P>Anna did very well on Sunday and Monday... she was active and laughing
despite the fact that her blood indicators were showing decreasing red
blood cells, decreasing platelets and increasing wastes building up in her
blood.  She was learning to draw with her left hand because the IV site on
her right arm inhibited her use of her right hand.  Good signs were that
she was continuing to pee and had normal blood pressure.   On Monday
night, they endeavored to give her a transfusion, but she broke out in
hives, so they had to back off.   They could not determine the cause of
the allergic reaction.</P>

<P>That day, Scott read on the Web that "road-side" apple juice had been the
source of one E. coli outbreak.  We wondered about the juice because it
had featured so prominently in my mother's description of Anna's week at
her house.</P>

<P>What's odd about the Odwalla story is the absence of hysteria. The Half Moon Bay company's apple juice has been linked to a multistate E.coli outbreak that's sickened dozens, sent small children to the hospital and may have killed a Colorado toddler. Where's the panic?</P>

<P>Loyal customers are buying Odwalla's non-apple based juices, and eagerly awaiting the return of apple-based juices made without pasteurization or preservatives.</P>

<P>The parents of the Colorado child who died after drinking her favorite Odwalla apple juice, say they won't sue. "I don't blame the company," said Christy Gimmestad, after her daughter's death.</P>

<P>This is remarkable.</P>

<P>At Whole Foods in Palo Alto, Sheri Moody was buying Odwalla orange juice to show her support for the company, and her anger at reports a San Francisco lawyer is looking for people to sue Odwalla. "Odwalla is a good, ethical company," said Moody, an occasional customer. "Sometimes bad things   happen to good companies."</P>

<P>At the Palo Alto Co-op Supermarket shoppers are worried about Odwalla's health, in addition to their own. "People who are into health foods are afraid they'll lose the chance to buy fresh, squeezed juice," said Rex Williams, general manager at Co-op in Palo Alto. "For the most part, people are supportive of Odwalla."</P>

<P>Odwalla customers pay premium prices: Serious Ginseng, reformulated to eliminate apple juice, costs $2.79 for 16 ounces at Co-op; Honey Lemon is the cheapest at $1.69. They think it's worth it.</P>

<P>The Food and Drug Administration is considering requiring all apple juice, and possibly all juice, to be pasteurized. Pasteurization destroys bacteria. Fresh squeezed fans say it also destroys flavor, nutrients and enzymes.</P>

<P>It could destroy businesses too, Williams pointed out. Juice bars couldn't afford to pasteurize, and who's going to pay $3.25 for a canned juice smoothie?</P>

<P>In part, Odwalla is reaping the benefit of a good reputation, and its quick response to questions about its products' safety.</P>

<P>Odwalla promptly recalled products with apple juice, and also recalled other juices made on the same equipment. The company offered to pay the medical bills for anyone made sick by Odwalla juice. The company chairman has visited the sick, and consoled the Gimmestads.</P>

<P>Not being defensive is the best offense.</P>

<P>So far, nobody knows how E.coli got into a batch of apple juice. An inspection of Odwalla's processing plant in Dinuba came up clean. The current theory is that the company unknowingly bought apples that had fallen in manure.</P>

<P>Clearly, many consumers are giving Odwalla the benefit of the doubt.</P>

<P>"I've seen a lot of support," said an Odwalla delivery driver, whose truck bears the slogan: "Drink It and Thrive." A serious juicie, she misses her Superfood, an Odwalla "nutritional" made of spirulina wheat grass, blue-green algae and fruit juices. "It's green, but if you can get past that, it gives you a lot of energy"</P>

<P>Odwalla also benefits from consumers' willingness to accept natural risks, like bacteria, while refusing to tolerate even the remotest man-made risks. Many people believe natural necessarily means healthy. They worry more about the risks of preservatives than the risk of eating spoiled food. They fret about chemical fertilizers but not about a natural alternative: manure. Mother Nature is their friend; Dr. Science is not.</P>

<P>There's also a growing skepticism about food scares. We've been through too many, and we're tired of being warned that everything we enjoy is bad for us.</P>

<P>In 1989, the Alar scare cost apple growers an estimated $100 million. Parents panicked when an environmental group claimed traces of Alar, used on 5 to 15 percent of the apple crop, increased cancer risks for children.</P>

<P>Demand soared for organic produce, grown without chemicals, and "health food" moved into mainstream supermarkets. It seems to be there to stay.</P>

<P>Personally, I never buy organic. It's too expensive. I've never had a swig of Femme Vitale, Maya Papaya or Menage a Tropique. I'm cheap.</P>

<P>But l hope the FDA lets Odwalla be Odwalla, perhaps with added warnings about the risk of unpasteurized juice for young children, who are least able to fight off an E. cold infection.    . (Who can afford to let their kids develop a taste for Odwalla?)	 </P>


<P>If adults are willing to take the slightly higher risk of unpasteurized juice, rather than giving up the taste of fresh-squeezed spirulina, why not let them drink the beverage of their
choice?</P>

<P>I'll stick to my carbonated water, caramel color, aspartame, phosphoric acid, potassium benzoate, natural flavors and citric acid.  </P>

<P>I would like to respond to Joanne Jacobs' commentary on the subject of apple juice related food poisoning. <i>(refer to  <a href="/kidsource/content2/ecoli/sjmercury.jacobs.html">Apple Juice Poisoning: The Panic That Wasn't </a> )</i>  One of the questions that has been raised was why there have not been more law suits, and why not more hysteria. I would have to concur with her that we have grown complacent. Yet, like the village people who have too often heard "Wolf" cried, the wolf may in fact now be at our gates.</P>

<P>Consumers do not know that there is no cure for an E. coli O157:H7 infection. No penicillin just takes care of it. All that doctors can do is try to keep tipping the scales back in their favor as the disease ravages the child's body. The first symptoms are rampant diarrhea and intense stomach cramps. If the child does not receive fluids, the child can die of dehydration. Next, all the color drains from the face of the child, as anemia sets in. If the child is not given a transfusion, the child will die. The child begins to retain waste fluids. They begin to get puffy. As the kidneys cease functioning, dialysis must begin, or the child will die. Knowing that it is E. coli that caused the complications does not change the course of action.</P>

<P>Consumers do not know that because this disease is not a nationally reportable disease. While the State of Washington is taking action, other states are left unaware that an epidemic is beginning and more children are poisoned until the epidemic is understood to be widespread. </P>

<P>Consumers also do not know that doctors don't always recognize the symptoms of this disease, especially if they are unaware of an epidemic, so that while a parent worries about the deteriorating health of the child, doctors may not treat the child appropriately.
Many health facilities are inadequate for treating the disease; yet, with diarrhea as the principle symptom, the child is likely to be taken first to a community hospital. Because the most afflicted are the youngest and cannot adequately verbalize their illness, it can be missed until it is too late.</P>

<P>Consumers do not realize that these epidemics will continue until we change our food processing. Animal-to-human contact has given us AIDS, flu, and E. coli O157:H7, and as bacteria and viruses continue to mutate becoming immune to our feeble medicines, we will see more virulent strains. </P>

<P>Consumers do not understand that this risk is in all fresh products. They feel safe because Odwalla has removed the "bad" stuff from the shelves, yet they purchase other produce such as carrots, radishes, mushrooms, or potatoes and feed them to their children without knowing that they can just as easily harbor deadly disease.</P>

<P>The parents of children afflicted with E. coli poisoning know differently. They know that Odwalla reacted as compassionately and quickly as a $50+ million company could and that the company has a culture of health and caring. They know that if Odwalla is guilty of selling tainted juice, they are guilty of giving them to their own children.They know that, unlike the newspapers report, it will be difficult to blame one source of food in particular. Long ago, they threw away the juice bottles-some do not even know which lot the juice came from; therefore, parents cannot perfectly prove that Odwalla juice did this. They cannot be sure that this will not happen to them again. They know that no amount of money will compensate them for the tragedy that has occurred. Driving Odwalla out of business not only hurts the long term financial connection between Odwalla and themselves, but also hurts the company that is most capable of instituting change in the natural foods industry so that this never happens again. The E.coli parents know that right now, all they most want to do is to have their lives return normal. </P>

<P>What the E. coli Parents don't know is their lives will never be normal again. They will never be able to look at diarrhea and not wonder if something is trying to kill their child. They cannot know, as they go back year after year for checkups with kidney specialists, that their child will not someday need one or more of the parents' kidneys. They cannot quantify the long term costs of their child's possibly poorer health. They do not know the names of all the other children affected because most parents are hiding from the news media.</P>

<P>A comparison made to the Alar scare is ludicrous. If you are a parent with small children or elderly parents, you should be concerned. You may have a different opinion about how we can protect ourselves, but you should not be complacent. You should attempt to better educate yourself than the media is able to do; there are many resources available on the World Wide Web. You should not think that it won't happen to you because you don't eat that salami, don't eat at Jack-in-the-Box, don't drink Odwalla fruit juices. The wolf is at the gate, and the next child affected may be your own.</P>

<P>
These guidelines are issued to help prevent children from strangling or getting entangled in the neck and waist drawstrings  of upper outerwear garments, such as jackets and sweatshirts. Drawstrings on children's clothing are a hidden hazard that can lead to deaths and injuries when they catch on such items as playground equipment, bus doors, or cribs</p>

<P>
In this news article, the  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) responds to the recent U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ruling regarding children's sleepwear.  The NFPA cites concern over the  CPSC ruling that allows children's sleepwear to be made of flammable materials like untreated cotton, so long as it is tight-fitting on children or the age it is designed for.

Thesurvey of 500 adults was conducted in June and July on behalf of Morton International, an airbagmanufacturer, to determine driver awareness of child auto safety precautions.</P><P> Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children from five to 15 years of age.While airbags are lifesaving devices that adults in the survey indicated they want, many were unawareof the special precautions that should be taken when driving with children in airbag-equippedvehicles. Children risk injury if they are unbelted, improperly belted, or otherwise too close to thedashboard when an airbag inflates. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA))estimates that as of July 1, 1996, approximately 21.6 million passenger cars and light trucks in theUnited States have passenger-side airbags. All new cars will be required to have passenger-sideairbags beginning in model year 1998.</P><P> "This research shows drivers need to know a few simple but important steps that can help preventinjuries to children riding in motor vehicles,&quot; said S. Jay Stewart, chairman and CEO, MortonInternational. &quot;In response to these findings, we are launching a public education campaign tospread the important safety message of &quot;Always Buckle Children in the Backseat.&quot;</P><P> Morton has provided a grant to Optimist International, a service organization with more than 160,000members and 4,000 chapters, to support their efforts to communicate this safety message in localcommunities. &quot;Our organization's motto is 'Friend of Youth.' What better way to serve youth thanto help keep them safe.&quot; said Stephen P. Lawson, executive director, Optimist International.</P>Key findings of the national survey include:<UL TYPE=DISC>	<LI> Drivers need to be informed and reminded that children are safest riding in the backseat. Amajority of drivers surveyed (61%.) think that children age six or younger are large enough to ridein the front passenger seat.<BR>	<BR>	<LI> Approximately 86% of drivers surveyed sometimes place children age five to 11 in the frontseat and two thirds (68%) transport children in this age range in the front seat at least twice aweek.<BR>	<BR>	<LI> More than one in ten drivers (12%) incorrectly believes it is safe for infants inrear-facing child safety seats to ride in the front of a vehicle equipped with a passenger-sideairbag. On the contrary, there is a high risk of danger to the child riding in this position shouldthe airbag deploy in a collision. One in six drivers (15%) surveyed usually place the infant seat inthe front passenger seat facing backward.<BR>	<BR>	<LI> More than one in five drivers (22%) of children age one to four do not use a child safetyseat to transport a child that age, most frequently because they consider the child to be too big andthe seat unnecessary.<BR>	<BR>	<LI> Approximately two out of five people surveyed (41%) are not aware that airbags can causeserious injuries or fatalities to unrestrained or improperly restrained infants and children.<BR>	<BR></UL><P> In addition to the national survey, Morton commissioned eight focus groups in San Jose, CA; Boston,MA; Memphis, TN; and Chicago, IL to determine drivers' awareness of the child safety issues. Theslogan and logo Always Buckle Children in the Backseat was developed based on this information, andtested with more than 150 people in San Antonio, TX; Columbus, OH; and Los Angeles, CA.</P> A brochure and vehicle window sticker will be used to communicate the basic safety messages:<UL>	<LI> buckle up every child in the vehicle properly -- and buckle up yourself too.<BR>	<BR>	<LI> Whenever possible, put children in the backseat of the vehicle.<BR>	<BR>	<LI> Always secure rear-facing infant seats in the backseat.<BR>	<BR></UL><P> The American Car Rental Association, representing most major car rental companies, will play animportant role in supporting this campaign and will share this safety message with car rentalcustomers nationwide. Chrysler Corporation has also provided funding to aid in the distribution ofmaterials.</P><P> The American Medical Association; Emergency Nurses Association; Emergency Nurses CARE; theInternational Association of Chiefs of Police; the Grand Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police; theNational Safety Council; and the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representativeswill assist in the program by distributing these materials to their members and the driving public.</P><P> Morton is also a member of the National Automotive Occupant Protection Campaign which is launching anationwide public education campaign on auto safety.</P><P> Morton International is a Chicago-based manufacturer and marketer of specialty chemicals, automotiveinflatable restraint systems and salt.</P><P>SOURCE Morton International, Inc.</P><P> CONTACT: Jane Ostrander of Morton International, Inc. 312-807-3329, or Denise Ertell ofFleishman-Hillard, Inc., 312-751-8878</P></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4><a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> |<a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |<A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |<a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center><img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left><address>We love to talk with you.

It's important thatthey should participate in making sure that all children, but particularly those children most atrisk, become immunized,&quot; says Marienne Gausche, MD, one of the study's authors. </P> <P> The authors readily agree that children should be immunized and records kept by one primary careprovider, whenever possible. &quot;We recommend that emergency departments try to integrate care andestablish better communications with primary care physicians. Telephones and fax machines can be usedto exchange information on a child's immunization status,&quot; notes Dr. Gausche. </P> <P> But there are a number of barriers to this, including cost, parental support, and access. TheCenters for Disease Control has reported that even when vaccines are provided free of charge, thevaccination rate is only 70%. </P> <P> While emergency departments face a number of problems in setting up immunization programs, theauthors believe that they can provide a vital service to today's children by referring the childrento appropriate providers or immunizing the children in the emergency department if community servicesare not available. </P> <P> Annals of Emergency Medicine is the peer-reviewed journal of the American College of EmergencyPhysicians, a national medical specialty society representing nearly 19,000 physicians who specializein emergency medicine.

And, according to a study in the September Annals ofEmergency Medicine, a parent's judgment of the severity of the fever is just as reliable as expensiveover-the-counter thermometers used in the ear. However, the most reliable and accurate way to measurea child's temperature - especially for children two years and younger -- is with the old stand-by - aglass mercury thermometer used rectally or orally.</P><P> &quot;Parents are good at knowing if their child is really sick,&quot; says Edmond Hooker, MD, thestudy's main author. Fevers are one of the primary symptoms that prompt parents to bring theirchildren to emergency departments.</P><P> Dr. Hooker and his colleagues in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics at theUniversity of Louisville School of Medicine decided to check if parents were accurate in detectingfever. Parents of 180 children age 4 and under who were admitted to the emergency department wereasked if their child had a fever. Then, each child's temperature was taken with both a thermometerplaced next to the child's ear (a noncontact tympanic thermometer -- NCT) and a rectal thermometer.</P><P> Parents were able to correctly tell that their child was feverish nearly 80 percent of the time, andin fact, were more accurate than the NCT.</P><P> &quot;Trust your common sense -- if your child seems okay and is only mildly warm, give them theproper amount of a non-aspirin analgesic,&quot; says Dr. Hooker. &quot;But if your child is running atemperature with other symptoms, particularly those children under two, take their temperature usinga regular glass mercury thermometer. You and the physician need to know what the temperature is forfurther treatment.&quot;</P><P> Annals of Emergency Medicine is the peer-reviewed journal of the American College of EmergencyPhysicians, a national medical specialty society representing nearly 19,000 physicians who specializein emergency medicine.

Itis hoped that the present generation, growing up in situations wherepeople with handicaps are a natural part of school and community life,will put to rest forever the notion that people with handicaps are"different."</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="What"></a><H3>What Special Treatment Should Be Given?</H3><P>Children with handicaps need to be treated, as much as possible, likeany other child. It is unfair to the child when he or she is notallowed to compete. The world at large is mainly inhabited by peoplewith the ability to see, to hear, to speak, and to move about freely.Children with handicaps need to practice meeting the standards of the"normal" world while they are growing up so they can gain confidenceand independence.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="How Can"></a><H3>How Can One Help Feeling Sorry For Children With Handicaps?</H3><P>If you perceive the disabled child as someone to be pitied, someonefrom whom little should be expected or demanded, probably little willcome. If, on the other hand, you expect the child to succeed and grow,to learn to act independently, then chances are good that the childwill become a successful, growing, independent student.</P><H3>How Should Frustrations Or Temper Tantrums Be Handled?</H3><P>Such problems should be handled the same way they would be handled ifthe child did not have a handicap. It is easy to assume that disabledpeople exist in a continuous state of frustration. This is not true.Of course disabled children may feel frustrated at times. Thesefrustrations should be handled with good sense, remembering that acertain amount of frustration is healthy and promotes growth but thattoo much frustration can be defeating.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="How"></a><H3>How Should You Respond To Everyday Accomplishments?</H3><P>It is a joy to see a child with a handicap able to do the same thingsthat other children do, such as read, play on the jungle gym, or gothrough the lunch line. It is important, however, to distinguishbetween accomplishments that are attained with about the same degreeof effort that is required from most children and thoseaccomplishments that really represent a challenge to the handicappedchild.</P><P>If people react to ordinary accomplishments that were not particularlydifficult to attain as if they were extraordinary, children candevelop unrealistic views of themselves--either an inflated view oftheir capabilities and accomplishments, based on the continualamazement elicited from others, or a deflated view, based on theobviously limited expectations others hold for children withhandicaps. On the other hand, encouragement and reinforcement shouldbe expressed when youngsters accomplish tasks made difficult by theirspecific disabilities, for example, dressing for a child with cerebralpalsy.</P><H3>How Much Help Should Be Given?</H3><P>One of the benefits of mainstreaming is that children can help theirdisabled classmates. But too much help can become a hindrance if itrobs the child of opportunities to learn and practice independence.Generally if a child cannot handle some procedure or material, she orhe should be taught how to do it if at all possible.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr><a name="So"></a><H3>So Children With Communication Problems Also Have Problems InThinking?</H3><P>One disability that people have trouble coping with involves speechand language. Whether the communication impairment results from aphysical disability such as cerebral palsy or a speech handicap suchas stuttering, the listener tends to anticipate what the disabledperson is trying to say and not allow the person the time she or heneeds to communicate.</P><P>It is easy to mistakenly perceive people who have severe communicationdisabilities as also having impaired intelligence because of theirsimple, poorly articulated speech. A natural tendency is to respond tothis kind of language pattern with a simplification of your ownspeech. This should be avoided. Individuals who have problemsexpressing themselves, unless they are also hearing impaired,generally have no problem understanding normal, complex language.</P><a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr></td></tr></table> <table border=0 valign="top" halign="left" cellpadding="5"><tr><td valign=top halign=left width=100><img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>                   </td><td valign=top><a name="Is"></a><H3>Is There Anything Special That Needs To Be Done?</H3><P>There are special considerations that can be helpful to children withspecial disabilities. For example, keep in mind that children who havevisual impairments depend upon what they hear and touch to bring theminformation about their surroundings. Provide opportunities forvisually impaired children to handle things that children with normalvision can simply look at. It is also helpful to describe new people,things, and events as they come into the child's environment. Allowtime for the child to ask what is going on.</P><P>Children who have hearing impairments or who are deaf must depend onsight for most of their knowledge. Make sure the hearing impairedchild can see the face of whoever is speaking; many cues are picked upthrough lipreading and facial expression. Arrange for seating near theteacher or leader. Do not assume that a youngster understands you justbecause you have his or her attention. Ask whether you have beenunderstood.</P><P>Children who have a mental retardation problem can get along betterwhen directions are short and clearly stated. Break down tasks into aseries of steps that can be completed in sequence. Maintain a routine,teach new procedures, and give time for practice.</P><P>Youngsters with orthopedic impairments should be asked whether theyneed help and, if so, what kind. Do not assume the child needs morehelp than he asks for.</P><P>EDITOR'S NOTE: Much of this information is based on "QuestionsTeachers Ask."

<P>On November 18,1988, the President-signed into law the Labeling
of Hazardous Art Materials Act (Public Law 100-695). This law
requires that all art materials be reviewed to determine the
potential for causing a chronic hazard and that appropriate
warning labels be put on those art materials found to pose a
chronic hazard. The term "art material" includes "any substance
marketed or represented by the producer or repackager as suitable
for use in any phase of the creation of any work of visual or
graphic art of any medium." (15 U.S.C. 1277(b)(1). The law
applies to many children's toy products such as crayons, chalk,
paint sets, modeling clay, coloring books, pencils, and any other
products used by children to produce a work of visual or graphic
art.</P>

<P>The "Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act" (LHAMA) amended the
Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) by adding Section 23 and
designating the ASTM Standard Practice for Labeling Art Materials
for Chronic Health Hazards (ASTM D-4236-88) as a regulation under
Section 3(b) of the FHSA. The requirements of the LHAMA became
effective on November 18,1990. These requirements apply to art
materials that are intended for use in the household or by
children, which are initially introduced into interstate commerce
on and after November 18, 1990.</P>

<P>The Commission believes that under the broad statutory definition
of "art material" three general categories can be seen:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Those products which actually become a component of the work
	of visual or graphic art, such as paint, canvas, inks, crayons,
	chalk, solder, brazing rods, flux, paper, clay, stone, thread,
	cloth, and photographic film.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Those products which are closely and intimately associated
	with the creation of the final work of art, such as brush
	cleaners, solvents, ceramic kilns, brushes, silk screens, molds
	or mold making material, and photo developing chemicals.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Those tools, implements, and furniture that are used in the
	process of the creation of a work of art, but do not become part
	of the work of art. Examples are drafting tables and chairs,
	easels, picture frames, canvas stretchers, potter's wheels,
	hammers, chisels, and air pumps for air brushes.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>The Commission does not believe that Congress intended products
in the third category to be considered "art materials."
Therefore, as an enforcement policy, the Commission is not requiring that products failing in this
third category comply
with the standard for art materials. However, manufacturers still
have the responsibility under the FHSA to assure that these
products comply with any FHSA labeling or other requirements due
to chronic toxicity or other hazards.</P>

<P>Parents and others buying art materials, school supplies and toys
such as crayons, paint sets, or modeling clay should be alert and
purchase only those products which are accompanied by the
statement "Conforms to ASTM D-4236."</P>

<P>The LHAMA does not change the fact that products which are
hazardous are banned for distribution to young children, whether
the hazard is based on chronic toxicity, acute toxicity,
flammability, or other hazard identified by the FHSA. There is an
exception for art materials if they meet all three of the
exemption criteria of Section 2(q) of the FHSA in that they: (1)
require the inclusion of the hazardous substances for their
functional purpose, (2) bear labeling giving adequate directions
and warnings for safe use, and (3) are intended for use by
children who have attained sufficient maturity, and may
reasonably be expected, to read and heed such directions and
warnings.</P>

<P>For more information on the requirements for art materials,
contact the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Division of
Regulatory Management, Office of Compliance and Enforcement,
Washington, DC 20207, telephone: 301-504-0400.</P>

Preventive care is as important for your child's health as treatment is when he or
she is sick. This care includes immunizations, tests, and health guidance. Your
child receives preventive care from the doctor or other health care provider at
check-up visits and at other times. Proper preventive care helps keep your child
healthy.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

As a parent, you should know what preventive care your child needs. Work
with your child's doctor or other health care provider to assure that he or she
gets proper care.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>

The <I>Child Health Guide </I>has information on needed preventive care and on
good health habits. Use it as a permanent record to help you keep track of your
child's health and care through the years. This guide can help your child get a

<p>Most American children attend kindergarten, and many participate in all-day kindergarten programs. While recent reform efforts have focused on extending the kindergarten day, research suggests that how kindergartners spend their time may be more critical than the amount of time children spend in class. In other words, longer kindergarten days in unsuitable activities yield no educational advantages over the traditional half-day kindergarten program.  This article provides a good overview of the key elements for a kindergarten program.

<hr>

<p>Keeping your child safe is a major priority for parents.  Here we have many excellent articles that will help parents protect their children.  They range from in depth articles, to news items to checklists. Many of these are from the United States Consumer Safety Commission (CPSC). Unlike the other areas at KidSource, we're not rating these individually because we think they all are very important.  Instead, we've sorted them by their primary area of interest:<br>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="#home">Around the Home</a></b>
<li><b><a href="#clothing">Clothing</a></b>
<li><b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.pre.safety.in.2.html#poisoning">Poisoning </a></b>
<li><b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.pre.safety.in.2.html#recreation">Recreation &amp; Travel</a></b> 
</ul>  

Or if the article is of great interest for all parents, we've highlighted it in our Special Interest area.   We suggest that you also refer to the <a href="/cpsc/recall.html">Product Recall Notices </a> index for additional safety related information. <br><br>
For additional information, refer to our overall list of <a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.html">Safety </a> articles.</p>

<hr>

<p>When a child is gifted or talented, their parents and educators are faced with many issues and challenges. These articles and digests provide ideas, guidance and activities for both parents and educators of gifted students. While some of these articles are written specifically for educators, they can also benefit parents who are seeking to create or influence a program for their children.  In addition,  we've found that many of these articles, such as those on college planning and underachieving students, are appropriate and helpful for other students, not just those that are gifted. <br>

<P>Frequently, bright children have been referred to psychologists or pediatricians because they
 exhibited certain behaviors (e.g., restlessness, inattention, impulsivity, high activity level,
 day-dreaming) commonly associated with a diagnosis of ADHD. Almost all of these behaviors, however, might be found in bright, talented, creative, gifted children. Until now, little attention has been given to the similarities and differences between the two groups, thus raising the potential for misidentification in both areas-giftedness and ADHD.  This digest provides specific differences between the two groups that will help parents and educators better understand and evaluate their children. </P>

Some factors that can contribute to problems with career planning are presented here, along with ways of preventing and intervening with career development problems.

</P>

<P>When a child is a gifted reader, how do you offer challenging reading materials? How do you guide their reading, and how do you know what books to recommend to them or their parents?  Another relevant concern is how to develop programs that use literature in ways that are the most helpful to gifted students and make the most effective use of their abilities. In  programs for gifted students it is important to go beyond a basic response to the need for more literature in the curriculum. This article addresses these concerns, and will help parents and educators understand and guide the gifted reader. </P>

</a></B></p>

<P>In most households, parents can tell when their child has a fever by the 
age-old method of feeling the child's head. However, the most reliable 
and accurate way to measure a child's temperature - especially for 
children two years and younger -- is with the old stand-by - a glass 
mercury thermometer used rectally or orally.

<h3>Safety - Part 1 </h3> 
</center>

<blockquote>
<hr>

<p>Keeping your child safe is a major priority for parents.  Here we have many excellent articles that will help parents protect their children.  They range from in-depth articles, to news items to checklists. Many of these are from the United States Consumer Safety Commission (CPSC). Unlike the other areas at KidSource, we're not rating these individually because we think they all are very important.  Instead, we've sorted them by their primary area of interest:<br>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="#home">Around the Home or School</a></b>
<li><b><a href="#clothing">Clothing</a></b>
<li><b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.2.html#poisoning">Poisoning </a></b>
<li><b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.2.html#recreation">Recreation &amp; Travel</a></b> 
</ul>  

Or if the article is of great interest for all parents, we've highlighted it in our Special Interest area.   We suggest that you also refer to the <a href="/cpsc/recall.html">Product Recall Notices </a> index for additional safety related information. </p> 

</p>

<hr>

<h3>Of Special Interest to all Parents</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><b><a href="/kidsource/content/prepared.html"> The Emergency Preparedness Checklist </a></b></p>

<p>This great checklist is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  We suggest you save a copy of it, print it off and go over the items one by one with your family.  Or if you want to order a printed copy direct from FEMA, the address is listed in the opening paragraph.</p>


<hr>

<P><B> <a href="/NFPA/rate.safety.html">Rate Your Child's Safety</a> from the <a href="/NFPA/index.html"> National Foster Parents Association </a></B> </P>
 
<P>This is a great checklist of things your child should know and do to keep 
themselves safe. While most of the items are for older children, several 
can be used with young children.</P>

<hr>

<P> <B><a href="/NFPA/alert.safety.html">Be ALERT Safety Tips for Parents</a> from the <a href="/NFPA/index.html"> National Foster Parents Association </a></B> </P>
 
<P>This is a great list for parents of what they should do and know to keep 
their child safe. The tips are primarily for when the children are around 
other people, the children are away from home or are home alone. But 
several tips apply to all children in any situation.</P>

<P>Parents play an important role in educating their children about drugs, but they cannot do it
alone. Other groups also exert strong influence over children, including the school, clubs, and
teams. Schools can increase children's awareness of the negative effects of drug use and
equip them with skills to resist drug and alcohol use. When parents and schools work together
within the context of the larger community, they gain the consensus that will strengthen drug
prevention efforts.</P>

<P>
Written by the American-Speech-Language Hearing Association, this is a thorough set of questions and answers about articulation problems.  These  problems may result from physical handicaps, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate or hearing loss, or may be related to other problems in the mouth, such as dental problems. However, most articulation problems occur in the absence of
any obvious physical disability. The cause of these so-called functional articulation problems may be faulty learning of speech sounds.

When parents suspect that their children are have difficulty in reading, most parents and teachers take the constructive step of providing more practice in reading at school and at home. When this step is not fruitful, it is time to ask if a learning disability is present.  The assessment for problems in reading requires tests for reading and intelligence level. In this article from the Learning Disabilities Association of California, you'll learn more about these tests and how to develop a strategy to prepare for an IEP.

</p>

<p>When looking for a preschool program,  you will first need to consider your particular needs and preferences.  Next, not only should the program conform to state regulations and satisfy standards of health and safety, you should  consider the characteristics of your child, of the program, of the preschool staff, and of the program's physical environment. This article will guide you through each of these considerations.

</a></B>  
</p>

<p>Most American children attend kindergarten, and many participate in all-day kindergarten programs. While recent reform efforts have focused on extending the kindergarten day, research suggests that how kindergartners spend their time may be more critical than the amount of time children spend in class. In other words, longer kindergarten days in unsuitable activities yield no educational advantages over the traditional half-day kindergarten program.  This article provides a good overview of the key elements for a kindergarten program.

Adults can encourage creativity by emphasizing the generation and expression of ideas in a non-evaluative framework and by concentrating on both divergent and convergent thinking. Adults can also try to ensure that children have the opportunity and confidence to take risks, challenge assumptions, and see things in a new way.</P>

Although providing early intervention to children with disabilities in an inclusive environment designed to meet the needs of all children is commonly regarded as best practice, concerns are sometimes raised about the ability of preschool programs to meet the needs of children developing normally as well as those with developmental delays.

<p><B><a href="/ASHA/articulation.html">Questions and Answers about Articulation Problems</a></B></p>

<P>
Written by the American-Speech-Language Hearing Association, this is a thorough set of questions and answers about articulation problems.  These  problems may result from physical handicaps, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate or hearing loss, or may be related to other problems in the mouth, such  as dental problems. However, most articulation problems occur in the absence of
any obvious physical disability. The cause of these so-called functional articulation problems may be faulty learning of speech sounds.

<h2> Health, Safety and Parenting Web-Sites </h2>
</center> 
<blockquote>
<h3>Health and Safety </h3>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)</a>

<p> The NHTSA is responsible for reducing deaths and injuries resulting from motor vehicle  crashes. As part of this responsibility, they oversee issues regarding child safety seats.  When you visit their website, not only can you check on your child's car seat, you can register your car seat and the NHTSA will send your name to the car seat's manufacturer.  In case of a safety recall, the manufacturer can use that information to send recall letters to owners. 
Specifically, look at these pages:
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://www-nsa.nhtsa.dot.gov/rquery.shtml">NHTSA Recalls Query Form - Request Model Year </a> Use this page to see if your car seat has been recalled.
 
<Li><a href="http://www-nsa.nhtsa.dot.gov/cssr_form.html"> Child Safety Seat Registration  </a> Use this page to register your car seat.

<li><a href="http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/airbag2/FAQ's/FAQs.htm"> Frequently Asked Questions about Child Safety in cars </a>.  This is a must read for any caregiver wondering about how to protect a child in an automobile.
</uL>
</p>
<p>You may need to try these pages a few times before you can get in. (It took us 5 tries to get to the car seat page, but it is worth it to check to see if your car seat has been recalled.)
<p>
If you have any questions, or need help with any child safety seat or motor vehicle safety issue, call the U.S. Department of Transportation's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline at 1-800-424-9393.
Washington D.C. area residents may call 202-366-0123. </p>


<li><a href="http://www.totalbabycare.com/">Total Baby Care </a>

<p>This new site, focuses on the needs and issues surrounding the care of infants. Sponsored by Pampers  as part of their new initiative called the Pampers Parenting Institute, it has discussions with Dr. T. Berry Brazelton and other renowned pediatricians as well as information from the American Academy of Pediatrics. </p> 


<li><A href="http://www.aapd.org/">The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry</a>

<br>The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry is the professional organization whose dentist members are specially trained to provide both primary and comprehensive preventive and therapeutic oral health care for infants, children, adolescents, and patients with special health care needs. This site is rich with information for parents.  For example, two pages we found interesting are: <br>

<UL>
<li> <a href="http://www.aapd.org/PedDent.html#Dental Checklist for Infants and Toddlers"> Dental Checklist for Infants and Toddlers </a>  

<li> <A href="http://www.aapd.org/broch1.html#Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits"> Thumb, Finger and Pacifier Habits </a>
</ul>
</p>


<li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diseases/immun.html"> CDC Immunization Information Page </a>

<br>If you want in depth information about the immunizations that are recommended for your child then visit this site from the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC).  Many of the articles  also include statistics and research data for your reference.  This site is ideal for those parents who want to know more about specific immunizations in order to make an informed decision with their pediatrician or medical professional about what is best for their child. </p>



<li> <a href="http://www.medhelp.org/web/hgf.htm">Human Growth Foundation </a><br>

primarily children, with growth-related disorders, their families, and

</p> 


<li><a href="gopher://gopher.nih.gov/00/clin/cdcs/individual/58.apnea">Infantile Apnea And Home Monitoring </a>

<P>This is a long detailed technical paper that will be quite informative for the parents of any premature infant who is undergoing home monitoring.  It is from the National Institutes of Health.
</P> 


<li><a href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~garyh/premres.htm"> Preemie Resources</a>

<p> This page has a good list  of  books, sources for financial aid, mailing lists, websites and more.  It is a good place to start to look for other information on the web. </p>

<li><a href="http://www.vicnet.net.au/~garyh/preemie.htm"> Discussion Groups, Mailing Lists and Chat Areas about Premature Infants </a>

<P>Here you'll find descriptions for two mailing lists - one on preemies and the other on families of preemies. The list managers believe that having a premature baby can be a scary and lonely business. and they hope that through this list they can offer support and the benefits of a wide range of experiences to other parents. </P>

<hr>

<p>Keeping your child safe is a major priority for parents.  Here we have many excellent articles that will help parents protect their children.  They range from in-depth articles, to news items to checklists. Many of these are from the United States Consumer Safety Commission (CPSC). Unlike the other areas at KidSource, we're not rating these individually because we think they all are very important. <br><br>

Instead, we've sorted them by their primary area of interest:<br>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.html#home">Around the Home or School</a> </b>
<li> <b><a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.html#clothing">Clothing </a></b>
<li> <b><a href="#poisoning">Poisoning </a></b>
<li> <b><a href="#Recreation">Recreation &amp; Travel </a></b>.
</ul>  

Or if it is of great interest for all parents, we've highlighted it in our Special Interest area.  
We suggest that you also refer to the <a href="/csps/recall.html"> Recall Notices </a> index for further safety related information. </p>

<P>With many families' "back-to-school" preparations well underway, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission urges parents to include bicycle helmets on the list of items for those youngsters planning to bike to school.  Each year about 1,200 bicyclists are killed and more than half a million bicycle-related injuries are treated in hospital emergency rooms. About one-third of these deaths and two-thirds of the injuries involve school age children under the age of 15. Some of these deaths and injuries  could have been prevented if the rider had been wearing a helmet.</P>

<h2>Our Ratings</h2>
<h3>Philosophy Behind Our System</h3> 
</center>

<blockquote>

<HR>
<P>
We have developed a rating plan for our articles to help busy parents find the best, most pertinent and helpful information for them and their children.<br><br>
First, all of the articles here at KidSource OnLine are good, informative and timely articles.  A low rating does NOT mean that these articles aren't of value.  We don't publish such articles. <br><br>
<hr>
<center>
<b> Our ratings: </b>  <img src="/images/review-5stars.gif" > is a <b> Must See by All Parents </b> to <img src="/images/review-1stars.gif"> <b> Use as Reference Material Only </b> <br><br>
</center>
5-star <img src="/images/review-5stars.gif" > ratings  are given to those few articles that 
<UL>
<li>will be of great interest to <b>all</b> parents
<li>are a "must-read", especially if you only have time to read 1 or 2 articles in a category
<li>are ones that you'll come back to again and again
<li>are the most popular and well read here at KidSource - for the reasons listed above
</ul>

3-star  ratings <img src="/images/review-3stars.gif" > are given to those articles that 
<UL>
<li>will be of great interest to <b>a select set of </b> parents - i.e. those primarily interested in gifted and talented students or learning disabilities, or some other special topic
<li>if don't have time to read them on this visit, you'll want to read soon as you can.  Bookmark these articles for your next visit.
</ul>

1-star ratings <img src="/images/review-1stars.gif" > are given to those articles that 
<UL>
<li>have good information for a <b>specific or narrow interest or need</b>
<li>are often used as future reference information - read them when you need to
</ul>

2-star ratings <img src="/images/review-2stars.gif" > and 4-star ratings <img src="/images/review-4stars.gif" > fall in between these categories. <br><br>

<hr><br>
Our <a href="/kidsource/pages/health.safety.in.html">Safety </a>  articles and <a href="/cpsc/recall.html"> Product Recall </a> notices do not have these ratings.  We feel that all of these articles are important for parents to look at. The Safety articles are broken out by category to make it easier for parents to review and within a category, they are organized alphabetically. Our Product Recall notices are organized by date to make it easier to see what's been recalled since your last visit. 
<br><br>
<hr>
<br>
We appreciate your feedback and opinions on this rating philosophy.  We want to make this work for you.   Write us at  <a href ="mailto:support@kidsource.com"> support@kidsource.com  </a>  <br><br>

Thank you!

     These brochures are designed to show parents a host of
practical ways to introduce their children -- both in school
and at home -- to creative writing theater, music, dance and
visual art.<br><br>

     Educators tell us that these activities help children
learn about the world and about themselves. Furthermore,
learning a favorite skill or subject is the principal way that
many children actually learn to read, write, reason and cipher.<br><br>

     Both culture and childhood deserve every adult American's
attention and cooperative concern. This collection of brochures
itself is the product of cooperation -- by five private
organizations* that drafted the brochure texts and the National
Endowment for the Arts. We are all indebted to the Hallmark
Corporate Foundation whose generous support made the project
possible and allowed us to help America's children experience
the wonder and wit and wisdom of the arts.<br><br>

<H3><a name="DANCE AND YOUR CHILD">Dance and Your Child </a></H3>

     Dance is essential to general education for boys and
girls. Dance education beginning in early childhood and
continuing throughout life benefits the body, mind and spirit.<br><br>
<blockquote>
     "The Arts -- and dance in particular -- transmit culture,
teach skills and fulfill the human spirit. There is perhaps no
better description of education than this."<br><br>

<H3><a name="BENEFITS OF DANCE">Benefits of Dance for Children</a></H3>

<B>Dance education has many benefits:</B><br>

<ul>
<li>    Physical. Dance helps to increase flexibility, improve
     circulation, tone the body and develop muscles. It also
     improves posture, balance and coordination.

 <li> Intellectual. Dance enriches learning through a variety of
     perspectives, both traditional and experimental.
    
 <li> Esthetic. Dance awakens consciousness of beauty, lending
     new meaning to movement and form.
    
<li> Cultural. Dance increases understanding and appreciation
     for forms, choices and rituals from a broad range of
     historical, social and cultural perspectives.
    
 <li> Emotional. Dance helps develop self-confidence and
     self-esteem in a stimulating environment.
    
 <li> Social. Dance improves sensitivity, understanding,
     appreciation and consideration for others, both for their
     similarities and differences.
</ul>

<B>Dance Engages the Whole Person</B><br><br>


     Although dance can be great exercise, it is primarily an
art form and an esthetic expression of mind and body. Dance as
an art form has three dimensions:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Learning. Like other art forms, dance helps us to perceive
     and communicate who we are.
    
  <li> Knowledge. Dance has its own body of knowledge which can
     be shared, passed on and enlarged.
    
   <li> Experience. The very nature of dance is best discovered
     through experiencing it. In this it is almost unique as an
     art form, and very special as part of a child's education.
</ul>
     By combining these three dimensions, dance engages the
whole person in simultaneously moving, thinking and feeling.
Thus dance education can enhance your child's physical, mental
and emotional development. This holds for boys and girls alike.<br><br>

<br>


     For young children, dance offers avenues for exploration,
discovery and the development of natural instincts for
movement. Dance activities offer many benefits for children,
encouraging mental and emotional development as well as
obviously enhancing motor skills.<br><br>

     Dancing gives the young child a chance to experience and
understand both personal and social perspectives in a
stimulating situation. Dancing offers opportunities to express
thoughts and feelings and to understand other's thoughts and
feelings.<br><br>

     The dynamic balance of dance's physical, mental and
emotional aspects should be present in dance education,
regardless of whether the child plans to pursue a career in
dance. As in other arts disciplines, professional preparation
in dance demands years of rigorous education, training and
practice.<br><br>


<B>What you can do to get your child started in dance</B><br><br>


     As a parent, you can offer your child early exposure to
the an of dance and movement through many activities:<br><br>
<ul>
 <li> Encourage your child to experience movement Ask questions
     like "How many ways can you balance yourself besides
     standing?" and "How many different ways can you move your
     head (arms, leg, upper body)?" Questions like these will
     help your child become aware of his body and its
     relationship to other people and the environment.

    <li> Provide a place and times for your child to explore and
     invent movement Have her tell a story by acting it out
     with body movements. Or, ask him to move with different
     types of walks (downhill, on parade, stiff, up stairs) or
     to pretend to use different kinds of vehicles (bicycle,
     skateboard, car, horse, etc.).

   <li> Encourage the child to relate movement to rhythm. This can
     be as simple as getting a child to clap, rock or hop to
     music or a rhythmic beat. Your child may also enjoy moving
     or dancing to familiar songs and nursery rhymes. The goal
     is to get the child to experience movement as it relates
     to music or rhythm.

   <li> Allow the child to experiment with basic movements.
     Walking, running, jumping, skipping and such are basic
     locomotor movements. Bending, stretching, twisting and
     swinging are non-locomotor movements. By varying the size,
     level and direction of these basics, children discover a
     large number of movements which can be combined to form
     basic dance steps.<BR><BR>

<H3><a name="WHERE TO FIND DANCE">Where to Find Dance Instructors </a></H3>

<br>

     Educators and teacher organizations increasingly recognize
creative movement as integral to children's development, and
there are a number of exemplary dance education programs in
elementary schools. But unfortunately, well-balanced dance
programs are not found consistently in our schools today. As a
parent you can do two things to ensure good dance education for
your child.<br><br>

     First, look into the situation in your school and school
district. Find what importance is given to dance and advocate
making it a high priority. Second, look into private
instruction in studios, community centers, parks and recreation
programs, summer camps and other enterprises such as YWCAs.<br><br>

     In both cases, assure yourself that a dance program is
appropriate for your child's physical and social development
and that it is educationally sound. The following information
may help you review the dance instruction in your local school,
private studio or other setting.<br><br>


<B>Evaluating Teachers and Classes</B><br><br>


     Ask the following questions about the teacher(s) who might
instruct your child. In an ideal situation all the answers will
be yes:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Can I observe the class before enrolling my child?
    
  <li> Does the teacher seem aware of the physical, emotional and
     social development and needs of the students?

  <li> Does the teacher seem enthusiastic about the work?
    
  <li> Is the teacher supportive of each student's abilities,
     potential and goals?

 <li> Does the teacher use imaginative, varied and interesting
     approaches to the material being taught?

  <li> Is the teacher well trained and qualified?
    
  <li> Does the teacher seem well prepared and able to
     effectively communicate his or her knowledge?
    
  <li> Is the teacher familiar with human anatomy and the proper
     use of the body?
</ul>
     In the same spirit, ask these questions about the classes:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Are the students grouped according to age, physical
     abilities and social development?

  <li> Are class and time allotments appropriate for the age
     group?

  <li> Does the teacher give time for movement exploration?
    
  <li> Does the class provide satisfaction and enjoyment?
    
   <li> Is required attire appropriate and comfortable?
</ul>    
     The following class sizes and durations are suggested:
<pre>
     Ages 3-5          7-15 students         30-45 minutes
     Ages 6-8          20 students           45-60 minutes
     Ages 9-12         25 students           60-90 minutes<BR><BR>
</pre>

<H3><a name="SELECTING A DANCE PROGRAM">Selecting a Dance Program</a></H3>



<B>Facilities</B><br><br>


     A good place for dance classes offers the following:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> A space that is clean, well ventilated, well lit and free
     of obstructions.
    
   <li> A floor that is resilient and well maintained. (A
     suspended wood floor is best to avoid physical stress, but
     certain treatments over cement and tile can accommodate
     dance that does not include a great deal of landing from
     jumps.)
    
 <li> Floor space that is adequate for the class size and the
     age of the participants, ideally 100 square feet per
     student.
    
  <li> Adequate space for changing clothes.
    
  <li> Access to drinking water and restrooms.
</ul>

<B>Other Considerations</B><br><br>

<ul>
  <li> Dance class should not over-stress the body.
    
  <li> Major portions of the class should not be devoted to
     performances or preparing for recitals.
    
  <li> Dance for children should concentrate on
     individualization, creativity and movement exploration.
    
   <li> Formal instruction in specific dance forms should not
     begin before age 7 or 8 depending on the development of
     the child and previous experience.
    
  <li> Pointe work (ballet dancing on "toe") should not begin
     before there is well-developed body coordination, adequate
     strength, proper skeletal alignment and working body
     placement. Special attention must be given to the
     development of the feet, legs and back. Very few children
     should start pointe work before age 11.

<B>Helping A Child Enjoy Imaginative Writing</B>
<br><br>

     All young children love to play with words. They love to
make jokes and puns, sing songs, invent names and listen to and
tell stories. It is a short step from loving such language play
to loving writing.<br><br>

     You can help your child make that short but important
step:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Encourage your child's curiosity and imaginative play.
    
  <li> Make reading an important part of your family life.
    
  <li> Respect your child's interests in writing and reading.
    
  <li> Suggest imaginative ways to write for school and for fun.
</ul>

<B>Preparing Your Child for Writing
</B><br><br>

     Your family's attitudes and habits can make learning to
write natural and fun for your child rather than hard and
frustrating. You can lay a firm foundation for future writing
by reading and telling stories to your child: by letting your
child know that you, too, enjoy and learn from books; by
respecting your child's curiosity and imagination.<br><br>

     Reading and listening to stories help make writing easier.
Children who read or hear stories regularly develop a natural
understanding of how sentences, ideas and narratives work, and
so have a much easier time later when these skills are "taught"
to them in school. Reading can also make your child more eager
to write. Just as young sports fans long to go out onto the
playing fields, so children who love reading want to make up
their own stories and poems.<br><br>


Here are three ways to prepare your child for writing:<br><br>

<ol>
 <li> <i>Read aloud to your children</i>, even when they are very
     little. When you read aloud, children get not only a good
     story but also a moment of intimacy with you that adds to
     their good feeling about books and writing. Also, the fact
     that you take the trouble to read shows that you respect
     the written word. Keep reading aloud even after children
     can read on their own. You can read more advanced books
     than your child is reading, or return to old favorites
     together. As children listen, they come to see that
     different kinds of writing have different effects on us.

  <li> Encourage children to read by <i>taking them to the library.</i>
     Give books as presents. Be patient. Don't worry if at first
     your child is interested only in comics. Children who enjoy
     reading simple books will move on to more mature ones.    

  <li> <i>Answer your children's questions and listen to their
     stories.</i> If children think that you don't care about what
     they say, they will not feel confident about expressing 
     themselves, aloud or on paper. Also, your explanations help
     them understand how to organize their own thoughts.
</ol>


<B>"Writing" Before Your Child Can Write</B><br><br>


     Writing with children helps them learn to organize their
ideas and stories and to think of themselves as authors. Here
are a few ways to have fun "writing" with children who can't
yet write on their own.<br><br>

     "Tell me a story." Ask your child to tell you a story.
Write it down as it is told. Don't worry if you are a slow
writer. While waiting for you to finish copying a line, your
child will be thinking about what happens next in the story. If
your child loses track of the story, you can help by reading it
back and by asking questions like: "So then what happened?" or
"What about the bad pirate?" Be careful not to "steal" the
story by making too many suggestions. Children might take your
contributions as criticisms, and end up feeling as if they've
failed.<br><br>

     The team story. This is a good party game. Ask your child
and some friends to form a circle and take turns making up one
big story together. If the children are shy, you can start it
off. Keep going until everyone has had a turn or the story
feels finished, then read it back with gusto. You'll be
surprised by how much fun this is.<br><br>

     Playtime. Young children spend much of their free time
pretending they are other people -- superheroes, princesses,
astronauts. Creating a play is a natural literary form for
children. Have your child (perhaps with some friends) dictate a
play or story to you. When it is finished, the children can act
it out. Let them change the play as they act it out, if they
wish.<br><br>

     "Publication." Just like adult authors, children write to
entertain themselves, but they also like to have other people
appreciate their work. There are many ways to "publish" your
children's writing. You can put it up on a bulletin board or
the refrigerator. You can type it, read it aloud, or photocopy
it and give it to family, friends and teachers. You can also
make a child's writing into little books (with illustrations by
the author) and keep them on a special shelf.<br><br>

     It is perfectly all right to take dictation from your
child even after they can write on their own. As long as
children enjoy the experience, it is good for the development
of their writing.<br><br>


<B>Encouraging Children To Write On Their Own</B><br><br>


<i>Writing for School</i><br><br>


     Much of your child's writing will be done at school. One
way to help your child enjoy school writing is to take an
interest in it. Give special praise for those compositions
based on imaginative assignments -- stories, poems, etc. 
because these are the sort your child is most likely to want to
try doing independently.<br><br>

     If a child enjoys writing in school, provide the time and
space at home to continue writing and encourage imaginative
experiments. If your child is bored by school. Writing
assignments, try to find ways of making them more interesting.
Say the assignment is to answer the question "What is love?"
One way of answering is to be wacky: "Love is a school bus full
of rutabagas." Another is to be honest: "I don't know what love
is. Sometimes I hate the people I am supposed to love...."
Remember, many teachers like surprising responses.<br><br>


<i>Writing at Home</i><br><br>


     Many children begin writing on their own at home simply
because it is fun. For some this is a natural outgrowth of
writing with their parents. Other children need encouragement.
The first thing you should do to encourage your child to write
at home is provide the basics that all writers need, young or
old:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> The tools of the trade: paper, pencils and pens; if
     possible a typewriter or computer.

  <li> A place to write that is comfortable and quiet.

   <li> Time enough not only to write but to look for inspiration
     by daydreaming and letting the imagination wander.
</ul>
     You can make writing special by allowing your child to use
your desk, your typewriter or computer, or just your favorite
pen. You can fold several sheets of typing paper in half staple
the folded edge, and say, "Here is an empty book, ready, to be
filled!"<br><br>

     Don't be pushy. Encouraging your child to write is a
delicate matter. Many children react to pressure by becoming
afraid of failure. Many children don't want to write because
they're afraid of making spelling mistakes. Tell children that
when they, write the poems and stories for themselves, they
don't have to spell every thing right. Only when children are
ready, to revise or publish their writing do they need to go
over spelling, punctuation, etc. School homework is a required
activity for children, but writing poems and stories at home
ought to be voluntary -- suggested only as a way of having fun.
Children will write a lot if they enjoy it.<br><br>


<B>Having Fun With Writing</B><br><br>


     If your children already like to write at home, it is
probably best not to meddle. Children will enjoy writing more
if they feel that it is really their own. But if they ask for
help, or you see that they are running out of inspiration, here
are a few ideas you could try:<br><br>
<dl>
  <dt> Riddles.<dd>Ask your child to describe something without
     revealing what the thing is. Example: "I come from a land
     where everything is upside-down. I have a pocket but I
     don't wear clothes. I have four legs but I don't walk.
     What am I?" (Answer: a kangaroo.) Writing fiddles
     improves children's ability to describe accurately.
    
  <dt> Apologies.<dd> Suggest that your child write a series of
     apologies for wild offenses. Example: "I'm sorry I told
     your mother that a pack of meat-eating butterflies had
     eaten your little sister, but I couldn't think of anything
     else to say and I didn't know she'd believe me." To make a
     surprising apology, your children will have to visualize a
     situation vividly.

  <dt> Impossible day. <dd>Suggest that your child write a story
     about a day when only impossible things happened. Example:
     "While my father was tiding his crayon, a camel flew in
     and kissed my mother on the cheek." The more impossible,
     the better. The joy of this type of story is that it
     invites children to search their minds for startling words
     and combinations.
    
   <dt> First sentences. <dd>Help your child start a story by
     providing a first sentence that sets up a strange or
     intriguing situation. For example: "On Saturday morning I
     noticed a flower beginning to grow out of the center of my
     forehead." Or, "When we reached the mountaintop, we found
     a rope hanging from the sky." It takes creative and
     connected thinking to make an attractive story out of such
     ideas.

   <dt> Photostories. <dd>Suggest that children flip through a
     magazine until they find an interesting photograph. Then,
     have them write a story (without reading the caption or
     article) that describes what happened before, during and
     after the photograph was taken. This idea also works well
     with paintings and family photographs, particularly if
     they are of people or places the children have never
     known. Whatever the subject matter, the story will help
     your children think logically and creatively about events.

   <dt> Dialogues. <dd>Suggest that your child write a conversation
     between two related objects, like a pencil and paper, a
     fork and meat, their own feet and the sidewalk. How would
     it feel to be the floor? How would it feel to be feet?
     Creating dialogues helps children think about the ways
     objects or ideas are linked.
</dl>

<B>Your Response To Your Child's Writing</B><br><br>


     Your response to your children's writing is all-important.
If you are proud of what they have written at home or at
school, they will also be proud and will want to do more. If
you are indifferent or too critical, they will find writing
much more difficult.<br><br>
<ul>
   <li> First point out what you like in your child's writing.
     Praising children's strengths is a much more effective way
     of helping them to write well than pointing out weakness.
     You can always find something to praise. Be specific and
     honest. If you praise everything uniformly, your praise
     will lose its effect.

  <li> Be very gentle with your criticisms, especially with
     beginning writers. Always introduce your concerns after
     some praise. Remember that your main purpose is not to
     turn the child into a Shakespeare, but to encourage the
     child to enjoy writing. As long as children keep writing,
     they will improve.

   <li> Praise what is unique or unexpected in your child's work,
     even if it seems a bit out of place, for it is in such
     unconventional parts that children are often truest to
     their own way of seeing things. If children feel free to
     be "different," they are much more likely to value writing
     as a mode of genuine self-expression.

  <li> Don't worry if your child wants to write only about
     superheroes or puppies. A child who enjoys writing will
     inevitably move on to other topics.
</ul>

     The visual arts interpret and reflect life. Through
studying art, children gain valuable insights about the world
along with knowledge and skills they can use throughout their
lives.<br><br>

The Scope of Learning
<B>The Scope of Learning</B><br><br>


     Art education -- appreciation courses, hands-on art
classes, museum visits and parent-assisted activities -- helps
children develop their own creative skills and understand the
artistic work of others. By encouraging visual arts education,
you will help your children to:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> respond to what they see in art and in the world around
     them;

  <li> perceive and grasp relationships in their environment;

  <li> think creatively while developing skills in drawing,
     painting, sculpting, designing, crafting, etc;

  <li> gain manipulative and organizing skills through their own
     creative work;

  <li> learn about humankind's vast cultural heritage;

   <li> understand the nature of art and the creative process;

   <li> make informed esthetic judgments about art.
</ul>
     To educate children, parents along with teachers and
museum professionals must keep in mind each student's interests
as well as his intellectual, social and esthetic maturity. The
instruction should be interesting in order to stimulate
intellectual growth. Not all activities should get the same
emphasis at each age or for each student. Find opportunities
that allow your child to:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Take close looks at both natural and cultural objects of
     many kinds.
    
  <LI> Find outlets for expressing perceptions and feelings
     through a variety of art forms suited to the child's
     abilities and preferences.
    
  <li> Experiment with different materials and methods in order
     to understand their different properties.
    
  <li> Evaluate and review the child's work so that the youngster
     gains understanding of formal structure and the potential
     for developing line, form, color, shape and texture.
    
  <li> Read about, look at, and discuss works of art from other
     past and modern cultures; to do this, use different
     educational, media and community resources.
    
  <li> Evaluate the child's works of art as well as those of
     artists past and present.
    
  <li> See artists and designers at work in classroom and museum
     demonstrations, on film and video.
    
  <li> Engage in arts activities -- museum visits, tours of art
     schools, participation in art classes -- to apply new
     knowledge the child has gained.
</ul>

<B>At Home and About Town</B><br><br>


<i>You, Your Child and the Visual Arts</i><br><br>


     Here are activities you can use to introduce your child to
the world of art. Remember that your own attitudes make strong
impressions on your child. A sense of openness to the visual
arts of diverse cultures, along with a willingness to ask
questions about art, are as important for you as for the child.<br><br>


<i>At Home and About Town</i><br><br>


     "Seeing" versus looking is something you can encourage
every day. Teach your child to see colors, shapes and textures
in the world at large. Help your child recognize and understand
the signs and symbols that abound in our lives. Make a game out
of identifying elements of art as you ride in the car or take
family walks. You will discover art all around: in local
architecture, monuments, billboards, a park's design, the
patterns of streets and signs as well as in traditional arts
and crafts.<br><br>

     Encourage your child to react to visual stimuli -- colors,
shapes, sizes, textures and materials -- found in art dealing
with a wide range of situations and subjects. Some will be more
engaging than others. Children generally prefer bright colors,
realism and familiar subject matter.<br><br>

     To help get children involved:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Find a wall at home that your children can use to display
     reproductions or original art that they have created. Or
     set up an exhibition in an "art comer."

  <li> Provide a space in which your child can explore different
     media such as paints, crayons and clay. (Pick an
     easy-to-clean space and dress in washables.)

  <li> Make available various two- and three-dimensional
     materials: paper to cut-and-paste, blocks to build.
    
  <li> Ask the art teacher at school about appropriate materials
     for your child at different development levels.
</UL>
     To keep interest alive:
<ul>
  <li> Encourage and compliment your child's creative efforts.
     Ask the youngster to tell you about the art. Do NOT say
     what you think is "wrong" with it or how you think it
     should be done.

   <li> Remind yourself that complex and fine motor skills take
     time to develop. Offer experiences that strengthen skills
     already learned. Provide materials and tools that broaden
     the range of creativity.

   <li> Remember that many children paint and draw for no other
     reason than the pleasure it gives them. These activities
     can be easily fostered.
</ul>

<B>At the Museum, Gallery or Arts Center</B><br><br>


<i>At the Museum, Gallery or Arts Center</i><br><br>


     Planned in advance, a visit to a local art center, gallery
or museum can be rewarding, exciting and stimulating for both
parent and child. Your state arts agency or local council can
provide information about art exhibitions -- where they are,
and what there is to see. Ask about programs designed for
children and about parent-and-child events.<br><br>

     Take time to plan your visit so that it meets your child's
physical and learning needs. Identify in advance the exhibit
areas and an works you wish to see. Learn where benches,
restrooms and cafeterias are located.<br><br>

     Don't overwhelm or tire children by overdoing it. If you
are visiting a large museum, stay in two or three galleries,
depending on the child's age and abilities. A number of short
visits are better than a long one that is overwhelming.<br><br>

     By listening carefully to your child before planning a
trip, you will learn what things he or she is most interested
in seeing. Remember to meet a child's physical need for
movement and change while engaged in "seeing and appreciating."
If a child expresses interest in a work of art you did not
select, spend time with it. Children may get frustrated at
having to view art selected for them, rather than what they
choose for themselves.<br><br>


<B>Making Art Trips Fun</B><br><br>


     Younger children have both a shorter attention span and
lower level of retention. For the very young, pictures and
drawings in books can spark interest in the visual arts and you
can build from there. It is a good idea to have children view
works of art on several occasions. They will remember some
vividly, while a second visit and talking about the works will
reinforce first impressions.<br><br>

     Also, it is good to encourage children to respond to
pictures, sculptures and crafts in their own way. Resist the
urge to tell them what they should see, feel or think. After a
first experience, you can discuss the art, listening to the
child's interpretation. Then share information you have about
the work, the artist who made it, and how it was achieved. The
facts you want to share should be appealing and easy to
understand.<br><br>

     A Word of Warning: At the first sign of boredom, fatigue
or disinterest, take a rest or quit for the day!<br><br>


More suggestions for making the arts enjoyable:<br><br>

<ul>
  <li> Museum shops sell postcards, posters of art works and
     books about art and artists written especially for
     children. Your child may want to buy a book or
     reproduction of a particular favorite.
    
   <li>Emphasize what the child understands and learns. Make
     connections with what he already knows. Ask what she is
     studying in school that relates to pictures you saw. Tie
     your "seeing" experiences into those subjects.
    
</ul>

     To get professional arts training for your child, check
with your school's art teacher, or with your local or state
arts agency for the names of qualified instructors and schools.<br><br>

<B>Music and Your Child's Education</B><br><br>


     Why should your child study music? From elementary school
onwards, music study, helps children acquire knowledge, skills
and attitudes that influence them throughout their lives.
In addition to learning music for its own sake, children who
participate in music learn coordination, goalsetting,
concentration and cooperation.<br><br>
<blockquote>
     The music in my heart I bore, long after it was heard no
more.<br><br>

--William Wordsworth
</blockquote>

<B>What You Can Do</B><br><br>


     As a parent, you can encourage your child's love of music
and nurture his or her musical talents in a number of ways: By
listening to good music programs and recordings together, by
attending musical events and making music as a family, by
praising children for their musical activities and
accomplishments. As a result of music-listening and
music-making experiences, elementary school children can become
better listeners and develop musical intelligence. They also
develop pride and a sense of accomplishment as young musicians.<br><br>


<i>Suggested Activities</i><br><br>


     Listening to music, moving to music and playing musical
games are best for small children and good for elementary
students as well. By ages five to eight, many children are
ready for one-on-one music lessons. You can help your child
choose an instrument by consulting the school music teacher and
by noticing what sounds your child most enjoys while listening
to music. If you decide to supplement lessons offered at the
school with private lessons, you can find a good teacher by
asking the school music teacher or the music faculty at a local
university for recommendations.<br><br>

     Group classes are particularly supportive for young
children. In the early stages, a parent should be in the room
with the child during at-home practice periods to offer
encouragement and praise and to request specific songs ("That
was really good! Would you play it again for me?") It is
impossible to give any child too much encouragement. Success at
music-making bolsters self-esteem.<br><br>


<i>When To Start</i><br><br>

<ul>
  <li> Children can begin piano lessons whenever they can sit on
     a piano bench and concentrate.
    
  <li> Stringed-instrument study can begin very early (if
     scaled-down instruments are used) -- preferably by grade
     four.
    
  <li> Study on wind instruments should begin by grade five.
</ul>    
     You can invest in your child's future by ensuring that
your school has good music programs, taught by certified music
specialists in general music, instrumental music and choral
instruction from pre-kindergarten through high school.<br><br>


<B>What Should Your Child Learn?</B><br><br>


What to Look For in Elementary School<br><br>

<ul>
  <li> Opportunities for all students: to sing, move to music,
     and learn to play classroom instruments; to develop skills
     in performing, reading, creating, listening to and
     describing music; to learn to use music vocabulary and
     read and write music notation; to develop enjoyment of and
     sensitivities to music; to explore music from a variety of
     cultures.
    
   <li> Opportunities for students to participate in both choral
     and instrumental music starting in grade four.
    
   <li> Special experiences for gifted and handicapped students.
    
   <li> Instruction by certified music educators supplemented by
     classroom teachers.

   <li> Adequate textbooks, printed music, instruments, equipment,
     recordings and other music materials.
    
   <li> Music rooms that have adequate space, ventilation and
     light as well as access to a good piano, risers,
     audiovisual equipment and a good sound system.
</ul>    
     Students in grades one through three should learn to enjoy
and explore music. By the end of grade three, students should
realize that music is an important part of everyday life and be
able to perform and create it. They should be able to use music
as a means of individual expression and to listen to the
creations of other people with respect, curiosity and pleasure.<br><br>

     Students in grades four through six should build on the
skills they developed earlier. By the end of grade six, they
should be able to participate in music activities by singing and
playing instruments. They should enjoy listening to most types
of music, and be able to describe musical works and discuss
their personal responses to them.<br><br>


<B>How You Can Help Your Child</B><br><br>


     At every age, your child should have regular opportunities
to:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> hear, sing or play music with and for family and friends
     in a relaxed setting.
    
   <li> take part in community music events that relate directly
     to the child's own culture and that involve distinctly
     different cultures.
    
   <li> join you in watching music and arts programs on
     television. (To make the most of these experiences, ask
     your child questions about the program afterward -- not
     during the performance.)
</ul>    

How to Make Your Child's life Musical<br><br>

<ul>
   <li> Encourage your child to participate in general music
     classes and performing ensembles.
    
   <li> When school offers band or string instrument instruction,
     help your child choose an instrument.
    
   <li> Visit the classroom to gain a better understanding of what
     takes place in the music program.
    
   <li> Volunteer to chaperon trips to music events and work to
     bring outstanding performers to your child's school.
    
   <li> Attend concerts with your child.
    
   <li> Help with home practice and set scheduled practice times.
     Set up a well-lit, quiet practice area free from
     distractions. Ask your child to play for you and others,
     and give sincere and frequent praise. Do not be overly
     critical; the music teacher will correct problems. Listen
     and show enthusiasm for your child's efforts and
     achievements.

<H3><a name="THE THEATER AND CHILDREN">The Theater and Children </a></H3>
 
     Children of all ages love to pretend, to enter worlds of
the imagination. As toddlers, they mimic things they see in
everyday life. By elementary school age, they act out stories,
creating original plots or adapting fairy tales and real-life
events. By middle school they're ready for more formal
play-acting: going on stage to present prepared scripts,
whether scenes from the classics or their own inventions. In
other words, each stage of childhood has its own forms of
drama, and all these forms help children grow and learn.<br><br>


<B>"Dramatic Play" and "Creative Drama"</B><br><br>


     Children enter the world of make-believe first as toddlers
when they discover the soul of theater by engaging in
activities they see around them and by putting themselves in
the places of others. This activity involves mind, body and
imagination. It is dramatic play, what one educator calls
"rehearsal for life." An extension of ordinary play, creative
play--the root of theater--is essential to a child's full
development.<br><br>

     As children grow older, their play develops structure.
They act out favorite stories, create original situations from
life experiences, and imagine themselves in fantasy worlds
where anything is possible. If they are encouraged in this kind
of play at home, they become ready for creative drama by the
time they enter primary school. As essential as dramatic play
is to a child's healthy development, creative drama is an art
form, a socializing activity and a means of learning. At this
point, guidance by an experienced teacher or leader is needed,
someone to guide the drama, to help the young players deepen
their experiences and express themselves more effectively.<br><br>

     Creative drama is not acting as adults think of it. It
requires no script or memorized lines. It is improvised and
centers on children as the participants. Older children often
want to extend the process and present their work for an
audience. This is fine, so long as the desire to "go public"
comes from them, for it is the process rather than the product
that is important for youngsters.<br><br>

     In middle school or junior high, many children become
ready for what most people think of as the "theater arts" which
involve a stage, actors and a play. This implies theater's
formal elements: acting, directing, scene and costume design,
as well as technical concerns such as stage management, set
building, lighting, publicity, etc.<br><br>

     Besides creating theater in its many forms, children also
benefit from seeing it. Children's theater, comprising an
ever-growing diversity of companies and scripts, is an
excellent introduction to lifelong enjoyment of theater.
For young children the theater arts are best used informally
and playfully. This offers pre-kindergarten and elementary-age
children opportunities to make theater that is a natural
extension of their physical, intellectual and emotional lives.
Creative drama builds on the universal human desire to
understand our world by imitating and reenacting it.<br><br>

     As a parent, you can help your child enjoy dramatic play,
even if you have had no theater background or experience. First
of all, you can encourage your child to play. Enter into the
game, taking cues as to your role. For example, your daughter
may want you to be a storekeeper or a customer, a doctor or a
patient, a bus driver or passenger, depending on which
character she wants to be. Provide a place for creative drama.
This could be a comer of the child's room where toys are kept.
"Props" can be simple and commonplace. For instance, a scarf
can become a shawl, a sash or any number of things. Hats can
denote different characters. Baskets, bags and plastic dishes
are all useful props.<br><br>

     Dramatic play need not be confined to one space, for it is
spontaneous and the impulse to enact a character or imitate an
action is rarely planned in advance. Chances are it will be
brief and fragmentary, although as children grow older the game
becomes longer and more detailed. Favorite stories and
activities are often repeated, but even with repetition new
ideas are constantly generated, thus fostering continued
imaginative growth for the children.<br><br>

     Read aloud and tell stories. Good literature suggests many
possibilities and discourages a tendency to imitate situations
seen on television. However, many ideas may come from real life
issues, even for very young children.<br><br>

     Finally, enjoy these spontaneous moments. Remember that
they are the child's first engagement with an art form and can
lead to lifelong pleasure. You are not encouraging a career in
the theater; you are helping in the development of a human
being through this most human of the arts, the theater.<br><br>


<B>Benefits of Creative Drama</B><br><br>


<i>What Does Creative Drama Offer to Young Children?</i>
<br><br>

     Creative drama provides many benefits, among them:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Development of imagination and esthetic awareness
    
  <li> Independent and critical thinking
    
  <li> Social growth and the ability to work with others
    
  <li> Improved communication skills
    
  <li> Healthy release of emotion
    
  <li> Knowledge of self
    
  <li> Fun and recreation

  <li> An introduction to the theater
</ul>

<i>What Do You, as a Parent, Get Out of It?</i><br><br>


     Creative drama offers benefits for parents too:<br><br>
<ul>
   <li> Quality time spent with four young child in creative
     moments.
    
  <li> Valuable insights into the observations, impressions,
     interests, fears and humor that your child reveals.
    
  <li> Fun! You can both enjoy dramatic play for the pure fun of
     it.
</ul>

<B>Finding Creative Resources</B><br><br>


     Because creative drama is a group activity requiting
skilled leadership, you should check with your child's teacher
or principal to see whether it is already part of the school
program. It may be that you will want to look further to find
opportunities in your community for classes in the performing
arts. While many schools are now adding theater to the
curriculum, unfortunately it is absent in most elementary
schools. Therefore, you should look for available resources in
the following places:<br><br>
<ul>
  <li> Community centers and city and county recreation
     departments.
    
  <li> Libraries, museums, churches, playgrounds and camps, YMCAs
     and YWCAs.
    
  <li> Local colleges and universities for year-round or summer
     classes for children.
    
  <li> Performing arts centers, professional and community
     theaters.
</ul>
     Many facilities have splendid programs in the arts. Visit
classes, check the age levels of the children and the
preparation of the teachers. Classes in creative drama,
puppetry, mime and dance offer enrichment beyond whatever the
school provides. Again, for the young child, the chance to
explore creatively and act spontaneously is more valuable than
pressured situations involving either a performance for an
audience or a predetermined product.<br><br>

     While creative drama involves children as active
participants, children's theater engages them as audience.
Plays range from entertainment for the primary grades to more
mature material designed for junior high school. Many, adult
plays can be enjoyed by older teenagers and (depending on the
subject matter and the style of the production) by younger
audiences as well.<br><br>

     Children's theater companies should be checked carefully,
before taking a child to a performance or engaging a company
for a school assembly. Many plays are over-simplified for the
very young, with occasional lines aimed at the adults in the
audience; this is a condescending practice and children are
quick to perceive it. Some good sources of information about
children's theater companies are: theater departments of
colleges and universities; newspaper reviews, if available;
local or state arts councils; the American Alliance for Theater
and Education (AATE). In addition, many regional arts agencies
support touting theaters for children and young audiences. Your
state arts council can put you in touch with the regional
organization for your area.<br><br>


<B>Benefits of Attending the Theater</B><br><br>


     Going to the theater has many benefits for children, among
them:<br><br>
<ul>
   <LI> Appreciation of theater as an esthetic experience.
    
  <LI> Increased awareness of social and cultural values.
    
  <li> Sharing in a communal art form.
    
  <LI> Increased knowledge of history and human events.
</ul>

<i>Elements of a Good Production</i><br><br>


     By attending children's theater regularly, both parent and
child gain personal likes and dislikes and can grasp what is an
excellent production as opposed to one that is poor or merely
competent. If you have not attended children's theater
regularly, here are some elements that characterize a good
production, along with some questions concerning each element.
Not every criterion will apply to every production.<br><br>
<dl>
  <DT> A Good Story: <dd>Children's theater today is wide-ranging,
     offering plays from traditional fairy tales to
     homelessness and drug abuse. Whatever the topic, a good
     production will clarify its subject. Did you learn
     something new or gain a new insight through the play?
    
  <DT> Credible Characters:<dd> A "willing suspension of disbelief"
     is necessary for viewing theater, but the characters
     should be believable. Did actions seem totally
     out-of-character for someone in the play? If so, did you
     lose interest in the action?

  <DT> Excellent Performance Skills (acting, dance, music, and
     any other skills called for such as juggling, fencing,
     etc.): <dd>Do the skills support the believability of the
     characters? Are they at a level befitting the expectations
     of the actors, both in terms of the amateur or
     professional status of the company and the actions of the
     characters?

   <DT> Effective Visual Elements: <dd>Do scenery, costumes, and
     lighting help transport you to the place and time of the
     play? Are they visually appealing? In cases where scenery
     and lighting are minimal or absent, did the production
     stimulate your imagination in other effective ways?

   <DT> Challenging Ideas:<dd> A good script can provoke thought,
     bring new ideas to light, perhaps help you look at a facet
     of life in a new or different way. Ask your child what he
     or she got from a performance. Try open-ended questions
     such as: What did you see on the stage? What was a
     particular character trying to do? What happened at the
     very beginning? The discussion you are likely to have may
     surprise you.

  <DT> Insight into Other Cultures:<dd> Theater can take us in time
     and place to other communities and cultures. Did the
     production help you to learn about cultural or ethnic
     traditions? If the play was in the present time, were
     there characters of culturally diverse backgrounds
     reflecting contemporary society?
    
  <DT> Strong Emotional Response and Involvement in the plot:<dd>
     Were you moved by the action of the play? Tears or
     laughter are sure signs that the playwright and actors
     reached you. While emotions can't always be verbalized, a
     discussion with your child about his or her feelings about
     what happened can benefit both of you.
</dl>    
     Children's theater includes a wide range of subject matter:
folk and fairy tales; contemporary social issues, adventure
stories; historical and biographical dramas. The form may be
the straight dramatic play, the musical, documentary, or
movement theater. In every case, however, the story line or
theme should be clear and honestly presented and the production
should be enjoyable.<br><br>

     The American Alliance for theater and Education: Artists and
Educators Serving Young People, a professional organization,
promotes the highest standards of excellence in drama and
theater education for children and youth. We provide the
theater educator and theater artist with a network of resources
and support, a base for advocacy, and programs and projects
that focus on the importance of drama in the human experience.

<P> PHILADELPHIA, March 11, 1996 -- It s almost Little League season again, and if you're a coach, there are 10 tips you should know to help keep your players healthy.</P>

<P>     "The number one tip coaches should remember is that children are not miniature adults and shouldn't be treated as such," says Jim Rogers, a certified athletic trainer in Temple University Hospital's sports Medicine Center.</P>

<P>     "This may seem obvious, but many adults don't realize children's bodies can't take the same amount of physical stress adult bodies can take. That's because children are still growing and therefore are more susceptible to injury."</P>

<P>     Rogers offers coaches these other tips to prevent injury:</P>
     <UL TYPE=DISC>
	

<LI>Stretching the muscles related to the activity is very important.
For example, if a child is pitching, he should concentrate on stretching
his arm and back muscles. If a child is catching, the focus should be
on the legs and back. <br><br>

<LI>A good warm-tip is just as important as stretching. A warm-up can involve light calisthenics or a short jog. This helps raise the core body temperature and prepares all the body's muscles for physical activity.<br><br>

<LI>Children should not be encouraged to "play through pain." Pain 
is a warning sign of injury. Ignoring it can lead to greater injury.<br><br>

<LI>Swelling with pain and limitation of motion are two signs that
are especially significant in children -- don't ignore them. They may
mean the child has a more serious injury than initially suspected.<br><br>

<LI>Rest is by far the most powerful therapy in youth sports injuries. Nothing helps an injury heal faster than rest.<br><br>

<LI>Children who play on more than one team are especially at risk
for overuse injuries. Overuse injuries are caused by repetitive stress
put on the same part of the body over and over again.<br><br>

<LI>Injuries that look like sprains in adults can be fractures in children. Children are more susceptible to fractures, because their bones are still growing.<br><br>

<LI> Children's growth spurts can make for increased risk of injury. A particularly sensitive area in a child's body during a growth spurt is the growth plate -- the area of growth in the bone. Growth plates are weak spots in a child's body and can be the source of injury if the child is pushed beyond his limit athletically.<br><br>

<LI> Ice is a universal first-aid treatment for minor sports injuries. Regular ice packs -- not chemical packs -- should be available at all games and practices. Ice controls the pain and swelling caused by common injuries such as sprains, strains and contusions.<br><br>

<P> ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS A CHILD CAN DO IS PLAY<BR></P>
</center><BR>
<hr>


<h3> <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<P>     One of the most important things a child do is play.
Play is the essential joy of childhood and is also the way
children learn about themselves, their environment and the
people around them.  As they play, children learn to solve
problems, get along with other people and control their
bodies as they enrich their creativity and develop leadership
skills.  When children play with a broad variety of toys, the
experiences help them to develop to their fullest potential.</P>

<P>     Children bring boundless energy and imagination to their
play with toys and constantly developing new and creative
ways to play.  Because there are so many different kinds of
toys and novel way to play with them, children learn that the
world is a diverse place with unlimited possibilities.  Toys
thus have an exciting role in helping children to become
mature, confident and imaginative adults.</P>

<P>     This booklet has been designed to help you provide the
best play opportunities for your child, describes how the toy
industry and government work together to ensure toy safety
and offers simple charts to guide you as you do your toy
shopping.  Have fun!                                        </P>

<h3> <a name="Learning through Play">Learning through Play</a></h3>


<P>     Play is essential to a child's development and is the
way that youngsters learn the skills they will need for a
happy and capable adulthood.  According to child development
specialist, Mary Sinker, these are just some of the ways a
child learns while playing.</P>

<P>     Physical skills are developed through movement as a
child learns to reach, grasp, crawl, run, climb and balance.
Dexterity develops as he or she handles objects in play.</P>

<P>     Language develops as a child plays and interacts with
others.  Beginning with cooing games with a parent and
evolving to sophisticated levels such as telling stories and
jokes, the ability to use language increases as the child
plays.
     Social skills grow as the child plays.  Learning to
cooperate, negotiate, take turns and play by the rules are
all important skills learned in early games.  It is through
imaginative play that the child begins to learn some of the
roles and rules of society.</P>

<P>     Understanding how the world works develops as a result
of problem solving with toys.  What fits here?  How big is
that?  Is this color the same as that color?  How can I
balance these?  A child moves on to higher levels of thought
as he or she plays in a stimulating environment.</P>

<P>     Emotional well being develops through positive play
experiences.  When children feel successful and capable as
they play, they acquire important ingredients for emotional
health.  Sharing play experiences also forges strong bonds
between parent and child throughout childhood.              3</P>

<h3> <a name="Parental Involvement in Play">Parental Involvement in
Play</a></h3>


<P>     Parents are their child's first and best playmates.  Not
only do parents have an important role in choosing good toys,
but research shows that the most creative children are those
who have had adults involved in their play.  The richest play
occurs when the adult takes an active role and plays
alongside the child, rather than just providing the toys or
supervising the activity.</P>

<P>     Becoming part of a child's play may take practice; after
all, we have been taught to give up childish things and "grow
up."  Here are some suggestions for joining your child's
play:</P>

<P>     <B>Observe:</B>  Watch your child closely to determine his or
her skill levels and favorite activities.</P>
    <P> <B>Follow:</B>  join in and play at the child's level.  You
can add to the complexity of the play, but let your child be
in control and determine the direction of the play.</P>
   <P>  <B>Be Creative:</B>  Rediscover the child inside yourself and
let go of the adult notion that there is only one way to play
with a toy.  Use toys as "springboards" and you'll be amazed
at how many different ways you can play.</P>
     <P><B>Have Fun:</B>  The wonderful thing about playing is that
everyone is successful at it.  Don't use playtime to test or
stretch your child's skills.  It's a time to feel good about
yourself and each other--and to just have fun together.</P>

<h3> <a name="Safety">Safety</a></h3>

<B>How the Federal Government and Industry Cooperate to Regulate
Toy Safety</B>

<P>     Toys have the distinction of being one of the most
closely monitored and regulated products on the market.  This
is understandable, given that over 2.6 billion toys are
purchased each year and parents are naturally very
       (Graphic omitted between pp 4 and 5)
concerned about the products they give their children.</P>
<P>     The toy industry and the Federal government work closely
together to ensure that toys are among the safest products
brought into the home.  The United States Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), created in 1973 and headquartered
in Bethesda, Maryland, has the authority to develop and
enforce safety regulations for toys and other children's
products.  The Commission employs teams of field inspectors
to monitor the marketplace for both domestically- and
foreign-produced toys that could pose safety hazards.</P>
<P>     The CPSC's regulations are incorporated by reference in
the industry's voluntary safety standard, ASTM F963, and are
a chief example of Toy Manufacturers of America's
coordination and cooperation with the CPSC.  TMA also works
regularly with the Commission to develop safety testing
procedures and to monitor any potential hazards associated
with toys already in the market.</P>
<P>     The American voluntary manufacturers' standards are
known as the most comprehensive in the world and any safety
requirements established by the CPSC are included in ASTM
F963.  (Many companies will note their compliance with the
standard on toy packaging.)  A toy may go through over one
hundred safety tests designated to duplicate the kind of use
and abuse it may get in the hands of a child.</P>
<P>     One of the most important safety tests a manufacturer
conducts is for small parts.  Since children under the age of
three are very likely to put objects in their mouths, it is
especially critical that toys intended for infants and
toddlers be manufactured with oversized pieces which meet
U.S. safety specifications.                                 </P>
<P>     A recent CPSC study of hospital emergency room data
suggests that the most frequent causes of injury involving
toys are falling on, tripping over or being hit with toys.
(In fact, toy-related and toy-caused accidents, which sound
so similar, are actually very different.  "Toy-related"
accidents happen for any number of reasons but are not due to
product flaws--e.g., tripping in the dark over a toy that was
not put away after play.  "Toy-caused" accidents, which occur
due to a fault in the toy's design, material content,
construction or performance, are infrequent.)</P>
<P>     The work that the toy industry does to design and
produce safe toys, as well as to communicate the importance
of proper adult supervision, continues to pay off by making
toys one of the safest consumer products available.</P>

<B>Supervision is Essential</B>

<P>     Careful manufacturing methods and toy selection are not
enough, however.  Toys must be used, maintained and stored
correctly to ensure that the safety built in at the factory
continues in the home.  There is no substitute, ever, for
sensible adult supervision!</P>
<P>     Parents and others responsible for a child's care must
be safety experts.  Remember, too, that youngsters learn safe
play habits and responsibility from grownups.  Read
instructions carefully to make sure that both you and child
understand them.  Special attention to directions will result
in safer play and longer toy life.
     Always remove and immediately discard all packaging
                  (Graphic omitted)
from a toy before giving it to a baby or small child.</P>

<B>A Few Words About Baby Safety</B>

<P>     An infant's environment should be made as hazard-free as
possible.  Crib gyms and mobiles must be removed once the
infant reaches five months of age or begins to push up on
hands and knees.  Remember that crib toys such as stuffed
animals, rattle and beads should never be hung or attached to
a crib, playpen or carriage with any sort of string or
ribbon.  (No matter how harmless you may think this is, there
is the possibility of the cord getting attached to a button
or strap of clothing or wrapped around hands, feet or neck.)</P>
<P>     For additional ideas on the selection and care of baby's
crib, stroller, car seat and other non-toy essentials, write
to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association for their
free brochure, "Safe and Sound for Baby."  Send a self-
addressed, stamped envelope (U.S. postage only) to JPMA, Two
Greentree Centre, Suite 225, P.O Box 955, Marlton, NJ 08053.</P>

<B>Toy Maintenance</B>

<P>     The proper selection of toys and supervision of play are
not the only steps that parents can take to ensure safe and
fun playtime.  Since toys are among the first things a child
considers his or her own, adults should encourage a youngster
to assume responsibility by demonstrating how to use and care
for toys.</P>
<P>     Spot check toys regularly for minor damage and urge
children to let you know when toys need repair.  A child does
not always see significance in a small crack or tear if the
toy is still in once piece.  Often a spot of glue, a
tightened bolt, a few drops of oil or a bit of tape will
prevent further damage and a possible accident.</P>
<P>     Do not allow toys to remain outdoors overnight.  Rain,
snow and dew cause rust and damage that increase the risk of
accidents.  A toy damaged beyond repair should be discarded
or replaced promptly.</P>
<P>     Teach children to store their toys properly in a place
selected by you.  Explain that putting toys where they
belong after play may not only prevent them from being lost,
stolen or damaged, but may also prevent younger brothers and
sisters from injuring themselves on toys intended for older
children.  Your encouragement will help to foster a sense of
responsibility and teach that care must be given to valued
belongings.</P>

<B>A Note About Balloons</B>

<P>     Because of the special attraction they hold for
children, balloons pose a risk that many parents overlook.
Since an uninflated balloon or a piece of a broken balloon
could present a choking or suffocation hazard, adults should
inflate balloons and supervise their use with children under
the age of eight.</P>

<hr>
<h3> <a name="Safety Checklist">Safety Checklist</a></h3>

<P>Remember that safety is the most important consideration
when selecting toys!  Keep this checklist of safety
suggestions handy when shopping and share it with your
child's caregivers.</P>

<P>Use recommended age labeling as a guide and look for
warnings and other safety messages on toy packaging.  This
will be covered in more detail in the next section.</P>

<P>Consider your home environment and the ages of other,
particularly younger, children in the family.  A toy intended
for an older child may be unsuitable and possibly dangerous
in the hands of a younger child.</P>

<P>Be especially careful when selecting toys for children under
the age of three.  Avoid toys with small parts that could be
swallowed or inhaled, including small balls and uninflated
balloons, and those with sharp points or rough edges.</P>

<P>Make sure that soft rattles, squeakers and teething toys,
even in their most compressed state, are too large to fit
completely in an infant's mouth.                            </P>

<P>     (Graphic omitted)</P>

<P>No matter how old a child is, if he or she is still mouthing
objects, be sure toys or pieces of toys are too large to
swallow or become lodged in the mouth or throat.</P>

<P>Check for sturdy, well-sewn seams on stuffed animals and
cloth dolls.  Be certain that eyes, noses, buttons, ribbons
and other decorations are securely fastened and cannot be
pulled or bitten off.</P>

<P>Choose electric toys with heating elements only for children
over the age of eight and instruct them to play with those
toys only when there is adult supervision.</P>

<P>Be certain that arrows and darts used by children have blunt
tips such as rubber or flexible plastic suction cups, cork or
other protective points.  Check to see that tips are attached
securely to shafts.</P>

<P>Look for the words "machine/surface washable" on stuffed and
cloth toys and "UL (Underwriters Laboratories) Approved" on
electrical toys.</P>

<P>Purchase a toy storage chest that has a removable lid or a
spring-loaded support, allowing the lid to remain securely
open.  Check for smooth, finished edges, proper air holes and
hinge line clearances to prevent pinched fingers.           </P>

<h3> <a name="About Toy Labels">About Toy Labels</a></h3>

<P>     Labels on toy packages make choosing safe, appropriate
toys much easier.  However, no package label can tell you
exactly which toys are right for your child and not all toys
are appropriate for every youngster.  On the other hand,
child development experts agree that children develop in a
sequence of stages and toymakers use this information to
indicate which types of toys are safe and appropriate for
children of various ages.  Product labels held consumers
distinguish among the vast number of toys on the market to
make the most appropriate purchases.</P>

<P>     Remember, each child is unique and develops at his or
her own pace.  The best thing adults can do when purchasing
toys is to know the maturity, skill level and interests of
the child, read the age labels carefully and use them as
guides and, above all, use common sense.  Nobody knows your
child better than you do.</P>

<B>How Toys Are Age Labeled</B>

<P>     Toymakers follow the age grading guidelines of the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, which consist of four
main criteria:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>the ability of a child to physically manipulate and play
	with the features of a toy
	<LI>the ability of a child to understand how to use a toy
	<LI>the child's play needs and interest at different
	developmental levels
	<LI>the safety aspects of the toy itself
</UL>

<P>     A child's abilities, interests and play needs will, of
course, vary at each level of development.
     New toys are frequently tested by children in play
     (Graphic omitted)
settings to determine durability, age-appropriatemenss and
play patterns.  At least one large toy manufacturer maintains
an in-house, year-round nursery school for this purpose,
while others establish relationships with universities and
other educational facilities.  Manufacturers also may involve
parents, teachers and others who care for children for their
first-hand knowledge and valuable insights.  In addition, a
toymaker may have a child development specialist,
psychologist or physician on staff or working as a
consultant.</P>

<B>Safety Labeling</B>

<P>     As of January 1, 1995, new toys and games for children
ages three through six will be required to carry warnings
about choking hazards.  The warnings will tell the consumer
if the toy contains small parts, a small ball, marbles, or
balloons; that these items are choking hazards, and that the
toy is not intended for children under the age of three.  No
matter what the age of the child, toys with these labels
should be avoided if the child is still mouthing objects.</P>

<P>     Some manufacturers may add other safety warnings and
cautions to the package and/or instructions advising parents
that special care should be taken.  Sometimes manufacturers
wish to emphasize that children may need help understanding
the instructions or that adult supervision may be required
during playtime.  Toys that would have cautionary labels in
addition to the age label include:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>electrically operated toys that also may have heating
	elements
	<LI>science toy sets that may contain toxic chemicals
	<LI>craft or science kits that may have functional sharp
	instruments such as scissors or breakable glass
	<LI>swim aids that are not life-saving devices
	<li>balloons
	<LI>kites
	<LI>crib gyms and mobiles, which should be removed when the baby
	 begins to push up on hands and knees to prevent possible
	entanglement
	<LI>any toy intended for assembly by an adult which may have
	potentially hazardous sharp points and edges in its pre-
	assembled state
</UL>

<B>How to Get the Most From Labels</B>

<P>     Now that you are familiar with the research involved in
designing a toy and assigning it an age label, you can make
your next toy purchase with confidence.  Keeping in mind your
child's skills and interests and using age labels as a guide,
you will be able to select a fun and appropriate toy.
(Graphic omitted)</P>

<P>     If you are tempted to buy your child a toy labeled for
an older child, please reconsider.  Remember that the age
label has been thoughtfully assigned based upon many factors,
including safety.  If you give a child a toy that is too
simple or too advanced, he or she may be frustrated and/or
exposed to a safety hazard.</P>

<P>     Remember: the purpose of toys is to have fun.</P>

<h3> <a name="Toy Selection">Toy Selection</a></h3>

<P>     The following are some suggestions for suitable toys for
children of various ages.  They are offered as a guide to
help in your selection, but remember that all children are
different.  Study your child and get to know his or her
interests, abilities and limitations.  Not all children enjoy
the same kinds of play: one child will be interested in
building with blocks or doing puzzles; another may prefer
riding bikes or playing ball; your child may enjoy pretending
with a dollhouse or playing board games.  Try to match the
toy to your child and keep in mind that his or her interest
in a toy will often carry through more than one age group.
(Graphic omitted)</P>

<B>Babies: Birth to One Year</B>

<P>     Experts agree that even babies need an assortment of
toys.  Since infants respond to smell, taste, sound, touch
and sight, properly selected toys provide a small baby with
opportunities to learn about size, shape, sound, texture and
how things work.</P>
<P>     Choose toys that:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>have pieces that are too large to swallow
	<LI>are lightweight for handling and grasping
	<LI>have no sharp edges or points
	<LI>are brightly colored
	<LI>are non-toxic
</UL>

<P>     Brightly colored, lightweight toys of various textures
stimulate a baby's senses.  For young infants, toys to look
at and listen to are best.  Rattles, squeaky toys and crib
gyms are ideal for grasping when the baby is ready to hold
objects.</P>

<P>     Soft dolls or stuffed animals made of non-toxic
materials are fun to touch and hug but are not designed for
sucking and chewing.  Make sure the seams cannot be easily
torn or bitten open and that eyes and noses are securely
fastened.  (Graphic omitted)</P>

<P>     A baby who is sitting up is ready for blocks with
pictures or bright colors.  Nesting cups or boxes and
stacking rings are also favorites.  Babies at this age
enjoy their first sturdy picture books showing familiar
objects.  Balls and push-pull toys are good choices when a
baby can crawl and walk.</P>

     (Graphic omitted)<BR><BR>

<B>Toddlers: One to Three Years</B>

<P>     A busy toddler needs toys for active physical play--
especially things to ride and climb on, such as a low
tricycle or a wagon to ride in and pull.  Outdoor toys such
as large balls, inflatable toys, a wading pool and an sandbox
with digging tools are all good choices.</P>

<P>     Toddlers begin to enjoy make-believe play just before
their second birthdays.  To imitate the adult world around
them, they use play food, appliances and utensils, child-
sized play furniture, simple dress-up clothes and dolls.
Children in this age group are particularly interested in
sorting and fitting toys, all kinds of blocks and simple
puzzles.  Toddlers also enjoy musical instruments such as
tambourines, toy pianos, horns and drums, as well as
listening to tapes.</P>

<B>Pre-Schoolers: Three to Five Years</B>

<P>     Pre-schoolers are masters of make-believe.  They like to
act out grown-up roles and create imaginary situations.
Costumes and equipment that help them in their pretend worlds
are important at this stage.  Some of the many possibilities
include pretend money, play food, a toy cash register or
telephone, a make-believe village, fort, circus, farm, gas
station or restaurant, a puppet theater and play with dolls
and doll furniture.</P>

<P>     In a child's private world, a favorite toy is both a
companion and protector.  Dolls and teddy bears, for example,
have helped countless children to cope with difficult
moments.  Children will sometimes express their feelings to
toy "confidants" and share emotions with them that
they might otherwise keep to themselves.</P>

<P>     Transportation is fascinating to young children.
Trucks, cars, planes, trains, boats and tractors are all fun
at this age and beyond.  Larger outdoor toys, including gym
equipment, wheeled vehicles and a first two-wheeled bicycle
with helmet and training wheels, are appropriate now.</P>

<P>     Visualization and memory skills can be sharpened by play
that requires use of imagination or mental computation, with
the introduction of board games, electronic toys and word and
matching games geared specifically for this group.
Construction sets, books and tapes, coloring sets, pains,
crayons, puzzles, stuffed toys and dolls continue to be
favorites.</P>

<B>School Age: Six to Nine Years</B>

<P>     Board games, table-top sports games and classics like
marbles and model or craft kits help develop skills for
social and solitary play.  In experimenting with different
kinds of grownup worlds, fashion and career dolls and all
kinds of action figures appeal to girls and boys.  Printing
sets, science and craft kits, electric trains, racing cars,
construction sets and hobby equipment are important to
children for examining and experimenting with the world
around them.</P>

<P>     For active physical play, a larger bicycle, ice and
roller skates, a pogo stick, scooter, sled and other sports
equipment, along with protective gear, are appropriate.  Even
though group play is enjoyed, children at this stage also
play well by themselves.  Paints, crayons and clay are still
good selections, as are costumes, doll houses, play villages,
miniature figures and vehicles, all of which help children to
develop their imaginations and creativity.</P>

<P>     Many games and electronic toys geared to children in
this age group are labeled "educational" because they have
been designed to help children learn specific skills and
concepts, such as games which require forming words, matching
letters of the alphabet with various objects or
learning about money through handling play coins and
currency.</P>

<P>     Video games appeal to children, teenages and adults.
Many games offer increasingly challenging levels of play, as
well as opportunities to develop coordination skills and a
sense of the meaning of strategies in relationships, usually
through competition against an opponent.</P>

<P>THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE, EVER, FOR SENSIBLE ADULT SUPERVISION<BR>
                                           (Graphic Omitted)</P>
<B>Nine to Twelve Years
</B>
<P>     Children begin to develop specific skills and life-long
interests at this age.  Give considerable attention to
hobbies and crafts, model kits, magic sets, advanced
construction sets, chemistry and science kits and puzzles.
Peer acceptance is very important at this age.  Active
physical play now finds its expression with team play in a
variety of sports.  Social and intellectual skills are
refined through board, card and electronic games,
particularly those requiring strategy decisions.</P>

<P>     Video and electronic games, table tennis and billiards
(pool) are very popular at this stage.  Dramatic play holds
great appeal.  Youngsters in this age group like to plan
complete productions including props, costumes, printed
programs, puppets and marionettes.  Painting, sculpting,
ceramics and other forms of artistic expression continue to
be of interest, as do books, tapes and musical instruments.</P>

<B>Teenagers</B>

<P>     After age twelve, children's interests in toys begin to
merge with those of adults.  This is apparent in the growing
market for sophisticated electronic games and computer-based
systems, which are often considered "family entertainment"
rather than toys.  They also will be interested in board
and adventure games.  Collectors of dolls, model cars,
trains, miniatures and stuffed animals often begin their
hobbies in the teenage years.                              </P>

<P>Thank you for requesting the second edition of THE TMA GUIDE
TO TOYS and PLAY.  The seeds for this booklet were sown in late
1979 with the publication of a series of pamphlets covering
toy selection and play, followed by THE ABCs OF TOYS and PLAY
in 1983, LEARNING ABOUT LABELS in 1985 and the first version
of THE TMA GUIDE TO TOYS and PLAY in 1990.  Although the
principles of choosing safe toys and the importance of
playing with and supervising children are unchanged, our new
guide reflects the most up-to-date information available on
toy safety and child development.
     Toy Manufacturers of America, Inc. (TMA), founded in
1916 and based in New York City, is the trade association for
U.S. producers and importers of toys and holiday decorations.

<li><A href="/kidsource/content2/equal_math_girls.html"> Equal Mathematics Education for Female Students </a>

<P>Research over the last decade has shown that males and females have different classroom experiences because they approach learning differently and because teachers tend to treat them differently. As girls progress through school, they are less likely to continue their math education, either taking more rudimentary courses or dropping the subject altogether.  This article identifies the specific
treatment of female students that inhibits their ability to successfully learn math and steps to remove the barriers that prevent females from learning advanced mathematics.</P>

<li><A href="/kidsource/content2/creativity_in_kids.html"> Creativity in Young Children  </a>

<P>The precursors of adult creativity are clearly evident in young children.  Adults can encourage creativity by emphasizing the generation and expression of ideas in a non-evaluative framework and by concentrating on both divergent and convergent thinking. Adults can also try to ensure that children have the opportunity and confidence to take risks, challenge assumptions, and see things in a new way.</P>

<P>	"You never listen to me" is a complaint heard as often from children as parents.  Good communication helps children and parents to develop confidence, feelings of self-worth, and good relationships with others. Try these tips:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Teach children to listen... gently touch a child before you talk... say their name.<br><br>

	<LI>Speak in a quiet voice... whisper sometimes so children have to listen... they like this.<br><br>

	<LI>Look a child in the eyes so you can tell when they understand... bend or sit down... become the child's size.
<br><br>
	<LI>Practice listening and talking:  talk with your family about what you see on TV, hear on the radio or see at the park or store.  (Talk with your children about school and their friends.)<br><br>

	<LI>Respect children and use a courteous tone of voice.  If we talk to our children as we would our friends, our youngsters may be more likely to seek us out as confidants.<br><br>

	<LI>Catch children and teens being good. Praise them for cooperating with you or their siblings, or for doing those little things that are so easy to take for granted.<br><br>

	<LI>Use door openers that invite children to say more about an incident or their feelings.   "I see," "Oh," "tell me more," "No kidding," "Really," "Mmmmhmmmmm," "Say that again, I want to be sure I understand you."<br><br>

	<LI>Praise builds a child's confidence and reinforces communication.  Unkind words tear children down and teach them that they just aren't good enough.<br><br>

	<LI>Children are never too old to be told they are loved.  Saying "I love you" is important. Writing it in a note provides the child with a reminder that he can hold on to.<br><br>

	<LI>Give your undivided attention when your children want to talk to you.  Don't read, watch TV, fall asleep or make yourself busy with other tasks.

<h3> <a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
 
 
      Our children deserve to learn important lessons from us
 and to acquire important habits with our help. They need help
 in learning what matters to us. We want our children to grow up
 to be responsible adults. We want them to learn to feel, think,
 and act with respect for themselves and for other people. We
 want them to pursue their own well-being, while also being
 considerate of the needs and feelings of others.
<br><br> 
      Today, there is wide recognition that many of our children
 are not learning to act responsibly while they are young.
 Studies show that many children see nothing wrong with cheating
 on tests. Some see nothing wrong with taking things that don't
 belong to them.
<br><br> 
      If proper attitudes and behavior are not learned early,
 problems can mushroom with even worse consequences when
 children are older. As crime has increased, teen-age offenders
 have shown less and less feeling for their victims. But even
 for the youngsters who will never commit a crime, it is better
 to learn responsibility when they are young, rather than when
 they are older and they have to change bad habits.
<br><br>

      This booklet focuses on practical suggestions for helping
 young children appreciate the importance of acting responsibly
 in their everyday lives. Further, it provides ideas on how to
 help them make responsible choices, and stick with them, even
 when doing so is hard and the material rewards are few.
<br><br> 
      Many parents will also want to share with their children
 deeply held religious and moral convictions as a foundation for
 ethical behavior. This booklet discusses habits of fairness,
 respect, courage, honesty, and compassion that responsible
 people share, and it can be used by parents with different
 beliefs.
<br><br> 
      As parents, we can give our children the best in us by
 helping them acquire habits and character traits that they can
 rely on in their own lives. If we help them lean to take
 pleasure in thinking and behaving well, they will have the best
 chance to lead good lives as individuals and as citizens in the
 community. This will be true no matter what unpleasant
 situations or bad influences they come across.<BR><BR>

 <h3><a name="whatdo">What Do We Mean by Responsibility?</a></h3>
 
 
      None of us is born acting responsibly. A responsible
 character is formed over time. It is made up of our outlook and
 daily habits associated with feelings, thoughts, and actions.
 Responsible people act the way they should whether or not
 anyone is watching. They do so because they understand that
 it's right and because they have the courage and self-control
 to act decently, even when tempted to do otherwise.
<br><br> 
      We want our children to appreciate the importance of being
 responsible. We also want them to develop the habits and
 strength to act this way in their everyday lives. Learning to
 be responsible includes learning to
<ul> 
    <li>respect and show compassion for others;
 
    <li>practice honesty as a matter of course;
 
    <li>show courage in standing up for our principles;
 
    <li>develop self-control in acting on our principles;
 
    <li>maintain self-respect.
</ul>  
 <h4>Respect and Compassion for Others</h4>
 
 
      As part of being responsible, children need to respect and
 show concern for the well-being of other people. Respect ranges
 from using basic manners to having compassion for the suffering
 of others. Compassion is developed by trying to see things from
 the point of view of others, and learning that their feelings
 resemble our own.
 
<br><br>
 
      Daddy, why was Grandma crying?
<br><br> 
      She is very sad. One of her closest friends just died.
 Come and sit with me. Do you remember how you felt when your
 gerbil, Whiskers, died?
<br><br> 
      I felt sad and lonely.
<br><br> 
      I'm sure Grandma feels that way, too. Maybe you can think
 of a way to help her.
<br><br> 
      I could give her a hug...
<br><br> 
      That's a great idea! I'm really glad you thought of it.
<br><br> 
      Respect for others also includes the habit of treating
 people fairly as individuals, regardless of race, sex, or
 ethnic group. As we mature, respect includes realizing that not
 all our obligations to others, such as caring for a family
 member who is sick, are chosen freely. And it includes
 tolerance for people who do not share our beliefs or likes or
 dislikes, as long as they do not harm others.
<br><br> 
      These habits are especially important because many of the
 wrongs people commit result from indifference to the suffering
 they cause.
 
 
 <h4>Honesty</h4>
 
 
      Honesty means telling the truth. It means not misleading
 others for our own benefit. It also means trying to make
 decisions, especially important ones, on the basis of evidence
 rather than prejudice. Honesty includes dealing with other
 people and being honest with ourselves.
<br><br> 
      To understand the importance of being truthful to others,
 our children need to learn that living together depends on
 trust. Without honesty, trusting each other becomes impossible.
<br><br> 
      Honesty with ourselves involves faring up to our own
 mistakes and biases, even when we have to admit them to others.
 It includes self-criticism. The point is to learn from our
 errors and to do our best to correct them, not to dwell on
 them.

<img src="/images/spacer.gif" haligh=left>           
        
</td>
<td valign=top>

 <h4>Courage</h4>
 
 
      Courage is taking a position and doing what is right, even
 at the risk of some loss. It means being neither reckless nor
 cowardly, but faring up to our duties. It includes physical
 courage, intellectual courage to make decisions on the basis of
 evidence, and moral courage to stand up for our principles.
<br><br> 
      Courage does not mean never being afraid. It can involve
 trying to overcome our fears, such as a fear of the dark. But
 our children also need to learn that sometimes it is all right
 to be afraid.
<br><br> 
      Daddy, a man showed us money by the school playground
 today.
<br><br> 
      What did you do?
<br><br> 
      We ran for the teacher.
<br><br> 
      Why did you do that?
<br><br> 
      We were scared. You and Mommy and our teacher Mrs. Jones
 said never take anything from grownups we don't know. Run away.
 Go and tell somebody we know.
<br><br> 
      Good for you. It was right to be scared. Lots of people
 are nice, but some are very mean. They can hurt you. The mean
 ones sometimes try to fool people by pretending to be nice.
 Now, tell me, what did the man look like?
<br><br> 
      Courage becomes especially important by the time children
 become teenagers. They often have to stand up against peer
 pressure to do the wrong thing, such as using drugs.
 
 
 <h4>Self-Control</h4>
 
 
      Self-control is the ability to resist inappropriate
 behavior in order to act responsibly. It relates to all of the
 different aspects of responsibility mentioned so far, including
 respect and compassion for others, honesty, and courage. It
 involves persistence and sticking to long-term commitments. It
 also includes dealing effectively with emotions, such as anger,
 and developing patience.

 
 <h4>Self-Respect</h4>
 
 
      People with self-respect take satisfaction in appropriate
 behavior and hard-won accomplishments. They don't need to put
 others down or have a lot of money in order to respect
 themselves. People who respect themselves also view
 selfishness, loss of self-control, recklessness, cowardice, and
 dishonesty as wrong and unworthy of them. As they mature, if
 they have learned the lessons of responsibility, they will
 develop a good conscience to guide them.
<br><br> 
      In addition, people who respect themselves respect their
 own health and safety. Similarly, they are unwilling to be
 manipulated by others. Patience or tolerance does not mean
 allowing others to mistreat us.
<br><br> 
      While we help children have high standards for themselves,
 we also need to let them know that failure is no embarrassment
 when we have done our best. For example, losing a game when we
 have played our best, and our opponents have simply played
 better, is no disgrace.<BR><BR>

 <h3><a name="howcan">How Can Parents Encourage Responsible Behavior?</a></h3>
 
 
<H4>Everyday Experiences</H4>
 
 
      Especially when they are young, children learn best about
 responsibility in concrete situations. What they do and what
 they witness have lasting effects. Most of the activities
 described in this book are for you and your child.
<br><br> 
      We are always teaching our children something by our words
 and actions. They learn from seeing. They learn from hearing.
 They learn from overhearing. They learn from us, from each
 other, from other adults, and by themselves.
<br><br> 
      All of us acquire habits by doing things over and over
 again, whether in learning to play a musical instrument, to
 pick up after ourselves, to play games and sports, or to share
 with others. The best way to encourage our children to become
 responsible is to act as responsibly as we can in their
 presence. We must genuinely try to be the sort of people we
 hope they will try to become.
<br><br> 
      We can show them by our words and by our actions that we
 respect others. We can show them our compassion and concern
 when others are suffering. They need to see our own
 self-control, courage, and honesty. They need to learn that we
 treat ourselves, as well as others, with respect, and that we
 always try to do our best. As they grow older, they should have
 the chance to learn why we live as we do.
 
<br><br>
 
      Daddy, why are you leaving that note on the garbage can?
<br><br> 
      There is broken glass inside, Matthew, and I don't want
 the garbage collectors to get hurt because of me. I am warning
 them about the glass.
<br><br> 
      Are they your friends?
<br><br> 
      No. I don't know them.
<br><br> 
      But you don't want them to get hurt...
<br><br> 
      As our children watch us daily, as we talk to them,
 encouraging their questions and trying to answer them
 thoughtfully, they begin to understand us--and we begin to
 understand them. Understanding each other well is the best way
 to teach our children respect for our ideals of good character.

 
 <H4>Using Literature and Stories</H4>
 
 
      Children learn about responsibility through many
 activities, including reading stories. They learn by
 identifying with individual characters or because the message
 from a favorite story strikes a particular chord. Children can
 be touched deeply by good literature, and they may ask to have
 things read to them again and again.
<br><br> 
      Children can learn all sorts of lessons from stories.
 They might learn about courage by reading about David standing
 up to Goliath. Or they might learn the value of persistence
 and effort from The Little Engine That Could.
<br><br> 
      When they are older, reading can help prepare children for
 the realities and responsibilities of adulthood. It is usually
 better for children to read a good book about such things as
 war, oppression, suicide, or deadly disease before seeing these
 things up close.
<br><br> 
      When our children grow up they often remember stories that
 were told to them by family members when they were young. When
 we tell stories to our children, we should remember old
 favorites of ours, like The Three Little Pigs, not leaving out
 a single time the wolf says, "I'LL HUFF, and I'LL PUFF, and
 I'LL BLOW YOUR HOUSE IN!"
 
 
 <H4>Developing Judgment and Thoughtfulness</H4>
 
 
      Judgment on ethical issues is a practical matter. Children
 develop their capacity for judging what is a responsible act,
 just as they come to appreciate the meaning of responsibility,
 through practice. Especially when they are young, children need
 to see moral questions in terms that are meaningful to them.
<br><br> 
      We can also help our children develop good judgment by
 talking through complicated situations with them. One way is to
 help them understand the long-term consequences of different
 choices. If they tell us about a story they have read, we might
 ask them to imagine what the result might have been if a
 favorite character had acted differently.
<br><br> 
      Sometimes, it can be difficult to know the difference
 between acting bravely and acting recklessly or how to balance
 duties when they conflict. As parents, we can help by making it
 clear, through what we do as well as what we say, that it is
 important in such situations to think carefully and honestly
 about what should be done, as well as to keep in mind how
 others will be affected by what we do.
<br><br> 
      Your child's ability to reason about different issues,
 including ethical ones, will improve as your child matures.
 Just as reasoning can lead to a more thoughtful understanding
 of responsibility, or what actions to take in complicated
 situations, it may also become easier to rationalize selfish or
 reckless behavior. But if you have helped your young child
 develop strong habits of considering the welfare of others,
 honesty, courage, and admiration for worthy accomplishments,
 your child will have a solid foundation on which to build.<BR><BR>

 <h3><a name="activities">Activities</a></h3>
 
 
      As parents, sometimes we think that we must set aside
 particular times or create special situations in order to teach
 our children. But that is far from the truth when it comes to
 learning about responsibility. While it is important to have
 some times together when you won't be disturbed, the most
 ordinary situations in everyday life are filled with
 opportunities for sound teaching, if parents pay attention to
 them.
<br><br> 
      This booklet contains activities to encourage habits of
 responsibility in your child. Most of them are not, however,
 the kind of activities that you can do together for half an
 hour once a week. Instead, they are more like rules of thumb,
 ideas to build on. They illustrate the concepts introduced in
 the previous sections. They should stimulate your own thinking
 and your own ideas.
<br><br> 
      Just remember one thing: teaching our children about
 responsibility doesn't mean that we can't laugh or that we have
 to be grim. Our children should see that we can be serious
 about our principles, while still being able to play and have
 fun.
 
<br><br>
 
      Dad, can I show you what we did in ballet class today?
<br><br> 
      Sure.
<br><br> 
      It was hard. We had to get way up on our toes and then
 twirl around like this.
<br><br> 
      Great. Let me try it. . .oops! Now, what's so funny about
 that? Well, OK. I guess we aren't all as graceful as you are.

<H3> Getting To Know Others</H3>
 
<P>      Children need to be shown and taught respect for others.
 Other people have feelings and hopes, just as we do. We have
 much to learn from each other from people who live far away and
 from those who lived long ago.</P>
 
 <H4>What to do</H4>
<ul> 
 
   <li>1. Set a good example by acting respectfully toward others.
      Always make clear that prejudice is wrong and that all of
      us are equals, no matter our color, gender, or background.
 
 
   <li>2. Show an interest in learning about and from others--from
      neighbors and relatives, and from books about our own and
      other civilizations. Tell your child interesting things
      you have learned.
 
   <li>3. Encourage your child to learn about many different lands
      and people, to learn more than one language, and to read
      stories about children from all over the world. Show your
      child how you try to see things from the point of view of
      others.
 
   <li>4. Listen attentively when your child wants to tell you about
      interesting things discovered about history, geography,
      religions, art, and ways of life.
</ul>
<br> 
      We can help our children understand that there are often
 things to learn from those who lived in the past and from those
 whose lives are different from our own. We can teach our
 children to behave respectfully toward people and not pre-judge
 them. Sometimes, however, we must make it clear that some
 people behave in ways that are harmful, and such behavior
 should not be tolerated.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="magic">Magic Words, Caring Deeds</a></h3>
 
 
<P>      The magic words are "please" and "thank you." There are
 other manners we are constantly teaching our children as well. </P>
 
 <H4>What you'll need</H4>
<ul> 
 <li>Chairs
 <li>Table
 <li>Paper Pen
 <li>Crayons, markers
 <li>Plates, cups, forks, spoons
</ul> 
 
<H4> What to do</H4>
<ul> 
 
   <li>1. Show your children the manners you expect at home first.
      The next time you eat dinner together, have the children
      pretend they are eating in a restaurant. How should they
      talk to each other? What should they say when the waiter
      brings their food? Or have the children pretend they are
      riding in a bus. What should they do if the bus stops
      suddenly and they bump into someone? How should they carry
      a large package on the bus?
 
   <li>2. The next time your children mention something nice that
      another person did for them, suggest they write a thank
      you note. It doesn't have to have a lot of words. It can
      have pictures as well.
 
   <li>3. You, too, can write short notes to your child to indicate
      your appreciation for something done right.
</ul>
<br> 
      Children need to learn that little signs of appreciation
 can be very important to other people. And manners are a part
 of respecting and caring for the feelings of others. If we turn
 the chore of learning manners into a game, children will get
 the practice they need without embarrassing us or themselves.
<br><br> 
      As you teach the importance of manners, you may need to be
 honest about what your child can expect form others.
<br><br> 
      Mom, why do you make such a fuss when I chew with my mouth
 open?
<br><br> 
      Because it's ugly for other people to see. Good manners
 show respect for other people.
<br><br> 
      What's respect?
<br><br> 
      It means caring how other people feel.
<br><br> 
      If I care about them, will they care about me?
<br><br> 
      Not always, Paul. Some people don't care and never will,
 no matter how kind we are to them. But in our family, we do
 care.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="gifts">Gifts From the Heart</a></h3>
 
 
<P>      Have your child give a gift of himself at the next holiday
 or any time he wants to do something nice for someone else.</P>
 
 <H4>What you'll need</H4>
 
<ul> 
 <li>Crayons, pencils, paints, or other art supplies
 <li>Paper
 <li>Packaging from around the house
 <li>Your child's special gift
</ul> 
 
<H4> What To Do</H4>
<ul> 
 
   <li>1. Talk to your child about gift giving. What does it mean to
      give something to someone else?
 
   <li>2. Instead of buying a gift, have your child make a gift.
      Does your child have a special talent? Maybe your child
      would like to sing or write a song for a relative? Is
      there a chore your child could do? Maybe wash the dishes
      for a week. Is there a special toy that could be loaned to
      a sister or brother for a week?
 
   <li>3. Use materials from around the house so that little, if
      any, money is spent.
 
   <li>4. If the gift is an activity or chore, have your child
      make a card with a note on it, telling what the gift will
      be.
 
   <li>5. Have your child use imagination in making an inviting
      package. Perhaps your child could paint a small rock and
      wrap it in a big box. Or make an envelope out of the
      comics from the Sunday newspaper.
</ul>
 
      Most young children don't have money to buy a gift for a
 friend or relative. You can teach your child that a gift that
 shows effort and attention can mean more than a gift from the
 store.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="honesty">Honesty, the Best Policy</a></h3>
 
 
<P>      Children need to learn that benefiting from manipulating
 or lying to others is dishonest and unworthy of them.</P>

<H4> What to do</H4>
<ul> 
 
   <li>1. Tell the story about the boy who cried "Wolf!" so many
      times to get attention that when the wolf finally came, no
      one believed him.
 
   <li>2. Ask your child if anyone has ever lied to her. How did
      that make her feel?
 
   <li>3. Be careful to follow through on things you say to your
      child. Commitments that may seem minor to you can mean a
      lot to your child. Make promises and keep them.
</ul>
  
      Our children need to learn about the importance of
 trusting each other in our everyday lives. Without honesty,
 trust becomes impossible.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="theres">There's A Monster In My Room</a></h3>
 
<P>      Sometimes our children have needless fears that we can
 help them overcome.</P>
  
 <H4>What to do</H4>
 
<ul> 
   <li>1. Listen when your child mentions a fear, even if it sounds
      silly to you.
 
    <li>2. With your child, come up with a plan for facing up to the
      fear.
 
    <li>3. Go through the plan together. Let your child take the step
      that confronts the fear, although it may be helpful for
      you to be there.
</ul>
 
      Children should learn not to allow others to mistreat
 them. At the same time, we want them to learn how to reach
 understandings peacefully, whenever possible.<BR><BR>

<P>      Children should learn not to allow others to mistreat
 them. At the same time, we want them to learn how to reach
 understandings peacefully, whenever possible.</P>
 
<H4> What to do</H4>
<ul> 
   <li>1. Listen to your child and find out if others are not
      treating your child as they should. This will encourage
      your child to trust you and come to you when there is a
      problem.
 
   <li>2. Help your child consider various ways of dealing with a
      particular problem.
 
   <li>3. If the problem is the way another child is behaving,
      suggest working out the problem by talking with the other
      child, or a responsible adult.
 
   <li>4. If the problem is another adult, however, or if your child
      is seriously threatened by other children, you will need
      to intervene directly.
</ul> 
       A part of self-respect is not tolerating mistreatment by
 others. Finding appropriate ways to deal with unpleasant
 behavior by others is an important, if sometimes difficult,
 part of growing up.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="helping">Helping Out</a></h3>
 
 
      Our children need to learn that as they get older and can
 contribute more, more will be expected of them.

 <H4>What to do</H4>
<ul> 
    <li>1. As your child matures, consider additional ways your child
      can contribute to the household.
 
   <li>2. Discuss the new duties with your child. Avoid describing
      them in ways that seem like a punishment. Instead, you can
      imply that they require a new level of ability, which your
      child now possesses.
 
   <li>3. With younger children, it helps sometimes if you do the
      chores together and talk or make it fun. But don't do your
      child's work!
 
   <li>4. If possible, new tasks should stretch a child's abilities
      and encourage satisfaction in good work. Praise something
      done well, especially a new challenge.               
</ul>
 
      Doing chores is a useful way to learn persistence and to
 learn that when we live up to our responsibilities we enable
 others to trust and rely on us.<BR><BR>

<h3><a name="ajob">A Job Well Done</a></h3>
 
 
<P>      We need to show our children that we take satisfaction in
 acting properly and accomplishing difficult tasks.</P>
  
<H4> What to do</H4>
<ul>  
   <li>1. Through your daily activities, show your children that you
      care about a job well done.
 
   <li>2. Perhaps our children's most important tasks are to work
      hard at school and do homework. When we check homework and
      point out mistakes, we help them see how an error has
      arisen. When we let them correct errors themselves, we
      inspire self-confidence. It is also important for us to
      show them that we appreciate their good efforts.
 
   <li>3. Teaching our children self-respect does not mean
      complimenting everything they do. Our children also need
      our honest criticism from time to time. When we do
      criticize, it should be of things they have done, not them
      personally.
 
   <li>4. Most of all, we should help our children form the
      self-confidence and self-respect that come from
      opportunities to do good work as students or as family
      members.
</ul>
  
      Helping our children form self-respect is based on how we
 treat them and our own example.
<br><br> 
      There are many opportunities to teach self-respect through
 our actions:
<br><br> 
      Dad, nobody's going to see inside the model's wing. Why do
 you work so hard with all those little pieces?
<br><br> 
      Because that's the right way to build the plane, Martha.
 It makes the wing strong when the plane flies, and that's more
 important than what people see. I want to make the best plane I
 can. Do you want to help?<BR><BR>

 <h3><a name="our">Our Heroes</a></h3>
 
 
<P>      Many children love to look at portraits or photographs,
 especially if you can tell them stories about the people in the
 pictures.</P>
  
 <H4>What you'll need</H4>
<ul> 
 
      <li>Family photo album (or a box or bag of pictures you've
 been meaning to put in an album)
<br><br> 
      <li>Portraits of impressive individuals from books or from
 history
</ul>
 
  <H4>What to do</H4>
<ul> 
 
   <li>1. Select a photo of a person in your family with an
      impressive quality or accomplishment. Tell your child
      about the person and about what the person did. Perhaps
      your grandparents had the courage to immigrate from
      another country or your parents sacrificed in order to
      support you in  school. Talk about the results of these
      actions. 
 
   <li>2. Collect photographs from newspapers or magazines about
      impressive people in your community. With your child, talk
      about their actions that merit admiration or praise.
 
   <li>3. In addition to relatives or others, you may want to
      display portraits of other people who deserve our
      admiration and respect. A picture of Anne Frank, a young
      girl who wrote a diary while she and her family lived in
      hiding from Nazi Germans and who died in a concentration
      camp, can inspire conversation about courage and
      compassion for others. A portrait of Martin Luther King, a
      great civil rights leader who believed in nonviolent
      change, can lead to discussions of great accomplishment
      despite prejudice. Choose people whom you admire and feel
      comfortable talking to your child about.
</ul><br>
 
      By stories we tell about the people we admire, we can
 inspire children and remind them of those qualities we think
 are important.<BR><BR>

<P>      Sometimes, as parents, we don't act the way we should in

 <H4>What to do</H4>
<ul> 
   <li>1. Try to be honest with yourself and your child if you find
      that you've done something that sets a bad example.
      Sometimes we need to think a little about an event to
      realize that we've done something inappropriate.
 
   <li>2. If your child has observed your behavior, it's especially
      important that you be honest. A simple statement is
      appropriate in most cases; there is no need to turn your
      admission into a major event.
 
   <li>3. Follow up with an apology to anyone you have treated badly
      and, if possible, by making up for what you have done.
</ul>

 see that we face up to our own mistakes.<BR><BR>

<ul> 
    <li>1. Talk to your child about what is important in a friend. In
      addition to bring fun, what other qualities are important?
      What about honesty, dependability, a real interest in your
      child's welfare?
 
   <li>2. Talk to your child about the type of friends to avoid. Ask
      if your child can remember a friend who couldn't be
      counted on.

 <h3><a name="share">Share a Story</a></h3>
 
 
<P>      One important way parents can help their children learn
 respect for others, self-control, or other aspects of
 responsibility is through the use of fables or stories. You can
 read to your child, you can read with your child, and you can
 encourage your child to read on his own.</P>
 
<H4> What you'll need.</H4>

<P> Good stories, either from books such as those listed in the
 back of this book or from your own experiences.</P>

  
 <H4>What to do.</H4>
<ul> 
   <li>1. Turn off the TV or other distractions.
 
   <li>2. Find stories that exemplify important aspects of character
      and that your child might enjoy.
 
   <li>3. Talk to your child about the behavior of different
      characters in the story. Ask your child how some of the
      behavior might apply to your own lives. 
 
   <li>4. Share some stories or books that you have found meaningful
      with your child. (It is important for  your child to see
      you reading and enjoying stories as well.)
 
   <li>5. Come up with your own stories. These can be family
      stories, such as baby stories (when your child was
      little...) that can become a part of your child's personal
      history.
</ul><br> 
 
      Stories can be good ways to learn important lessons. Your
 child can identify with characters in meaningful situations
 without your having to lecture.<BR><BR>

 <h3><a name="parents">Parents and the Schools</a></h3>
 
 
      Parents need to work with teachers and other parents to
 ensure that children are brought up well. An African proverb
 says, "It takes an entire village to raise one child." It is
 important for parents and other adults to cooperate in order to
 have common goals for them. Close communication is essential.
<br><br> 
      Parents can visit with teachers to discuss ways they and
 the school can reinforce the same lessons about good character.
 Children are less likely to do much homework, for example, if
 parents let them watch television for hours.
<br><br> 
       Parents can learn from teachers what their children are
 studying and what interests them. A teacher or school librarian
 can provide good ideas for activities to do at home.
<br><br> 
      Parents can cooperate with each other, too. They can agree
 on standards of supervision at parties and on entertainment.
 Some parents may be free to escort children to museums,
 libraries, athletic events, and extracurricular school
 activities, when others are not. Taking turns can provide
 better opportunities for all the children.<BR><BR>

 <STRONG>Introduction</STRONG>
 
<br><br> 
      Reading to and reading with children can help them learn
 responsible behavior. Finding good books, however, requires
 time and thought. Librarians and teachers can offer valuable
 assistance.
<br><br> 
      This section is divided into three lists: Beginning (ages
 1-6); Intermediate (ages 6-9); and Advanced (ages 9 and up).
 The age levels overlap and are only rough guides. Please note
 that some entries have annotations identifying specific habits
 of character such as courage, self-control, and responsibility.
<br><br> 
      Art and music also can enrich the lives of parents and
 children. Parents and children can enjoy the illustrations in
 many of the books listed here. They can find inspiration in the
 music on carefully chosen records, tapes, and CDs. Audio
 recordings of the spoken word also can fascinate children and
 include many dramatic readings, fairy tales, and even whimsy.
 Magazines, encyclopedias, and a few movies are recommended as
 well. Films can supplement lessons about responsibility found
 in the many books listed below.

<P>Children have to be taught discipline.
They are not born with it. Little by little
parents have to teach it to them. While
teaching discipline does take time and
practice, it gets easier as children learn to
control their own behavior. And best of
all, teaching discipline does not have to
hurt either the parents or the kids.</P>

<H3>Parents ask..
What is discipline?</H3>

<P>Discipline is helping children develop
self-control. Discipline is setting limits
and correcting misbehavior.<B> Discipline
also is encouraging children, guiding
them, helping them feel good about
themselves, </B> and teaching them how to
think for themselves.</P>

<a name="Spanking"></a>
<H3>Is spanking a useful approach to
discipline?</H3>

<P>No. Discipline should help children
learn how to control their own behavior.
Spanking is used to directly control
children's behavior. Spanking does not
teach children how to change what they
do, as good discipline should.</P>

<H3>Isn't is easier to just spank my
children?</H3>

<P>It may seem easy at the time. But
babies who are hit often cry louder. Older
children who are hit often are learning to solve problems by hitting others. Many parents notice that after a spanking children may settle down for a while, but pretty soon they start misbehaving again.</P>

<H3>Won't spanking teach children whom boss?</H3>

<P>Kids do need to know that the adult is in charge. Spanking can teach children to be afraid of the adult in charge. Good discipline teaches children to respect the adult in charge. Respect goes both ways-
treat children with respect and let them have some control, and they will respect you and listen to you.</P>

<H3>Won't spanking make my children afraid to misbehave?</H3>

<P>It can. Spanking can make children afraid to misbehave, but probably only when you are watching. Children need to
learn to control their own behavior even when you are not around to watch them.</P>

<H3>Don't children need a good spanking sometimes?</H3>

<P>No child needs a spanking. Spanking can be dangerous. You can never tell when children will be hurt badly by a spanking if you lose control. Children do not need to be hit in order to learn how to behave.</P>

<H3>If I do not spank, then what can I do?</H3>

<P>You can do lots of things that will help your children learn self-control - you can help them feel good about themselves, you can show them how a person with self-control acts, you can guide them, you can set limits, you can correct misbehavior by talking to them, and you can teach them how to think for themselves.</P>

<hr>

<a name="What"></a>
<H3>What can I do to help my children feel good about themselves?</H3>

<P>Let them know what they are doing right, as well as about the mistakes they make. Hearing good things makes us feel good and makes us want to do more good things. <B>Say two nice but true things to children for every time you correct them. </B> Remember, when they are changing their behavior, tell them how well they are doing, even if they only improve just a little. "Great, you played in the playground all morning without fighting."</P>

<H3>What do I need to do to guide them?</H3>

<P>One thing is to set routines for bedtime, meals and chores. Routines help children feel safe, because they know what parents expect.</P>
<P>Young children have a hard time going from one activity to another. Warning them a few minutes ahead helps them get ready. You can say, "You have five more minutes before bedtime." Be clear about their choices. "You can have milk or juice, but you can't have soda."</P>

<P>Remind them of your rules. Just saying no is not enough. Children often need reminders.</P>

<a name="How"></a>
<H3>How can I set limits</H3> 

<P>Here are some tips for setting limits:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI><B>Start with only a few rules.</B> 
	The more rules you have, the harder it will be for  your children to remember them.

	<LI><B>Be sure you know why you are saying no. </B>     
	As a parent you must keep your children healthy and safe. You must help      your children learn to get along with      other people. And you must stick to      what you believe in. Explain your      reasons for saying no. Be sure your      child understands your reasons. "You  cannot take your bike across town because there is too much traffic and      you might get hurt."

	<LI><B>Give kids a voice.</B> Kids need a voice in  setting limits. They need a chance to      tell you what they think and feel. Even  a child of five or six can talk with you  and help you set fair limits. When kids      help you make rules, they are more      likely to obey them. It's important to      understand their point of view, but      just because you listen to them does      not mean that you have to agree with      them and change your rules. You can      set many limits together, though      some may have to be set by you alone.

	<LI><B>Say what you mean.</B> Be very clear about  your limits. For example, state clearly the hour you want your child to be home. Say " 12 o'clock" instead of "Not too late."

</OL>


<H3>Will my children like me when I set down limits? Will they think I'm a "meanie"?</H3>

<P>Setting limits does not make you a "meanie" forever - not if you are fair. When you stick to your limits, your children may not like what you are doing. It makes sense that they might be unhappy. Try not to get upset. It only makes things worse.</P>

<P>          Accept their feelings, but stick to your limits.
For example, say, "It is hard to leave when you are having so much fun, but it is time to go." Fair limits show that you care. If you set limits by yourself that are unfair and too strict, your children will try to get back at you. If you do not set any limits, your children will push and push until someone sets a limit for them, maybe even a school principal or a policeman.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Break"></a>
<H3>What do I do when my children break the rules?</H3>

<P>Stay calm. Do what is fair. Sometimes, your children can help you decide what is fair to do when a rule is broken. Do something that makes sense and will help them learn not to make the same mistake again. For example, if they write on the wall, have them help clean it up.</P>

<P>You can use these problem-solving steps to help children think through what happened and figure out how they can help themselves not make the same mistake again:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>Have the child say what the problem is ("I want to go across town, and my      parent says I cannot take my bike").

	<LI>Have the child come up with as many  solutions as possible. At this point, the number of ideas is more important than how good the ideas are ("I could walk. I could take the bus. I could bike halfway and walk the rest of the way").

	<LI>Discuss solutions together and have  the child choose which solution to try      next time. Be sure it is a solution you   can both accept ("I will take the bus").

	<LI>Try out the solution.

	<LI>Check the results. If it works, great.  If not, start again.

to children when you use this approach. First, no problem is so great that you cannot solve it. Second, you are responsible for your own behavior.</P>

<H3>What should I do when I am so angry that I think I am going to lose my temper and all I want to do is hit or scream at my child?</H3>

<P>Find a way to help yourself calm down so that you do not do or say something you will be sorry for later. If your children are old enough to be left alone or if there is another adult with your children, go somewhere else until you calm down. Tell your children what you are doing. Take a walk, go to another room, or even lock yourself in the bathroom. Try to stay away no longer than five or ten minutes. When you come back to your children, calmly explain your feelings. </P>

<P>Other ways to calm down are to listen to music, take a few deep breaths, or count backwards from ten. Try to do something with your hands to keep them busy - bake a cake, wash a counter, draw, write what you are feeling, or even just scribble. To help yourself not say anything you'll be sorry for later, chew gum, sing or even put your hand up to your mouth. </P>

<P>Remember, what you do always teaches your children what to do. If you lash out, won't your children learn to do the same? If you do lash out, apologize to
your child. Saying "I'm sorry" teaches
them what to do if they offend others.</P>

<H3>What do I do if my children get really
angry because I discipline them?</H3>

<P>Their anger is no reason to feel as
though you're a bad person. Often children get angry when disciplined. As long
as you are being fair, it's okay. Let them
be angry but you keep your cool. Children must get their angry feelings out. Help them take time-out - draw, build something, play with clay, listen to music or go to a room alone and scream. Most important, when they are ready, help them talk about their feelings. Letting children get their feelings out is like taking out a splinter before it gets infected.</P>

<P>Teach them how to talk about their
feelings without hurting or attacking
other people. "I feel angry when I cannot
go across town, because I want to be with
my friends."</P>

<P>Remember:<B> Discipline is how adults
teach children to grow to be happy, safe,
well-adjusted members of society.</B> Raising children is a tough job, but as children
learn to control their own behavior, discipline gets easier and easier. It's well worth
the initial effort as your children become
responsible for their actions. And you can
feel proud that your loving care guided
them on their way!</P>

<H4><I>Stop using words that hurt.  Start using words that help.</I></H4>

<P>Welcome to the world of parenthood! Why didn't someone tell you there were going to be days when you would feel:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>old before your time 
	<LI>tired before 11 a.m. 
	<LI>too upset to think straight.
</UL>

<P> Would you have believed them, if they had?</P>
 
<P>The fact is you're a parent now, and those children are yours. But you're not alone (lots of parents feel the way you do), and things can get better.</P>

<P>One of the nicest things about being a parent is that you don't have to know everything. The job, like the child, grows gradually. There's on-the-job training.</P>

<P>So take a few moments, just for yourself, and learn how to make the rewards of parenting equal the demands.</P>

<a name="Birth"></a>
<H3>Birth to One Year</H3>

<P><B>Learn the basics.</B> How do you bathe a baby? Or change a diaper? You can learn! Read, ask an expert, talk to your parents and other parents.</P>

<P><B>Love your baby.</B> Give all you've got! Talk to your baby, touch (hold, kiss, hug), smile and enjoy! It's impossible to spoil a baby.</P>

<P><B>Discover what's what.</B> Pay close attention to all the sounds (cooing, babbling, gurgling, and crying) your baby makes, as well as facial expressions and body movements. Each one means something different</P>

<P><B>Never use physical force.</B> The pressures of parenting are very real. You need to find safe, satisfying ways to release them - but never on your baby.</P>

<a name="Toddlerhood"></a>
<H3>Toddlerhood</H3>

<P><B>Take a deep breath.</B> The assault on your house, your personal belongings... this too, shall pass. Right now, to your toddler, everything is new, exciting ... and just waiting to be explored.</P>

<P><B>Childproof your house.</B> Pack away your treasures and lockup dangerous or poisonous items. You'll be more relaxed, and you won't have to say "NO" so often.</P>

<P><B>Keep the rules simple and few.</B> Your goal is to keep your toddler safe. Table manners can wait and so can toilet training.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="School"></a>
<H3>School Age</H3>

<P><B>Show interest.</B> Check homework, talk about what's happening in school, ask their friends over, and find time to see your children's teachers occasionally.</P>

<P><B> Communicate.</B> If there's a single golden rule for parents, it's this: Talk to your children (and listen, too).</P>

<P><B>Assign kid-sized chores.</B>  Kids this age love to help. Just make sure the chores fit each child's capabilities. Nothing makes a child lose interest faster than having to do something too difficult, or too easy.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Adolescence"></a>
<H3>Adolescence</H3>

<P><B>Refuse to get confused.</B> Part of growing up is acting like a two-year-old and an adult, all in the same day. Expect your teen to do this, and be prepared to comfort, reassure and, on occasion, look the other way.</P>

<P><B>Face the facts.</B> Your teen will probably say "I know that," when you talk about the facts of life, but do it anyway. As a parent, you're the only one who can share the values that go with the facts!</P>

<P><B>Let your affection show.</B>  Cool the physical demonstrations (especially when their friends are around), but make it loud and clear: You care!</P>

<P><B>Cut those apron strings.</B> Old values, taught from the cradle, may fade away during the teen years, but they come back - along with grownup children you'll be proud to know. Trust your teens to make it all the way. </P>

<hr>

<a name="Discipline"></a>
<H3>Discipline</H3>

<P><B>Nothing</B> helps your survival as a parent more than discipline. But, to be effective, discipline must teach a child how to avoid repeating misbehaviors and what to do instead. It should also be given in doses that fit the age of the child and the size of the crime.</P>

<P>Babies are never candidates for discipline. They're too little!</P>

<P>All children react better to approval and affection!</P>

<P>Discipline only when reasonable expectations are not met. Define clearly, in advance, what you want them to do!</P>

<P>Be consistent. Whatever style of discipline you choose, use it in every situation, even in public or when the grandparents are visiting.</P>

<P>Review expectations regularly. There are no perfect children, just as there are no perfect parents. If your children are not meeting your expectations, the expectations probably need changing, not the children.</P>

<P>Shame, rejection, withdrawal of affection, or preferential treatment of one child over another have no place in discipline.</P>

How To Teach Your Children Discipline</a><br><br>
<hr width=75 align=left>
</td>
<td>

<p>How do young children learn self-control, self-help, ways to get along
with others, and family and school procedures? Such learning occurs when
parents and teachers of infants, toddlers, or preschoolers are continuously
involved in setting limits, encouraging desired behaviors, and making
decisions about managing children.</p>

<p>When making these decisions, caregivers often ask themselves these
questions: Am I disciplining in a way that hurts or helps this child's
self-esteem? Will my discipline help the child develop self-control? This
digest suggests methods and language that can be used in handling
common situations involving young children.</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="methods"></a>
<H3>Methods Of Discipline That Promote Self-Worth</H3>

<p>1. Show that you recognize and accept the reason the child is doing
what, in your judgment, is the wrong thing:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"You want to play with the truck but..."</p>

<p>"You want me to stay with you but..."</p>

<p>This validates the legitimacy of the child's desires and illustrates that
you are an understanding person. It also is honest from the outset: The
adult is wiser, in charge, not afraid to be the leader,
and occasionally has priorities other than those of the child.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>2. State the "but":</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"You want to play with the truck, but Jerisa is using it right now."</p>

<p>"You want me to stay with you, but right now I need to (go out, help
Jill, serve lunch, etc.)."</p>

<p>This lets the child know that others have needs, too. It teaches
perspective taking, and may lead the child to develop the ability to put
himself in other people's shoes. It will also gain you the child's
respect, for it shows you are fair. And it will make the child feel safe;
you are able to keep him safe. </p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>3. Offer a solution:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"Soon you can play with the truck."</p>

<p>One-year-olds can begin to understand "just a minute" and will wait
patiently if we always follow through 60 seconds later. Two- and
three-year-olds can learn to understand, "I'll tell you when it's your
turn," if we always follow through within two or three minutes. This helps
children learn how to delay gratification but does not thwart their
short-term understanding of time.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>4. Often, it's helpful to say something indicating your confidence in the
child's ability and willingness to learn:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"When you get older I know you will (whatever it is you expect)."</p>

<p>"Next time you can (restate what is expected in a positive manner)."</p>

<p>This affirms your faith in the child, lets her know that you assume she
has the capacity to grow and mature, and transmits your belief in her good
intentions.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>5. In some situations, after firmly stating what is not to be done, you
can demonstrate how we do it, or a better way:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"We don't hit. Pat my face gently." (Gently stroke).</p>

<p>"Puzzle pieces are not for throwing. Let's put them in their places
together." (Offer help).</p>

<p>This sets firm limits, yet helps the child feel that you two are a team,
not enemies.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>6. Toddlers are not easy to distract, but frequently they can be
redirected to something that is similar but OK. Carry or lead the child by
the hand, saying,</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>"That's the gerbil's paper. Here's your paper."</p>

<p>"Peter needs that toy. Here's a toy for you."</p>

<p>This endorses the child's right to choose what she will do, yet begins to
teach that others have rights, too. </p></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>7. Avoid accusation. Even with babies, communicate in respectful tones
and words. This prevents a lowering of the child's self-image and promotes
his tendency to cooperate.</p>

<p>8. For every no, offer two acceptable choices:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"No! Rosie cannot bite Esther. Rosie can bite the rubber duck or the
cracker." </p>

<p>"No, Jackie. That book is for teachers. You can have this book or this
book."</p>

<p>This encourages the child's independence and emerging decision-making
skills, but sets boundaries. Children should never be allowed to hurt each
other. It's bad for the self-image of the one who hurts and the one who is
hurt.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>9. If children have enough language, help them express their feelings,
including anger, and their wishes. Help them think about alternatives and
solutions to problems. Adults should never fear children's anger:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>"You're mad at me because you're so tired. It's hard to feel loving when
you need to sleep. When you wake up, I think you'll feel more friendly."</p>

<p>"You feel angry because I won't let you have candy. I will let you choose
a banana or an apple. Which do you want?"</p>

<p>This encourages characteristics we want to see emerge in children, such
as awareness of feelings and reasonable assertiveness, and gives children
tools for solving problems without unpleasant scenes.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>10. Establish firm limits and standards as needed. Until a child is 1 1/2
or almost 2 years old, adults are completely responsible for his safety and
comfort, and for creating the conditions that encourage good behavior. After
this age, while adults are still responsible for the child's safety, they
increasingly, though extremely gradually, begin to transfer responsibility
for behaving acceptably to the child. They start expecting the child to
become aware of others' feelings. They begin to expect the child to think
simple cause/effect thoughts (provided the child is guided quietly through
the thinking process). This is teaching the rudiments of self-discipline.</p>

<p>11. To avoid confusion when talking to very young children, give clear,
simple directions in a firm, friendly voice. This will ensure that children
are not overwhelmed with a blizzard of words and refuse to comply as a
result.</p>

<p>12. Remember that the job of a toddler, and to some extent the job of all
young children, is to taste, touch, smell, squeeze, tote, poke, pour, sort,
explore, and test. At times toddlers are greedy, at times grandiose. They do
not share well; they need time to experience ownership before they are
expected to share. They need to assert themselves ("No," "I can't," "I
won't," and "Do it myself"). They need to separate to a degree from their
parents, that is, to individuate.  One way they do this is to say no and not
to do what is asked; another is to do what is not wanted.</p>

<p>If adults understand children in this age range, they will create
circumstances and develop attitudes that permit and promote development.
Self discipline is better learned through guidance than through punishment.
It's better learned through a "We are a team, I am the leader, it's my job
to help you grow up" approach than through a "me against you" approach.</p>

<H3>Creating A Positive Climate Promotes Self-Discipline</H3>

<p>Creating a positive climate for the very young involves</p>
<UL>
<li>spending lots of leisurely time with an infant or child;<br><br>

<li>sharing important activities and meaningful play;<br><br>

<li>listening and answering as an equal, not as an instructor (for example,
using labeling words when a toddler points inquiringly toward something, or
discussing whatever topic the 2-year-old is trying to tell you about);<br><br>

<li>complimenting the child's efforts: "William is feeding himself!" "Juana
is putting on her shoe!" (even if what you are seeing is only clumsy stabs
in the right direction); and<br><br>

<li>smiling, touching, caressing, kissing, cuddling, holding, rocking,
hugging.<br><br>

<H3>Harmful, Negative Disciplinary Methods</H3>

<p>Criticizing, discouraging, creating obstacles and barriers, blaming,
shaming, using sarcastic or cruel humor, or using physical punishment are
some negative disciplinary methods used with young children. Often saying,
"Stop that!" "Don't do it that way!" or "You never..." is harmful to
children's self-esteem. Such discipline techniques as removal from the
group, or isolation in a time-out chair or a corner, may have negative
consequences for the child.</p>

<p>Any adult might occasionally do any of these things. Doing any or all of
them more than once in a while means that a negative approach to discipline
has become a habit and urgently needs to be altered before the child
experiences low self-esteem as a permanent part of her personality.</p>

<P>Becoming a foster parent will change your life-style. Maybe not at first, but as months and years pass you will be affected. Foster care will affect you and your family in many areas (extended family, community involvement, your personal activities, and those of your children.) The changes, like life around us, range from very good to very negative. </P>

<P>You will find that your relatives fit into two categories when you inform them that you are going to <B>take in</B> a foster child. Either they proclaim you the saints of the family or just plain nuts. 

Whichever side of the discussion they voice their opinion on, your	
choice to take in foster children puts them in various dilemmas. Grandparents suffer through a multitude of questions. Besides the normal dilemma of whether to include the foster child on their Christmas list, I had a grandparent question whether they should be included in their will. If you only take one or	
two foster children into your homein your lifetime those questions may	
need an honest answer, but after ten or more foster children the questions
become moot.</P>

<P>Foster parents are trained to respect the privacy of the foster child and their families. Relatives don't always understand why you can't tell them about their <B>new</B> niece or nephew. Their bewilderment only gets worse when the child acts out in an inappropriate manner and you can't justify the behavior because the past history falls into the data privacy area. For some families this leads to selective invitations, where only certain individuals, or only adults are invited over. What do you do in those special circumstances? Cousins will get married, families will want a family portrait, what is the best way to handle special circumstances? No matter how many or what types of children you care for, the one thing that relatives will come to realize is that you are a very busy person. As the years pass, and you have to react to foster care emergency after emergency, you may find that the visits and the invitations become few and far between. </P>

<P>The community, your neighbors, are not much different. There may be a few who would like to blame you for every wrong that happens in the neighborhood, because you brought <B>those kids</B> into your home. Most, though, think it's wonderful that you can do what you do, just keep them in your yard. </P>

<P>Our police officers know us by name and most of the teachers at the school refer to us as <B>that house</B>. The ones we work with on a regular basis are supportive and complimentary, the rest just raise their eyebrows when we pass them on the street. Church members work hard to include the children in activities, but never invite the <B>whole</B> family over for dinner. (If someone 
did once, it never happened twice.) Foster families tend to be larger than the <B>norm</B>, and size alone can cause discomfort, without adding the
abnormal behavior factor. Foster families are very visible to the
community and can add additional pressures whether real or imaginary. As the adult of the foster family, you will constantly find yourself surrounded by people and yet very much alone.</P>

<P>Being a foster parent will develop your skills as a independent social director, therapist, and taxi service, to mention just a few.
Activities that you took for granted as a member of the adult world will
be infringed upon by the children you invited into your home. If you are
physically active, and participating in athletic pursuits, your activities may
change when the teenager you accept into your home is too paranoid to ride a bike, skate, or go in a boat. The activities of the whole family will be tailored to fit the least adaptable member. Need for attention or preconceived fears will stimulate pseudo injuries or refusals to participate. Your social outings will be disrupted by unruly children or true emergencies (you will have more than you could imagine). The foster children you choose to bring into your home will have all the normal problems, but accelerated to an abnormal pace. </P>


<P>You will be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The safety and welfare of the foster children will be a constant priority. Your birth children will grow up with "the street in their home." They will, at a young age, be aware of the cruelties that the children of this world face. They will endure pressures at home where they were intending to find refuge. Your choice to take in foster children will either send them on the streets in rebellion or give them skills to become outstanding young adults. It is not uncommon to find your birth children very active outside the home. They will participate in the community, not only because they choose to, but because it is a release from the constant pressure foster care places on them. Your choice to accept a foster child into your home will change your birth child for life. When you are old, no one will remember what you did. Except for: </P>

<blockquote>

<P>A child, now an adult, who has a life with a little more purpose and a lot more love, </P>

<P>A child who would never have experienced an alternate "safe family" except that you chose to be a foster parent. </P>

<P>Who has a job and pay the bills, because you taught them how to work. </P>

<P>Who completed school, because you ensured that the homework was done. </P>

<P>Who treats their family with respect, because you modeled dignity. </P>

</blockquote>

<P><B>Thank you, from all of them!</B> </P>

<P>  Anyone who has shopped at a grocery store or a mall with children, especially young children, knows the experience can sometimes be trying and highly stressful. Here are some steps that can change potential misery into potential mastery of shopping with kids.</P>

<a name="Plan"></a>
<H3>Plan Ahead...</H3>

<H4>Explain the rules</H4>

<P>Before entering the store make  your expectations clear, such as "Stay close to me," "Use your quiet voice," and "No  begging for candy."</P>

<P>Select a secret word or signal that you can both use to get the immediate attention of the other.</P>

<P>Role play at home in how to act at the store.</P>
<H4>Agree on rewards for good behavior</H4>

<P>Keep it simple such as a choice of a favorite snack or a stop at the park. Promise to read a story or play a game at home. "When we leave, you can select a package of gum if you remember the rules."</P>

<H4>Pack a treat</H4>

<P>Bring a nutritious snack for the child to eat during the shopping trip (raisins, cut up apples, nuts, etc.).</P>
                         
<P>Bring a storybook for the child to look at. Keep a supply of little action figures or small manipulative toys handy.</P>

<P>Bring a favorite blanket, toy or book from home to help make the child feel secure.  For a small child, tie a favorite soft toy to the handle of the shopping cart or stroller.</P>

<P>Bring a pad and pencil or magic markers for the child to use while you are shopping.</P>

<H4>Check emotions</H4>

<p>Is your child too tired or hungry to shop? Are you? If yes, postpone your trip or find a sitter for your child(ren). </p>

<P>Go when you are rested, as well as when the child is rested. Don't wait until the end of a tiring day.</P>

<a name="At"></a>
<H3>At The Store</H3>

<H4>Make a game out of shopping</H4>

<P>Who can see the bananas? Who can see the potatoes first? Do you remember what animal bacon comes from?</P>

<P>Let's count all the tennis shoes we see on people's feet. Let's see how many Bs you can find on signs. Let's guess how much something is going to cost. </P>

<P>Sing songs. Make up a silly one together about spinach or broccoli.</P>

<P>Play "I see something" - Then ask your child(ren) what it is.  Give hints to challenge the imagination. Describe a food in the cart and have the children  guess the food. </P>

<H4>More Games</H4>

<P>Discuss the pictures on the package - what you could make with this, etc.  Let the child see how many things one can do with a certain item.  (How many things one can do with a certain item. (How many things can you make out of tomato paste?)</P>

<P>Find five things on each aisle that start with the letter B, are red, are in cans, are for eating, are NOT for eating, etc.</P>

<P>Have the child help you name all the vegetables in the cart, all the meats, breads, fruits, milk products, etc.</P>

<P>Count how many steps it takes to get from the "Cheerios" to the "Frosted Flakes".</P>

<P> Do "quiet cheers" at the checkout stand, spelling each child's name (Give me an A (A), Give me an M (M), etc.)</P>

<P>While waiting in line, retell your child's favorite story having the child chime in on  the verses he or she knows.</P>

<H4>Give children some choices</H4>

<P>When possible, allow your child(ren) to make some decisions. Blue or red socks? Chocolate or vanilla ice cream? Be prepared to bargain or compromise.</P>

<H4> Give child a responsibility</H4>

<P>Help select the hardest apples, find the cheapest greenbeans, match the coupons with the labels. </P>
 
<P>If the child is old enough, let him or her check the grocery list or see which fruit, cheese, etc. is the best bargain.</P>


<H4>Praise your child</H4>

<P>"You are being so helpful." A hug can be reassuring and say more than words	at times. 	Reinforce appropriate behavior.  Talk with the child, play and engage the child in the decision making process.  
Encourage the child to talk, watch, listen and think.</P>

<hr>

<a name="If"></a>
<H3>If All Else Fails...</H3>

<P>Remember:     Kids will be kids; they are not perfect. Of course, neither are we, but we are the adults.</P>

<P>Ignore inappropriate behavior unless it becomes dangerous, destructive, annoying to others, or truly embarrassing. Don't let the child think that you will allow him or her to misbehave in public.</P>

<P>Remove a child who is out of control. Take him or her to the restroom or out of the store. Tell the child quietly, eye-to-eye that the behavior is absolutely unacceptable.</P>

<P>Wait, saying nothing at all, for the child to calm down. Then ask if he or she is ready to try again.</P>

<P>Go home if the child cannot calm down. If the shopping cannot wait, find a sitter and return alone.</P>
   
<P>   Tell  the child you will have to leave him or her at home next time-then do it. </P>
   
<P>   Don't ever buy the child a treat when he or she has thrown a fit.</P>

<P>BRADENTON, Fla.--Jun. lO--When Mary Anderson went back to work full time, plunking down $75 a week for her son's care required budgeting at first.</P>

<P>Now that her 23-month-old son Daniel has been at A Growing Place in Palmetto for about a year, she is pleased with the care he receives.</P>

<P>"It's a bigger day care with two teachers in every classroom and that makes you feel safe. They do a good job," said Anderson, 27, who schedules surgery at Manatee Memorial Hospital. Her husband, Bill, 33, is a used-car salesman.</P>

<P>But the child-care payment is still a chunk out of the Anderson family's budget, especially since they don't qualify for subsidized care.</P>

<P>"That's the first expense that comes out of each paycheck," Anderson said.</P>

<P>Child care is a very difficult thing for many people to afford, said Carol Hunt, director of Project Child Care, 1003 17th St. W., Palmetto. Project Child Care is the central agency for child-care referrals and subsidies in Manatee County since 1985.</P>

<P>Her agency doles out state subsidies for 1,100 local children whose parents meet state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services income guidelines and another 75 children who receive subsidies through Manatee County Children's Services.</P>

<P>The state and county funding either provides parents with vouchers for day care or the children attend one of the 37 local child-care centers and homes under contract with Project Child Care.</P>

<P>Project Child Care owns A Crowing Place, which serves 153 children, 70 percent of whom receive subsidized care. The agency also operates e day care center for about 200 teenage mothers that is funded by the Manatee County School Board</P>

<P>Nationwide, parents pay an average of $3,500 a year for care, reported the Child Care Action Campaign, a national not-for-profit child advocacy organization in New York City.</P>

<P>The advocacy group - which seeks better standards for child care - found that one-third of workers nationwide need child care, while absenteeism from work due to child care breakdowns cost businesses $3 billion each year.</P>

<P>According to the Florida Children's Forum, another advocacy group, 61,000 income-qualified parents are receiving public child-care subsidies, with another 25,000 parents on waiting lists.</P>

<P>In Manatee County, 1,175 parents receive subsidies.</P>

<P>Another 279 working parents are eligible for subsidies, but there isn't enough money to help them, Hunt said.</P>

<P>Those parents are paying for child care and struggling, Hunt said. "Or, they have their kids in compromising situations either juggling them between friends and family or leaving them alone."</P>

<P>While some people can't afford child care now, people like Hunt fear that new welfare-law restrictions will further limit financial assistance.</P>

<P>Child-care experts believe stimulating learning experiences in the first five years of life are critical for proper development of the brain and thought processes.</P>

<P>Those experts advocate improvements in the quality of day care, which
would increase training costs and salaries for child care workers.</P>

<P>While Project Child Care provides state-mandated training for all local child-care workers, it is very basic training, Hunt said.</P>

<P>Most day cares can't afford to pay the salaries trained and certified teachers command, so they are forced to train unqualified staff members and have a higher ratio of children to adults just to break even.</P>

<P>"The dilemma is the majority of parents can't pay for care now, or they have a hard time paying for care," said Hunt. "The child care community can't afford to provide the level of cars that children need."</P>

<P>Child-care programs in Manatee County offer a range of programs, said Hunt, from those that simply watch children; to those that offer safe and healthy environments with limited stimulating activities; to those that emphasize top-rate developmentally appropriate programs.</P>

<P>"We are probably providing a little bit of good care in some places, mediocre care in others and hopefully no poor care," Hunt said.</P>

<P>Quality is a concern to many parents, but money drives their decisions about child care, Project Child Care Resource Director Rosa Trahan-Wise said.</P>

<P>"You can hear the frustration in the voice of parents who know what type of child care they want," Trehan-Wise said. "When we tell them how much it will cost, they sacrifice quality for less money."</P>

<P>And summer is a particularly difficult time for parents who need to find care for school-age children.</P>

<P>They are tempted by signs that pop up in front yards offering child-sitting services at seemingly affordable prices, said Trahan-Wise.</P>

<P>"Many families use illegal providers ... rather than pay $80 a week for good, quality care," she said.</P>

<P>There are 282 licensed or registered child-care providers in Manatee County and Project Child Care can help any parent - regardless of income --find child care.</P>

<P>People come to us in tears because they don't know where to turn," Trahan-Wise said. "Our staff does a good job helping them."</P>

<P>The agency uses a computer program to match providers with parents. Staff members help parents find care during odd days or hours, and they know providers who will work with financially struggling parents.</P>

<P>They also qualify parents for subsidies that can make a difference for people like Shonda Davis, 23, of Bradenton, who is separated and raising five children.</P>

<P>With subsidies, Davis pays $32 every two weeks for three of her children, Nakia Cummings, 4, Devontae' Cummings, 3, and Eboni Davis, 1, to attend A Growing Place.</P>

<P>She pays $20 a month for son, D'Uuintin Holloman, 5, to attend Manatee County Nursery School. Daughter Tiffani Davis, 8, attends boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Manatee.</P>

<P>Davis, who also works at A Growing Place, is grateful for the financial assistance. Without it, she would have to pay more than $300 a month for child care end could not afford to work.</P>

<P>People who don't work or who abuse the system that provides for subsidies worry Davis.</P>

<P>"People who don't work need to try to get a Job," she said. "I feel the people trying to do better ought to get the subsidies," Davis said.</P>
<BR><BR>
<P>HERE ARE SOME TIPS FOR PARENTS FROM PROJECT CHILD CARE:</P>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

	<LI> Plan well in advance searching for your child's day-care needs. Some facilities have limited openings or waiting lists.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Check out at least three day-care centers or child-care homes before choosing one for your child.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI>Visit each center or home and talk to teachers/staff at least twice -one announced visit and one unannounced visit.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Ask for the qualifications and length of employment of teachers/staff.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Review health and safety inspection reports at the state Department
	of Health and Rehabilitative Services child Day Care Licensing and Regulations office, 353 Sixth Ave. W., in Pinnacle Plaza.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Talk to other parents who use the services you are considering.<BR><BR>
	
	<LI> Buy the best care you can afford.<BR><BR>

	<LI> Once you find day care, get involved. Get to know the teachers and care-givers. Find out what's happening with your child and ask questions.<BR><BR>

<p>Close to half of all mothers of children under one year of age are now
working outside of their homes. Their children are cared for by relatives,
by in-home caregivers, and in family day care homes and centers. Family day
care is the most common out-of-home child care arrangement for infants, but
the proportion of infants in center care is steadily increasing (Hofferth
and Phillips, 1987).</p> 

<p>Recent debate has focused on the possibility that children enrolled in
out-of-home child care as infants are at risk for later social and emotional
development (Belsky, 1988; Clarke-Stewart, 1988). This ERIC Digest will
evaluate the evidence concerning infant child care as a risk for children's
social and emotional development.</p>

<a name="Maternal"></a>
<H3>Studies of Maternal Employment</H3>

<p>Studies of the effects of maternal employment on the security of the
child's attachment to the mother form the primary research base for the
assertion that infant child care constitutes a risk for children. Security
of attachment is commonly assessed with the Ainsworth Strange Situation
(Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978) when the child is approximately 1
year old. The Strange Situation is a 20-minute laboratory procedure that
involves repeated separations from the mother and the infant's being left
with a friendly stranger.</p>

<p>Sixteen recent studies that used this assessment method showed that
infants of full-time employed mothers were more likely to exhibit an
insecure maternal attachment relationship than infants of part-time employed
and nonemployed mothers (Belsky, 1988; Clarke-Stewart, 1988). It is
important to recognize that even though more infants of full-time employed
mothers were classified as insecure, well over half (Belsky: 59%;
Clarke-Stewart: 63%) of the infants of full-time employed mothers have been
classified as securely attached.</p>

<p>On the basis of this research, Belsky (1988) concluded that full-time
infant child care prior to the first birthday puts children at risk for
later development. Alternative interpretations focus on the psychological
meaning of the Strange Situation assessment to the infant who has
experienced child care. The experiences of separation of infants in child
care centers and family day care homes differ from those of infants not
enrolled in child care. We do not know if the former infants find the
Strange Situation less stressful than the latter.</p>

<p>One problem with the research linking maternal attachment security and
maternal employment is that it provides little information about the kind of
alternative care experienced by the infant. We know that infants become
attached to their alternative caregivers (Howes, Rodning, Galluzzo, &amp; Myers,
1988). We also know that the quality of the child's attachment to the mother
does not predict the quality of the child's attachment to the alternative
caregiver (Howes and others, 1988). A child with an insecure maternal
attachment relationship may have a secure attachment
relationship with an alternative caregiver.</p>

<p>These studies suggest that positive relationships with infant child care
caregivers may compensate for insecure maternal attachments. If future
research supports these conclusions, the stability and characteristics of
the infant child care caregiver will assume great importance.</p>

<a name="Settings"></a> 
<H3>Studies of Child Care Settings</H3>

<p>Mothers who are responsive and sensitive--that is, who respond
consistently and appropriately to their child's social bids and initiate
interactions geared to the child's capacities, intentions, moods, goals, and
developmental level--are most likely to have children with secure maternal
attachments (Belsky, Rovine, and Taylor, 1984). One can assume that this is
also true for alternative caregivers. Some research suggests that in infant
child care, infants and toddlers with more responsive and sensitive
caregivers have higher cognitive and language scores and greater social
competence (Rubenstein &amp; Howes, 1983).</p>

<p>Several features of the child care environment are linked to caregiver
sensitivity and responsiveness. These are: formal training in child
development on the part of the caregiver, few children to care for and many
adults in the room, short hours,
decreased responsibility for housework, and environments designed to be safe
and appropriate for children (Howes &amp; Stewart, 1987). As might be expected,
caregivers who work in high quality child care settings can be more
responsive and sensitive to the infants in their care than caregivers with
less desirable conditions. Infants and toddlers in high quality child care
are more likely than children in low quality care to be securely attached to
caregivers (Howes and others, 1988), to engage in competent social
interaction with adults and peers (Howes and Stewart 1987), to self-regulate
(Howes and Olenick, 1986), and to have high language and cognitive scores
(Goelman &amp; Pence, 1987).</p>

<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><hr>

<a name="Developement"></a>
<H3>Studies Linking Children's Developement To Family And Child Care
Influences</H3>

<p>Despite constraints on parental choice of child care, several studies
report that families who provide appropriate care in their homes tend to
select good child care. Parents who are stressed (Howes and Stewart, 1987),
lead complex lives (Howes and Olenick, 1986), lack social supports (Howes
and Stewart, 1987), and lack developmentally appropriate child rearing
practices and values (Howes &amp; Stewart, 1987), are more likely to enroll
their child in low quality than in high quality child care. Mothers whose
infants are classified as insecurely attached enroll their infants in family
day care homes that have a higher than average number of children per
caregiver (Howes and others, 1988).</p> 

<p>A few studies have attempted to compare the relative influences of family
and child care on the development of infants in child care. These suggest
that the combination of child care and family influences best predicts the
social development of the infant (Howes &amp; Olenick, 1986; Howes and Stewart,
1987; Howes, 1988). Infants and toddlers in high quality care and cared for
by families low in stress and high in social support and developmentally
appropriate child rearing values and practices were more socially competent
(Howes and Stewart, 1987). Children with a history of high quality care
inside and outside the family were better able to adjust to first grade than
children with less fortunate care and family histories (Howes, 1988).</p>

<p>Research evidence does not suggest that infant child care per se is
detrimental to the child's future social and emotional development. It does
raise concerns for the child who experiences insensitive care both at home
and in child care.</p>

What understandings from thisknowledge base can help ussupport young children as they developstrategies for dealing withcomplex interpersonal relationships among theirpeers?</P><P>Aggression and cooperation represent two critical featuresin thechild's social domain. What do they have in common? Both emergefromthe child's strong developmental push to initiate andmaintainrelationships with other children, beginning at a very early age.Peerrelationships provide critical opportunities for children to learntomanage conflict and work towards establishing intimacy. Aggressionandcooperation are two possible strategies for dealing with thenormalconflicts of early peer interactions. Both have important rootsinearly family interactions, both are responsive to adult expectationsandvalues, and both can be responsive to environmental factors.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <aname="Aggression"></a><H3>Aggression And Cooperation: Definitions AndEmerging Features </H3><P>"Aggression" is defined here as anyintentional behavior that resultsin physical or mental injury to anyperson or animal, or in damage toor destruction of property. Aggressiveactions can be accidentalactions, in which there is no intentionality;instrumental actions, inwhich the child deliberately employs aggression inpursuit of a goal;or hostile actions, in which the child acts to causeharm to anotherperson. Because peer interactions in their earliest formsemerge fromplay in which infants treat each other as they would treat atoy orinteresting object--for example, one baby reaches over and grabsthecheek of another--unintentional aggression is a common and naturalformof behavior for infants and toddlers. These accidental behaviorscan enableyoung children to achieve desired results (for example,grabbing a toy fromanother child) and, in a short period of time, caneasily develop intoinstrumental forms of aggression. Aggressivebehavior is a deterrent tofriendships and social success. Studiesindicate that young children citeaggressive behavior as a significantreason for disliking others. Researchalso indicates that aggressivebehavior is responsive to environmentalinfluences and can beencouraged or discouraged by experiences in home andschool.Aggression should not be confused with assertion--behaviorthroughwhich a child maintains and defends his or her own rights andconcerns. Assertive behavior reflects the child's developingcompetence andautonomous functioning and represents an important formof developmentalprogress. Assertiveness also affords the young childa healthy form ofself-defense against becoming the victim of theaggressions ofothers.</P><P>Much evidence suggests that children who exhibitinstrumental andhostile forms of aggression during the preschool yearshave beenexposed, in early family interactions, to adults who encourage,model,or condone aggression by using discipline techniques thatarepunitive, rigid, and authoritarian; ignoring or permittingaggressiveactions by the child and other children; providing ortoleratingaggressive toys or aggressive images from television, movies,andbooks in the child's surroundings; or modeling aggression in theirowninterpersonal interactions.</P><P>"Cooperation" is defined here asany activity that involves thewilling interdependence of two or morechildren. It should bedistinguished from compliance, which may representobedience to rulesor authority, rather than intentional cooperation. Whenchildrenwillingly collaborate in using materials, for example,theirinteractions are usually quite different than when they are toldto"share." Cooperation, like aggression, has its roots in very early,evenpreverbal, social interactions. Studies on the origins ofprosocialbehaviors, which include cooperation, suggest that familyvariables relatedto the development of prosocial behaviors includeparental disciplinetechniques that are authoritative rather thanauthoritarian and that offerthe child free expression of affectionand nurturance. These techniquesinvolve the use of high expectations;competent communication; andinductive reasoning, in which parentsengage children in explanations ofthe reasons for family rules andlimits. Children who demonstrate a numberof cooperative strategiesand can attend to the needs of others while alsoasserting anddefending their own rights are more likely to be sociallysuccessfuland to establish reciprocal, mutually satisfying friendshipsthan areother children.</P><HR> <aname="Techniques"></a><H3>Techniques For Reducing Aggression And FosteringCooperation </H3><P>Because aggressive behavior can emerge as a normalbehavior during thesecond and third years of life, it is important not toassume thatsuch behaviors represent a personality trait. When adultsassume thatchildren are being intentionally aggressive, the expectationforundesirable qualities can become established and can lead toa"recursive cycle" (Katz and McClellan, 1991) in which children cometofulfill the expectations set for them.</P><P>Aggressive toddlers orpreschoolers can benefit from support andencouragement for replacingaggressive behaviors with more sociallyproductive alternatives. Importanttechniques include helping youngchildren label and verbalize theirfeelings and those of others,develop problem-solving approaches toconflicts, seek and obtainassistance when in difficulty, and notice theconsequences of theiraggressive actions for their victims. Age-appropriateanger managementtechniques, and discussion of the causes and consequencesofinterpersonal conflicts, can help both young children andtheircaregivers deal with emerging aggressive behaviors. Adultguidancethat is consistent, supportive, nonpunitive, and includes thechild inunderstanding the reactions of all participants and the reasonsforlimits, will help even very young children cope withaggressivebehaviors.</P><P>How can parents and teachers recognize andfoster the cooperativebehaviors which all children demonstrate as theydevelop? They canacknowledge children's efforts to initiate socialinteractions inappropriate ways, affirm helping behaviors, use positivedisciplinetechniques and communicate their power, communicate positiveregardand high expectations for all young children, and support eachchild'sstruggle to resolve interpersonal conflicts. Of criticalimportanceare classroom strategies that promote cooperative, ratherthancompetitive, endeavors; foster dramatic play techniques andreflectivestrategies for thinking about and discussing socialinteractions; andenable children to get to know and trust each other andwork towardstruly interdependent activity.</P><HR> <aname="Policies"></a><H3>Program Policies That Foster The Development OfCooperation </H3><P>Many children begin to show interest in peers asearly as eighteenmonths. Early childhood educators can support theemergence oftrusting and positive interpersonal strategies by encouragingtheformation of play groups and regular social interactions thataresupervised in a supportive manner. Children benefit from consistentandsustained relationships in which they can build trust, understandandpredict the responses of their peers, and gain confidence in theirabilityto cope with conflictual interactions.

<h2>Donation to Doddridge County High School </h2>

<p>Congratulations to the Doddridge County High School, Doddridge County West Virginia!  They are the recipients of the donation of a 386 laptop computer for their Media Center as part of KidSource OnLine's Computing EDGE program.<br><br>

<a href="mailto:crichard@access.k12.wv.us">Christine Richards</a>, the school's Library/Media Specialist received the donation from <a href="/kidsource/pages/hybridmedia.html">HybridMedia</a> of Palo Alto, California. HybridMedia provides strategic planning and product management services for Internet and multimedia companies worldwide.<br><br>  

Doddridge County High School has 425 students and is located in a rural area of West Virginia with a high rate of unemployment.  Funding for new technology is rare and such donations bring sorely needed resources to those who can use them the most.<br><br>   

The laptop will not only expand the resources available to students in the Media Center, but Ms. Richards plans on letting students check out the laptop and take it home to use it with their parents.   This is one way for her to increase the understanding of the benefits of computing technology throughout her school district. <br><br>   

Her vision is to bring the world of the Internet to her students and their parents, in addition to teaching basic computer skills as a foundation for future employment.<br><br>

We wish to thank HybridMedia for their generous donation. <br><br>

        The Iowa Juvenile Home, 701 S. Church Toledo,Iowa,  is in need of
computers to be used in the classrooms.  Currently we have few computers
that limit assess for our students,  We have approximately 92 students
many from low income and troubled families with limited experience in
computers. We are looking for <B>lap-tops</B> or other <B>up-to-date equipment</B> that the
teachers can use with their students in the classrooms.  Contact Mike Sawyer at
<a href="mailto: msawyer@max.state.ia.us">msawyer@max.state.ia.us</a> if you wish to help us.  Thank You.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>***NEW***</B> <br>
I work in an education cooperative west of Boston, Mass.  Fifteen
school districts belong to our collaborative.  My job is to coordinate
teacher training for all the disricts.  I need either <B>Macintosh
machines (minimally SEs), preferably LCs, Performas (dare I say Power
Macs)</B> and/or Windows machines for the training site.<BR>

Part of our collaaborative is that we run a few of our own schools for
special needs students and students  with social problems.  These
children typically cannot attend public schools.  We have multiplly
handicapped classroom and these children use computers with various
adaptive devices.<BR>

Our high school program for children with scial/emotional problems is
very interesting.  Many of the students are in fact quite bright, but
need to be in a small environment.  They need the technology because
very soon they are going out in the world to jobs (and in some cases
small colleges) where they will need technology skills.<BR>

Please e-mail me <a href="ross-mcb@meol.mass.edu">ross-mcb@meol.mass.edu</a> call me at (617) 237-3028 Gail
Ross-McBride if you can donate.  Thank you.<BR><BR>

        Everyone at John Marshall Middle School will benefit from
additional computers.  We are a low socio-economic school located in
Wichita, Kansas, in which few students have access to computers outside of
school.  Our current technology is so old that broken parts are no longer
replaceable by the district.  These computers are so slow that some
students graduate before they can complete a project!<BR>
        We would appreciate any help in obtaining the following:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>Macintosh</B> or DOS computers and compatible printers.
	<LI>CD Roms and Modems
	<LI>Any and all software for the middle school level, especially related to
Math, Language Arts, Science, Graphing and Charting, Keyboarding/Typing,
Clip Art and any publishing programs.

My school is located in an extremely low economic region of rural
Tennessee.  (Grundy County)  We have many wonderful natural resources,
including bright children.  We are working hard to provide them with
skills to help them better the lives of their families.  We currently
have some Macintosh computers, some Apple II's and a couple of IBM
compatible computers.  We serve approximately 650 students in grades
K-8.  We want our children to be able to compete favorably in the job
markets and we know that a knowledge of computers is essential.  We
would appreciate any assistance available, from CD rom drives, to
computer systems.  We would especially like to be able to network all
the computers we do have to a central location (a server).  HELP!
Our 50 teachers have all become computer literate over the last 4
years, and would definitely put additional computers to use with our
children.  We are searching for <B>Macintosh computers, CD rom drives,
printers, scanners, modems, etc</B>.  We would be willing to recognize a
donor of such equipment as our "Partner in Education" and invite you
to visit and see the many good things we're doing for the children in
our community.<BR>

We are opening a new elementary school in September, 1996.
Believe-it-or-not, this is a new school with NO networking infrastructure
and no money for technology.  We have a room which would be ideal for a
computer lab - but alas! no computers!  We could use help with wiring our school, including cable for TV. <B>Any computer equipment</B> in good condition would be gratefully received and put to good use - we need the whole ball of wax.<BR>

Brady School is ready to enter the 21st century.  We gave 350
kindergarden through fifth graders, 98% of which are hispanic
and low income.  Our school is located in a crime/gang ridden
area.  Computer expertise is THE only way out for our
students.<BR>
We have built our computer lab from the cast-offs of other
places.  We have some PC(ols 346). Some Apples IIc that we
salvaged from the garbage after another school district threw
them away.<BR>
Our ONLY chance to give our students a fighting chance is the
good people who will be able to help us.  <B>We gladly accept
anything that works.  We are NOT picky.</B>  We value evething.  By
helping our students, you will be contributing to the future -
both yours and theirs.<BR>

   A team of 4 teachers work as a mini lab school with 80 common students
within a student population of 1200 at Edward Little High School.  Team
students are selected by guidance counselors and parents at the end of the
Freshman year.  These youngsters are average and above intellectually but
are not reaching their academic potential.  Teaming provides a more
individualized, personal approach for youngster as they grapple with their
personal and academic uncertainties and insecurities.<BR>

   Teachers in the areas of math, science, English and history have
developed, through grant writing over a 5 year period, a five pronged, multi-level
community service learning project - ELF Woods.  The ELF Woods project
includes:<BR>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>  A 40 acre wooded campus with a mountain bike trail, cross country trail, obstacle course and lighted footpath designed and
	built by students for student and community use.
	<LI>Student built and managed greenhouse with self sustaining business.
	<LI>   Arboretum in the first year of development involving K-12 students to be enjoyed by students and community.
	<LI>  300 seating capacity outdoor amphitheater built by students and parents to be used by students and community.
	<LI>   Independent study course for community service projects.
</OL>

  The summer of 1996 will "see" the finalization and focus of the
procedures to coordinate and expand these projects as we become a lab institute for
commuity service learning in the state of Maine.<BR>

   A cluster of 6 computers will enable students sufficient learning and
practice time to develop competency in the areas of word processing,
spread sheet and data base.  Proficiences in these areas will provide marketable
life skills.<BR>

  The classroom and lesson design will allow 12 students computer time
while remaining students receive direct instruction , and/or experimentation or
practice time on a given topic.  Then the groups will be rotated to ensure
equal access time.  This is manageable within an 80 minute class period.<BR>

  The Power Book would be used by students at home in persuit of
individualized work.  The majority of our students are from culturally
disadvantage homes.  This will hopefully inspire parents to consider the
purchase of a computer as they watch their child's enthusiasm and experise
grow.<BR>

  Teachers would also have access to the power book to do project work.
Three of the 4 team teachers do not have Machintosh equipment at home which
causes frustrations and delays in preparing materials.  Neither do theachers have
ready access to computers at work on a regular basis during our prep or
team planning periods.<BR>

My name is Renee Ramig, and I am the technology coordinator at St.
Lawrence Elementary and Middle Schools in Santa Clara, CA.  During the
past nine years our Parent Teacher Group along with the total support of
the staff, have raised thousands of dollars for a new lab.  We currently
have a 20 station Macintosh lab.<BR>

We are a Pre-K - 8th Grade Catholic School.  We have an enrollment of 450
students.  The current computer lab is always busy with wonderful
projects from keyboarding to multimedia, research, and using the
Internet.<BR>

I am looking for computers that I can put into the classrooms.  I would
like much of the keyboarding and wordprocessing to take place in the
classrooms keeping the lab free for final editing, printing, multimedia,
etc.<BR>

I am looking for Macintosh computers.  Our middle school kids would
benefit from <B>any Mac that is an SE or above with a hard drive</B> since much
of their computer time involves word processing.  Our Pre-K - 5 students
would benefit greatly from <B>any color Mac LC or above</B> since most of their
work involves projects using objects and colors (Kidpix, Math Keys, The
Writing Center, etc.)  We are also always in need of <B>Macintosh-compatible
(serial) printers</B>. Thank you.<BR>

We are Ansley Public School, a rural district in the middle of Nebraska.
We are a small town  with our school being the heart of the community.
We would like to have Macintosh Computers that we could place on carts
so that we could have a mobile computer lab of sorts to try and get
technology into the classroom to enhance our existing curriculum.  We
have K-12 housed in the same building (approx. 350 students, K-12), so
it could be shared by all.  We'd like <B>PowerMac</B>'s so that we could find
some match funding to pick up Apple Curriculum Solution Bundles to place
on these machines.  We have a progressive and innovative faculty that
want to integrate technology into the curriculum for student benefit,
but lack the hardware resources.<BR>

<B>Ethernet Network Items Needed!</B><BR>

Gilbert Junior High School is located in Gilbert, Arizona.  Our Junior
High School's population in approximately 1000 students (7th &amp; 8th).
The school is in need of Ethernet network items.  Our goal is to set up
the computer applications lab with an Ethernet network for Internet use.
 Students, parents, and other community members will benefit from the
Internet connectivity.<BR>

Our school district has created the backbone (fiber), purchased a T1
line, and done everything except make the lab Ethernet.  Inadequate
funding resulted in a freeze of this project (major budget problems do
to record growth in the district).  We currently have a lab of 32
Macintosh computers (28 LC 550 w/12 mg Ram, 2 LC5400, 1 Workgroup Server
80, and 1 Quadra 660 AV).<BR>

Requested Items:<BR>

	<LI><B>Apple Ethernet Cards</B> (28)<BR>
	<LI><B>TCP/IP Software </B>(for each machine)<BR>
</UL>

A major goal of the students at Gilbert Junior High is to build a
community computer commons.  This facility would allow students at the
school to teach other members of the community about computer and the
Internet.  We want to expand learning beyond the classroom walls!  We
appreciate your consideration and thank you for any assistance you can
give.<BR>

Edward Hartigan School is located in Chicago, Illinois' Robert Taylor
Housing
Project.  I am one of four special education teachers.  Our students love
to
use computers, but there is a shortage.  We have only one Mac and one
Apple
lle to use betweeen the four rooms.  The students are making some progress
with the CD Roms, because of their multisensory ability.  If we had more
computers our students would make tremendous gains in reading and math.
We
would appreciate <B>15 Macintosh computers with CD Roms ( 8-16 megs of RAM)
and
monitors</B>.  <BR>
We are also in need of a used copying machine. In special
education there are lots of individual records to update and duplicate.
 Please help us soar into the 21st century.<BR>

Edgar Road School is located in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb just 
outside of St. Louis.  We are in need of <B>four Macintosh computers with 
CD Roms. </B> The Macs would be used in a "Multimedia Exploratorium 
Enrichment Room, where students will collaborate on curriculum related 
multimedia presentations.  Students will incorporate video camera 
footage, scanned images, Quick Take pictures, and recorded sounds to 
create media projects to enhance the curriculum.  The Exploratorium 
will be used by grades K-5, as they explore and discover that 
technology isn't just computers.  <Br>

 Our school would love to receive at least one <B>Mac with a CD Rom</B> or any 
of the above mentioned equipment.  We're ready to become multimedia 
explorers and boldly go where no school has gone before!  Any help 
that would assist in our journey is very much appreciated!<Br>

I am the librarian of an elementary school in Woodbridge VA.  Currently
we are using the Accelerated Reader program as a reading incentive.  The
students read books from selected lists and then take comprehension
tests on the computer.  Currently we have stand alone Macs which are
used for the testing.  We have one to two Macs per grade level , but we
have at least 5 sections per grade level.  The students in classrooms
with a Mac are making exciting progress with the reading program.  Other
classes who must go to other locations to take tests, are not doing so
well.<BR>
        We would love to have any working <b>Macs (LCII to the latest Macs with CD
ROM) </b> to use in the classrooms without direct access to the Accelerated
Reader program.<BR>

 This equipment and software will be installed in a Technology Education
laboratory which serves middle school, high school, and university teacher
education students.  We envision this laboratory as the beginning of  a
RsmartS
classroom which uses a computerized information management system for
individualized student educational planning and assessment, workgroup
software which facilitates student collaboration and knowledge building,
the
availability of a variety of multimedia resources and computerized tools,
and a
variety of modular workstations which facilitate hands-on experimentation
and
design activities alongside computerized media and tools.<BR>

This laboratory will become a primary resource for the development,
teaching
and demonstration of integrated mathematics, science and technology
concepts
and processes.  Mathematics, science and technology education teachers
will be
involved in the development and use of this laboratory.  In addition, the
laboratory will be used to teach summer workshops for teachers and serve
as a
resource for community groups and organizations.<BR>
        
Price Laboratory School recently acquired a network server (IBM with
Netware
3.1 installed) and has access to the Internet.  It is our intent to
network the
20 MacIICX computers for activities within the laboratory as well as to
share
software with other areas of the building as appropriate.<BR>

Price Laboratory School is a department of the College of Education at the
University of Northern Iowa.  The laboratory school provides direct
teaching
experiences for move than 1000 teacher education students each year.
Faculty
also provide professional development services for teachers throughout the
state of Iowa and beyond.   The laboratory school has an NK-12 enrollment
of
approximately 550 students and a professional staff of over 100.<BR>

    Pepperell Middle School in rural NW Georgia is in need of Macintosh 
computers for classroom use. Macintosh SE's and up could be used by our 
students and teachers for word processing and research. <b>Any Macs that 
are 68030 or above </b> could also be used in the library for research.<br>
        We have scrounged a lab full of Apple IIe's from the auction block, but 
could use some <b> color monitors </b>to replace the original monochrome 
monitors. We also could use  Apple IIgs's  since we can put them on our 
Mac network.<br>
        We have used local money (ice cream sales at lunch, etc.) to purchase 
used Mac+'s and SE's for teacher use (to dampen the technology 
integration shock by using old (relatively) inexpensive computers) and 
have also bought/scrounged materials to install a LocalTalk network with 
used PhoneNet connectors and used Farallon StarControllers. The county 
used state technology money to install an EtherNet network, but only the 
computer lab and 4 computers in the library can feasibly be attached 
without a major investment in ethernet cards.<br>
        Our local school administrators have been very supportive of efforts to 
find inexpensive equipment to augment what technology we have.<br>
        We can find a use for nearly any Mac and could even arrange for pickup 
within the state of Georgia and areas out-of-state near NW GA.<br>
        This is a list of equipment we could "plug'n'play" the minute we 
receive it:

I teach children with autism at M. C. Lively Elementary in Irving, Texas.  Children with autism have serious communication disabilities.  Through computers and assistive technology these children are often given the voices that they have been denied.  As you know, computers are a thriving component of education today.  A classroom without a computer is often obsolete.  As a teacher, I can personally see the effect that computers have on the students academic, communicative and social growth.  In matching students with autism with typical peers, both students have the opportunity to learn and grow with each other.  An individual with autism once stated that computers were "fun because you know what they're going to do."  Most of my students can operate a computer with little or no instruction.  This skill affords them the opportunity to be a part of or stand above mainstream society for the time they are sitting at the keyboard.  Not only do computers give these students a voice, it gives them self confidence, independence and freedom.
<br>
My request for you is to consider placement of old demo units such as <b>  MAC's </b> or PC's , <b> preferably with CD-Rom's. </b>  that are out of date or used into the classrooms of these children.  This would give your company an opportunity to participate in the education of children within your community.  It would also be a noble gesture on the part of your company into the enhancement of individuals with disabilities.  I appreciate your time and thoughts put into this project.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me.

I am a parent of children in the Philadelphia school district.  I am actively invloved in the school.  I have been trying to obtain computers for our school.  I did manage to get a PC with CGA monitor and set it up in a first grade class room.  I have been able to spend time with the children working on the computer with them.  Through word of mouth and trash picking (literally) I also have a 286... but no monitor, and a Sperry Unisys that could be upgraded to have a better monitor.  I don't know where to turn.  My knowledge is only of IBM compatibles ... the school has Mac's.  
<br>
I would like to learn more about <b> Mac's and hardware.</b>..if any resources are available I could learn to upgrade these machiness myself.  I'm sure that you realize that children in the earlier grades (especially) could utilize `out of date' computers.  It doesn't require a state of the art machine to run letter matching and basic counting programs.
<br>
Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I'm sure the principal would be very helpful.

I am desperately trying to get my kids into the 20th (much less the 21st) century in a meaningful way. I teach at an urban school and will have a fourth grade class next year. These children will stay with me for fifth grade as well so this is an opportunity to really get into serious computing. 
<br>
My ultimate goal is to get a phone line to my room, set up a BBS run by the kids and make the world wide web our classroom. Easier said than done. Building is 100 years old and we are on the third floor. It took four years just to get a phone line to the third floor in the hall. There is one direct line to a university on the fourth floor, but that is inaccessible to me (administration doesn't see the importance) on a regular basis. I want something the kids can use every day.
<br>
What I am searching for is a<b> server and a way to set up at least six terminals</b> to it withing my classroom.  Word processing is nice, but I am in the opinion that the real value of computers ( at least the ones we can get ) are in their use to connect to the outside world.
<br>
<b> Macs </b> or IBMs, it wouldn't matter to me and a mix would be even better.<b> CD-roms and 8 meg of ram, some harddrives of decent proportions. And modems. </b> 
<br>
I would be glad to document this project for anyone willing to help me and I want to be able to establish a web-page for our students. The university will allow me to place a page on their system for the meantime.

I'll take <b> anything Mac </b> and find it a happy home.  I am with our
Education Foundation and expanding technology in the classroom 
across the district is one of our goals.  (The Detwieler Foundation in 
La Jolla collects computers from large companies, more than 200
employees and donates them to schools.  To receive these, schools
must ask for and receive donations from individuals and small
businesses. ) Most of our elementary
teachers prefer the Mac platform.  Right now I would like three
computers to complete a 21st century classroom that could be a 
model.  The teacher is a wonderful young man, very techno-literate
we gave him a silver screen last year.  He currently has 32 students
and five computers.  He does table groupings of four and would like
each table to have a computer.  I also need a <b> color printer </b> that
will print transparencies.  Another school would like to print 
maps from the CD Rom drive in the library, have copies for the
students and one for the overhead.  Will stop there, but if anyone
in Santa Monica or the Westside is reading and has a Mac they want
to give for a tax deduction, have them contact me.

...... Looking for <b> old (or new) Macintosh computers </b>.......
Hi, I am the Supervisor of Schools and therefore responsible for the
technology needs for the Dogrib Divisional Board of Education in the Northwest
Territories, Canada (near the north pole...). Our Board is a very small
aboriginal (Dene Indian) board. We have just over 800 students in 6 schools in
5 separate communities, 3 accessible only by air. Over 90% of the students are
Dogrib (aboriginal). Roughly this same percentage of students come from
families that are eligible for welfare assistance and are eligible for free
lunches. Most of the students fit the at-risk status. There is no tax base in
these communities so funding is limited to government contributions.
<br>
We have been moving towards implementing and integrating computer technology
for the past couple of years, but we have several holes.  We use Macintosh
computers and have managed to network these computers in two schools and make
a connection to Internet however our computer numbers are very low, meaning
that our children remain technology and information poor.
<br>
We are desperately in need of more Macintosh computers that we can connect to
our network and Internet. Any <b> MacPlusses or better </b> that could be donated or
sold to us cheap would be placed and used effectively. Anything we could do in
return for anyone or any organization considering donating, we would be
pleased to consider. Please do not hesitate to contact me.

I am the computer representative for Elizabeth Mackenzie Elementary School in Rae-Edzo, NorthWest Territories. Our school services the native Dogrib community of Rae. We have been moving towards computer technology for the past couple of years, but we have several holes. We use both Mac and Apple II  computers. Although, the <b> Apple II's </b> have been mainly used for keyboarding and wordprocessing more would help to spread the program to the younger grades. We are presently considering setting up a lab for our school. Any <b>Classics or up </b> that you could free up would be placed in such a lab. If <b> higher quality computers are donated, such as 475's or higher </b>, these could be used to improve the cd rom technology in the primary end of our school. Recently, interactive reading programs for grades K to 3 have become available presenting our school with the problem meeting the need to put such technology into the classroom. In addition, there is a shortage of <b> cd rom readers </b>.

We need something in the line of a <b> Mac 7100, 6100, with AV capabilities, and a palette </b> would be nice. We have some equipment, but I would like something that is more dedicated to classroom material (ie multimedia presentations, in-class demos, interactive lab demos etc). I teach physics, with not enough time to do the things I would like to do. Therefore, if I have this equipment, the students will be able to do more with the lab end of the course than we are now able to do.

"Passing It On," a mentoring program at the Martin Luther King, Jr.
Elementary School in Hartford, CT, is in need of Macs, Apples, and
PC-Compatibles.  The computers will be used by elementary students to enhance
their skills in reading and math.  <br>

        Pepperell Middle School in rural NW Georgia is in need of Macintosh 
computers for classroom use. Macintosh SE's and up could be used by our 
students and teachers for word processing and research. Any Macs that 
are 68030 or above  could also be used in the library for research.<br>
        We have scrounged a lab full of Apple IIe's from the auction block, but 
could use some <b> color monitors </b>to replace the original monochrome 
monitors. We also could use <b> Apple IIgs's </b> since we can put them on our 
Mac network.<br>
        We have used local money (ice cream sales at lunch, etc.) to purchase 
used Mac+'s and SE's for teacher use (to dampen the technology 
integration shock by using old (relatively) inexpensive computers) and 
have also bought/scrounged materials to install a LocalTalk network with 
used PhoneNet connectors and used Farallon StarControllers. The county 
used state technology money to install an EtherNet network, but only the 
computer lab and 4 computers in the library can feasibly be attached 
without a major investment in ethernet cards.<br>
        Our local school administrators have been very supportive of efforts to 
find inexpensive equipment to augment what technology we have.<br>
        We can find a use for nearly any Mac and could even arrange for pickup 
within the state of Georgia and areas out-of-state near NW GA.<br>
        This is a list of equipment we could "plug'n'play" the minute we 
receive it:
<ul> 
<li>any Mac computer 
<li>Apple IIgs
<li>Apple IIe (enhanced preferred)
<li>ImageWriter II printers
<li>LocalTalk cards for ImageWriter II printers
<li>ImageWriter LQ printers
<li>LocalTalk cards for ImageWriter LQ printers
<li>External hard drives (to upgrade Mac+'s)
<li>EtherNet cards (10bT) for Mac SE's, SE 30's, and Mac II's </b>
</ul>
Thanks for your consideration......... take the tax write-off! :-)
Remember the kids we educate today will be voting during your "golden 
years". You _do_ want us to help them be well-educated, thoughtful, 
productive citizens and voters, right???

We are a diverse -- both culturally and academically -- (public) middle
school in suburban Washington, DC in need of <b>Apple IIGS's</b>.  We've accumulated
a lot of software over the years but currently have Apple IIc's and IIe's
dating back to the early 80's which break down frequently and, one-by-one
prove irreparable.  Donations would allow us to spread the older machines
around among the classrooms, providing us with an all-GS lab to be used
primarily by every English class. <br>

I am the computer representative for Elizabeth Mackenzie Elementary School in Rae-Edzo, NorthWest Territories. Our school services the native Dogrib community of Rae. We have been moving towards computer technology for the past couple of years, but we have several holes. We use both Mac and Apple II  computers. Although, the <b> Apple II's </b> have been mainly used for keyboarding and wordprocessing more would help to spread the program to the younger grades. We are presently considering setting up a lab for our school. Any <b>Classics or up </b> that you could free up would be placed in such a lab. If <b> higher quality computers are donated, such as 475's or higher </b>, these could be used to improve the cd rom technology in the primary end of our school. Recently, interactive reading programs for grades K to 3 have become available presenting our school with the problem meeting the need to put such technology into the classroom. In addition, there is a shortage of <b> cd rom readers </b>.

I am a member of the Johnstown (PA) Christian Homeschoolers.  We would be
very happy for any working IBM-PC computers (<B>286, 386 or above</B>).  Also,
any <B>DOS- or Windows-compatible educational software</B> is greatly needed.
These items would be distributed to homeschooling families in our group
who would otherwise not be able to afford a computer for their children.
We are in a very economically depressed area; the computers would be a
great blessing for the children.  Please contact Susan Zallar at:

As a result of the growing use of technology, students at the Newark Boys
Chorus School are in particular need of the following:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>PROCESSORS   <B>486 IBM-Compatible(4-8MB RAM; 100MB hard drive; 66MHz speed)</B>
	<LI>MONITORS     SVGA color with graphics capabilities
	<LI>PRINTERS     Dot-matrix or Laser<BR>
</UL>

The Newark Boys Chorus School, located in urban Newark, New Jersey is the
home of Newark's Musical Ambassadors to the World. It is a non-profit
organization where many of the students are on scholarships. The ethnic
composition is 80% African-American and 20% Hispanic. The academic and
music program is rigorous, with our students testing almost two years
above grade level when leaving us in 8th grade. Seeing the need for a
computer-literate student body, parents were able to raise money for two
new computers and our Board of Trustees agreed to finance the wiring for
connecting all computers. But the budget only included the purchase of
four workstations during this school year. Although connected, the
majority of the student body will not benefit because it will take six
years to complete the purchase of workstations. If you are able to help
us in some way, I would appreciate hearing from you.<BR>

I work in an education cooperative west of Boston, Mass.  Fifteen
school districts belong to our collaborative.  My job is to coordinate
teacher training for all the disricts.  I need either Macintosh
machines (minimally SEs), preferably LCs, Performas (dare I say Power
Macs) and/or <B>Windows machines</B> for the training site.<BR>

Part of our collaaborative is that we run a few of our own schools for
special needs students and students  with social problems.  These
children typically cannot attend public schools.  We have multiplly
handicapped classroom and these children use computers with various
adaptive devices.<BR>

Our high school program for children with scial/emotional problems is
very interesting.  Many of the students are in fact quite bright, but
need to be in a small environment.  They need the technology because
very soon they are going out in the world to jobs (and in some cases
small colleges) where they will need technology skills.<BR>

Please e-mail me <a href="ross-mcb@meol.mass.edu">ross-mcb@meol.mass.edu</a> call me at (617) 237-3028 Gail

        Everyone at John Marshall Middle School will benefit from
additional computers.  We are a low socio-economic school located in
Wichita, Kansas, in which few students have access to computers outside of
school.  Our current technology is so old that broken parts are no longer
replaceable by the district.  These computers are so slow that some
students graduate before they can complete a project!<BR>
        We would appreciate any help in obtaining the following:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Macintosh or <B>DOS computers and compatible printers</B>.
	<LI>CD Roms and Modems
	<LI>Any and all software for the middle school level, especially related to
Math, Language Arts, Science, Graphing and Charting, Keyboarding/Typing,
Clip Art and any publishing programs.
</UL>
        If you are able to donate any of the above, please contact:<BR>

 My name is Lynn Monson, and I work at Carmel Academic Arts Charter School in
Arizona. We are a performing arts school (visual arts as well), that
also integrates arts into the academic curriculum. Also, we are a
new school going into our second year of operation.<BR>

Our needs are:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>computers - <B>IBM's  - Windows and/or Dos</B>
	<LI>modems for internet connections
	<LI>educational interactive software especially art related,
</UL>
but we need all areas<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>CD-ROM
	<LI>sound card
</UL>

Both students and teachers will use it but mostly students at this
point. We want our students to be literate in all forms including
technology, and wish to teach different disciplines creatively via
the computer. Students can explore a different world of visual
images via the computer, and we would like them to experience that.
We want our students to be able to understand the creative side of
technology and how they are and can be integrated. Lastly, we want
them to be able to create works of art using the technology of the
computer.<BR>

Olmsted Falls High School is a grade 9 to 12 southeast corner of Cuyahoga County in Northeast Ohio.  It is a remote
suburb of Cleveland.  There are 31 distinct school districts in the
area and the Olmsted Falls Schools have one of the lowest per pupil
expenditures in the the area (somewhere near the bottom).<BR>

    The Mathematics and Science Departments have teachers who are quite
interested in using technology to teach math and science topics to both
college and non-college bound students.  We have a deep committment to
use of technology and have spent all available funds to build and
maintain a computer room shared by both departments.  We currently have
15 IBM-compatible 386 machines in the lab that have 2 meg of RAM and
use Windows 3.0.  We are involved in the Ohio initiative called
SchoolNet and will see our building wired for access to the Internet
sometime during this 1996-97 school year.  We want to do the following:<BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> add more computers to the lab to accomodate more students

	<LI>add more RAM to current machines

	<LI>install appropriate hardware for hooking up to the Internet
</UL>

In a nutshell:<BR>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>    We need more<B> 386 and/or 486 machines</B> to accomodate increasing
       enrollment
	<LI>    We need modems to hook up to the Internet
	<LI>  We need "AA" and "AAA" batteries to power the TI-81, TI-82 and
	       TI-92 graphing calculators we use in math class.  We have
	        a classroom set of 25 of each model.  They are used practically
	      every period of every day and the batteries tend to go quickly.

</OL>

Our motto is "Excellence with Economy".  We have ranked consistently in
the Top 10 in achievement in our geographical region while spending
less than most other districts.  We need the equipment and it will
be well cared for and used often by our math and science students.<BR>

Our teaching staff is well qualified and many spend time in the summer
in acquiring more training to stay on top of new trends in teaching
with technology.<BR>

aloha,<BR>
my name is Larry Westfall and I work at an alternative school for
alienated children in Ewa, Hawaii.  The school, Hale O Ulu (House of
Growth), is part of a larger non-profit organization (Child &amp; Family
Service).  We work with students who have dropped out, been kicked or
forced out of public school.  The majority of our students fall into one
or more of the following categories: single-parent home, abused
(physically, mentally, sexually), abusers, gang members, drug users,
alcoholics, children of alcoholic parents, apathetic, low self-esteem,
behind one or two years in school...the list goes on.  We offer a safe
and supportive environment with a program that allows students to work at
thier own pace to catch up on their credits, hopefully return to their
"home school" and continue on with their lives - graduate, college,
marriage, and/or the military.<BR>
Currently we have three decent computers - one 486 and 2 386's (PC
compatible, windows driven) for a student body of 65.  The 486 is on-line
thanks to a donation from a local server.  The computers that we have are
all the result of donations.  I usually receive bits and pieces and try
to make them operational.  This has been somewhat successful but having a
limited budget and limited resources in Hawaii, this is difficult.  The
majority of offerings here of the 286 with monochrome monitor variety.
The giving is nice, but 286 really dont satisfy the needs.  We are in the
process of establishing a new family center (one-stop shopping mall for
social problems) and the school will be a part of that.  My dream is to
have a computer class with 25 computers linked in a network with the
majority having on-line access.  I know it is a bit far fetched...but I
do like to dream.<BR>
thanks for the opportunity to express my request.  Hale O Ulu does have a
home page that we would love for you to visit. The URL is

	Fourth Graders Who Need Your Help<BR>
        I am a fourth grade school teacher in a small parochial school in
southern Mississippi. I had two Commodore 64 computers in my classroom
last year.  I had the students learn geography with Carmen SanDiego and we did
some typing skills, word processing and publishing. Unfortunately, I began
having problems with one of the diskette drives so I am now down to one
computer. I would love to have a <B>386 (or 486)</B>, and eventually a CD-ROM to teach them how to use multimedia resources for information but I am not choosy. I believe that it is important for students of this age to learn to use the computer as a writing and research tool. During the fourth grade year the emphasis in social studies in U. S. geography and history. There are many excellent sources of information and learning about geography on CD-ROM and the WWW including mapping programs, and National Park system web sites. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.<BR>
        I recently received a donation of  a mid-size tower case, a  486DX2/66
motherboard,   4 MB RAM, an  I/O card (2 serial/1 parallel/1 game port),
and a 14" Viewsonic Monitor.<BR>
        To complete this system I will need:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <B>hard-drive</B>
	<LI> <B>floppy-drive</B>
	<LI> <B>keyboard</B>
	<LI> <B>video card</B>
	<LI>  <B>software (DOS, Windows, word processing)</B>

I am a computer teacher at Chester Middle School in Chester, South
Carolina. Our school district is slowly trying to fund new labs and equipment for
all of our schools from elementary on up to high school.  I am currently using
Apple IIe computers to teach 8th graders. These students are taught
keyboarding and word processing.  I would very much like to be able to
bring my students up-to-date with current technology by being able to teach them
on modern equipment.  I would eventually like to teach my students how to<BR>
use the Internet to better prepare them for high school and beyond.  I
would appreciate a donation of <B>15 to 25 IBM or compatible 486 computers</B> with
Windows, CD ROM drives would be helpful but not a must, and <B>2 dot matrix
printers</B>.  Thank you very much.<BR>

Brady School is ready to enter the 21st century.  We gave 350
kindergarden through fifth graders, 98% of which are hispanic
and low income.  Our school is located in a crime/gang ridden
area.  Computer expertise is THE only way out for our
students.<BR>
We have built our computer lab from the cast-offs of other
places.  We have some PC(ols 346). Some Apples IIc that we
salvaged from the garbage after another school district threw
them away.<BR>
Our ONLY chance to give our students a fighting chance is the

We are a small Montessori preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In our
preschool program, our children work with computers and various kinds of
educational software every day. They enjoy it a great deal. The children
who use our computers range in age from 3 to 8 years old. We want
desperately to upgrade our computers. Currently in our classroom we have
several Apple IIs and the equivalent.  We would love to replace them with
more modern <B>PCs, preferably 386 or higher, with CD ROM drives and modems</B>
for Internet capability. Our children will be the citizens of the 21st
Century, and need exposure to more modern technology, so that they are
prepared for the future. If you can help us reach our goal, we will be
highly appreciative.<BR>

The name of the school is Peach Tree Montessori Preschool Workshop, and
our address is 319 N. Ashley, Ann Arbor, MI 48103. Our director, Harriet

Science Department of Brawley High School, a public school in the
southern California desert agricultural community of Brawley, needs
<B>ibm-compatible 386 or better</B> computers for science lab experiments.
Students hook sensing devices( temperature, pH, echolocation) to
computers, collect data, use computers to graph and analyze data, and use
word processing to produce professional looking lab reports. Ten to
fifteen machines would let us start one lab which our seven teachers
could rotate their classes through, serving about 1000 of our 1500
students each year.  Students are mostly hispanic, low income and/or

   I teach in a small (160-180 students) school that is in need of <B>ten to
twelve 486 IBM compatable computers with CD-ROM  and modem if available</B> in
order that our school be connected with the internet and each classroom
have access to it. In our area, we now can get access to the internet at a
very reasonable rate, but we lack the equipment. Many, many of our
children
do not have access to computers and they need the hands-on experience with
them. If CD-ROM and modems are too much to ask for, we would still love to
have the computers. If this is too much to ask, we could use laptop
computers that could be easily transported from room to room.  Our
students
must keep writing and math portfolios for state assessment and computer
generated work would give them the experience they need with computers and
make their work look great too.<BR>

The Mohawk Trail Regional School District is attempting to change the way
we educate children.  Our goal is to prepare them for the 21st century
through the inclusion of technology in virtually all curriculum areas.  During
the next 5 years we intend to fully network all schools, and put reasonable
computers in each classroom.  If we are to be truly successful in this,
we need to put a small lab in several schools coming on late in the schedule
in order to get the students and teachers going.  I would like the
following equipment for each of the 2 schools:  Hawlemont Regional Elementary and
Buckland Shelburne Elementary:<BR>

I teach children with autism at M. C. Lively Elementary in Irving, Texas.  Children with autism have serious communication disabilities.  Through computers and assistive technology these children are often given the voices that they have been denied.  As you know, computers are a thriving component of education today.  A classroom without a computer is often obsolete.  As a teacher, I can personally see the effect that computers have on the students academic, communicative and social growth.  In matching students with autism with typical peers, both students have the opportunity to learn and grow with each other.  An individual with autism once stated that computers were "fun because you know what they're going to do."  Most of my students can operate a computer with little or no instruction.  This skill affords them the opportunity to be a part of or stand above mainstream society for the time they are sitting at the keyboard.  Not only do computers give these students a voice, it gives them self confidence, independence and freedom.
<br>
My request for you is to consider placement of old demo units such as  MAC's or <b>  PC's , preferably with CD-Rom's. </b>  that are out of date or used into the classrooms of these children.  This would give your company an opportunity to participate in the education of children within your community.  It would also be a noble gesture on the part of your company into the enhancement of individuals with disabilities.  I appreciate your time and thoughts put into this project.  If you have any questions, feel free to call me.

I am a parent of children in the Philadelphia school district.  I am actively invloved in the school.  I have been trying to obtain computers for our school.  I did manage to get a PC with CGA monitor and set it up in a first grade class room.  I have been able to spend time with the children working on the computer with them.  Through word of mouth and trash picking (literally) I also have a 286...<b> but no monitor, and a Sperry Unisys that could be upgraded to have a better monitor </b>.  I don't know where to turn.  My knowledge is only of IBM compatibles ... the school has Mac's.  
<br>
I would like to learn more about  Mac's and hardware...if any resources are available I could learn to upgrade these machiness myself.  I'm sure that you realize that children in the earlier grades (especially) could utilize `out of date' computers.  It doesn't require a state of the art machine to run letter matching and basic counting programs.
<br>
Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I'm sure the principal would be very helpful.

I am desperately trying to get my kids into the 20th (much less the 21st) century in a meaningful way. I teach at an urban school and will have a fourth grade class next year. These children will stay with me for fifth grade as well so this is an opportunity to really get into serious computing. 
<br>
My ultimate goal is to get a phone line to my room, set up a BBS run by the kids and make the world wide web our classroom. Easier said than done. Building is 100 years old and we are on the third floor. It took four years just to get a phone line to the third floor in the hall. There is one direct line to a university on the fourth floor, but that is inaccessible to me (administration doesn't see the importance) on a regular basis. I want something the kids can use every day.
<br>
What I am searching for is a<b> server and a way to set up at least six terminals</b> to it withing my classroom.  Word processing is nice, but I am in the opinion that the real value of computers ( at least the ones we can get ) are in their use to connect to the outside world.
<br>
 Macs  or<b> IBMs </b>, it wouldn't matter to me and a mix would be even better.<b> CD-roms and 8 meg of ram, some harddrives of decent proportions. And modems. </b> 
<br>
I would be glad to document this project for anyone willing to help me and I want to be able to establish a web-page for our students. The university will allow me to place a page on their system for the meantime.

I started a company this last year called Teaching Through Technology or T" for short. It is a non profit organization. What I do is get computers from companies, refurbish them and then put them into schools and give the recipient a basic lesson on how to use that particular computer and any associated software that was donated. 
<br>
I find that many of the computers which are donated by individuals or companies have been slightly disassembled or in some manner are non functional and they don't want to expend the resources to get it working again. I do not charge anything, make any money or even earn a salary. I do this purely as a charitable contribution of my time. There is no catch and this isn't a marketing scheme! Just a concerned parent. 
<br>
Currently I support six Poway Unified Schools and am working with them on identifying their technology needs and helping them to achieve them. Unfortunately, donations are slow and so is $ to buy the extra parts to get the computers running. I have five 386 computers ready to be refurbished (in my garage) and I need <b> 4 meg RAM, svga graphics cards, I/O cards for AT architecture (mfm type as well as IDE), mice, and sound cards (8 bit would be fine) </b> . Although these computers are currently targeted for some schools, I would be happy to donate my time for other schools that need them.
<br>
There is a group of us (4 ladies) who get together on fridays and configure computers for donation whenever we have the equipment. (some change from quilting, huh?) If you have equipment to donate:

I am the computer representative for Elizabeth Mackenzie Elementary School in Rae-Edzo, NorthWest Territories. Our school services the native Dogrib community of Rae. We have been moving towards computer technology for the past couple of years, but we have several holes. We use both Mac and Apple II  computers. Although, the <b> Apple II's </b> have been mainly used for keyboarding and wordprocessing more would help to spread the program to the younger grades. We are presently considering setting up a lab for our school. Any <b>Classics or up </b> that you could free up would be placed in such a lab. If <b> higher quality computers are donated, such as 475's or higher </b>, these could be used to improve the cd rom technology in the primary end of our school. Recently, interactive reading programs for grades K to 3 have become available presenting our school with the problem meeting the need to put such technology into the classroom. In addition, there is a shortage of <b> cd rom readers </b>.

As a result of the growing use of technology, students at the Newark Boys
Chorus School are in particular need of the following:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>PROCESSORS  486 IBM-Compatible(4-8MB RAM; 100MB hard drive; 66MHz speed)
	<LI><B>MONITORS     SVGA color with graphics capabilities</B>
	<LI><B>PRINTERS     Dot-matrix or Laser</B>
</UL>

The Newark Boys Chorus School, located in urban Newark, New Jersey is the
home of Newark's Musical Ambassadors to the World. It is a non-profit
organization where many of the students are on scholarships. The ethnic
composition is 80% African-American and 20% Hispanic. The academic and
music program is rigorous, with our students testing almost two years
above grade level when leaving us in 8th grade. Seeing the need for a
computer-literate student body, parents were able to raise money for two
new computers and our Board of Trustees agreed to finance the wiring for
connecting all computers. But the budget only included the purchase of
four workstations during this school year. Although connected, the
majority of the student body will not benefit because it will take six
years to complete the purchase of workstations. If you are able to help
us in some way, I would appreciate hearing from you.<BR>

        Everyone at John Marshall Middle School will benefit from
additional computers.  We are a low socio-economic school located in
Wichita, Kansas, in which few students have access to computers outside of
school.  Our current technology is so old that broken parts are no longer
replaceable by the district.  These computers are so slow that some
students graduate before they can complete a project!<BR>
        We would appreciate any help in obtaining the following:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Macintosh or <B>DOS computers and compatible printers</B>.
	<LI><B>CD Roms and Modems</B>
	<LI>Any and all <B>software</B> for the middle school level, especially related to
Math, Language Arts, Science, Graphing and Charting, Keyboarding/Typing,
Clip Art and any publishing programs.

 My name is Lynn Monson, and I work at Carmel Academic Arts Charter School in
Arizona. We are a performing arts school (visual arts as well), that
also integrates arts into the academic curriculum. Also, we are a
new school going into our second year of operation.<BR>

Our needs are:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>computers - <B>IBM's  - Windows and/or Dos</B>
	<LI>modems for internet connections
	<LI>educational interactive software especially art related,
</UL>
but we need all areas<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>CD-ROM
	<LI>sound card
</UL>

Both students and teachers will use it but mostly students at this
point. We want our students to be literate in all forms including
technology, and wish to teach different disciplines creatively via
the computer. Students can explore a different world of visual
images via the computer, and we would like them to experience that.
We want our students to be able to understand the creative side of
technology and how they are and can be integrated. Lastly, we want
them to be able to create works of art using the technology of the
computer.<BR>
Thank you<BR>

Olmsted Falls High School is a grade 9 to 12 southeast corner of Cuyahoga County in Northeast Ohio.  It is a remote
suburb of Cleveland.  There are 31 distinct school districts in the
area and the Olmsted Falls Schools have one of the lowest per pupil
expenditures in the the area (somewhere near the bottom).<BR>

    The Mathematics and Science Departments have teachers who are quite
interested in using technology to teach math and science topics to both
college and non-college bound students.  We have a deep committment to
use of technology and have spent all available funds to build and
maintain a computer room shared by both departments.  We currently have
15 IBM-compatible 386 machines in the lab that have 2 meg of RAM and
use Windows 3.0.  We are involved in the Ohio initiative called
SchoolNet and will see our building wired for access to the Internet
sometime during this 1996-97 school year.  We want to do the following:<BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> add more computers to the lab to accomodate more students

	<LI>add more RAM to current machines

	<LI>install appropriate hardware for hooking up to the Internet
</UL>

In a nutshell:<BR>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>    We need more 386 and/or 486 machines to accomodate increasing
       enrollment
	<LI>    We need <B>modems</B> to hook up to the Internet
	<LI>  We need <B>"AA"</B> and <B>"AAA" batteries</B> to power the TI-81, TI-82 and
	       TI-92 graphing calculators we use in math class.  We have
	        a classroom set of 25 of each model.  They are used practically
	      every period of every day and the batteries tend to go quickly.

</OL>

Our motto is "Excellence with Economy".  We have ranked consistently in
the Top 10 in achievement in our geographical region while spending
less than most other districts.  We need the equipment and it will
be well cared for and used often by our math and science students.<BR>

Our teaching staff is well qualified and many spend time in the summer
in acquiring more training to stay on top of new trends in teaching
with technology.<BR>

    If you can help, contact<BR>

Charlestown High School serves 1300 students from the City of Boston.
The overwhelming majority of students fall below current poverty
guidelines and to most English is a language that is only used in a
school setting. We recognize that the traditional methods of teaching
are innapropiate for this population. The broad range of skills and
experiences require individualized strategies. Charlestown High School
believes that technology may provide the direction that will allow us to
provide for our students. We plan to bring the Internet into every
classroom. We have identified a means to wire every room but we need
hardware to provide entry. The donation of computers that could serve as
Internet stations,modems <B>14.4 or higher and printers</B> that could provide
text support would be greatly appreciated. In addition we are seeking a
<B>server</B> that can support 50 stations and an NT cross platform
configuration or at least some advise about networking our equipment.
Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.<BR>

My school is located in an extremely low economic region of rural
Tennessee.  (Grundy County)  We have many wonderful natural resources,
including bright children.  We are working hard to provide them with
skills to help them better the lives of their families.  We currently
have some Macintosh computers, some Apple II's and a couple of IBM
compatible computers.  We serve approximately 650 students in grades
K-8.  We want our children to be able to compete favorably in the job
markets and we know that a knowledge of computers is essential.  We
would appreciate any assistance available, from CD rom drives, to
computer systems.  We would especially like to be able to network all
the computers we do have to a central location (a server).  HELP!
Our 50 teachers have all become computer literate over the last 4
years, and would definitely put additional computers to use with our
children.  We are searching for <B>Macintosh computers, CD rom drives,
printers, scanners, modems, etc</B>.  We would be willing to recognize a
donor of such equipment as our "Partner in Education" and invite you
to visit and see the many good things we're doing for the children in
our community.<BR>

	Fourth Graders Who Need Your Help<BR>
        I am a fourth grade school teacher in a small parochial school in
southern Mississippi. I had two Commodore 64 computers in my classroom
last year.  I had the students learn geography with Carmen SanDiego and we did
some typing skills, word processing and publishing. Unfortunately, I began
having problems with one of the diskette drives so I am now down to one
computer. I would love to have a 386 (or 486), and eventually a CD-ROM to teach them how to use multimedia resources for information but I am not choosy. I believe that it is important for students of this age to learn to use the computer as a writing and research tool. During the fourth grade year the emphasis in social studies in U. S. geography and history. There are many excellent sources of information and learning about geography on CD-ROM and the WWW including mapping programs, and National Park system web sites. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.<BR>
        I recently received a donation of  a mid-size tower case, a  486DX2/66
motherboard,   4 MB RAM, an  I/O card (2 serial/1 parallel/1 game port),
and a 14" Viewsonic Monitor.<BR>
        To complete this system I will need:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI> <B>hard-drive</B>
	<LI> <B>floppy-drive</B>
	<LI> <B>keyboard</B>
	<LI> <B>video card</B>
	<LI>  <B>software (DOS, Windows, word processing)</B>
	<LI>(extra: <B>modem, CD-ROM</B>)
</UL>
 
        I would also like to have a second 386 or greater system so I can have
two groups working at a time.  Thank you, <BR>

I am a computer teacher at Chester Middle School in Chester, South
Carolina. Our school district is slowly trying to fund new labs and equipment for
all of our schools from elementary on up to high school.  I am currently using
Apple IIe computers to teach 8th graders. These students are taught
keyboarding and word processing.  I would very much like to be able to
bring my students up-to-date with current technology by being able to teach them
on modern equipment.  I would eventually like to teach my students how to<BR>
use the Internet to better prepare them for high school and beyond.  I
would appreciate a donation of 15 to 25 IBM or compatible 486 computers with

the computer applications lab with an Ethernet network for Internet use.
 Students, parents, and other community members will benefit from the
Internet connectivity.<BR>

Our school district has created the backbone (fiber), purchased a T1
line, and done everything except make the lab Ethernet.  Inadequate
funding resulted in a freeze of this project (major budget problems do
to record growth in the district).  We currently have a lab of 32
Macintosh computers (28 LC 550 w/12 mg Ram, 2 LC5400, 1 Workgroup Server
80, and 1 Quadra 660 AV).<BR>

Requested Items:<BR>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI><B>Ethernet Hubs (2)</B><BR>
	<LI><B>Apple Ethernet Cards</B> (28)<BR>
	<LI><B>TCP/IP Software </B>(for each machine)<BR>
</UL>

A major goal of the students at Gilbert Junior High is to build a
community computer commons.  This facility would allow students at the
school to teach other members of the community about computer and the
Internet.  We want to expand learning beyond the classroom walls!  We
appreciate your consideration and thank you for any assistance you can
give.<BR>

lle to use betweeen the four rooms.  The students are making some progress
with the CD Roms, because of their multisensory ability.  If we had more
computers our students would make tremendous gains in reading and math.
We
would appreciate 15 Macintosh computers with CD Roms ( 8-16 megs of RAM)
and
monitors.  <BR>
We are also in need of a <B>used copying machine</B>. In special
education there are lots of individual records to update and duplicate.

<p> The following article was written by Thomas Kearns in response to reader questions about donations to the <a href = "/kidsource/pages/Donation.html">Computing EDGE </a> program.  Please consult your personal accountant or tax preparer for questions relating to your particular tax situation. </p>

<hr> 
<br>                           

     Taxpayers who itemize, using Form 1040, Schedule A, are allowed a tax deduction for charitable contributions made during the tax year. This applies to both cash and non cash contributions.  The contribution must be made to a recipient which is eligible to receive deductible contributions.  The recipient may be religious, charitable, educational, governmental or other philanthropic organizations. If you need to verify the eligibility of the organization, the Internal Revenue Service can provide you with Publication 78 which lists acceptable organizations. IRS Publication 526, Charitable Contributions, should also be referred to for additional information.
<br><br> 
     All contributions of $250 or more must be substantiated by written acknowledgment from the organization receiving the contribution.   The acknowledgment must state the amount of money or description of property and whether any consideration was qiven in exchange for the contribution.
<br><br> 
     If your non cash contribution is valued at $500 or more, you must complete and attach Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions.  For property with  a value of  $5,000  or more the donor will,  in most situations, have to obtain a qualified appraisal to substantiate the value of  the property.   Publicly traded stock  is  one of  the  few exceptions to the qualified appraisal.
<br><br> 
     Record keeping:   Taxpayers deducting contributions on their tax returns should also keep a receipt from the organization or a reliable written statement that shows the organization's name and address.  Your written records should include:<br>
<ol> 
  <li>  The method used to determine the property's value at the time you
      contributed the property.  Copies of comparable sales prices or other documentation should also be retained in your tax records.

  <li>  The cost or other basis of the property, if you must reduce the
      cost, by any ordinary income or capital gain that would have
      resulted if the property had been sold at its fair market value. 
  <li>  How you determined your deduction if you chose to reduce your
      deduction for gifts of capital gain property. 
  <li>  Any conditions attached to the gift. 
</ol>
     <B>Limitations:</B><br>
<ol>
    <li> No deduction is allowed for the value of benefits received from the
      qualified orqanization. 
  <li>  If the property contributed has a fair market value that is less
       than your basis in the property, your deduction is limited to fair
       market value.  You cannot claim a deduction for the difference
       between the property's basis and its fair market value.

  <li>  Property which has appreciated--Please contact your tax preparer.

  <li>  If your contributions are more than 20% of your adjusted gross
      income, the amount of your contribution may be limited to either
      20%, 30%, or 50% of your adjusted gross income, depending on the
      type of property you give and the type of organization you give
      the property to.

  <li>  If your contributions are more than the applicable limits, you
      can carry over your contributions that you are not able to deduct
      in the current year, to a future year.  You can deduct the excess
      contributions in each of the 5 succeeding years until the excess
      has been used up, but not beyond the 5 years.
</ol>

     <b>Example: </b>   Personal computer and related software with a purchase price of $3,000, valued at $500 at time of contribution, receives a $500 deduction on Schedule A.  A written receipt must be received and Form 8283 should be attached to your return.
<br><br>
    <b> Example: </b>  Business  computer  system,  original  purchase  price $100,000, current value $10,000, adjusted tax basis of $15,000, receives a deduction of $10,000. A written receipt must be received and Form 8283 should be attached to your return.  Since the value is over $5,000, an appraisal is required and should be made part of your tax records.
<br><br>

     The above is a brief summary of the rules surrounding contributions of property.  Please contact your tax advisor if you have any questions.

<H3>What is LDA</H3>

<p>On behalf of children with learning disabilities, in 1964, a group of concerned parents formed the Learning Disabilities Association. It is the only national organization devoted to defining and finding solutions for the broad spectrum of learning problems. LDA has 50 state affiliates with more than 775 local chapters. Membership totals are 60,000, including parents, professionals from many sectors, and concerned citizens.</p>

 <H3>What are LDA's goals?</H3>
<p>Learning disabilities occur in many forms - visual, auditory, motor control, communication, logic, etc. Effective correction must include a total approach to the educational, physiological, psychological and medical needs of the individual child. Therefore, LDA believes in an interdisciplinary approach with these major goals: <br>

<ul>
 <li><STRONG>Encourage</STRONG> research in neuro-pnysiological and   psychological aspects of learning disabilities
<li><STRONG>Stimulate</STRONG> development of early detection programs
<li><STRONG>Create</STRONG> a climate of public awareness and acceptance
<li><STRONG>Disseminate</STRONG> information widely
<li><STRONG>Provide</STRONG> advocacy information

<li><STRONG>Develop</STRONG> and <STRONG>promote</STRONG> legislative assistance

<li><STRONG>Improve</STRONG> regular and special education

<li><STRONG>Establish</STRONG> career opportunities
</ul>

<H3>What services does LDA offer?</H3>

<blockquote>

<H3>Information and Referral</H3>

An inquiry to the local chapter, or national LDA office may be a crucial first step in providing help to a person with learning disabilities.

Members receive annually six newsletters from the national LDA, along with local newsletters.
<br><br>

 <H3>School Program Development</H3>
LDA and its state affiliates are available to work directly with school systems in planning and implementing programs for early identification and diagnosis, as well as remediation in resource and special education classroom situations. Because of the relationship of learning disabilities to school drop-out and delinquency, the Adolescent and Young Adult Committee works with educators, correctional authorities and jurists in order to develop comprehensive approaches to education and employment.
<br><br>

 <H3>Legislation</H3>
The LDA Governmental Affairs Committee provides information and recommends action on pending legislation which may affect children with learning disabilities and/or their families. LDA was active in the passage of the 1969 Elementary Secondary Education Amendments, P.L. 93-103 (Education Act for the Handicapped) and P.L. 94-142 (Education Act for All Handicapped Children) - programs designed to provide free, appropriate education for those with handicaps and learning disabilities.

<h3>Facts About SIDS </h3>

<ul>
<li>It is the leading cause of death of infants between one week and one year of age.</p>

<li>It is an unpredictable medical disorder.</p>

<li>It is not contagious and it is not caused by immunizations or by child abuse.</p>

<li>Researchers are getting closer to answers, but currently there are no explanations for the cause or causes of the deaths of these apparently healthy babies.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Reducing the Risk </h3>

<p> Recent research suggests the risk of SIDS may be reduced by following a number of guidelines:</P>

<ul>
<li> Place healthy babies on their backs or sides to sleep, not on their tummies.</P>
<li> Babies should be placed to sleep only on a firm mattress or other firm surface.</P>
<li> Babies should be kept warm, but not too warm; the room should feel comfortable to you.</P>
<li> Never allow anyone to smoke around your baby.</P>
<li> Mothers should get early and regular care during pregnancy, and should consider breastfeeding.</P>
<li> Call your doctor or clinic right away if your baby seems sick, and make sure he/she is immunized on schedule.</P>

</ul>

<hr>


<h3>Mission </h3>

<p>The SIDS Foundation of Washington is dedicated to the informational and emotional support of bereaved families, to the education of the general public and professionals and to the ultimate elimination of this tragic medical phenomenon through research.</p>

<hr>

<H3>What is the CPSC</H3>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is an
independent federal regulatory agency that was created in 1972 by
Congress in the Consumer Product Safety Act.  In that law,
Congress directed the Commission to "protect the public against
unreasonable risks of injuries and deaths associated with
consumer products."</P>

<P>It has jurisdiction over about 15,000 types of consumer
products, from automatic-drip coffee makers to toys to lawn
mowers.  Some types of products, however, are covered by other
federal agencies.  For example, cars, trucks and motorcycles are
covered by the Department of Transportation; drugs and cosmetics
are covered by the Food and Drug Administration; alcohol, tobacco
and firearms are covered by the Department of the Treasury.</P>
<hr>
<H3>What the CPSC does</H3>

<P>CPSC works to reduce the risk of injuries and deaths from
consumer products by:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>developing voluntary standards with industry;

     	<LI>issuing and enforcing mandatory standards; banning
     	consumer products if no feasible standard would adequately
     	protect the public;

     	<LI>obtaining the recall of products or arranging for their
     	repair;

     	<LI>conducting research on potential product hazards; and

     	<LI>informing and educating consumers through the media, state
     	and local governments, private organizations, and by
     	responding to consumer inquiries.
</UL>
<hr>
<H3>How Can It Help You and Your Family</H3>

<P>If you've had a problem with a consumer product or you want
information, here's how to get in touch with the CPSC:</P>

<P>To report an unsafe consumer product or a product-related injury:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
     	<LI>call the CPSC toll-free Hotline at (800)638-2772; and
     	(800)638-8270 for the hearing impaired;

     	<LI>contact us via electronic mail on the Internet at
     	info@cpsc.gov

     	<LI>access the CPSC Internet gopher system at cpsc.gov;


     	<LI>write to request a free copy of a publication listing
     	at:

	<UL TYPE=DISC>

<h2>Great Tips for Choosing Math Software</h2>

<h3>For All Ages</h3>
<ul>
<li>	Look for software you can play with your child.  Your interest and involvement is as important as the lessons in the software.  Choose titles that you like, too; you'll be seeing and hearing a lot of them!
</ul>

<H3>For Preschoolers</H3>
<ul>
<li>Choose software that fosters discovery.  Programs that let kids play and discover at their own pace make the best introduction to math concepts.<p>

<li>	Make sure the program's graphics are clear, simple, engaging; too many on-screen antics (like animation and music) can be overwhelming for little kids.<p>

<li>	Try using an art program to make up simple math games to play with your child.  That personalized playtime will mean a lot to your child.
</ul>
<H3>For Kids in the Early Grades</H3>
<ul>
<li>Look for titles based on the newest standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. That way, your child's at-home computer activities will be in step with what's going on at school.  (You'll find one such title, <a href="/kidsource/software/anno2.html">Anno's Learning Games</a>, reviewed on this site.)<p> 

<li>	Find out how (and when) your child's school introduces math concepts and skills.  Try complementing the curriculum with programs that reinforce specific skills.  Or if your child is struggling with classroom methods, try titles that takes a different approach.<p> 

<li>	Let your child's learning style be your guide.  If your son hates quizzes or your daughter can't stand to be rushed, look for titles that encourage them to develop strategies for solving mathematical problems at their own pace.  
</ul>
<H3>For Older Students</H3>
<ul>
<li>	Be alert for <a href="/kidsource/software/mathfun.html">math activities within other software programs </a>.  Many history, science and geography titles make computational challenges part of their activities and adventures.
</ul>

<p>You'll find recommendations for the best kinds of math practice as well as highly creative math exploration products in <strong>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids (HarperCollins Perennial, $16).</strong>

<h2>The Best Math Exploration Titles</h2>

<p>These games and puzzles encourage kids to explore math concepts, hone their reasoning skills and develop strategies to solve problems.</p>

<H3> Millie's Math House
<img src="/images/guide-4stars-sm.gif"></h3> 	  
<ul><li>For Kids 4-6   	
<li>Category: Math Skills	  
<li>Publisher:  Edmark (800) 691-2985
<li>The best beginning math program we've seen!  Millie's seven activities provide whimsical opportunities to explore beginning math concepts like quantity, number recognition, counting, shapes, patterns, sizes, comparison and beginning addition and subtraction.
</ul>

<h3>James Discovers Math  <img src="/images/guide-2stars-sm.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 3-6  	
<li>Publisher:  <a href="http://www.broderbund.com">Broderbund </a> (800) 521-6263   
<li>A spunky collection of early math activities that range from simple number recognition all the way to beginning addition and subtraction.  Topics are similar to those in Millie's Math House with two excellent exceptions:  the Pencil Box activity offers an inventive introduction to estimating and measuring, and the telling-time activity is one of the clearest we've seen. 
</ul>

<h3>Where's Waldo? At the Circus  <img src="/images/guide-2stars-sm.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 4-9 	
<li>Publisher:  <a href="http://www.warneractive.com"> WarnerActive </a> (818) 840-2358   
<li>A playful combination of I-Spy activities and math challenges, featuring Waldo in his signature red-striped cap and shirt.  A good choice if you have a Waldo aficionado who could benefit from some time math.  Activities range from basic number and shape recognition to problems that explore division, weights and measurements and visual and auditory discrimination. 
</ul>

<h3>Money Town  <img src="/images/guide-2stars-sm.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 5-8  	
<li>Publisher: <a href="http://www.davd.com"> Davidson </a> (800) 545-7677   
<li>One of the few software programs designed to let kids play with money, and in the process get some practice in basic money math, including identifying and counting coins and making change.  Graphics of actual coins and bills are not as detailed and clear as we'd like.</ul> 

<h3>Snootz Math Trek  <img src="/images/guide-3stars-sm.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 5-9  	
<li>Publisher:  Theatrix Interactive (800) 955-TRIX   
<li>Imaginative and challenging activities  - featuring an odd but endearing pair of aliens known as Snootz - that encourage kids to discover problem-solving strategies and hone math thinking skills as they play.  Kids who have outgrown Millie's Math House will be especially charmed by Snootz Math Trek:  It's from the same development team and picks up at the skill level where Millie's leaves off.</ul>  

<h3>Math WorkShop  <img src="/images/guide-4stars-lg.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 5-12  	
<li>Publisher:  <a href="http://www.broderbund.com">Broderbund </a>  (800) 521-6263   
<li>A great new twist on classroom math that adds multimedia to the intriguing mathematical challenges recommended by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.  Puzzle-solving, estimation, logic and pattern-recognition activities are a visual delight, as well as tantalizing brain teasers.</ul>   

<h3>Countdown  <img src="/images/guide-2stars-sm.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 5-12  	
<li>Publisher:  <a href="http://www.voyagerco.com">Voyager </a> (800) 337-4989   
<li>Fast, spirited games that encourage kids to hone their skills in estimation,    logical reasoning and problem-solving.  The software makes brilliant use of video, presenting kids with vivid, funky photographs that change in response to the child's gameplay strategies</ul>  

<h3><a href="/kidsource/software/anno2.html">Anno's Learning Games </a> <img src="/images/guide-3stars-sm.gif"></h3>  
<ul><li>For Kids  6-10  	
<li>Publisher:  Putnam New Media (800) 788-6262  
<li>Inventive puzzles let kids explore mathmatical relationships with help from two mischievous elves.  Based on the fanciful illustrations of Mitsumasa Anno, this title has a quiet watercolor feel and gently amusing animations.  Good for kids who like math challenges.</ul>  

<h3>Adventures in Flight  <img src="/images/guide-2stars-lg.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 8-12  	
<li>Publisher:  <a href="http://www.sanctuary.com">Sanctuary Woods </a> (800) 872-3518   
<li>A program that convincingly shows how math does matter for real-life people who work at an airport. As kids explore a passenger cabin, cockpit, control tower, repair hangar and service area, they encounter realistic (and reasonably intriguing) scenarios that entail using math. Educationally sound but too low-key and static for many kids.</ul> 

<h3>Counting on Frank <img src="/images/guide-2stars-lg.gif"></h3>	  
<ul><li>For Kids 8-12 	
<li>Publisher:  <a href="http://www.ea.com/crwonders.html">Creative Wonders </a> (800) 543-9778  
<li>A good-looking program designed especially for practicing word problems.  On the plus side:  Bold, colorful graphics; a funky hero; a focus on complex reasoning and understanding how to apply basic computational skills; excellent explanations.  On the minus side:  the low-key adventure won't work for fast-action kids.</ul>

<br><br>Welcome to The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids - a new resource from HarperCollins Perennial ($16) to help you choose the best software for your kids ages 2 to 12.   The Guide uses the expertise of the world's only computer museum and the opinions of real kids and parents to select software that challenges kids to think and learn.  You'll find reviews and ratings for more than 200 software titles, plus lists of the "best" titles, by age and subject category, that let you quickly pinpoint programs that best match the ages and interests of your kids.
</center>  

<br><br><br>
<p>
Here at Kidsource, we share excerpts from The Computer Museum Guide, advice from the authors, special tips about choosing titles, new-product reviews, plus industry news about kids' software.  Check in regularly for updates!
</p>
<hr>

<H2>What's The Computer Museum?</H2>  

<p><a href= "http://www.tcm.org">The Computer Museum </a> in Boston is the country's only museum focused exclusively on computer technology.   It's introduced more kids and families to computers than any other place in the world.</p>  

<p>With record numbers of computers being purchased for home use - they're selling at the rate of two per second right now! - the Museum was seeing more and more families introduce their kids to computing.  Lots of families were looking for advice.  And parents told the Museum they wanted a software review as reliable as Consumer Reports and as lively and down-to-earth as Siskel and Ebert. 
</p>
<p>So in partnership with the Museum, authors Cathy Miranker and Alison Elliott put its decade of experience to work  to answer parents' questions.
</p>

<br>
<H2>Kids and Computers: What's the Museum's Vision?</H2> 

<p>Thanks to the Museum's years of creating and testing interactive learning exhibits, the Computer Museum Guide has a unique perspective - and exceptionally high expectations - about children's software.</p>  

<p>We believe the computer can be far more - and far better - than a quiz master, drilling kids on math facts or state capitals.</p>

<p>We favor software that uses technology to let kids learn by doing ... that encourages kids to create ... to experiment ... to make choices ... to solve problems (or better still, to create problems to solve!) ... that creates a compelling environment for exploration.  That stimulates kids' natural curiosity and satisfies their intrinsic need to learn.</p>

<p>Guided by expectations like these, the Museum created a book that serves as a road map to the best things a child can do with a computer.  We think you'll find that The Computer Museum Guide charts a quick route to the best titles for your child's age, interests and learning style.</p>

<br>
<h2> How Do We Evaluate Children's Software?</h2> 

<p>There were three stages to our evaluation process.</p>
<ul>
<li>	First we worked with Museum experts to develop an exacting set of standards.<br>

<li>	Next we personally tested close to 1,000 titles against those ideals.<br>

<li>	Then, programs that made it past this first level of scrutiny were turned over to the toughest critics of all, our test families.  These families used the software in their homes over several months.  And we spent lots of time talking with kids and parents, one on one, to understand what they liked and why.<br>
</ul>
<p>We'd like to give you a closer look at the questions we asked during every evaluation, so you can begin subjecting programs to the same kind of scrutiny.</p>

<p>Our criteria sound simple enough:   
<ul><li><a href="/kidsource/software/learning.html">Learning</a> 
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/learning.html#looks">Looks</a>
<li><a href="/kidsource/software/learning.html#longevity">Longevity </a>   
</ul>

But we read a lot into these words, as you'll see.</p>

<p>And finally, we asked the most important question of all:  does the software bring a truly <a href ="/kidsource/software/learning.html#new">new dimension </a> to learning?<p>

<p>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids uses a two-step process to evaluate software.  The first step:  the Guide's authors evaluate a program against the Museum's standards for learning, looks and longevity.  The second step:  families use the program at home and share their experience and opinions.  In the Guide's reviews, you'll find this family perspective reflected in a program's description and its star rating.  If there are no stars with a review, that means the product has not been thoroughly kid-tested.

<p><em>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids</em> is filled with useful lists that help parents quickly find the Museum's best programs by age or subject.  Since KidSource parents appreciate the efficiency of "recommendation" lists, we've included three of <em>the Guide's</em> unique "Best Lists."   We hope these inspire you with new ways to think about software for your kids.  You'll see these lists best with a browser that supports tables.  <!--If you browser doesn't, then view our alternate format <a href="/kidsource/software/bestalt.html"> our alternate format</a> --> </p>

<h2><a href="/kidsource/software/bestmathlist.html">The Best Math Exploration Titles</a></h2>

<ul><li>These games and puzzles encourage kids to explore math concepts, hone their reasoning skills and develop strategies to solve problems.</ul>

<H2><a href="/kidsource/software/bestmathdrill.html">The Best Math Drills</a></H2>

<ul><li>Kids practice math skills as they battle the bad guys in a fast-action style modeled on video arcade games (without the violence.)</ul>

<h2><a href="/kidsource/software/mathfun.html">More Math Fun</a> </h2>
<ul><li>You can find some intriguing math adventures in many "non-math" programs recommended in <EM>The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids</EM>.  Here are a few of our favorites.</ul>

<p> Visit our Kids and Computers Forum and talk with our experts, Cathy Miranker and Alison Elliott.   Chat about these topics and more:
<ul>
<li>Do you think gender is an issue in kids' software; what's your family's experience?
<li>What's missing in kids' software; what would you like to see?
<li>Parents' Grapevine:  Ask advice from other parents or share your family's experiences about the best software for different ages and subjects.
<li>When did you get your child started on the computer; what software worked best?
<li>How do you and your child use the computer to help with homework?
</ul>   


  

<h2> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<ul>
<li><h3>Won't the computer turn kids into antisocial loners?</h3>

<p>Don't worry!  Many of the best titles featured in The Computer Museum Guide invite cooperative problem-solving and shared adventures.  Try Travelrama USA (Sanctuary Woods) for an innovative geography game.  For non-readers, Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo (Humongous) is a great joint venture.  And remember to stay involved; that way, your home computer will never be an electronic baby-sitter. </p>

<li><h3>My kids seem to know more about computing than I do; any suggestions for getting up to speed?</h3>
<p>One thing you might consider is using your kids' software as a way to get comfortable.  Their programs are fun.  You can figure them out alone, after your kids are in bed.  Or you can let your kids teach you!  We know a school principal who gets "lessons" from fifth- and sixth-graders.  And we know one grandfather who got started with computers by playing Kid Pix.  Then check local libraries or museums; there are lots of computer classes for adult beginners that will make you feel good about catching up with your kids.</p>
 

<li><h3>How can I get my video-game playing kids to do something more educational on the computer?</h3>

<p>Happily there are plenty of titles that combine great gameplay with learning.  For older kids, simulation software is a fascinating way to experience the (virtual) realities of life as a pioneer or a city planner.  And the quests, mysteries and adventures in The Computer Museum Guide's Fun and Games section all require lots of brain power.</p>


<li><h3>Are there programs kids and parents can use together?</h3>
<p>Using the computer can be a great family activity, and The Computer Museum Guide offers a list of <a href="/kidsource/software/bestlistsarch.html">Best programs for kids and parents to play together</a>.   Some great "use-'em-together" titles:  Kid Pix Studio (Broderbund), any Carmen Sandiego title (also Broderbund), Davidson's Kid Works Deluxe (Davidson), Explorapedia (Microsoft), The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain (Sierra).</p> 

<li><h3>Is newer better?</h3>
<p>Not always. Some fine pieces of software - the Sim series, Oregon Trail, Kid Pix - have been around for years. Good kids' software is in many ways like a good children's book.  It has a special, enduring quality that stands the test of time.  Smart companies keep good titles up-to-date with new technology.</p>  

<li><h3>It seems like everyone is turning books into CD-ROMs these days; does the transformation always work?</h3>
<p>Be very choosy about storybook software. Some electronic books are so TV-like that kids become passive viewers, not involved readers.  But good interactive stories can be a powerful way to connect kids with reading.  And that's the kind of software you'll find in The Computer Museum Guide's Stories on Screen section. Always ask yourself: Is this electronic story turning my child into a reader of real books?</p>

(Holdaway, 1979)." This process facilitates the learning ofwords and of letter/sound patterns, as well as an understanding ofprint and how it is read in English.</p><p> "By discussing letter/sound relationships in the context ofauthentic reading selections." Teachers can facilitate such discussionwithin the shared reading experience, using big books or charts thatall the children can see. Alphabet books also invite the discussion ofletter/sound relationships.</p><p> "By engaging in a limited number of activities reinforcingletter/sound relationships, as an outgrowth of the shared readingexperience." For example, children might make charts of wordsexhibiting letter/sound patterns of particular interest to them. Aftertwo or more charts have been compiled, children could make relatedgraphs comparing appropriate data (Whitin et al, 1990).</p><p> "By learning to use letter/sound cues along with prior knowledge andcontext." For example, proficient readers seem unconsciously to useinitial letters plus prior knowledge and context to predict what aword might be, before focusing on more of the word or the followingcontext to confirm or correct. This strategy seems to come naturallyfor many children, but others may need instructional assistance infirst using the strategy consciously.</p><p> "By rereading favorite stories, songs, and poems, independently orwith a peer." This independent practice contributes greatly tosolidifying children's growing understanding of print. The rereadingis facilitated if children have individual copies of the text, and ifthey can listen to a tape recording of the text as they read. It'sespecially helpful if the tape recording is appropriately paced(Carbo, 1989).</p><p> "By observing and participating as the teacher demonstratesletter/sound relationships while writing." For example, the teachermay model his/her writing process, lead the children in guidedwriting, and/or write something from the children's dictation.</p><p> "By writing independently, constructing their own spellings as bestthey are able." Of course, primary grade children should be writing inwhatever way they can, whether it be scribble writing, random lettersand symbols, or letters that at least begin to be decipherable aswords. But when they can use letters to represent sounds, they beginto promote their own phonics development through writing (Temple etal, 1993).</p><p> "By developing their own strategies for learning letter/soundpatterns." The story of Jevon in "Jevon Doesn't Sit at the BackAnymore" (White, 1990) beautifully illustrates how children maydevelop their own strategies that teachers are not always aware of.During Jevon's second year in her kindergarten, White noticed thatJevon was learning letter/sound relationships by observing thespellings of his classmates' names, which were written on the messageboard and sign-up sheets, as well as on the papers they wrote. Whitereports that "Long before Jevon connected sounds and symbols ininventive spelling, names made their way into his writtencommunication" (1990, 18-19).</p><a name="ways"></a><H4>Ways Teachers Can Help Children Develop Phonics Knowledge</H4><ol><li> "First, have faith in children as learners." They can and usuallywill develop a grasp of letter/sound relationships with little directinstruction, just as they learned to talk without direct instructionin the rules of the English language. Also, don't assume that becausechildren cannot do worksheets on particular phonics elements that theycannot read words with those same patterns (e.g. the example fromWatson and Crowley, 1988, 263-265).</p><li> "Discuss interesting patterns of onsets and rhymes, in the contextof shared reading experiences." Among the stories, poems, rhymes, andsongs chosen to share with children should be some that emphasizealliteration and rhyme. One of the best ways to generate children'sinterest in the sound elements of a selection may be to ask simply"What do you notice about this poem?" or, more specifically, "What doyou notice about the sound in this poem?" (Mills et al, 1992). Thoughchildren may notice different sound elements than the teacheranticipated, this procedure gives children ownership over their ownlearning. Of course much of the poetry that rhymes is humorouspoetry--one thinks, for example, of Shel Silverstein's poetry or JackPrelutsky's, though humorous poetry should comprise only a modestproportion of the poetry to which children are introduced. One bookparticularly rich in poems with alliteration, rhyme, and onomatopoeiais "Noisy Poems," collected by Jill Bennett (Oxford University Press,1987). A cumulative book with wonderfully alliterative andonomatompoetic verbs is "Deep Down Underground," by Olivier Dunrea(Macmillan, 1989).</p><li> "As an outgrowth of the shared reading experience, engage childrenin, and/or allow for, a limited number of activities that reinforcetheir natural learning of letter/sound relationships and patterns."Mathematically-related ideas can involve the making of charts thatlist words with particular sound patterns, and graphs based upon thecharts (for example, you might chart all the "sl-" and "sp-" and "st-"words in several poems, then make a class graph showing the relativefrequency of the words in each list (see Whitin et al, 1990). Childrenmay especially enjoy collaborating in such activities--and in creatingtheir own alphabet books, too. In "Looking Closely: Exploring the Roleof Phonics in One Whole Language Classroom (Mills et al, 1992)," wesee various phonics-enhancing activities that can stem from andenhance enjoyment of literature, as well as activities involvingchildren's names.</p><li> "Emphasize the use of letter/sound cues along with prior knowledgeand context." Teachers can do this, such as: (1) by modeling how theythemselves use meaning (and grammar) along with initial letters topredict what a word might be; (2) by repeatedly encouraging childrento think "what would make sense here" before trying to sound out aword, (3) by engaging together in oral cloze activities based on theirshared readings ("What would fit in this sentence, 'I put c------ inthe soup?'") and (4) by discussing, in literature discussion groups,how various children dealt with problem words. It is critical to helpchildren develop and use letter/sound knowledge in the context ofconstructing meaning from texts.</p><li> "Foster the acquisition of phonics knowledge indirectly, throughvarious means--" </p><ul><li>by pointing to words during shared reading experiences with bigbooks, charts, etc. </p><li>by providing small, multiple copies of many selections, so thatchildren can easily reread favorite stories, songs, and poems </p><li>by providing tapes of many selections for children to listen to, asthey follow along with the written text </p><li>by attending to letter/sound patterns while modeling the writingprocess, engaging children in guided writing, and writing down whatchildren have dictated </p><li>by encouraging children to write as best they can, and by helpingthem to develop phonemic awareness and phonics knowledge throughinvented spelling (see Freppon &amp; Dahl, 1991) </p><li>by encouraging children to experiment with print and solidify theirunderstanding of letter/sound patterns in a variety of self-chosenways.</p></ul><li> "Be alert for children's idiosyncratic ways of developing phonicsknowledge, and support those." Jevon's learning of letter/soundrelationships through his classmates' names is but one example (White,1990).</p><li> "By providing additional materials and help for individualchildren, as appropriate." For instance, children who seem readily tograsp the concept of letter/sound relationships might especiallybenefit from Dr. Seuss books that reinforce letter/sound patterns--andother children would enjoy and benefit from such books too. Childrenwho are exceptionally slow in grasping letter/sound relationships maybenefit from tutorial assistance, such as that offered in Marie Clay'sReading Recovery Program.</p></ol><a name="References"></a><H3>References</H3> <P>Carbo, M.

What understandings from thisknowledge base can help ussupport young children as they developstrategies for dealing withcomplex interpersonal relationships among theirpeers?</P><P>Aggression and cooperation represent two critical featuresin thechild's social domain. What do they have in common? Both emergefromthe child's strong developmental push to initiate andmaintainrelationships with other children, beginning at a very early age.Peerrelationships provide critical opportunities for children to learntomanage conflict and work towards establishing intimacy. Aggressionandcooperation are two possible strategies for dealing with thenormalconflicts of early peer interactions. Both have important rootsinearly family interactions, both are responsive to adult expectationsandvalues, and both can be responsive to environmental factors.</P><ahref="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR><HR> <aname="Aggression"></a><H3>Aggression And Cooperation: Definitions AndEmerging Features </H3><P>"Aggression" is defined here as anyintentional behavior that resultsin physical or mental injury to anyperson or animal, or in damage toor destruction of property. Aggressiveactions can be accidentalactions, in which there is no intentionality;instrumental actions, inwhich the child deliberately employs aggression inpursuit of a goal;or hostile actions, in which the child acts to causeharm to anotherperson. Because peer interactions in their earliest formsemerge fromplay in which infants treat each other as they would treat atoy orinteresting object--for example, one baby reaches over and grabsthecheek of another--unintentional aggression is a common and naturalformof behavior for infants and toddlers. These accidental behaviorscan enableyoung children to achieve desired results (for example,grabbing a toy fromanother child) and, in a short period of time, caneasily develop intoinstrumental forms of aggression. Aggressivebehavior is a deterrent tofriendships and social success. Studiesindicate that young children citeaggressive behavior as a significantreason for disliking others. Researchalso indicates that aggressivebehavior is responsive to environmentalinfluences and can beencouraged or discouraged by experiences in home andschool.Aggression should not be confused with assertion--behaviorthroughwhich a child maintains and defends his or her own rights andconcerns. Assertive behavior reflects the child's developingcompetence andautonomous functioning and represents an important formof developmentalprogress. Assertiveness also affords the young childa healthy form ofself-defense against becoming the victim of theaggressions ofothers.</P><P>Much evidence suggests that children who exhibitinstrumental andhostile forms of aggression during the preschool yearshave beenexposed, in early family interactions, to adults who encourage,model,or condone aggression by using discipline techniques thatarepunitive, rigid, and authoritarian; ignoring or permittingaggressiveactions by the child and other children; providing ortoleratingaggressive toys or aggressive images from television, movies,andbooks in the child's surroundings; or modeling aggression in theirowninterpersonal interactions.</P><P>"Cooperation" is defined here asany activity that involves thewilling interdependence of two or morechildren. It should bedistinguished from compliance, which may representobedience to rulesor authority, rather than intentional cooperation. Whenchildrenwillingly collaborate in using materials, for example,theirinteractions are usually quite different than when they are toldto"share." Cooperation, like aggression, has its roots in very early,evenpreverbal, social interactions. Studies on the origins ofprosocialbehaviors, which include cooperation, suggest that familyvariables relatedto the development of prosocial behaviors includeparental disciplinetechniques that are authoritative rather thanauthoritarian and that offerthe child free expression of affectionand nurturance. These techniquesinvolve the use of high expectations;competent communication; andinductive reasoning, in which parentsengage children in explanations ofthe reasons for family rules andlimits. Children who demonstrate a numberof cooperative strategiesand can attend to the needs of others while alsoasserting anddefending their own rights are more likely to be sociallysuccessfuland to establish reciprocal, mutually satisfying friendshipsthan areother children.</P><HR> <aname="Techniques"></a><H3>Techniques For Reducing Aggression And FosteringCooperation </H3><P>Because aggressive behavior can emerge as a normalbehavior during thesecond and third years of life, it is important not toassume thatsuch behaviors represent a personality trait. When adultsassume thatchildren are being intentionally aggressive, the expectationforundesirable qualities can become established and can lead toa"recursive cycle" (Katz and McClellan, 1991) in which children cometofulfill the expectations set for them.</P><P>Aggressive toddlers orpreschoolers can benefit from support andencouragement for replacingaggressive behaviors with more sociallyproductive alternatives. Importanttechniques include helping youngchildren label and verbalize theirfeelings and those of others,develop problem-solving approaches toconflicts, seek and obtainassistance when in difficulty, and notice theconsequences of theiraggressive actions for their victims. Age-appropriateanger managementtechniques, and discussion of the causes and consequencesofinterpersonal conflicts, can help both young children andtheircaregivers deal with emerging aggressive behaviors. Adultguidancethat is consistent, supportive, nonpunitive, and includes thechild inunderstanding the reactions of all participants and the reasonsforlimits, will help even very young children cope withaggressivebehaviors.</P><P>How can parents and teachers recognize andfoster the cooperativebehaviors which all children demonstrate as theydevelop? They canacknowledge children's efforts to initiate socialinteractions inappropriate ways, affirm helping behaviors, use positivedisciplinetechniques and communicate their power, communicate positiveregardand high expectations for all young children, and support eachchild'sstruggle to resolve interpersonal conflicts. Of criticalimportanceare classroom strategies that promote cooperative, ratherthancompetitive, endeavors; foster dramatic play techniques andreflectivestrategies for thinking about and discussing socialinteractions; andenable children to get to know and trust each other andwork towardstruly interdependent activity.</P><HR> <aname="Policies"></a><H3>Program Policies That Foster The Development OfCooperation </H3><P>Many children begin to show interest in peers asearly as eighteenmonths. Early childhood educators can support theemergence oftrusting and positive interpersonal strategies by encouragingtheformation of play groups and regular social interactions thataresupervised in a supportive manner. Children benefit from consistentandsustained relationships in which they can build trust, understandandpredict the responses of their peers, and gain confidence in theirabilityto cope with conflictual interactions. Continuity ofrelationships can benurtured. The grouping of friends andacquaintances across the years ofprogram service enables children todevelop and build on successfulrelationships.</P><P>Early childhood programs can help parents understandand deal with thefull range of young children's emerging socialrepertoires. Parentsoften need help in addressing the common aggressivebehaviors of youngchildren in a nonjudgmental and constructive manner.Educators canencourage parents to provide regular opportunities forchildren todevelop productive and sustained friendships by providingcontinuityof access to potential friends, inviting friends or potentialfriendsto play at home, and helping children to continue to see goodfriendseven if they lose daily and convenient contact.</P><HR> <aname="Conclusion"></a><H3>Conclusion </H3><P>Our emerging knowledgeabout the complex factors that enter into thedevelopment of socialcompetence in the young child can be put tovaluable use. Young childrencan benefit from the understandingsupport and guidance of the adults whohelp them develop constructivestrategies for dealing with the challengesof early peerrelationships.</P><HR> <aname="References"></a><H3>References</H3><P>Buzzelli, C., and File, N."Building Trust in Friends."

<P>Most parents want their young children to have a healthy sense of
self-esteem. That desire can also be seen in education--schools around the
country include self-esteem among their goals. Many observers believe that
low self-esteem lies at the bottom of many of society's problems. </P>

<P>Even though self-esteem has been studied for more than 100 years,
specialists and educators continue to debate its precise nature and
development. Nevertheless, they generally agree that parents and other
adults who are important to children play a major role in laying a solid
foundation for a child's development. </P>
 <HR>
 <a name="Self"></a>
<H3>What Is Self-Esteem?</H3>


<P>When parents and teachers of young children talk about the need for good
self-esteem, they usually mean that children should have "good feelings"
about themselves. With young children, self-esteem refers to the extent to
which they expect to be accepted and valued by the adults and peers who
are important to them.
    </P>
<P>Children with a healthy sense of self-esteem feel that the important
adults in their lives accept them, care about them, and would go out of
their way to ensure that they are safe and well. They feel that those
adults would be upset if anything happened to them and would miss them if
they were separated. Children with low self-esteem, on the other hand,
feel that the important adults and peers in their lives do not accept
them, do not care about them very much, and would not go out of their way
to ensure their safety and well-being.  </P>

<P>During their early years, young children's self-esteem is based largely on
their perceptions of how the important adults in their lives judge them.
The extent to which children believe they have the characteristics valued
by the important adults and peers in their lives figures greatly in the
development of self-esteem. For example, in families and communities that
value athletic ability highly, children who excel in athletics are likely
to have a high level of self-esteem, whereas children who are less
athletic or who are criticized as being physically inept or clumsy are
likely to suffer from low self-esteem.
    </P>
<P>Families, communities, and ethnic and cultural groups vary in the criteria
on which self-esteem is based. For example, some groups may emphasize
physical appearance, and some may evaluate boys and girls differently.
Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination are also factors that may
contribute to low self-esteem among children. </P>

<HR>

    <a name="Develop"></a>
<H3>How Can We Help Children Develop a Healthy Sense of Self-Esteem? </H3>


<P>The foundations of self-esteem are laid early in life when infants develop
attachments with the adults who are responsible for them. When adults
readily respond to their cries and smiles, babies learn to feel loved and
valued. Children come to feel loved and accepted by being loved and
accepted by people they look up to. As young children learn to trust their
parents and others who care for them to satisfy their basic needs, they
gradually feel wanted, valued, and loved. </P>

<P>Self-esteem is also related to children's feelings of belonging to a group
and being able to adequately function in their group. When toddlers become
preschoolers, for example, they are expected to control their impulses and
adopt the rules of the family and community in which they are growing.
Successfully adjusting to these groups helps to strengthen feelings of
belonging to them. </P>

<P>One point to make is that young children are unlikely to have their
self-esteem strengthened from excessive praise or flattery. On the
contrary, it may raise some doubts in children; many children can see
through flattery and may even dismiss an adult who heaps on praise as a
poor source of support--one who is not very believable. </P>

<P>The following points may be helpful in strengthening and supporting a
healthy sense of self-esteem in your child: </P>


<P><b>As they grow, children become increasingly sensitive to the evaluations
of their peers</b>. You and your child's teachers can help your child learn to
build healthy relationships with his or her peers. </P>

<P><b>When children develop stronger ties with their peers in school or around
the neighborhood, they may begin to evaluate themselves differently from
the way they were taught at home</b>. You can help your child by being clear
about your own values and keeping the lines of communication open about
experiences outside the home.
    </P>

<P><b>Children do not acquire self-esteem at once nor do they always feel good
about themselves in every situation</b>. A child may feel self-confident and
accepted at home but not around the neighborhood or in a preschool class.
Furthermore, as children interact with their peers or learn to function in
school or some other place, they may feel accepted and liked one moment
and feel different the next. You can help in these instances by reassuring
your child that you support and accept him or her even while others do
not. </P>

<P><b>A child's sense of self-worth is more likely to deepen when adults
respond to the child's interests and efforts with appreciation rather than
just praise</b>. For example, if your child shows interest in something you
are doing, you might include the child in the activity. Or if the child
shows interest in an animal in the garden, you might help the child find
more information about it. In this way, you respond positively to your
child's interest by treating it seriously. Flattery and praise, on the
contrary, distract children from the topics they are interested in.
Children may develop a habit of showing interest in a topic just to
receive flattery. </P>

<P><b>Young children are more likely to benefit from tasks and activities that
offer a real challenge than from those that are merely frivolous or fun. </b>
For example, you can involve your child in chores around the house, such
as preparing meals or caring for pets, that stretch his or her abilities
and give your child a sense of accomplishment. </P>

<P><b>Self-esteem is most likely to be fostered when children are esteemed by
the adults who are important to them</b>. To esteem children means to treat
them respectfully, ask their views and opinions, take their views and
opinions seriously, and give them meaningful and realistic feedback. </P>


<P><b>You can help your child develop and maintain healthy self-esteem by
helping him or her cope with defeats, rather than emphasizing constant
successes and triumphs</b>. During times of disappointment or crisis, your
child's weakened self-esteem can be strengthened when you let the child
know that your love and support remain unchanged. When the crisis has
passed, you can help your child reflect on what went wrong. The next time
a crisis occurs, your child can use the knowledge gained from overcoming
past difficulties to help cope with a new crisis. A child's sense of
self-worth and self-confidence is not likely to deepen when adults deny
that life has its ups and downs.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>


<P>Parents can play an important role in strengthening children's self-esteem
by treating them respectfully, taking their views and opinions seriously,
and expressing appreciation to them. Above all, parents must keep in mind
that self-esteem is an important part of every child's development.

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends
that parents keep a close watch when a child is in an infant
carrier seat because the seat can fall or turn over and the child
can be injured or killed. CPSC has reports of over 20 deaths
since 1986 associated with infant carrier seats. The deaths
happened when infants became entangled in restraining straps,
when carrier seats toppled over on soft surfaces such as beds, or
when unrestrained children fell from the carrier seat to the
floor. In almost all of the cases, infants were left unattended
in the infant carrier seat. Active infants can move or tip
carrier seats by their movements or by pushing off on other
objects with their feet.</P>

<P>To prevent injuries and deaths with infant carrier seats, CPSC
recommends that parents:</P>

<ul>
<li> Choose a carrier with a wide, sturdy base for stability.

<br><br><li> Stay within arm's reach of the baby when the carrier seat is on
tables, counters, couches, and chairs. Never place a carrier seat
on soft, plush surfaces that will make it unstable.

<br><br><li> Always use the safety belts and watch the child carefully, even
when strapped in.

<br><br><li> Do not use infant carriers as a substitute for infant car
seats.

</ul>

<P>To prevent injuries and deaths with infant carrier seats, always
use restraining straps and watch the child carefully, even when
strapped in.</P>

<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 6,1996 -- With children heading back to school, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that school age children have a complete medical eye exam by their fourth birthday, and routine eye exams approximately every two years thereafter.
</P>

<P>
 Parents should be aware of signs which may indicate that their child has vision problems, including:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>wandering or crossed eyes

	<LI>a family history of childhood vision problems


	<LI>disinterest in reading or viewing distant objects

	<LI>squinting or turning the head in an unusual manner while watching television
</UL>


<P>
 An appointment with an ophthalmologist, pediatrician, or family physician is recommended. Eye exams may also be obtained through school programs, vision testing programs, churches, synagogues, community centers, clubs, or from volunteer organizations such as local Societies to Prevent Blindness.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Common childhood eye problems include:</H3>
</P>

<P>
 <B>Refractive errors.</B> Refractive errors are eye conditions that can cause eye strain or a decrease in vision. They are corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses. Hyperopia (farsightedness or the inability to focus on objects at close range) can cause children to cross their eyes. Myopia (nearsightedness or the inability to see clearly at a distance] is uncommon before a child reaches fourth grade.
</P>



<P>
<B> Amblyopia.</B> Amblyopia, or &quot;lazy eye,&quot; occurs when vision develops abnormally during early childhood. It can result from a number of underlying causes and is often difficult to detect. Glasses or eye-strengthening patches are used for treatment, which is most effective in preventing loss of vision when initiated at a very early age.
</P>



<P>
<B> Strabismus.</B> Strabismus is a misalignment of the eyes, which causes them to point in different directions. Strabismus is a common condition among children and affects about 4% of all children in the U.S. Glasses or an eye patch are also used to treat strabismus, but surgery may be required in some cases.

<P>
<H3>The American Academy of Ophthalmology Answers Your Questions About Learning Disabilities</H3>
</P>

<P>
Q: How can I tell if my child has a learning disability?
</P>

<P>
 A: In the United States, approximately 3.4 million children younger than 13 years old have learning disabilities. Signs that may indicate your child has a learning disability include difficulty, avoidance, or extreme dislike of reading; poor handwriting; slow writing speed; difficulty with math; not being able to put information in order; difficulty understanding abstract concepts; memory problems; trouble following instructions or remembering words. It is not unusual for a child to have multiple learning disabilities.
</P>

<P>
 Children with learning disabilities may become frustrated, lose interest in school work, and try to avoid difficult tasks. Personality and behavioral problems may develop due to loss of self-esteem. Watch for signs of withdrawal, anxiety, depression or aggression. Remember that children with learning disabilities need love, understanding, and reassurance that they will do fine in life.
</P>

<P>
Q: Is a learning disability, such as dyslexia, considered an eye problem?
</P>

<P>
 A: No. Learning disabilities are not problems of the eye or vision. Dyslexia is a serious reading disability that involves switching around letters and words. The eyes transmit visual signals to the brain. The brain determines what it has seen. Dyslexia is only one of several learning disorders that can involve reading, writing, speaking, concentrating, listening and doing math. Since it has been demonstrated that dyslexia and other specific learning disabilities stem from the central nervous system, treatment can be complex.
</P>

<P>
Q: Who can help my child with his learning disabilities?
</P>

<P>
 A: First, the exact learning disability needs to be identified through school testing or a visit to a physician.
</P>

<P>
 Teachers, tutors, and physicians can all help identify and treat learning disabilities. Educators play key roles in offering early diagnosis and educational follow-up. Constant communication with your child is vital, to assist him or her in continuing educational growth, to help build self- esteem, and to offer reassurance.
</P>

<P>
 Q: I've been told that eye exercises and special prescription glasses are solutions to helping my child overcome his learning disability. Are these treatments recommended by the American Academy of Ophthalmology?
</P>

<P>
 A: No, the American Academy of Ophthalmology does not recommend these treatments, because no research proves their effectiveness. Eyes are used for vision, not comprehension. No scientific or medical evidence supports claims that academic abilities of dyslexic or learning disabled children can be improved with special glasses or eye exercises.
</P>

<P>
 Q: How much money should a parent spend on vision therapy to correct a child's learning disabilities?
</P>

<P>
 A: Absolutely none! It is often difficult for parents to accept the fact that their child might suffer from a learning disability. Often, out of concern for their child's well-being, parents go to great lengths to provide vision therapy for their children, including special diets, vitamins, sugar restriction, eye exercises or vision training. After spending valuable time, and often excessive money, on vision therapies, the learning disability remains.
</P>

<P>
 Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who specialize in eye and vision care. In diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases, ophthalmologists provide comprehensive eye exams, prescribe and administer corrective lenses and medicine, and perform surgery. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is the world's largest association of eye physicians and surgeons.

<P>Last month Pure Facts described a workshop presented at the FAUS Annual Conference by our retiring-president, Pat Palmer. This is a continuation of the information she provided.
KidSource Editors Note:  See article:<a href="/feingold/add.strategies.html">Strategies For Dealing With ADD in the Classroom</a></P>

<a name="copying"></a>
<H3>Copying From The Blackboard</H3>

<P>This can be almost impossible for the child who has problems with eye/hand coordination or other difficulty with writing. It's best for the teacher to have this information on a hand-out. The most important goal is to have the child learn the work, not to learn how to copy off a blackboard.</P>

<a name="started"></a>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>

<P>When the children come into class, I suggest teachers allow time for them to organize their notebooks, pencils, and papers. Base this time allowed on the child who takes the longest.</P>

<a name="Homework"></a>
<H3>Homework</H3>

<P>Teachers generally send home whatever did not get done in class. This means some children bring home an awful lot of homework! They really shouldn't have more than an hour or two each night. Homework is supposed to reinforce what the child has learned during the day; it shouldn't be an ordeal each evening for the child and his parents.</P>

<P>Every child needs a break after school. Some may prefer to get the homework done first, but for young children especially, it's better for them to have some physical activity, to be able to play, and then do the homework after dinner or later in the evening.</P>

<P>If you find your child is spending too much time on homework you may want to write into the IEP (individualized educational program) that no more than one or two hours will be spent on homework, depending on what is appropriate for their age. The parent is only expected to get the child to do what he is capable of doing during that time.</P>

<P>Consider which parent is better suited to work with the child...it isn't always Mom.</P>

<P>Allow the child to work in the environment that best suits him. For one youngster, this may be a quiet place in his bedroom. For another it could be at the kitchen table. Some work best with the radio on while others don't. Also, remember how important it is for the chair and desk/table to be the right 'fit.'  (See the July/August Pure Facts. (KidSource Editors Note:  See article:<a href="/feingold/add.strategies.html">Strategies For Dealing With ADD in the Classroom</a>)) The child's feet should be firmly "planted" on the floor when he sits down, and this can be as simple as putting a book under his feet.</P>

<P>He may need timed breaks. For the child who has started the Feingold Program and is having success, you can show him that he can lengthen his time of focus. Use a timer to determine how long he will try to focus on his work. You might start by having work periods that last only ten minutes, with breaks in between. Then, the following week, lengthen the time by a few minutes, perhaps it can be 12 minutes instead of 10. This will teach the child to focus for longer and longer periods, and he will eventually be able to work for as long as he is comfortable without the need for a timer or outside intervention. He will be able to get up, take a break, and come back to the work, to set his own pace.</P>

<P>We adults don't usually work on a project for hours at a time. We take breaks, leave it for awhile, and come back to our project.</P>

<P>When homework assignments are given, it's helpful if the teacher provides a list of books or other materials to complete the assignment. How many kids have come home with a homework assignment, but without the book needed to do it? Or, they come home with the book, but they don't know which page they're supposed to do. The teacher can spell it out on the blackboard.</P>

<P>Teachers can help students plan their time on a project by providing an outline which blocks out periods of time and charts how far along the child should be on the project, to help him to stay on target.</P>
<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Handwriting"></a>
<H3>Handwriting</H3>

<P>One of the specific learning disabilities teachers often complain about is the child's handwriting. Handwriting involves fine motor skills. The way teachers generally try to get children to improve their handwriting is to have the child practice it over and over again. But there's a much more effective way to help these children.</P>

<P>Start by using the child's gross motor skills, and gradually work down to the fine motor control. I recommend a large easel pad. You want the child to understand what the letters look like and how you make them. [Pat demonstrated using gross motor skills to make a single very large letter on the pad.] I moved my whole body; I didn't move just my fingers or my wrist, but I learned how to make a letter with a fluid motion. Once the child knows how to make a letter on a big page like this, you then move on to the next step. Again, use these very large sheets of paper, but now draw red and blue lines -- solid and dotted, just like the page in his writing workbook at school. When the child is able to write the letters using these enlarged pages, gradually use smaller pages and closer lines.</P>

<P>As the size of the letter gets smaller, the child will go from using most of his body to make the letter, then perhaps use his whole arm. So, you continue to have the fluid movement, but he still is not using the fine muscles. There's a smaller pad than this, which is available from the FAUS Resource Catalog. The lines are still big, but by this time the child has worked down to using his wrist. As he improves the child can use progressively smaller pages. We use the child's gross muscles to learn the motion and shape of the letter, and then as the motor control improves he can gradually come down to the size of letter being taught. Unfortunately, this progressive help is not offered in most schools. You don't have to use a large easel pad; instead, give the child a piece of chalk and let him write on the sidewalk.</P>

<P>There are other useful tools to help with a child's handwriting. Have you seen the child who holds the pencil or pen right down at the point, or up at the end? [Pat demonstrated a pen shaped so that the finger can't slide to the tip or go up too high.] These are specifically made for someone who has a problem with gripping the pencil/pen or a fine motor problem.</P>
<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Cursive"></a>
<H3>Cursive vs. Printing</H3>

<P>For the child who has problems writing, it's easier to learn cursive than to learn to print. The rhythm of the writing seems easier for this child to handle than the stop and start of printing. If you feel this is important for the school to follow, have it written into the IEP.</P>

<P>Youngsters who have difficulty writing should be allowed to type reports, and for some children, giving an oral report is better yet.</P>

<P>The child who has gross motor problems should receive occupational therapy (OT) intervention. Children who are clumsy and lacking in balance need the OT.</P>
<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Language"></a>
<H3>Language and Speech Delay</H3>

<P>If a child has delays in language and speech it may manifest itself as ADD because it's very frustrating not to be able to respond well.</P>

<P>One form of language problems in children and adults is called aphasia. This is where the child understands what you're saying and understands what his response is supposed to be, but has difficulty in verbalizing. We see this in people who have had strokes. Such a person is angry because they can't tell you what they want to say. If you have a child with this problem seek out a good speech therapist who can evaluate the child.</P>
<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Hearing"></a>
<H3>Hearing and Quality of Hearing</H3>

<P>Some children have very hypersensitive hearing. I used to take my son to church. He was fine until the organ music began, then he would scream, and I would have to leave. He acted like the noise was painful. This is the same child who told the fluorescent lights to stop buzzing; nobody else could hear them. He told the radiators to be quiet, because he heard these things. A person who is distracted by this super-sensitivity to noise will tune out the world around him when he is trying to focus.</P>

<P>There is interesting research being conducted that suggests you can have a different rate of hearing in each ear. So, if one ear is hearing sooner than the other, the person must decode what they hear before they can respond to it. That puts them out of sync with the rest of the world.</P>
<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Learning"></a>
<H3>Learning to Read</H3>

<P>Many of these children need phonics. They need the tools to decipher language, and phonics is the way to do it. Our kids aren't patient enough to learn "whole word recognition" and they don't want to memorize whole words. But if you give them the tools to decipher the language they'll do very well, so phonics is a better way to teach reading and language to these children.</P>

<P>Read all directions twice to be sure the children have heard them. Have the students repeat to you what the direction was.</P>

<a name="distractions"></a>
<H3>Certain Distractions</H3>

<P>We often hear about children who are distracted by things like the noise of a page turning, but some children who are not bothered by background noise of this type will have difficulty in the classroom if there is a discussion group going on while the child is trying to focus on something else. This child will be extremely distracted, even if the group is on the other side of the classroom; so I tell teachers who have kids with ADD to try not to divide up into groups, but to have the children work independently.</P>
<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Note"></a>
<H3>Note Taking</H3>

<P>By the time a child reaches seventh and eighth grade he will need to learn to take notes. This involves many skills. The child needs to:</P>

<ol>
<li> pay attention <br><br>

<li> translate what he hears into what he puts down on the page<br><br>

<li> remember what has just been said in order to put it on the page<br><br>

<li> comprehend the language and the words to put them on the page<br><br>

<li> be able to coordinate the handwriting to write it in a legible manner on the page<br><br>

<li> integrate all this together to make sense of the notes he just took.<br><br>

</ol>

<P>Note-taking is a very complicated skill. Keep in mind that you are asking a child to do six things at one time and you'll have a better idea why he's having trouble taking notes.</P>

<a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a><br>
<a name="Visual"></a>
<H3>Visual Tracking</H3>

<P>Following the letters across the page is a problem for many children, but it is one many teachers don't pick up on. Effective reading involves holding your head relatively still and mowing your eyes to follow the words across the page</P>

<P>When a child reads, if you see him lay his head on the desk or cock his head to one side, he's probably only tracking with one eye. This means he is moving his head in order to focus on the words, rather than holding his head still and moving only his eyes.</P>

<P>I know personally how difficult it is to track on a page if you have a visual problem. I suffered from this all through school and nobody knew it. Only after I was out of school and went to a specialist did I gain a better understanding of what I was dealing with visually. I could read, and could read the eye chart across the room, but I had trouble tracking across the page. The
way I compensated is the way they teach people to speed read. This involves reading down the center of the page, using peripheral vision mostly, so the eyes don't track left to right. One benefit is that I learned to read very rapidly. It was a compensation I didn't realize I was doing until years later. If I tried to track across the page I would lose a word, and I'd have to go back and find the word I lost because the sentence didn't make sense. That still happens to me today, but now I understand what's going on. If you have a child who's trying to read something and has to go back two or three times a line to make sense of what he is reading, he's going to read three times slower than his classmates. Watch the way the child holds his head for clues that he's only tracking with one eye.</P>

<P>Teach the child to sit up straight, to use his finger to track on the page or to use a T square. This rests against the side of the book and the ruler is parallel to the line of text. The child can use the T square to help keep his eyes right on the line. If you use interventions like these, be sure to ask the child which works best; you don't want to make things harder.</P>

But for others, dietis only a piece of the puzzle and remedial help will be needed as well.</P><a name="begin"></a><H3>Begin by identifying the problems </H3><p>There are practical steps parents and teachers can take to enable a child with &quot;ADD&quot; tolearn and succeed, but most parents and teachers don't really know how to accomplish this. A good wayto begin is to try to determine when the child seems to have problems, why, and to identify thedysfunction. A child may have a problem with only one teacher, one subject, or in one room in theschool. For example, large, noisy rooms such as cafeterias and gyms tend to overwhelm somechildren.</P><a name="iep"></a><H3>The IEP</H3> <p>After a need is identified it should be written into the IEP, the '`individualized educationalprogram&quot; or plan of action the school is required to follow for a child with disabilities. Theseinterventions can be effective if everyone involved -- parents, teachers and school staff participatein the plan.</P><a name="diet"></a><H3>A special diet</H3> <p>If there is a need identified, such as adherence to a diet, this must be written into the IEP. Onceit is completed it is very hard to go back and have something added in. Have your doctor write on hisletterhead that the child has a need for a restricted diet, and it must be followed as the parentoutlines. This gives you a lot of power.</P><a name="ask"></a><H3>Ask the child </H3><p>Not only do the adults need to be involved, but the child should be encouraged to give feedback. Askthe child if he feels the plan is helping him. If a youngster feels something is &quot;dumb&quot; itprobably isn't helping. Even young children can be asked, but it's especially important that theolder child (10-12 years old) be asked.</P>Also, don't lose sight of the fact that learning should be fun.</P><a name="furniture"></a><H3>Furniture </H3><p>The desk and chair need to be the right size. When children are uncomfortable in desks and chairsthat are not in proportion, they are going to squirm and fidget. If his feet don't touch the ground,he will swing them. At the very least, place an old telephone book on the floor so the child can resthis feet solidly on a surface.</P><p>If you're uncomfortable in your chair because your legs hit the edge of the seat in an uncomfortableway, you will move around in an attempt to become more comfortable.</P><p>A youngster should be able to put his elbows on the surface of the desk, and have his chin fitcomfortably in the palm of his hand. With these proportions he can write without having to bendover.</P><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><a name="floor"></a><H3>Floor plan</H3><p>Where the child sits is important. Teachers generally want to put difficult kids in a back corner --as far away as they can. But the problem this causes is that now the child sees everything that goeson in the classroom; the further back he is, the harder it will be for the child to focus on what isbeing taught.</P><p>The best place for a distractible child is right up in the first row, preferably in front of theteacher's desk. This will limit the amount of activity the child is exposed to.</P><a name="secret"></a><H3>Secret signals</H3><p>Such a seating arrangement also allows the teacher to use a system of signaling the child. The twoagree to a signal, perhaps the teacher touching the child's shoulder, as the reminder that he needsto focus. She can then signal the child without having to call attention to him or interruptteaching.</P><p>Some children need to move around more than others. Some do well until they get&quot;overloaded&quot; with stimuli, and then need to retreat to a place where they can be bythemselves and regain control. Some teachers allow a younger child to move around the classroom aslong as he does not disrupt the other children. An older child might be allowed to ask to go to thenurse's office, so he can get himself back together.</P><p>I've had people tell me the child may abuse the privilege and leave the classroom too often. That'strue, but this will tell you more about where the problem is. If it always occurs with the samesubject or with the same teacher, then you will have some information about the problem. But theother side of the coin is that when we can give the distractible child more power over hisenvironment, he will often use it wisely.</P> <a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a> <a name="predictable"></a><H3>Be predictable</H3> <p>Structure and consistency are very important for the child who still feels some internal chaos. Thereshould be immediate consequences for mistakes, but for the most part it should be private. When achild is scolded in front of the class it gives the class the ability to ridicule him.</P> <p>Each party should know in advance what the rules are, and the consequence for not adhering to them.These consequences should be obvious and appropriate. Take the child aside and explain what is wrong.It's important to know that the child understands he broke a rule, and which rule it was. Many times,a distracted child really won't know what he did wrong. See if he can tell you.</P>  <p>It may be appropriate for older children to have a say in planning the consequences. This empowers achild, and he is more likely to follow rules when he had a part in developing them.</P> <a name="perfect"></a><H3>Picture perfect</H3> <p>It's easy to write a list of rules for children who can read, but for the younger one, pictures canwork well. A parent can use this technique at home and the child might enjoy it even more it you havephotos of him. For example, a checklist for a school day may be: waking up, brushing teeth, gettingdressed, eating breakfast, etc.</P><p>Checklists are helpful for everyone, but they are especially important for disorganizedchildren.</P><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><a name="something"></a><H3>Something different </H3><p>Some children don't deal well with change. A new classroom, new teacher, new desk, new classmates canall be upsetting. What looks like odd behavior may simply be a child's inability to adapt to thechanges that are required of him.</P><p>Middle school can be especially difficult as the student is expected to change classes, use a locker,etc. Here is where extra help and lots of patience are in order.</P><p>Minimal rules and minimal choices are best for these children. In order to stay calm and be morefocused they need to clearly know what's expected of them -- they can stand in the middle of aclassroom and be totally unaware of what they're supposed to be doing next. It's especially hard ifthey're in a large, confusing place such as a cafeteria or gym, where they may get overexcited andhave trouble calming down. Compensate by gradually decreasing the activity, or by letting the childknow that gym will be over in ten minutes so he can begin to calm himself.</P><a name="thing"></a><H3>One thing at a time</H3><p>Parents and teachers get exasperated at the child who can't remember a series of directions. Ask himto go up to his room, get a sweater, and bring it downstairs. By the time he reaches his room hehasn't a clue why he's there. Most children hear the first direction, but lose it after that.</P> <p>When you give this child directions, have the child look at you. Watch his eyes. The minute his eyesgo up toward the ceiling, he will not hear the next word you say. You then remind him, &quot;No, payattention,&quot; and have the child repeat the directions. If he does, most likely he will thenremember what's been said.</P><p>Most kids hear the first direction; then their eyes leave, their body leaves, and they haven't heardthe rest. Games like &quot;Simon says&quot; can help with learning to pay attention.</P><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a><a name="bite"></a><H3>Bite-size pieces</H3> <p>Help the child learn how to break a project down into smaller sections. Children are assignedreports, but they are rarely taught how to do this. Many youngsters, not just those with attentiondeficits, are told to read a book and then write about it, but don't know how to do it.</P> <p>If the book is one that can be written in, use a highlighter pen (not a perfumed or smelly one) andshow the child how to highlight one sentence in each paragraph which tells what that paragraph says.If the book cannot be written in, or if photocopies are not an option, then have him write the keysentence on a separate paper.</P> <p>At the end of the chapter put all of the sentences together in a paragraph, and this will tell youwhat is contained in each chapter. This is helpful even for young children, where the books areshort.</P><p>This works for math problems too. If the problem is a written one, such as &quot;Mary has two applesand John has three&quot; show the child how to underline the important facts: two, plus, three. It'sthen nothing more complicated than addition.</P><p>Long range projects are very hard for the disorganized student. They need to make lists, but also touse a calendar to plan each step of the project. If a report is due in 4 weeks, they need to see howmuch should be read each day. Breaking down assignments into smaller, do-able steps can help them tokeep on target.</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a></td></tr></table><br><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

<h2>10 TIPS TO BUYING CHILDREN'S SOFTWARE
 </h2>

<p>Cathy Miranker and Alison Elliott, authors of The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids, offer these 10 tips for buying children's software. </p> 

<H3>Before you go shopping:</H3>
<ul>
<li>Know the exact capabilities of your computer system.  Write down the details so you can compare them to specifications on software packages.
<br>
<li>Research software titles that match your child's interests, age, school needs and learning style.  Use an independent resource likeThe Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids  to get the kind of information you need to meet the needs of your individual kids.
<br>
<li>Select titles before you go shopping.  Don't expect help at the store.  Sales people know what software sells but they don't evaluate titles for educational quality or effectiveness.

</ul>

<H3>At the store:</H3>

<ul>
<li>Buy two titles at a time, at most.  Build your library carefully over time.
<br>
<li>Read the fine print on the package.  Check your notes to make sure your computer meets the program requirements.
<br>
<li>Learn the store's return policy.  Choose retailers that will let you return a CD-ROM if it does not live up to  expectations held by you or your child.
</ul>

<H3>At home:</H3>

<ul>
<li>Familiarize yourself with software before you show it to your children, and be around when they first use it to make sure they figure it out.
<br>
<li>Put away some programs for a month, once in a while.  Your kids will approach software with a fresh perspective when you re-introduce it.
<br>
<li>Join your child at the computer.  Your participation as her audience or partner is more important than any program.
</ul>
<br>
<p>You'll find more tips like these, plus lists of recommended software and helpful reviews, in The Computer Museum Guide to the Best Software for Kids, published by HarperCollins and in stores now for $16.</p>

<P>Since the early 1970's, schools across the nation have been 
adding computers and instruction in computing to programs for 
students of all ages and abilities.  Gifted and talented students in 
most schools now have access to computers in their classrooms, and an increasingly large percentage of these students 
have home computers.  As the goals for technology education 
and the promises of educational change have grown, the hardware and the software used in both schools and homes have improved steadily.  Educators, business and industry, the government, and the general public believe our most able students must 
be computer literate for our nation to be competitive in the next 
generation.  Only recently, with the gulf between promises and 
achievements widening, have voices of concern been raised 
(Holden, 1989).</P>

<P>        The disparity between theory and practice is attributed to 
many causes, ranging from a lack of educational focus to a 
shortage of funding.  But even those reporting problems have 
found evidence of students working "smarter," whether they are 
learning and using more information, understanding key concepts and relationships better, or developing higher level thinking 
skills.  Gifted students are benefitting from increased use of 
computers because their special needs are being met through informed use of technology.</P>

<a name="The"></a>
<H3>The Needs of Gifted and Talented Students</H3>

<P>The identification of gifted and/or talented individuals and the determination of their specific needs is made complex by the widely 
different opinions of what giftedness is and how it is manifested.  
Basic research is as varied as Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of 
multiple intelligences and Joseph Renzulli's (1977) dependence 
on congruence between ability, commitment, and creativity. Most 
agree, however, that the talents of gifted youngsters are dynamic rather than static or fixed, and that the youngsters and 
their talents must be nurtured.</P>

<P>        How schools nurture and the effects of various practices are 
the focus of much research.  June Cox (Cox, Daniel, &amp; Boston, 
1985), with the Sid W. Richardson Foundation, conducted a national study of current programming for able learners.  Donald 
Treffinger (1986) has written prolifically on gifted programs.  
Others have explored the relationship of specific processes 
such as problem finding to nurturing specific talents such as creativity (Getzels &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 1976).</P>
<P>        Combined with practice and experience, the research suggests the following tenets are essential to good  programming for 
gifted and talented students:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Instruction recognizes students' unique learning styles.
	<LI>Students are supported as they grow in self-confidence and 
self-awareness of their strengths and weaknesses.
	<LI>Students progress at a rate most appropriate for them.
	<LI>Structured opportunities are provided for individual and small 
group investigations of real problems.
	<LI>Students are encouraged to develop and practice higher level 
thinking skills.
	<LI>Opportunities are provided for students to establish goals and 
determine objectives.
	<LI>Students learn with and from each other.
	<LI>A wide range and variety of materials and resources are available.
	<LI>Student interests are used as a basis for learning.<BR><BR>

<a name="Computers"></a>
<H3>Computers are Idea Engines</H3>

<P>The computer has evolved well beyond the ancestral calculator 
that did amazing computations.  It has become an idea engine - a 
tool for discovery, exploration, and collaboration.  Computers are 
designed to process information, and the results they furnish are 
as limitless as the humans using them and the problems and applications for which they are employed.  </P>

<P>Computers can manage 
data whether the information they store is organized as numbers, 
names, words, dates, or any combination of facts.  Computers 
can produce graphics in charts, pictures, animation, color, and 
three dimensions if the necessary peripherals and programming 
devices are available.  They can be used to manipulate text, correct spelling, critique grammar, and speak several languages. </P>
 
<P>When connected with telephone lines or other cabling, they can 
share information.  Instructed properly, computers can make 
"intelligent" decisions.  They do all of this accurately with speed 
and increasing flexibility.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Computer"></a>
<H3>Computer Applications</H3>

<P>At the simplest level, as intelligent tutors offering Computer 
Aided Instruction (CAI), computers provide only modest support 
of program goals for able learners.  Instruction is individually 
paced, different learning styles may be accommodated, and 
some self-confidence may be gained.  However, this use of computers fares poorest in the research.  Teachers are still better at 
traditional stimulus/response instruction.</P>

<P>        At a higher level, students are provided opportunities to do 
research and apply complex thinking skills by working with real 
problems and computer simulations.  Learning becomes fun and 
more challenging.  Some of the best software on the market falls 
into this category and the results of time spent with computers in 
this mode are not easily dismissed.  Students are taught programming languages that aid them in beginning to turn a computer into a real tool.  The LOGO languages and the concepts introduced in Mindstorms  (Papert, 1980) and the more advanced 
Turtle Geometry (Abelson, 1984) provide platforms for students 
to invent their own syntax, integrate knowledge, and share ideas.  
All students in gifted and talented programs should be introduced 
to such computer applications and programming.</P>

<P>        Unfortunately, many students never move beyond this level.  
The new found mastery of the power of the computer is seductive.  Every problem presented can be solved. The graphics are 
spectacular.  Non-users are awed and even the teachers are 
often surpassed; hackers emerge.  However, little is to be gained 
from merely a faster CPU, better resolution, gigabytes of storage, or technology.  The real power of the computer is the quality 
of the questions students ask and attempt to answer.</P>

<a name="Asking"></a>
<H3>Asking Better Questions</H3>

<P>In November, 1987, Control Data Corporation challenged students across the country to put their best questions forward as 
part of a contest to promote a new supercomputer.  They wanted 
to know what students were interested in and how they would use 
a computer to discover, explore, and collaborate.  Teachers were 
asked to spend the next six months building and guiding learning 
experiences which reinforced and clarified the students' topics.  
Teams were formed - each student with an independent project - 
to pool strategies, share learning, and expand alternatives.  Time 
was spent in the library reading professional journals and investigating tangents.  At the end of the school year the students with 
the best developed questions (still no solutions) were invited to 
spend the summer in Minnesota working with a powerful computer 
and mentors from Control Data staff.  After nearly eight months of 
investigation, the students reported what they had learned to a 
panel of scientists who read each paper and spent several hours 
listening to the students and sharing their own knowledge and 
experience.</P>

<P>        The impact of that program on each of the 1,475 schools 
which participated nationwide was remarkable.  Computers had 
been used to frame better questions, define important problems, 
stretch students farther than they or their teachers thought possible.  These gifted and talented students combined their individual strengths and needs with a conglomerate of people, resources, and technologies that changed their learning experience.  It is important to note that the use of computers, although 
significant, was not the focus of the program.  The students were 
not studying computer science or applications.</P>

<a name="Gifted"></a>
<H3>Gifted and Talented Students Work Smart</H3>

<P>When computers are used to support program goals and meet 
individual student needs they can help gifted students work 
smart.</P>
<p>
<ul>
<li> When choices are provided and experimentation allowed, 
individual learning styles and preferences can be accommodated and enhanced through the flexibility of the computer 
to interact with pictures, words, numbers, or any other 
medium the student is most comfortable with.  The flexibility of 
the technology is the key concept.  Different students find 
different word processors, graphics packages, databases, 
and spreadsheets more or less easy to use.

<br><br><Li>Structured experiences designed by well-trained teachers 
can help students use computers to develop strengths and 
overcome or neutralize weaknesses.  Word processors do 
improve writing and expression of ideas. Databases can be as 
rigid or open as the student needs. Solving problems and 
answering questions are satisfying outcomes.  Students grow 
in confidence as they build their repertoire of skills.

<br><br><Li>Computers can be used to match the student's pace.  They 
are patient and will hold on to an idea for a long time.  They do 
more complex tasks when students are ready to use them in 
more complex ways.  They provide information when the 
student is ready for it.

<br><br><Li>When students assume responsibility for the process they 
work smarter.  Computers serve people.  People define 
problems, set goals and objectives, and determine roles.  The 
better students understand the learning process, the better 
they will use technology.

<br><br><Li>People learn from people. People are on the other end of the 
information and ideas accessed through a computer.  
Students have contact with these people via software, bulletin boards, or face to face in discussions and group projects.  Students can meet a lot of smart people through 
computers.<BR><BR>

<H3>How Parents Can Help Prevent and Halt Future E. Coli Epidemics</H3>



<P>As of November, 1996, parents MUST educate themselves about food
processing.  Between where food is grown and when it reaches your child,
there are many opportunities for E. coli to enter the system.  Having
educated yourself, YOU SHOULD WRITE, FAX OR E-MAIL YOUR GOVERNMENT
REPRESENTATIVES and recommend the preventative methods you prefer.</P>

<P>There are five ways in which animal waste products can contaminate fruit
and vegetables virtually at their source.  First, ground beef can be
affected when certain cow body parts are ground up.  Second, fecal matter
can get into other cow products such as milk or cheese in a similar
fashion.  Third, contaminated manure can be used to grow fresh produce.
Fourth, water can be contaminated and used on growing fruit and
vegetables.  Fifth, tree fruit can fall on the ground where animals, such
as cow or
deer, have defecated.</P>

<P>The government could mandate a complete separation between animal products
and fresh produce.  For example, food could be grown only in sterilized
manure and water.  Cows would not be allowed to graze in orchards.  This
might not resolve all possible contamination for foods purchased from
outside the U.S.</P>

<P>Beyond the source, there are at least three ways in which fresh produce
can be contaminated before it gets to your grocery store or restaurant.
First, it can be contaminated by unsafe practices at the manufacturing plant.
Second, it can be contaminated by human contact by an E. coli infected
person with unclean hands.  Third, it could be contaminated by other
similar fruit or vegetables with which it comes into contact.</P>

<P>The government already mandates many health practices such as handwashing
and manufacturing plant sanitization which are presently insufficient.
More needs to be done.</P>

<P>At the plant, fresh fruit and vegetables can be turned into processed
foods
such as salads "in-a-bag" or fresh squeezed juices.</P>

To eliminate E. coli at a factory, these products must somehow be
sterilized. At present, the best method known for sterilization is
pasteurization.  However, there may be alternate solutions, such as
additives, irradiation, or chemical washes that will address this problem
in fruit and vegetable that are not served cooked, such as cantaloupe and
lettuce. However, these need to be mandated by the government.

<P>At the grocery store, parents should be warned about which products may be
contaminated.  No matter how you feel about other solutions, labeling ON
products and IN grocery stores is an inexpensive, educational method for
notifying parents about the risk of death in feeding uncooked,
unsterilized
products to children.  A similar, successful campaign was launched against
feeding honey to children under the age of 2 which has dramatically
reduced
cases of botulism.</P>

<P>At home, we need to clean fresh produce, cook them thoroughly before
giving
them to our families, wash counters that come into contact with food, and
regularly wash hands.</P>

<P>The government should make E. coli infection and HUS complications
reportable diseases to the Center for Disease Control.  At the moment, it
is tracked by a majority of states, but because the CDC is not
accountable,
evidence of this growing threat to the food supply is not gathered, and
when widespread epidemics occur, children continue to be affected long
after they should have been because there is no central method of
notification across state lines.  Doctors can also be unaware that an
epidemic is going on and therefore misdiagnose the preliminary symptoms.</P>

<P>At a state level, parents should demand quick response to such epidemics.
In 1996, because the King County/Seattle Health Department quickly
researched and identified its E. coli cases and notified the manufacturer
of the juice, California and Colorado learned that their cases might be
related.  If you live in a state other than Washington, you should be
concerned about the speed with which your health department might respond
to prevent and epidemic.</P>

<P>The government and industry should invest in faster tests to quickly and
accurately identify E. coli infections in people and contamination in
food.
Only with quick identification can the spread of E. coli epidemics be
slowed.</P>

 <a name="Think"></a>
<H3>If You Think Your Child Has An E. Coli Infection:</H3>



<P>If you think your child has an E. coli infection, your investigation
should have two focuses:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

        	<LI> Determining whether your child has such an infection and
        	<LI> Investigating the source of the infection
</OL>

<P><B>DETERMINING whether your child has an E. coli infection:</B></P>

<P>Young children are most affected by E. coli infections and are in the most
danger of possible complications.  The primary symptoms caused by an E.
coli infection are:</P>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
        	<LI> Diarrhea, which may be bloody, and becomes watery with time
        	<LI> Stomach cramps
        	<LI> A low grade or NO fever
        	<LI> Vomiting
</OL>
If your child has shown these symptoms and SUBSEQUENTLY shows signs of
<OL TYPE=1 START="5">	
        	<LI> ANEMIA, or a
        	<LI> SKIN RASH,
</OL>

<P>YOU SHOULD INSIST ON SEEING YOUR PEDIATRICIAN IMMEDIATELY, OR IF HE IS NOT
AVAILABLE, GO IMMEDIATELY TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. Anemia is characterized by
the color draining out of the child's face. Lips and gums that are
normally
deep rose to red in color will become increasingly gray, and the child
will
become first irritable and then listless. Insist that medical
professionals
run the stool samples and blood tests recommended below, if they do not do
them automatically. A rash appears as little red or purplish dots that
don't blanch (clear) when you press on them.  According to the New England
Journal of Medicine, children under the age of two are the most at risk of
complications; dehydration occurs more rapidly and can be more severe in
younger children.</P>

<P>The stomach cramps caused by an E. coli infection distinguish it from a
flu. They can be so painful as to wake the child in the middle of the
night. A young, but toilet trained, child may have difficulty making it to
the bathroom in time because of how much fluid is being lost. They will be
going to the bathroom more frequently than every four hours.</P>

<P>However, some of these symptoms are difficult to distinguish from other
forms of food poisoning that can cause similar, but not identical
symptoms,
such as Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and a number of viruses. A
certain type of Shigella, S. dysenteriae, can cause the same complications
as an E. coli infection, but will initially be treated differently. Also,
over the course of the illness, some symptoms may disappear or be
obscured.
In Shigella, for example, the child may have a seizure or an initial high
fever, but by the time the child visits the doctor, these symptoms may no
longer be present. Therefore, diagnosing E. coli can be difficult.</P>

<P>Most parents would take their child to the Pediatrician's after two days
of
the first four symptoms, and that is correct timing. To be aggressive, as
parents, we ask that at that first visit, YOU INSIST ON A STOOL CULTURE
for</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> Shigella
        	<LI> Campylobacter
        	<LI> Salmonella, AND
        	<LI> E. COLI, including E. coli O157:H7
</UL>

<P>regardless of how bloody the stool is. Note that as of the end of 1996,
clinical laboratories do NOT routinely do cultures for E. coli, despite
the
availability of an inexpensive test.  By not screening all stools for E.
coli, money is saved.  In the August 10, 1995 New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors recommended "Laboratories not already culturing all
diarrheal stool specimens for E. coli O157:H7 should begin doing so.  If
only specimens of bloody stool are cultured for the organism, some
infections will be missed... We recommend that all clinical laboratories
screen for E. coli O157:H7, particularly if the stool is bloody."  Your
pediatrician may even think that he has ordered the test, when it has not
in fact been ordered.</P>

<P>Catching and managing this disease early is critical to your child's long
term health.  While at present no antibiotics are known to stop an E. coli
infection, dehydration can hasten complications along.  The opportunity
arises for misdiagnosis.  For example, treatment with antimotility drugs,
such as Imodium, has been linked to worse complications; and suspicion of
appendicitis can lead to an exploratory surgery.  Drug trials in which it
might be possible to participate require detection within the first few
days of the illness.</P>

<P>A stool sample routinely takes two to four days to complete. Should the
stool sample come back negative for all four and the symptoms persist, you
should insist on seeing your pediatrician again. Many times, E. coli is not
cultured out of a stool. At that point, assuming your child is still
showing the symptoms, YOU SHOULD INSIST ON SETS OF BLOOD TESTS: </P>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> a "CBC"
	(short for "Complete Blood Count"), and <BR><BR>
	<LI> those that check electrolytes
and kidney function. Because a young child will have had frequent diarrhea
for four days at this point, he/she will be nearing a point where he/she
might need intravenous fluids.
</OL>
<P>If your child is determined to have an E. coli infection and appears to be
developing HUS complications, as determined by the blood test results, YOU
SHOULD REQUEST A TRANSFER TO THE BEST CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN YOUR
VICINITY,
specifically one with a pediatric nephrologist, a children's kidney
expert.
Very few hospitals are equipped to deal with the full range of supportive
treatment required for HUS complications. Also, very few pediatricians
have
the "hands-on" experience to understand appropriate treatments.
Therefore,
being at an inexperienced medical center puts your child in the very real
danger of being undertreated or overtreated.</P>

<P>Note that as of November, 1996, there is no cure for this illness.
Treatment is known as "supportive"; in other words, doctors overseeing
your
child's case will continue to try to tip the odds back in favor of your
child's healing.  A very high percentage of these children, up to 98%,
seen
at major medical centers recover with supportive treatment.</P>

<P>As a point of fact, there is a blood test available at "reference
laboratories," such as the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, that can
be run to determine whether your child has ever been exposed to E. coli
O157:H7.  Very few physicians know of its availability and due to the two
weeks it takes to get results, the test presently will have little impact
on your child's treatment.  Unlike a stool culture which attempts to grow
the actual bacterial organism, this test checks to see whether your
child's
body has tried to fight off an E. coli O157:H7 infection.  Thus, while the
organism may already have left your child's body like a thief in the
night,
its footprints may still be found.  This is known as the test for
"Antibodies to O157 lipopolysaccharide."  It may be relevant to
identifying
your role in a larger epidemic with a known cause.</P>


<P><B>INVESTIGATING the source of the illness</B> </P>

<P>There are three reasons why you would be interested in the source of your
child's infections:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
        	<LI> To determine what caused it and put your mind at ease (personal)
        	<LI> To help prevent an epidemic (social)
        	<LI> To assess responsibility (financial)
</OL>

<P><B>First, for the last 10 days, REVIEW</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> the foods your child has consumed
        	<LI> the animals with which your child may have come into contact
        	<LI> bodies of water in which your child may have come into contact
        	<LI> other children with which your child has come into contact
</UL>

<P>An E. coli infection has an incubation period of approximately 3-10 days
with likelihood skewed toward the shorter period.  Unlike previous
reports,
E. coli is now known to be found in foods as diverse as unpasteurized
juices, melons, lettuce, salami, ground beef and milk products.  Suspect
all uncooked foods until proven otherwise.</P>

<P><B>Second,</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> DON'T PUT OUT THE TRASH OR THE RECYCLING
</UL>

<P>In the October/November, 1996 apple juice epidemic, many parents threw
away
the bottles of juice which their children had consumed.  Valuable
information such as the lot numbers of the bottles were lost.  You can go
through your trash and recycling bins to find</P>
<blockquote>
        	- receipts for produce that you purchased,<BR>
        	- wrappers for different foods, and<BR>
        	- other containers that may be related
</blockquote>

<P>Set any evidence such as this aside immediately.  Ideally, containers with
residue of possible contamination should be placed in the refrigerator and
clearly labeled so that no one else will consume them.</P>

<P><B>Third,</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> CONTACT your county and state department of health
</UL>
<P>While many states as of November, 1996 have E. coli as a reportable
disease
(e.g., as soon as your doctor knows that there is an E. coli infection),
many doctors will not report your child's illness until they have proven
that E. coli is there.  Unfortunately, due to the rapid spread of the
illness and the difficulty of detecting E. coli as a source, you need to
act as your own advocate.  The questions you should ask your local health
officials are:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> Are there any other cases going on in your county?
        	<LI> Are there any other cases going on in the neighboring counties?
</UL>

<P>Often, counties do not speak with one another to determine whether an
epidemic may be occurring.  If your local health officials do not know the
answer, insist that they find out.  You could live in Vermont and be the
first and only case there while 10 people in New Hampshire have gotten
sick.  You might also ask:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> Are any other states reporting epidemics at this time?
</UL>
<P>Unfortunately, present reporting mechanisms are virtually inadequate for
your local officials to know the answer to this question.  However, when
this disease is made reportable to the CDC, the information obtained may
point to a more widespread epidemic.  Lastly, remember to ask</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> What other things do those cases/epidemics have in common
with yours?
</UL>

<P><B>Fourth, if you have not already,</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> ASK FOR AN E. COLI O157:H7 BLOOD TEST IF YOUR STOOL CULTURE IS
	NEGATIVE
</UL>

<P>Many doctors and hospitals do not know this blood test exists.  A stool
culture can be superior in cost, time-to-results (2 to 4 days) and
determining the genetic fingerprint of the infectious agent.  However, due
to the difficulty of culturing this type of E. coli, it can take as long
as
a month for laboratory facilities to give you O157:H7 results from a
stool.
The blood test, which can take two weeks, may be able to tell you that it
was O157:H7 but not which kind.</P>

<P><B>Fifth, if a source is identified,</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> CALL THE MANUFACTURER RESPONSIBLE AND NOTIFY THEM OF YOUR CASE
</UL>
<P>You may need to ask to speak with the CEO, but the more quickly you make
your situation known, the more quickly the company may be able to respond.
For example, a company might only be pulling potentially contaminated
product off of shelves in your state, when they should be pulling it off
the shelves all over the country.  Likewise, the manufacturer should treat
you with some compassion.</P>

<P><B>Sixth,</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> ATTEMPT TO CONTACT OTHER PARENTS AFFECTED BY YOUR OUTBREAK
</UL>
<P>One of the most damaging results of a widespread, infectious disease is
that it isolates parents in similar situations from one another.  Doctors
and health officials may not release your name without your permission;
yet, you may in fact learn more directly from other parents than you learn
from officials.  You should want to have your privacy respected, but you
should also know that silence enables the epidemic to spread further and
faster than it would if information was well known.  And because not all
doctors are familiar with it, you may be able to educate them about the
latest techniques and tests that you learn from others.</P>

<P><B>Lastly,</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
        	<LI> IF YOU ARE ABLE, GO PUBLIC WITH YOUR STORY
</UL>
<P>Again, silence or retreat in the face of this infectious disease maintains
the status quo of ignorance.  Only when people understand the gravity of
infectious diseases will something be done about it.  E. coli infections
are not just bad things that happen to other people because they eat at
THAT fast food place, drink THAT brand of apple juice or swim at THAT
watering hole.  They can happen to anyone.</P>

<P>COLUMBUS, Ohio, July 11 /PRNewswire/ -- CompuServe Incorporated (Nasdaq: CSRV) and Henter-Joyce, Inc., St. Petersburg, Florida, have agreed to work together on a solution that updates accessibility to the CompuServe(R) Information Service and the Internet by visually impaired members.</P>

<P>"As information technology continues to move forward, adaptive equipment and technology must change to keep pace," said Kent Stuckey, CompuServe director, business Development. With CompuServe moving to a non-ASCII, more graphics-rich environment and adopting Internet standards, the company chose to work with Henter-Joyce to ensure that members who are blind or visually impaired can use the same computer and interface software enjoyed by sighted household members, and thereby continue to benefit from the online experience.</P>

<P>"Henter-Joyce welcomes the opportunity to join CompuServe in providing today's technology to all visually impaired individuals wishing to participate in the online world. With the combination of our two companies' products, they can do so using their own or their family's home computer," said Eric Damery, vice president of sales for Henter-Joyce.</P>

<P>During the third quarter of this year (July - Sept.), the two organizations will offer a package that includes Henter-Joyce's JAWS for Windows screen reader, CompuServe's interface software for the Windows operating system and a set of training audio tapes to help instruct the visually impaired user on the use of CompuServe as well as the screen reader. To order the package, call 800-336-5658 or send electronic mail inquiries to info@hj.com. Henter-Joyce maintains e Forum(R) area on the CompuServe information Service et GO JAWS.</P>

<P>"Cyberspace is a world where people interact with one another beyond their physical limitations," Stuckey added. "The online world comes to them, wherever they are, whenever they want it, without regard to physical barriers. Cyberspace allows them to do research, work, learn, share their experiences and socialize with people around the world."</P>

<P>In addition to thousands of online news, information, communication and entertainment areas, CompuServe offers Forum areas of particular benefit to people with disabilities, including the Disability Forum (GO DISABILITIES), the Handicapped Users Database (GO HANDICAPPED) and technical support Forum areas for providers of software tools and other adaptive equipment.</P>

<P>"While the Windows operating system can present technical challenges for users with disabilities and for accessibility software developers, it has proven to be where the computer world of today and tomorrow is going, and Henter-Joyce intends to be there every step of the way," Damery added.</P>

<P>Founded in 1987, Henter-Joyce develops software that enables people with visual impairments to make computers talk.</P>

<P>Founded in 1969, CompuServe Incorporated provides the world's most comprehensive online services, business network and Internet access. Through CompuServe, more than five million home and business users in more than 185 countries access the Internet and 3,000-plus online information, education and entertainment services and products. In addition, 982 corporate customers use CompuServe's value-added network solutions. Among its many uses. the CompuServe owned network serves as the world's mailbox and check-out lane, hosting millions of e-mail messages per month and more than one billion point-of-sale transactions per year. With world headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, CompuServe's offices include European centers in Munich, London and Paris.</P>

<P>CONTACT: Carrie Reber or Jeff Shafer of CompuServe Incorporated, 614-539-4092 or 614-538-4632, or Cathy Kaiser of Henter-Joyce, 813-528-8900</P>

Simply stated, learning disabilities are troubles children might have withskills such as listening reading, writing, spelling or speaking. These skill impairments have littleto do with a child's intelligence - in fact, most learning- disabled children have normal or higherintelligence, and some who are gifted.</p><P> The following information lists five major types of learning disabilities, and what parents cando to help. Children can begin to show signs of these disabilities during preschool, early grades andthroughout their academic careers - so be sure to watch children for the warning signs below.</P><a name="language"></a><H3> Language Disabilities </H3><P> Signs include a child: asking for repeated information; misunderstanding directions, havingtrouble remembering and following directions; having trouble expressing himself or herself; and usingincorrect grammar beyond an appropriate age (such as saying &quot;I don't got none&quot; for &quot;ldon't have any&quot; by school age). Parents can help improve language skills by reading to childreneveryday. In addition, trips that expose them to language through conversations, such as to museumsand zoos, are excellent vocabulary builders.</P><a name="speech"></a><H3> Speech Disabilities </H3><P> These include slurred speech, stuttering and lisping which can all affect a child's ability tocommunicate by making them hesitant to speak because of embarrassment. Children may also beembarrassed by hoarseness of voice or monotone, which can be caused for many reasons. For all thesespeech disabilities, a parent can repeat back the correct way to pronounce words through normal andfrequent conversation.</P><a name="reading"></a><H3> Reading Disabilities and Dyslexia </H3><P>Children who show little interest in reading and the reading portions of educational televisionmay have a reading disability. Reading difficulty can be caused by a variety of factors, so a readingevaluation is necessary to determine exactly what causes the trouble. Parents can help develop achild's reading skills by reading along and pointing at each word to match the words up withsounds.</P><a name="writing"></a><H3> Writing Disabilities</H3><P> Writing disabilities may be caused by underdeveloped muscles in the hands or trouble with thecombination of senses used to write. Arts and crafts, as well as hand-eye games such as jump rope andmarbles, are excellent ways to develop the skills required for writing.</P><a name="math"></a><H3> Math Disabilities</H3> <P> Any problems with math, such as poor grades or general frustration, may signal a math disability.Parents can point out the math in every day situations, such as setting the table and making change.In each case, it helps to provide a visual symbol along with the number to increase comprehension(such as two cups + three cups = five cups).</P><P> In most cases, whatever the disability may be, both children and parents must remember that thereis nothing wrong with the child or the child's intelligence. Just like learning a new position inbaseball or learning a new piece on the piano, families must approach these challenges as newobstacles to overcome.</P><P> If you suspect any of these disabilities in a child, consult your doctor and the child'steachers.</P><P>Reprinted from Triaminic Parents Club, winter 1996</P><a href="#top">Back to top</a></td></tr></table><hr><center><h4> <a href="/kidsource/pages/Newborns.html"> Newborns </a> |  <a href="/kidsource/pages/toddlers.html"> Toddlers </a> |<a href="/kidsource/pages/Preschoolers.html"> Preschoolers </a> |    <a href="/kidsource/pages/k12.html"> K-12</a> | <br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Education.html"> Education </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Health.html"> Health </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Recreation.html"> Recreation </a> |<a href="/Forums"> Forums </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/parenting.html"> Parenting </a> |<br><a href="/kidsource/pages/Donation.html"> Computing EDGE </a> | <a href="/kidsource/pages/Organizations.html"> Organizations </a> | <a href="/kidsource/software/Guide.html"> Guide to Best Software</a> |<br><A HREF="/index.html"> Home </a> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/about.html">About Us</a> |    <A HREF="/survey.qry?function=form"> Survey</A> |<A HREF="/kidsource/pages/friends.html">Friends</a> |  <a href=/guestdisp.qry?function=search> Guest book</a> |</h4></center> <img src="/images/KIDSRCE3.btn.gif" alt = "KidSource OnLine" align=left>   <address>We love to talk with you.

<h3>Facts About SIDS </h3>

<ul>
<li>It is the leading cause of death of infants between one week and one year of age.</p>

<li>It is an unpredictable medical disorder.</p>

<li>It is not contagious and it is not caused by immunizations or by child abuse.</p>

<li>Researchers are getting closer to answers, but currently there are no explanations for the cause or causes of the deaths of these apparently healthy babies.</p>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Reducing the Risk </h3>

<p> Recent research suggests the risk of SIDS may be reduced by following a number of guidelines:</P>

<ul>
<li> Place healthy babies on their backs or sides to sleep, not on their tummies.</P>
<li> Babies should be placed to sleep only on a firm mattress or other firm surface.</P>
<li> Babies should be kept warm, but not too warm; the room should feel comfortable to you.</P>
<li> Never allow anyone to smoke around your baby.</P>
<li> Mothers should get early and regular care during pregnancy, and should consider breastfeeding.</P>
<li> Call your doctor or clinic right away if your baby seems sick, and make sure he/she is immunized on schedule.</P>

</ul>

<p>Today, even in two-parent families, both parents often work. As a result,
many children routinely spend time at home without adult supervision.
Moreover, single parents have long faced the challenge of working and caring
for young children alone.</p>

<p>Easy answers don't exist. After-school daycare is  hard to find. (It's
almost impossible to find in     most rural areas.) When it is available, it
is very  expensive. This means that most of us really have    no alternative
but to be away from our children at   times when they might need us.</p>

<p>Some reports refer to children's "self-care." This term interprets
parents' necessary absence from the home (at work) as a choice. Obviously,
it  usually isn't a choice, and self-care is sometimes not a good
alternative.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many, if not most, children 11 or older can manage
after school. If the areas in which they live are not dangerous, and if
parents make plans, "self-care" can be a good experience. Children can, if
protected by a set of ground rules, learn to be responsible for themselves.</p>

<p>Maybe the real question is "When is being home alone acceptable?"</p>

<p>Things to consider include:</p>
<UL>
<li>Is your neighborhood safe?<br><br>
<li>Will a neighbor help in an emergency?<br><br>
<li>Can your children get in touch with you when they need you?<br><br>
<li>Do you need the cooperation of your employer? What for?<br><br>
<li>What ground rules do your children need to follow when home alone?<br><br>

</UL>

<p>Depending on your situation and what your children are like, ground rules
will vary. The idea is that parent and child understand what to expect, how
to deal with the expected, and what to do when the unexpected comes up. </p>

<p>In general, though, consider making rules for:</p>
<UL>
<li>visits from friends,<br><br>
<li>use of the television,<br><br>
<li>completion of homework,<br><br>
<li>answering the door or phone,<br><br>
<li>going outside,<br><br>
<li>using appliances, and<br><br>
<li>dealing with squabbles among brothers and sisters.<br><br>
</UL>

<p>Rules can't cover every situation, and that's why it's important that
children know how to contact you at work.</p>

<P>Welcome to the world of parenthood! Why didn't someone tell you there were going to be days when you would feel:</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>old before your time 
	<LI>tired before 11 a.m. 
	<LI>too upset to think straight.
</UL>

<P> Would you have believed them, if they had?</P>
 
<P>The fact is you're a parent now, and those children are yours. But you're not alone (lots of parents feel the way you do), and things can get better.</P>

<P>One of the nicest things about being a parent is that you don't have to know everything. The job, like the child, grows gradually. There's on-the-job training.</P>

<P>So take a few moments, just for yourself, and learn how to make the rewards of parenting equal the demands.</P>

<a name="Birth"></a>
<H3>Birth to One Year</H3>

<P><B>Learn the basics.</B> How do you bathe a baby? Or change a diaper? You can learn! Read, ask an expert, talk to your parents and other parents.</P>

<P><B>Love your baby.</B> Give all you've got! Talk to your baby, touch (hold, kiss, hug), smile and enjoy! It's impossible to spoil a baby.</P>

<P><B>Discover what's what.</B> Pay close attention to all the sounds (cooing, babbling, gurgling, and crying) your baby makes, as well as facial expressions and body movements. Each one means something different</P>

<P><B>Never use physical force.</B> The pressures of parenting are very real. You need to find safe, satisfying ways to release them - but never on your baby.</P>

<a name="Toddlerhood"></a>
<H3>Toddlerhood</H3>

<P><B>Take a deep breath.</B> The assault on your house, your personal belongings... this too, shall pass. Right now, to your toddler, everything is new, exciting ... and just waiting to be explored.</P>

<P><B>Childproof your house.</B> Pack away your treasures and lockup dangerous or poisonous items. You'll be more relaxed, and you won't have to say "NO" so often.</P>

<P><B>Keep the rules simple and few.</B> Your goal is to keep your toddler safe. Table manners can wait and so can toilet training.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>

<a name="School"></a>
<H3>School Age</H3>

<P><B>Show interest.</B> Check homework, talk about what's happening in school, ask their friends over, and find time to see your children's teachers occasionally.</P>

<P><B> Communicate.</B> If there's a single golden rule for parents, it's this: Talk to your children (and listen, too).</P>

<P><B>Assign kid-sized chores.</B>  Kids this age love to help. Just make sure the chores fit each child's capabilities. Nothing makes a child lose interest faster than having to do something too difficult, or too easy.</P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Adolescence"></a>
<H3>Adolescence</H3>

<P><B>Refuse to get confused.</B> Part of growing up is acting like a two-year-old and an adult, all in the same day. Expect your teen to do this, and be prepared to comfort, reassure and, on occasion, look the other way.</P>

<P><B>Face the facts.</B> Your teen will probably say "I know that," when you talk about the facts of life, but do it anyway. As a parent, you're the only one who can share the values that go with the facts!</P>

<P><B>Let your affection show.</B>  Cool the physical demonstrations (especially when their friends are around), but make it loud and clear: You care!</P>

<P><B>Cut those apron strings.</B> Old values, taught from the cradle, may fade away during the teen years, but they come back - along with grownup children you'll be proud to know. Trust your teens to make it all the way. </P>

<a name="Discipline"></a>
<H3>Discipline</H3>

<P><B>Nothing</B> helps your survival as a parent more than discipline. But, to be effective, discipline must teach a child how to avoid repeating misbehaviors and what to do instead. It should also be given in doses that fit the age of the child and the size of the crime.</P>

<P>Babies are never candidates for discipline. They're too little!</P>

<P>All children react better to approval and affection!</P>

<P>Discipline only when reasonable expectations are not met. Define clearly, in advance, what you want them to do!</P>

<P>Be consistent. Whatever style of discipline you choose, use it in every situation, even in public or when the grandparents are visiting.</P>

<P>Review expectations regularly. There are no perfect children, just as there are no perfect parents. If your children are not meeting your expectations, the expectations probably need changing, not the children.</P>

<P>Shame, rejection, withdrawal of affection, or preferential treatment of one child over another have no place in discipline.</P>

Instead, these childrenengage in HOME SCHOOLING--that is, they will pursue learning at homeor elsewhere in the community.</P><P>There is no one way to do it.  One family may begin with openingceremonies to signal the start of the daily routine and follow ascheduled curriculum.  Another family may opt for child-led learning,where parents provide help as the child expresses interest in a topic. Usually parents provide supervision and help, but most childrenassume increasing responsibility for choosing and carrying outprojects as they mature.</P><P>Most families involved in home schooling organize activities withother families.  Some children spend part of their time at a localpublic or private school, or a nearby college.</P><a name=""></a><H3>What Are the Origins of Home Schooling?</H3><P>Schooling at home was a necessity in an age when there were a limitednumber of schools.  After schools became universally available, sometraditional groups, including the Seventh Day Adventists and Mormons,still elected to keep their younger school-aged children at home.  TheAmish kept their older children out of public schools, preferring totrain them through life in the community.</P><P>In the 1970s, other families opted for home schooling, despite easyaccess to schools.  In the early stages of this contemporary movement,most were pursuing a philosophy of child-led learning, as articulatedby writers and educators such as John Holt.  Later, many families withstrong religious convictions also turned to home schooling.</P><H3>How Many Children Are Home Schooled Today?</H3><P>On any given day, roughly half a million school-aged children areprobably learning outside of a school classroom.  They make up about 1percent of the total school-aged population and almost 10 percent ofthe privately schooled population.  This estimate assumes modestgrowth since the fall of 1990, when data were collected from threeindependent sources--those state education agencies (SEAs) that havedata; distributors of popular curricular packages; and memberships ofsupportive associations.  Since each source represents the tip of aniceberg, upward adjustments were made based on surveys ofhome-schooling groups (Patricia Lines 1991).</P><P>Because many children are home schooled for only a few years, thepercentage of children who reach age 18 with some home-schoolingexperience will be larger than 1 percent.   Until a well-designedhousehold survey is conducted, however, it will be extremely difficultto estimate this percentage.</P><P>To estimate the number of children engaged in home schooling withinits borders, a state could begin with its own database, if it has one,then supplement it with surveys to assess how many families filereports or other papers required of home schoolers. States cannotassume 100 percent compliance with filing requirements. If a statedoes not collect data, an assessment of families who are members ofstate and regional associations could serve as a starting point.</P><H3>Is Home Schooling Legal and Constitutional?</H3><P>Today all state compulsory-education laws explicitly make homeschooling a valid option, or the state interprets compulsoryschool-attendance laws to include "attendance" at a "school" locatedat home.  States have also liberalized requirements for the hometeacher.  For example, parents do not need teaching certificates, andonly Michigan requires the involvement of a certified teacher.  Evenin Michigan, however, court decisions have restricted the scope ofthis requirement.</P><P>With very few exceptions, all states require families to file basicinformation with either the state or local education agency (SEA orLEA).  Many states have additional requirements, such as thesubmission of a curricular plan, testing of students, or, lessfrequently, education or testing requirements for parents.</P><P>In the past two decades, some states have charged parents withviolating compulsory-education laws.  Parents have responded withlawsuits asserting a constitutional right to direct the education oftheir children.  Some courts have stricken compulsory-education lawsfor being too vague or have found that more restrictive regulationsexceeded the state education agency's statutory authority.  Othercourts have allowed prosecution of parents when their educationalprogram does not meet state requirements.</P><P>The United States Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled on homeschooling, but it did rule against compulsory school requirements inWISCONSIN V. YODER (1972), a limited decision involving the Amish. More generally, it has also upheld the right of parents to direct theeducation of their children.</P><H3>What Resources Are Available To Home Schoolers?</H3><P>Other like-minded families constitute a major resource for homeschoolers. Local support groups form whenever there are more than ahandful of families pursuing home schooling in a particular locale. There is at least one state-level association in every state, and insome states there are a dozen or more regional associations.</P><P>Other resources include libraries, museums, colleges, extensioncourses, parks departments, churches, local businesses, mentors,private schools, and, in some states, public schools. Books and othereducational materials are also important.  Many private educationalinstitutions offer curricular packages, books, and other materials foruse in home schooling.</P><P>Several states have innovative learning options.  In Alaska, teachersin Juneau work with students located all over the state, staying intouch by mail, telephone, and through occasional home visits.  InCalifornia, children can enroll in an independent-study programthrough a public school then base their studies in the home. Washington and Iowa require public schools to enroll children on apart-time basis if they apply.</P><P>Some districts have organized education centers where families mayobtain resources, find instructional support, and/or sign up forscheduled classes.  Other states or districts also allow part-timeenrollment, "shared schooling," "dual enrollment," or similar forms ofpart-time school attendance.</P><H3>How Well Do Home-Schooled Children Perform?</H3><P>People disagree on whether home schooling is advantageousacademically.  Research has not determined whether the SAME childrenwould perform better or worse in a public or private classroom, or ina home-schooling arrangement.  Analyses of test scores are available,based on data from states that require testing or from home-schoolingassociations.  Data from both sources may not be representative ofhome schoolers as a whole, however, because not all families cooperatewith state testing requirements and private efforts rely onvolunteers.  Keeping these caveats in mind, virtually all theavailable data show that the group of home-schooled children who aretested is above average. The pattern for children for whom data areavailable resembles that of children in private schools.</P><P>People also disagree about whether home schooling helps or hinders achild's social development. Children engaged in home schooling spendless time with same-aged children and more time with people ofdifferent ages.  Most spend time with other children through supportand networking groups, scouting, churches, and other associations. Many spend time with adults other than their parents through communityvolunteer work, running their own businesses, tutoring or mentoringarrangements, or other activities.</P><P>There is no conclusive research suggesting that additional time withsame-aged peers is preferable to more time with individuals of varyingages.  Limited testing of a self-selected group of home-schooledchildren suggested above-average social and psychological development.</P><H3>How Do Public Educators, Policy-Makers, and the Public View Home Schooling?</H3><P>The practice of home schooling is controversial.  The nationalParent-Teacher Association opposes the practice; in 1988, the NationalEducation Association adopted a resolution calling for more rigorousregulation of home schooling.  And the National Association ofElementary School Principals has maintained that education is "mosteffectively done through cohesive organizations in formal settings."  Since 1983, it has condemned home-schooling in its platform.</P><P>Other groups, such as the national American Civil Liberties Union,maintain that parents have a constitutional right to educate theirchildren at home.  Although they didn't necessarily approve of homeschooling, a majority of Americans responding to a Gallup pollnonetheless said parents have a right to engage in home schooling. State legislatures agree, and many have amended their laws to providegreater flexibility for home schooling.</P><P>Patricia Lines is a Senior Research Analyst with the NationalInstitute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policy-Making, andManagement, OERI.</P><P>An expanded version of this ERIC digest is available in P. Lines,"Homeschooling," in Private Education and Educational Choice, editedby James G. Cibulka Greenwood Press, forthcoming.

<P>HARRISBURG, Fa., June 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Baby bottles emblazoned with soft drink logos are among the latest fad items selling in discount and toy stores across the country. Members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association (PDA) and other health-care professionals are concerned that parents and caregivers will be encouraged to give infants soft drinks in these bottles, increasing the likelihood of baby bottle tooth decay.</P>

<P>Baby bottle tooth decay is a condition that can destroy the teeth of an infant or young child. It is the result of teeth being exposed for long periods of time to liquids containing sugars. Sugars are used by bacteria in the mouth as an energy source. In the process, the bacteria produce acids which lead to cavities over time.</P>

<P>Many sweet liquids cause these problems, including milk, formula and fruit juices. And it's not just what is in a child's bottle that causes decay, but how often and for how long. Giving a child a bottle of sweetened liquid many times a day is not a good thing. Allowing the child to fall asleep with a bottle during naps or at night can also harm the child's teeth.</P>

<P>To help keep baby bottle tooth decay from affecting your child, the FDA encourages parents and other caregivers to follow these tips:</P>
 <UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI> After each feeding, wipe the baby's gums with a clean, damp washcloth or gauze pad. Begin brushing the child's teeth when the first tooth appears. Clean and massage gums in areas that remain toothless, and begin flossing when all the baby teeth have come in.<br><br>

<LI> Never allow your child to fall asleep with a bottle containing milk, formula, fruit juice or sweetened liquids. If your child needs a comforter between regular feedings, at night, or during naps, fill a bottle with cool water or give the child a clean pacifier recommended by your dentist or physician. Never give your child a pacifier dipped in any sweet liquid and always avoid filling your child's bottle with liquids such as sugar water and soft drinks.<br><br>

<LI> If your local water supply does not contain fluoride, ask your dentist how your child should get it.<br><br>

<LI> Start dental visits by the child's first birthday. Make visits regularly. If you think your child has dental problems, take the child to the dentist as soon as possible.<br><br>
</UL>

<P>The 6,300 members of the Pennsylvania Dental Association serve the public by providing preventive and comprehensive dental care.</P>

What your child eats is very important for his or her health. Follow the nutrition guidelines below.</P>

<CENTER>
<h3>Guidelines for a Healthy Diet</h3>
</center>

<H3>0-2 Years Old:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Breast milk is the best single food for infants from birth to 6 months of age. It provides good nutrition and protects against infection. Breast feeding should be continued for at least the first year if possible.
<LI>If breast feeding is not possible or not desired, iron-enriched formula (not cow's milk) should be used during the first 12 months of life. Whole cow's milk can be used to replace formula or breast milk after 12 months of age.
<LI>Breast-fed babies, particularly if dark-skinned, who do not get regular exposure to sunlight may need to receive Vitamin D supplements.
<LI>Begin suitable solid foods at 4-6 months of age. Most experts recommend iron-enriched infant rice cereal as the first food.
<LI>Start new foods one at a time to make it easier to identify problem foods. For example, wait one week before adding each new cereal, vegetable or other food.
<LI>Use iron-rich foods, such as meats, iron-enriched cereals, and  other grains.
<LI>Do not give honey to infants during the first 6 to 12 months of life.
<LI>Do not limit fat during the first 2 years of life.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>2 Years and Older:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Provide a variety of foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
<LI>Use salt (sodium) and sugars in moderation.
<LI>Encourage a diet low in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.
<LI>Help your child maintain a healthy weight by providing proper foods and encouraging regular exercise.

<P>School reform initiatives have resulted in many changes
in American education  during the past decade.  The
complexity of the process has presented numerous 
challenges for every educator.  Juxtaposed against the
reform climate are  several other changes that have
affected American classrooms:  changing  demographics,
increasing diversity of student populations, and
limited fiscal  resources.  It is within this broad
context that the needs of our most capable  youth must be
challenged.  This digest provides a process for assuring
that the  unique needs of students who are gifted are
addressed within the context of  systemic reform. 
Several key elements guide the process:  creating belief 
statements, clarifying the issues, and designing
strategies for implementation. </P>

<a name="Creating"></a>
<H3>Creating Belief Statements</H3>

<P>Belief statements define systemic parameters as
reflected in a district's  vision statement and expected
outcomes. For example, what is believed about students
who are gifted is based on what is believed about all
learners.  Creating belief statements about all
learners is guided by the following questions: </P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>    What do we believe (about all learners)?
	<LI>     What do we know?
	<LI>    What do we want?
	<LI>       What do we do?
</OL>

<P>Processing these questions generates a set of district
or school level belief  statements, vision statements,
and expected outcomes that will affect the  entire
community.  Discussion should include educators and
parents of students who are gifted and talented as well as
other representatives from various special interests
groups.   By working individually, in small groups or as a
whole, each person generates belief statements.  The
general discussion provides an opportunity to examine
beliefs individuals hold about students who are gifted
and talented.  Through a process of narrowing down the
statements, each small group lists five most strongly
held statements.  Later, when groups combine their
statements, a list of 10 to 15 strongly held belief
statements provides an organizational profile.  A
second list of belief statements may also be generated
around the question, "What do you believe about programs
for students who are gifted/talented?"  </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Clarifying"></a>
<H3>Clarifying the Issues</H3>

<P>To understand elements of systemic change, each
educator needs to clarify the  issues.  Again, a key
question guides the process:  "As you reflect upon what 
you know about education reform, the best practices in
education, and your  experience with students who are
gifted/talented, what are the critical issues  that come
to your mind?"  Identifying the five most important
critical issues  helps narrow the topics of concern and
focus discussion.  </P>
<a href="#contents">Back to the Table of Contents</a><BR><BR>
<hr>

<a name="Designing"></a>
<H3>Designing Strategies</H3>

<P>Developing a successful relationship between education reform efforts and 
gifted education is linked to five key strategies:</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>    Analyze the language.
	<LI>    List key decision makers, stakeholders, and risk takers.
	<LI>       Infuse gifted/talented into several school policies.
	<LI>  Visualize the desired direction.
	<LI>   Enact equitable access to resources.
</OL>

<P>The acronym "ALIVE" means that each strategy incorporates valuable information 
gleaned in one of the other strategies and does not function in isolation.</P>

<P>"Analyze the language" refers to interpreting what is
really being said.  For  example, the concept of
inclusionary programs sounds very altruistic, but
might  mean "inclusion of special education students
only" in the regular school  setting.  In this example,
students such as those being served by Chapter 1 
programs, gifted programs, or English as a Second
Language (ESL) programs may  continue to be excluded from
inclusive schools because the terminology has  multiple
meanings.  </P>

<P>Language in vision statements, district policies, and
expected outcomes can  also be used to benefit students
who are gifted.  The following statement of purpose uses
several helpful words and phrases:  "The purpose of the
British Columbia school system is to enable learners to
develop their individual potential and to acquire the
knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to contribute
to a healthy society and a prosperous and sustainable
economy" (Ministry of Education, 1991).  Words like
"individual," "each," and "potential" are inviting. 
Collective words such as "all," "they" and "everyone"
can be misleading.  Finding terms that are links to
systemic parameters is crucial to embedding special
services in policy, linking a school system with the
community, and developing a shared vision.  </P>

<P>"List key decision makers, stakeholders, and risk
takers" means identifying  individuals and groups who
are strategic influencers.  The people most affected  by
school system changes need to be included in discussions
from the beginning.  The number of persons needs to be
manageable.  The group should represent a  broad range of
constituencies, including students, parents,
teachers,  administrators, and members of the
community.  When choosing community members,  keep in
mind that key individuals who have credibility with and
the respect of  their colleagues will influence support
for change. </P>

<P>"Infuse gifted/talented into several school policies"
implies that well-written  local district policies
provide a basis for developing quality program services 
for all students, including those who are gifted. 
Although services for  students who are gifted need to be
defined in a specific program policy, they  should also be
interspersed throughout broader policy statements on
curriculum,  instruction, counseling, special
populations, parent involvement, and staff 
development.   </P>

<P>The following excerpt from a local district policy
statement reflects that  community's beliefs and
priority for programming:  "Challenge their multiple 
intelligences and engage students with diverse
linguistic and cultural  backgrounds."  This example
depicts a connectedness to the whole district and 
supports the district's need to address "multiple
intelligences" and "diverse  linguistic and cultural
backgrounds" of all students.  Thus, infusing services 
that meet the needs of students who are gifted/talented
into local policy  statements can work two ways. </P>

<P>"Visualize the desired direction" means that within the
context of the total  school system, design a clearly
stated and concise framework for delivering  services to
students who are gifted.  Such a design should challenge
the future  and illustrate not only a relationship of such
services to the total system,  but also provide
accountability for a continuum of services from
kindergarten  through 12th grade.  </P>

<P>"Enact equitable access to resources" means using the
first four strategies to  build equitable access to
resources in a defensible manner.  The notion that  the
"squeaky wheel gets the grease" is often true because
special interest groups have gained an audience and
power.  Comprehensive quality services to students are not developed by squeaky wheels, but instead are the
result of well planned efforts reflecting the beliefs
and commitments of several constituencies.  Equitable
access to resources also implies that resources are
based on the needs of students and not solely on the needs
of teachers or administrators.</P>

<P>By using these five key strategies, a healthy
relationship with the different  education reform
efforts becomes possible.  Each education reform
strategy can  be accepted by educators of the gifted as an
opportunity rather than a barrier. </P>

<P> A Gifted Leadership Conference in the state of
Washington demonstrated one way  that using this process
can generate strategies for blending gifted education 
and school reform.  Participants identified eight
education reform efforts  affecting services to highly
capable students.  The resulting product, created  by the
41 participants, was entitled:  "The Reform Movement:
Where Do Gifted  Students Fit?"  (Fascilla, Hanninen, &amp;
Spritzer,, 1991). The following reform  strategies,
excerpted from the original publication, illustrate
how bridges in  thinking can be built between education
reform and gifted education.</P>

<a name="Grouping"></a>
<H3>Grouping Strategies for Success with Gifted Students</H3>

<P>Six guidelines to use when considering grouping options (Rogers, 1991): </P>
<OL Type=1 Start="1">
<LI>      Students who are academically or intellectually gifted and talented
        should spend the majority of their school day with others of similar 
        abilities and interests.<BR><BR>

<LI>      Cluster grouping of students within an otherwise heterogeneously 
        grouped classroom can be considered when schools cannot support a
        full-time gifted program.<BR><BR>

<LI>      In the absence of full-time gifted program enrollment, students might
        be offered specific group instruction across grade levels, according 
        to their individual knowledge acquisition in school subjects.<BR><BR>

<LI>       Gifted students should be given experiences involving a variety of 
        appropriate acceleration-based options, which may be offered to gifted 
        students as a group or on an individual basis.<BR><BR>

<LI>      Students should be given experiences which involve various forms of 
        enrichment that extend the regular school curriculum, leading to the 
        more complete development of concepts, principles, and generalizations.<BR><BR>

<LI>       Mixed-ability cooperative learning groups should be used sparingly, 
        perhaps only for social skills development programs.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Outcomes-Based Education: Strategies for Success with Gifted Learners</P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>   Maintain programs for gifted until acceptable options are available, that is, acceleration, self-contained classes, or advanced classes.<BR><BR>
	<LI>   Educate all staff so that they are able to identify and provide 
        appropriate curriculum for gifted students.<BR><BR>
	<LI>    Pretest before initial instruction, and provide gifted students credit for prior learning.<BR><BR>
	<LI>     Provide an enriched curriculum for all students and acceleration 
	        and/or in-depth study for gifted students.<BR><BR>
	<LI>    Ensure opportunities for flexibility in scheduling so that students
	       can be appropriately grouped and regrouped.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Provide gifted students the opportunity to work with their academic 
	        or intellectual peers/mentors.<BR><BR>
	<LI>     Match new learning experiences that capitalize on the students' 
	     strengths and interests to the expected student outcomes, and provide 
	        appropriate assessment options.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Match the curriculum to the student's learning rate.<BR><BR>
	<LI>      Eliminate the ceiling on learning (i.e., if a student is ready to 
	       learn algebra in 5th grade, the system must not only permit it, it
	       should support it).<BR><BR>
	<LI>    Extend the depth and breadth of the lessons.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Within each education reform strategy, ideas were
presented that respect the  integrity of the research and
assure appropriate learning opportunities for 
students who are gifted. </P>

<P>All students in our schools, including those who are
gifted, deserve the best  education we are capable of
providing.  On the one hand, education reform  efforts
reflect those approaches deemed necessary to
accomplish that goal.  On  the other hand, gifted
education has frequently been perceived as being the 
best in education provided only for "the best."  If the aim
of education reform is that all students should
experience "gifted teaching," then the expertise and
support of educators of the gifted should be a part of
those efforts.  Concurrently, all educators need to
acknowledge that "gifted teaching" does not 
necessarily mean effectively "teaching the gifted." 
Knowing the difference  depends upon understanding the
nature of a student's gifts and talents.  It  also means
placing greater value on each student's strengths.</P>

<P>The keys to successful education reform for students who
are gifted results in  educators and parents who can
continually: </P>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI> Evaluate the effectiveness of the education reform strategies used 
       in their districts.<BR><BR>
	<LI>     Review the quality and clarify the relationship of educational 
       services for students who are gifted.<BR><BR>
	<LI>    Understand the complexity of the "big picture" as different education
        reform strategies are institutionalized in schools and beliefs about 
	        services for students who are gifted are incorporated.<BR><BR>
</OL>

<P>Education reform is an opportunity for professionals in
gifted education to  recognize what works, what does not
work, where "hitchhiking" on the ideas of  others is wise,
and to understand the changes that are needed to assure 
excellence in learning and character development.  An
inevitable outcome will  be better schools for all
students.</P>

<P>Although parents and teachers may be concerned about academic planning
for gifted and talented young people, they often assume that career
planning will take care of itself.  Students may have many choices
available because of multiple gifts or a particular talent, and a career
choice in that area seems inevitable. There is no need for career planning:
The student is simply expected to make an occupational decision around
the sophomore year of college and then follow through on the steps
necessary to attain that goal.</P>
<P>        Unfortunately, evidence is mounting that youthful brilliance in one
or more areas does not always translate into adult satisfaction and
accomplishment in working life.  Studies with such diverse groups as
National Merit Scholars (Watley, 1969), Presidential Scholars (Kaufmann,
1981), and graduates of gifted education programs (Kerr, 1985) have
shown that the path from education to career is not always smooth, and it
may be complicated by social-emotional problems and needs of gifted
students that differ from those of more typical students.</P>
<P>        Recognition of these problems has produced counseling models that
address student needs (e.g., Berger, 1989; Buescher, 1987; Silverman,
1989; VanTassel-Baska, 1990).  Some factors that can contribute to
problems with career planning are presented here, along with ways of
preventing and intervening with career development problems.</P>
<HR>

<a name="Multipotentiality"></a>
<H3>Multipotentiality</H3>
<P>Multipotentiality is the ability to select and develop any number of career
options because of a wide variety of interests, aptitudes, and abilities
(Frederickson &amp; Rothney, 1972).  The broad range of opportunities
available tends to increase the complexity of decision making and goal
setting, and it may actually delay career selection.  Multipotentiality is
most commonly a concern of students with moderately high IQs (120-140),
those who are academically talented, and those who have two or more
outstanding but very different abilities such as violin virtuosity and
mathematics precocity.  Signs that multipotentiality is a concern include
the following:</P>

<P>       <B> Elementary school: </B> Despite excellent performance in many
or all
school subjects, students may have difficulty making decisions, particularly
when they are asked to make a choice on topics or projects from among
many options.  Multiple hobbies with only brief periods of enthusiasm and
difficulty in finishing up and following through on tasks (even those which
are enjoyable) are additional signs for concern.</P>
<P>        <B>Junior high:</B>  Despite continued excellence in many or all
school
subjects, difficulty with decision making and follow-through continue.
Students may participate in multiple social and recreational activities with
no clear preferences, and they may overschedule, leaving few free periods
and little time to just think.</P>
<P>        <B>Senior high:</B>  Decision-making problems generalize to
academic and
career decisions, resulting in overly packed class schedules and highly
diverse participation in school activities.  Students often accept leadership
of a wide variety of groups in school, religious activities, and community
organizations.  Adults may notice occasional signs of stress and exhaustion
(absences, frequent or chronic illness, periods of depression or anxiety,
etc.), or they may see evidence of delay or vacillation about college
planning and decision making.  Students are able to maintain high grades
in most or all courses taken.  An important clue to continuing
multipotentiality is the student's vocational interest test profiles.  These
tests often show interests and similarities to an unusually large number of
occupations. </P>
<P>        <B>College:</B>  Multipotential students often have multiple
academic
majors.  Three or more changes of college major are not unusual for an
individual who cannot set long-term goals.  They continue intense
participation in extracurricular activities and have outstanding academic
performance but are concerned about selecting a career.  They may make
hasty, arbitrary, or "going-along-with-the-crowd" career choices.  They
may encounter the dilemma of opportunities lost in giving up some
interests in favor of others. </P>
<P>        <B>Adulthood:</B>  Some of the implications of multipotentiality
can be seen
in bright adults who, despite excellent performance in most jobs, hold
multiple positions in short time periods and experience a general feeling of
lack of fit in most jobs.  Some experience feelings of alienation,
purposelessness, depression, and apathy despite high performance and
excellent evaluations.  Some experience periods of unemployment and
underemployment, or they fall behind same-age peers in career progress
and sometimes social development (marriage, family, community
involvement).</P>

<P>        Possible intervention strategies for multipotentiality at different
educational levels include the following:</P>

<B>Elementary School</B>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>       Provide realistic exposure to the world of work through parent
	sharing and exposure to parents' working places.

achievement of
	Scout merit badges, which require goal setting and follow-through.
	<LI>       Use biographies of eminent people as primary career education
	material.
	<LI>       As teachers or parents, carefully evaluate skills, talents, and
interests in order to help children understand possible areas of greatest
interest.

<a name="Early"></a>
<H3>Early Emergence</H3>
<P>Early emergers (Marshall, 1981) are children who have extremely focused
career interests.  A passion for an idea and an early commitment to a
career area are common childhood characteristics of eminent individuals in
a wide variety of professions (Bloom, 1985; Kerr, 1985); thus, early
emergence should not be thought of as a problem of career development,
but rather as an opportunity that may be acted upon, neglected, or,
unfortunately, sometimes destroyed.  Acting upon early emergence means
noticing an unusually strong talent or enthusiasm, providing training in
skills necessary to exercise that talent, providing resources, and keeping an
open mind about the future of the talent or interest.  Neglecting early
emergence means overlooking the talent or interest or failing to provide
education and resources.  Destroying the early emerger's passion may not
be easy, but belittling the talent or interest ("Who cares about someone
who doodles and draws all the time instead of listening?"  "What makes
you think you can become an anthropologist?") may easily extinguish the
flame.  Insisting on well-roundedness or disallowing needed training (e.g.,
refusing to allow a mathematically precocious child to accelerate in math)
may diminish the passion.  Overly enthusiastic encouragement and
pressure may also remove the intrinsic pleasure the child feels in the
interest or talent area.</P>
<P>        As with multipotentiality, there are signs of early emergence:</P>
<P><B>Elementary school:</B>  Avid interest in one school subject or
activity with
only general liking for other subjects and activities and extraordinary
talent in one area and average or above average performance in others are
underlying signs of early emergence.  (These students may be mistakenly
labeled as underachievers).  Students may also try to write more papers
than required,  choose too many subjects in the area of interest, and
mention early career fantasies about success and fame in a particular area
of interest.</P>

<P>        <B>Junior high: </B> Students continue highly focused interests
and may
express a strong desire for advanced training in an area of talent and
interest.  Development of adolescent social interests may be delayed
because of a commitment to work in a talent area or because of rejection
by others, yet performance in the talent area grows, while performance in
other areas diminishes.</P>
<P>        <B>Senior high: </B> Students may develop a strong  identity in
the talent
area (the "computer whiz," "artist," or "fix-it person," for example).  They
may express a desire for help with planning a career in an area of interest.
A desire to test skill in competition with or in concert with peers in the
chosen talent area and continued high performance in the talent area to a
degree that causes neglect of other school subjects or social activities are
additional signs of a focused interest and passion.</P>
<P>       <B> College students and young adults:</B>  These young people
make an
early, but not hasty or arbitrary, choice of career or major.  They often
show a desire for completion of a training period in order to "get on with
work,"  seek out mentors, continue intense focus, and often neglect social
and extracurricular activities.</P>
<P>        <B>Adulthood:</B>  Adults may continue their intense focus,
desire eminence
or excellence in the talent area, and possibly forego or delay other aspects
of adult development such as marriage, nurturing of a younger generation,
social and community involvement, and personal development.</P>

<P>Possible intervention strategies for early emergers at different educational
levels include the following:</P>

<P><B>Elementary School</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>       Provide for early identification of unusual talent or area of
precocity.
	<LI>       Consult with experts on the nature and nurture of particular
gifts or
	talents.
	<LI>       Consult with the school on ways of nurturing the talent or gift.
	<LI>       Encourage fantasies through reading of bibliographies and
playing of
	work roles.
	<LI>       Provide opportunities to learn about eminent people in the talent
	area (attend a concert; visit an inventor's workshop; attend a math
	professor's class).
	<LI>       Relate necessary basic skills to the area of interest.
	<LI>       Provide opportunities to socialize with children with similar,
intense
	interests through such activities as music camps, computer camps, and
	Junior Great Books.
	<LI>       Strike a careful balance between encouragement and laissez-faire;

provide support for the strong interest along with freedom to change
direction.  Do not become so invested in the child's talent or interest that
you fail to notice that the child has changed interests.  (Early emergers
most often change to a closely related interest; that is, they switch musical
instruments or transfer an interest in mathematics to an interest in
theoretical physics).
</UL>
<P><B>Junior High</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>      Provide support and encouragement during the intensive training
	that often begins at this point.
	<LI>      Allow for plenty of time alone.
	<LI>       Seek opportunities for job "shadowing" (following a professional
	throughout the working day) in area of interest.
	<LI>       Seek opportunities for light volunteer work in area of interest.
	<LI>       Avoid pressuring the student into social activities.
</UL>

<P><B>Senior High</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>       Continue support, encouragement, and time alone.
	<LI>       Seek opportunities for internships and work experiences in the
areas
	of interest (internship on archaeological dig; job as camp counselor at a fine
	arts camp; coaching younger people in musical or athletic skill).
	<LI>       Seek career guidance from a guidance counselor who is familiar with
	the talent area or from a professional in that field.
	<LI>       Make a detailed plan of training and education leading toward the
	chosen career goal, including financial arrangements.
	<LI>       Explore higher education or postsecondary training early and
	thoroughly, with contacts and visits.
	<LI>       Help the student establish a relationship with a mentor in the
area of
interest.  Early emergers often fare better in a less prestigious institution
where they have access to an enthusiastic mentor than in an Ivy League or
high status institution where they do not.
</UL>
<P><B>College Students and Young Adults</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>       Help provide support for extended education and training.
	<LI>       Encourage the development of knowledge of career ladders in the
	area of interest (auditions, gallery shows, inventor's conventions, etc.).
	<LI>       Encourage a continuing relationship with a career counseling or

guidance professional for support in decision making and problem solving.
</UL>
<P>        The career development problems discussed here are nearly opposite
one another:  The multipotential student seems unfocused, delaying, and
indecisive, whereas the early emerger is focused, driven, and almost too
decisive.  Both types carry with them dangers and opportunities. Skillful
career education and guidance can help ensure that neither
multipotentiality nor early emergence leads to difficulty in career planning
and development.</P>

<a name="Career"></a>
<H3>Career Planning For Special Populations</H3>
<P><B>Minority Gifted Students</B></P>
<P>Minority gifted students have special career planning needs as well as
needs related to multipotentiality or early emergence.  Minority students
from Black, Hispanic, and American Indian backgrounds are less likely to
have been selected for gifted education programs and less likely to
perform well on standardized achievement tests than their nonminority
peers.  In addition, they may have lower career aspirations because of
lower societal expectations.  Nevertheless, the patterns of leadership and
out-of-class accomplishments of gifted minority students are very similar
to those of nonminority gifted students (Kerr, Colangelo, Maxey, &amp;
Christensen, 1989).  Minority gifted students are active leaders in other
communities.  Therefore, career counseling for these students may be most
effective when it focuses on raising career aspirations and emphasizes out-
of-class accomplishments as indicators of possible career directions.  Career
planning must also go hand in hand with building a strong ethnic identity
if later conflict between ethnic identity and achievement in majority
society is to be avoided.  Colangelo and LaFrenz (1981) have provided
suggestions for how this can be accomplished.</P>

<P><B>Gifted Girls and Women</B></P>
<P>Persisting sex role stereotypes and the continued socialization of girls for
secondary roles means that, despite great gains in certain fields such as
medicine and law, gifted girls are less likely than gifted boys to achieve
their full potential.  Although gifted girls outperform gifted boys in terms
of grades, gifted boys achieve higher scores on college admissions
examinations.  Compared to gifted boys, gifted girls are underprepared
academically, having taken fewer mathematics and science courses and
less challenging courses in social studies.  As a result, they have fewer
options for college majors and career goals (Kerr, 1985).  Bright women
apparently let go of career aspirations gradually, first through
underpreparation and later through decisions that may put the needs of
husbands and families before their own.  Gifted women fall behind gifted
men in salary, status, and promotions throughout their working lives.</P>
<P>        In order to ensure that gifted girls have the greatest possible
chance
to fulfill their potential, career planning should emphasize rigorous
academic preparation, particularly in mathematics and science;
maintaining high career aspirations; and identifying both internal and
external barriers to the achievement of career goals.  Many suggestions for
career planning for gifted girls are provided in SMART GIRLS, GIFTED WOMEN
(Kerr, 1985).</P>
