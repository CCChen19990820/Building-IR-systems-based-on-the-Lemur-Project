<Font size=5>INTRODUCTION</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P> 
<Font size=3><B>By DAVID ROBIE</B><P>
TWENTY FIVE years ago in Melbourne I encountered a young cartoonist with a flair and panache that was remarkable. His name is Michael Leunig. At the time I was editor of the <I>Sunday Observer</I> and I felt Michael was destined for an astounding future. His distinctive whimsical and poetic style -- Barry Humphries once described it as 'murky, melancholy and marvellous' -- eventually took him to the top of Australian cartooning. His socially aware messages and his characteristic flippant duck were a remarkable antidote to the humourless puritans of the era. He once drew me a galivanting duck balancing a teapot on its head as I left Melbourne for greener pastures. 
<P>
Now I have encountered another cartoonist, this time from the Solomon Islands, who has also impressed me. And in an environment where cartoonists are rare and an endangered species. Campion Ohasio, who joined our journalism course in 1993 as a young 22-year-old from Nariekeara village in South Malaita, was deceptively quiet at first. But his trenchant abilities with the pen soon became apparent -- in spite of the fact that he has never had formal art lessons. Compared with the subtleties of a Leunig, Ohasio has a certain rawness in his style. But his directness is refreshing in Island societies that are often culturally reluctant to get to the point, let alone be brutally honest.
<P>
At first Campion Ohasio, encouraged by senior <I>Post-Courier</I> journalist Leigh Martin who was at the time tutoring journalism students on <I>Uni Tavur</I>, contented himself with local issues on campus at the University of Papua New Guinea. The issues were plentiful and painful, and Ohasio treated them robustly. But by the end of 1993, he was restless for more challenges and I persuaded him to tackle national issues. And before the end of the following year, Ohasio was also making his mark with regional issue cartoons. He developed a 'Class of 93' strip, featuring Tome and his dog friend, Spotty. 'The experience,' he says, 'has been one of most rewarding things that have happened to me as an overseas student studing and living in PNG.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/campion.gif" ALT="Photograph of Campion Ohasion" WIDTH=200 BORDER=2><B><P>Campion Ohasio ... robust cartoon style.</B><BR><Font size=1>Photo: David Robie<Font size=3><P>
Before cartooning for <I>Uni Tavur</I>, he had been doing some editorial cartoons for the <I>Solomons Voice</I>, one of the weekly newspapers in Honiara where he worked in 1992 as a graphic artist and reporter. 'I had limited knowledge about what cartooning is really all about,' Ohasio admits. 'I like reading cartoons and I usually wonder how cartoonists think up ideas fast to meet deadlines -- especially on the daily papers.'
<P>
<I>The Independent's</I> Jada Wilson and the popular 'Grassroots' strip creator, Bob Browne, now a lecturer at the university's Creative Arts Faculty, have influenced Ohasio, yet he has been developing his own irreverent style. Environmental and logging cartoons, along with land rights and French nuclear tests, have often been at the forefront of his work. 
 <P> 
'Cartoonists probably are the only artists in the world who are expected to come up with a creation every day, or week depending on which media organisation they are attached to,' says Ohasio. 'In my case it has been every two weeks.  It is definitely not an easy job -- but a country such as PNG, or in Melanesia, or even in the wider South Pacific context, there are more things going wrong than right. A perfect setting for a cartoonist.  As Sudhir Tailang, one of India's rising cartoonists, says: "Cartooning is an art of dissent, of protest. Cartoonists look for negative things and find plenty of them.  There's no place for a cartoonist in utopia." '
<P>
I have to admit there were frustrations at times, as is often the case with people with creative abilities. Campion Ohasio's definition of editorial deadlines was unnerving, even by 'Pacific time' standards. Many were the times when we were about to go to press with me tearing my hair out (or, at least, what I have left) trying to find 'Campi'. But he would always turn up just in the nick of time and with the cartoon theme spot on to the issue at hand. Once I had literally given up after sending out our 'press gang' to locate Campion. In fact, I had made arrangements to reprint an earlier cartoon. However, as I walked out my office door to leave for the <I>Post-Courier</I>, the Pacific’s largest daily, which prints <I>Uni Tavur</I>,  Ohasio arrived breathless -- and with a scathing cartoon about Ok Tedi mine, our front page lead.
<P>
But in the end it was always a pleasure to have 'Campion’s Comment' and another instalment in the Class of 93 ... or 94 ... or 95 ... in print.
<P>
Campion Ohasio is the third-born of a family of six children. Throughout his schooling he never had art lessons. However, his artistic talents and motivation steered him towards his ambitious dream. During secondary schooling at St Joseph's, Tenaru, he never had any art lessons yet his work was soon recognised by staff.
<P>
He was given the job of illustrating the school magazine. In 1986, he won a cultural exchange opportunity to visit museums and art galleries in Brisbane and Canberra. Two years later he made another visit to Australia for the World Expo exhibition in Brisbane. In 1989, he sought a scholarship for an art school but his requests fell on deaf ears.
<P>
Ohasio ended up studying journalism at the University of Papua New Guinea in 1991 -- the year the campus was closed for a semester because of student protests over a controversial pay rise for MPs. Why didn't he get a chance on a creative art course? The Solomon Islands Government apparently only provides scholarships for economics, accounting and science students. Unfair, says Ohasio. But, as he points out to other students, 'You don't have to go on an arts course to become an artist -- you just have to look and learn.'
<P>
When he was profiled for <I>Uni Tavur</I>  by a Milne Bay journalism student colleague, Rex Matthew (who tragically died aged 22 in May 1995 from kidney failure), Ohasio said he was keen to set up his own comics company in the Solomon Islands. A leaf out of Bob Browne’s Grassroots comics books. 'After all, my journalism experience would be of great help to me when I start the comic company,' he said.
<P>
The day before Ohasio left for Honiara, he showed me the roughs for his new strip character, Toka. I guess Toma and Spotty will be taking a back seat these days. And our readers will miss them in <I>Uni Tavur</I>.
<P>
But as Conman -- the real one, our 'stroppy' columnist  -- would say: NOKEN WARI. CAMPION WILL BE BACK. LUKIM YU.

<Font size=5>3 THE REGION</F5><P>
<Font size=4>A selection of the 40 cartoons.</F4><P><IMG SRC="../../images/forest.gif" ALT="Logging cartoon" WIDTH=400> 
<P>
<Font size=3><B>38. Uni Tavur, 15 September 1995: </B><BR>
 Logging abuses are a serious problem in Melanesia.  Like a huge cigar, Asian logging companies are smoking away tonnes of our forests every year.  We live from the forests. Like the family in the cartoon reveals, what would life be like without our forests?  Groups such as the non-government organisations are trying very hard to put out this fire -- or at least limit it to a sustainable rate.  Ironically, it is the 'responsible' governments of our Melanesian countries that promote this rapacious practice. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/oktedi.gif" ALT="Ok Tedi cartoon" WIDTH=400> 
<P><B>39. Uni Tavur, 29 September 1995: </B><BR>
 The Ok Tedi landowners had filed a lawsuit against the giant Australian mining company BHP in its headquarters city of Melbourne seeking up to K3.7 billion in compensation for the alleged destruction of their environment. BHP retaliated with support from the PNG Government which passed new legislation to prevent the landowners from winning their demands. Don't we learn from experience? Just imagine another Bougainville and the effect it would have on the country. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/campus.gif" ALT="Campus cartoon" WIDTH=400> 
<P><B>40. Uni Tavur, 13 October 1995:</B><BR>
Once upon a time the University of Papua New Guinea was a safe place to live and study.  Not any more!  In recent years the university campus at Waigani has been rundown with many criminal activities.  During 1995, two lecturers and two students were murdered in separate incidents. It has been going on for so long that no one wants to be held responsible. University authorities just point the finger at each other. When this collection of cartoons ended, little had been done to deal with the problem.
<BR>
<B>Postscript: </B>And, by the way, our newspaper <I>Uni Tavur</I> won the 'best print publication' award in the <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/UniTavur/UniT_496_Prize.html">1995 JEA Ossie Awards.</A> We gained this honour against publications at more than 22 universities in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific that run journalism schools or programs with ties to the Journalism Education Association.

<UL><LI><B><A HREF="95times.html">THE TIMES OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA: AN <BR>INVESTIGATIVE TRADITION</A></B><BR>
<I>By Harlyne Joku</I><BR>
In May 1995, one of the Pacific's best known newspapers closed. A regional magazine summed up <I>The Times of Papua New Guinea</I>   thus: <I>Strength:</I>   the diversity of views and efforts to cover national life full. <I>Weakness:</I>   Loss of skilled journalists that it develops to organisations like the <I>Post-Courier.</I>

<P>
<LI><B>SELF-CENSORSHIP: THE MOST INSIDIOUS GAG</B><BR>
<I>By Peter Cronau</I><BR>
Journalists feel the pressures to conform to the accepted values of their workplace. But those pressures come not just from editors and producers above them, but significantly from the journalist's peers -- their fellow journalists.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="95invest.html"><B>INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IN MELANESIA: IS IT NEEDED?</B></A><BR>
<I>By Walter Nalangu</I><BR>
Some argue there is no place for investigative journalism in Melanesia, particularly in Papua New Guinea. Such critics believe that for investigations to be effective then politicians must make changes. A media panel at a UNESCO-funded seminar at the University of Papua New Guinea debates these issues.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="95sbs.html"><B>PNG: UNDER THE SPELL</B></A><BR>
<I>By Helen Vatsikopoulis</I><BR>
Corruption and law and order problems beset Papua New Guinea in its 20th year of independence. Says the former Governor of the Central Bank, Sir Mekere Morauta: 'This nation is under the spell of the statement that we are rich. So our riches will deliver us from the evils, from our own evils. They didn't. Where are we now?'
<P>
<LI><B>OPEN SEASON FOR SNIPES</B><BR>
<I>By James Pinder</I><BR>
'For 365 days a year, the media cop it from our pollies. But the overseas press are employed to report on the country and its goings on -- not the whims of our politicians, who, whenever they make a boo-boo, claim they are misreported.'
<P>
<LI><B>ATTACKS ON THE PRESS</B><BR>
<I>By David Robie</I><BR>
A record 173 journalists were held in prison at the end of 1994 and 72 journalists were killed in the line of duty -- eight more than the previous year. Pacific cases have been cited in monitoring of news media abuses.
<P>
<LI><B>TIME TO LIGHT UP THE NBC AIRWAVES</B><BR>
<I>By Ian Boden</I><BR>
'The [Papua New Guinea] National Broadcasting Commission is a shadow of its former self. The provincial Kundu service, following years of neglect, has become an unproductive shambles. The flagship Karai service has a weak signal. And the cash cow Kalang has contributed little.'
<P>
<LI><B>INTERNATIONAL NEWS FLOW COOPERATIVE STUDY</B><BR>
<I>By Sorariba Nash</I><BR>
A media cooperative study of foreign news and international news flow in the 1990s is under way. The objective is to define a New World (Dis)order geography of news gathering. Papua New Guinea and other Pacific nations are involved.
<P>
<LI><B><A HREF="95copyright.html">THE COPYRIGHT LAW AND PNG</A></B><BR>
<I>By Professor John Nonggorr</I><BR>
'Papua New Guineans would not be impressed by fancy arguments advanced elsewhere -- that it is immoral to copy somebody else's work and that a country should adopt copyright laws to enhance its international standing.'
<P>
<LI><B>THE DEATH PENALTY: A FLAWED DEBATE</B><BR>
<I>By William Ferea</I><BR>
Media debate on the controversy over capital punishment in Papua New Guinea has been emotional. But the arguments have been flawed and distorted.
<P>
<LI><B>DILEMMA FOR  FIJI MEDIA AND THE CONSTITUTION</B><BR>
<I>By Philip Cass</I><BR>
Fiji prides itself on being at the crossroads of the Pacific and yet the rest of the great ocean remains almost invisible to the Fijian press, to whom the world consists of floods in India, stock prices in Australia and OJ in the US.
<P>
<LI><B>BLEAK MEDIA SCENARIOS CONFRONT VANUATU</B><BR>
<I>By Kiery Manassah</I><BR>
Lack of qualified and experienced journalists, a tendency to allow censorship and disregard for the notion of publicly funded broadcasting services belonging to the public hamper freedom of information.
<P>
PINA 1995 CONVENTION IN PNG:<BR>
<LI><B>1 SERVING TRUTH WITH DEVELOPMENT NEWS</B><BR>
<I>By Sir Julius Chan</I><BR>
Flawed journalism has sullied Papua New Guinea's good name and built up an unfortunate but valid distrust of the media. The country and its problems have been the victim of shallow journalists unable to look past the bad.
<P>
<LI><B>2 <A HREF="95maino.html">PEOPLE, NEWS AND GOVERNMENT</A></B><BR>
<I>By Sir Charles Maino</I><BR>
Like all rights and freedoms, freedom of the press sometimes gets a rough handling by various authorities and governments throughout the world. In the Pacific, the right must be preserved for the interest of the people.
<P>
<LI><B>3 A BLURRED AND DISTORTED VIEW OF PNG</B><BR>
<I>By Gabriel Dusava</I><BR>
Some 'mischievous' news media do not present a full portrait based on real life in Papua New Guinea but a caricature -- without the humour of a cartoon -- which too often misses the point.
<P>
<LI><B>4 <A HREF="95vision.html">SHARE THE WHOLE VISION, GOOD NEWS AND BAD</A></B><BR>
<I>By David Robie</I><BR>
Image-massagers sprucing up Pacific government images aren't enough. While issues such as the raskol problem, land disputes and Bougainville remain unresolved, there will continue to be a 'bad press'.
<P>
<LI><B>5 REGIONAL CONFLICTS: GETTING BOTH SIDES</B><BR>
<I>By Sorariba Nash</I><BR>
How well has the mass media in the South Pacific fared covering military, social and political conflicts in the region -- such as Bougainville? What are the problems encountered by journalists covering such disputes?
<P>
<LI><B>6 PACIFIC MEDIA AWARDS</B><BR>
PINA Pacific Media Award winners at the 1995 convention.
<P>
<LI><B>7 NOW THE NEGATIVE NEWS FROM PARADISE</B><BR>
<I>By Kunda Dixit</I><BR>
Pacific countries are increasingly sensitive about media coverage. Singled out for special scrutiny and criticism are the Australian and New Zealand media, which specialise in the region. An Asian perspective.
<P>
PROFILES IN MEDIA<BR>
<LI><B>Wendy Bacon: A BULLET AND AN ORCHID</B><BR>
<I>By Sophie Kuasi</I><BR>
Wendy Bacon, a winner of the Walkley Award, exposed corrupt activities by some New South Wales police officers and also foreigners implicated in the Fiji coups. Now an academic, Associate Professor Bacon assisted University of PNG's new investigative journalism course.
<P>
<LI><B>Neville Togarewa: A SCOOP IN THE JUNGLE</B><BR>
<I>By Nimo Kama</I><BR>
From his observation and association with the three newspaper companies, Neville Togarewa believes in investigative journalism is mostly lacking in Papua New Guinea. However, it is demanding. It involves courages as well as resources.
<P>
<LI><B>Abby Yadi: FROM FISH TO BUSINESS</B><BR>
<I>By Sophie Kuasi</I><BR>
Abby Yadi once had his name written on a bullet after taking an inside photograph of a Defence Force helicopter which was published on the front page of the <I>Post-Courier</I>.   His family was also threatened during the Bougainville crisis.
<P>
<LI><A HREF="95rainbow.html"><B>A PHOTOGRAPHER'S DATE WITH A NUCLEAR DEATH</A> *Photos</B><BR>
<I>By David Robie</I><BR>
President Jacques Chirac's controversial final round of nuclear tests at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in 1995 unleashed an unprecedented storm of international protest. And dilemmas for journalists covering the riots in Papeete and the junkets by French authorities. The Vanuatu government banned news reports on protests. A journalist on board the original environmental campaign ship <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   -- bombed by French secret agents a decade ago -- recalls the events. He was later arrested by the French military.
<P>
<LI><B>CAT-AND-MOUSE OVER THE FRENCH NUKES</B><BR>
<I>By Ekonia Peni</I><BR>
French nuclear tests and the controversial draft Pacific logging code of practice drew most of the media coverage at the Madang South Pacific Forum meeting. But logging was almost brushed aside by the host country.</UL>

As with everything else in Papua New Guinea, the media work force is male-dominated. However, this pattern is now changing with many more women making a career in communication and gradually moving into middle and senior management.<P>

<I>By Deborah Richards</I><BR>
When the ABC <I>Four Corners</I>  program 'Bush Bugarup' was shown in May 1994, it stirred a contriversy in Papua New Guinea and headlines in the press. But it wasn't mentioned by the Rimbunan Hijau-owned <I>National</I>. This is an edited extract from the script, published for the first time.<P>

<h4>Vol 3 No 2, November 1996</H4><P>
<Font size=5>PACIFIC INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM AWARD: <BR>
WHAT THE JUDGES SAID<P>
<Font size=4>Sponsored by  the South Pacific Centre for Communication  and Information in Development (SPCenCIID), the inaugural Pacific Investigative Journalism Award has been established to promote higher standards in investigative reporting and to foster good relationships between journalists.
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By the judges, WENDY BACON, PETER CRONAU and DAVID McKNIGHT</B>
<P>
INVESTIGATIVE journalism is alive and well in the Pacific news media. The quality and breadth of reporting taking place in the South Pacific region is reflected in the high standard of stories entered in the first Pacific Investigative Journalism Award. Pressures for economic reform, development and democratisation are creating societies in change, providing a feast of potential issues needing in-depth reporting to the public. Stories that reinforce the public's right to be informed; stories that investigate hard-to-get facts and give the public a new perspective on events and issues; stories that carry a wealth of detail about how the society works are the stories that uphold the finest traditions of investigative journalism.
<P>
The judges found that all the eligible stories entered in the award, displayed the Pacific media's awareness of the importance of the watchdog role that the media has over society. In refining the criteria -- 'an investigative report that has made a significant contribution to Pacific regional public awareness, or changed the public agenda in an individual Pacific nation over an important issue' -- for judging the award, the judges examined the stories using three categories:
<P><UL>
<LI>The importance of the issue covered and significance to the society in which it is published.
<P>
<LI>The use of investigative techniques and skills in establishing the facts of the story.
<P>
<LI>The story-telling ability of the journalist in making the issue accessible to the reading public.</UL>
<P>
While all of the stories judged were impressive, three stories stood out in the minds of the judges as being excellent investigative journalism, and one in particular.
<P>
<B>Winner:</B> The winner of the award for 1996 is Yashwant Gaunder's report, published in the July 1995 edition of The Review news magazine of Fiji, on the failings of the National Bank of Fiji that revealed the bank's doubtful loans of F$120 million. The article pieced together the maze of relevant facts, unearthed new information, and interviewed major players in the matter, to provide the reader with a compelling account of corruption and incompetence within a country's major financial institution. The journalist used a range of investigative techniques from relentless pursuit of a wide range of sources, to researching companies and individuals associated with the bank. The story added to the public understanding of a major political and business crisis in Fiji society.
<P>
The judges also commended two other articles in the award.
<P>
<B>Commended:</B> Dominic Kakas, in Papua New Guinea's The Independent on 22 July 1995, revealed substantial evidence that a Malaysian logging company operating in PNG had purchased a K335,000 house for the use of the then Forests Minister. The story showed that Forests Minister Andrew Posai was occupying a house provided by a company associated with the controversial Malaysian logging company Rimbunan Hijau. The story displayed a courageous and tenacious attitude to pursue information about a matter of vital public interest. 
<P>
The journalist has displayed a fine understanding of how basic investigative techniques can expose important matters to the public gaze. The article exposed a tale of corruption that opens a view into the heart of PNG’s politics and business.
<P>
<B>Commended:</B> The second story commended by the judges was Ilaitia Turagabeci and Asaeli Lave's report in The Fiji Times on 16 March 1996, of a village using income from marijuana to finance needed community projects. The story impressed the judges as it dealt with the issue of illegal cropping of marijuana not in the usual framework of 'crime'.  
<P>
The newspaper also withstood the pressure brought to bear on it from government and the police force. It upheld a crucial principle of journalism: the upholding of the professional secrecy of the source of information obtained in confidence. The journalists involved in this story put in the hard slog to investigate the story on the ground, and reported with a refreshing understanding of the reasons for the villagers breaking the law.
<P>
The judges noted the absence of any entries from the non-print media and suggest that journalists in radio and TV be encouraged to enter the next award. Also the judges recommend that all reports should be submitted in good quality photocopy or tear-out form rather than fax, and radio and TV entries should be accompanied by transcripts of the items.
<P>
Each item should also detail full attrributions for information in stories, where this is not provided in the published/broadcast stories themselves. The entries in the inaugural Pacific Investigative Journalism Award are in the best traditions of investigative journalism, and uphold the highest principles of quality journalism in informing the public.
<P>		      
<LI> <B>The deadline for the 1997 award is March 31. Email for <A HREF="David.Robie@uts.edu.au">entry details.</B></A>

<h4>Vol 2 No 1, November 1995</H4><P>
<Font size=5>THE TIMES OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA:<BR>
AN INVESTIGATIVE TRADITION</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P>
In May 1995, one of the Pacific's best known newspapers closed. A regional magazine summed up <I>The Times of Papua New Guinea</I>   thus: <I>Strength:</I>   the diversity of views and efforts to cover national life full. <I>Weakness:</I>   Loss of skilled journalists that it develops to organisations like the <I>Post-Courier.</I>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By HARLYNE JOKU</B>
<P>I WAS FIRST inspired into a career of journalism by <I>The Times of Papua New Guinea</I>   because the newspaper was so different from the dailies, and also because of its indepth reports and interesting profiles of people. I was attracted to read a new copy in my school library each week and was fascinated by journalism which seemed quite new to me at the time.
<P>
When  <I>The Times</I>   was first introduced to Papua New Guinea on the fifth anniversary of PNG's independence, people -- particularly the young educated, became its loyal readers -- welcomed it like a breath of fresh air. I was one of those readers, a young student at Sogeri National High School, who didn't know then that one day I'd write for the newspaper, even making it to become acting editor during the last four months of its publication. 
<P>
<I>The Times</I>   was officially launched on 12 September 1980. Distinguished Australian journalist Michael Davie, editor of the Melbourne <I>Age</I>,  launched it and Franzalbert Joku was founding editor. Said the first editorial:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
It is no coincidence that we launch <I>The Times of PNG</I>   today. It is our way of marking, as an independent weekly newspaper, our fifth anniversary of independence as a nation. Five years ago PNG was on the verge of nationhood...
<P><I>The Times of PNG</I>   aims to be part of the process of diagnosis and will not always be popular. But we will always strive to tell as much of the truth as we can get hold of. And we hope we can help find a new way for our nation in the 1980s. 
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
The circumstances leading to Word Publishing Company's board of directors' decision to discontinue <I>The Times</I>  is unfortunate. There are many loyal readers out there who totally disagree or cannot understand why. To them, including loyal fans like myself, <I>The Times</I>   is indispensable -- PNG cannot do without it. An investigative newspaper like <I>The Times</I>   was much needed in this young country's development.
<P>As astutely put by the then Premier for Morobe,  Utula Samana, now PNG's ambassador to the United Nations: 'The true voice of PNG is yet to be heard, shaped by its people to influence development on the basis of its own aspirations and values. The 1980s is a crucial decade for this nation. It is my hope that <I>The Times</I>   will be instrumental in this decade in encouraging and promoting PNG’s national "consciousness", which would in turn become a vital tool to reshape our society in our human image.'
<P>
Papua New Guinea was then a young, inexperienced nation and <I>The Times</I>   was seen by many educated people as a new model of communication between the Government and the people.
<P>
<I>The Times</I>  has since served its purpose, despite criticism from its predecessors that it has lost its touch and direction.
<P>
As early as the years it was launched, its first media columnist, University of PNG's founding journalism lecturer, Ross Stevens, wrote a memo to the editor titled: LETS HAVE THE HARD STUFF!
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
People like the depth in your stories and the way you looked. I agree with them. But I missed the hard stuff -- the one hard story that wrapped it all up in a way a weekly can. Example: What's happening in Simbu? Why are the coffee factories going broke? Why has Waigani got to bail out the provincial government etc?
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
After Stevens wrote his commentary, <I>The Times</I>   began to publish investigative reports. Sinclaire Solomon  began as <I>The Times'</I>  first recognised investigative journalist. His stories uncovered vast corruption in the logging industy, one of the issues that touches the heart of the majority of Papua New Guineans. The consistency  of those reports gave way to a public outcry against this corruption, resulting in the establishment of a national inquiry into the allegations which was headed by Judge Thomas Barnett.
<P>Former leaders like Deputy Prime Minister Ted Diro and Sir Julius Chan were implicated in the report. Diro resigned from public office as a result.
<P>More of <I>The Times</I>   investigative reports followed from journalists like Neville Togarewa and Bernard Maladina on logging and other issues valued by <I>The Times'</I>   aims and objectives:<P><UL>
<LI> To promote gospel values, through encouraging total human development, by helping people to mature intellectually and spiritually; and in the use of material resources.<P>
<LI>To seek the truth.<P>
<LI>To oppose injustice, inequality, violence and the destruction of the environment.<P>
<LI>To hold a mirror to society and all institutions.<P></UL>
And Word's aims:<P>
<UL><LI> To disseminate information so that people can form true and objective judgements.<P>
<LI>To encourage reader participation.<P>
<LI>To reflect a wide variety of opinions.<P>
<LI>To build an interest in serious reading.<P>
<LI>To encourage in-depth reporting on a wide range of institutions, including the churches.<P></UL>
Former editors, journalists and support staff of  <I>The Times</I>   have in their own way upheld those philosophies and values. I pay tribute to them, especially my editor-in-chief Anna Solomon, who through thick and thin led <I>The Times</I>   editorial team onwards until the decision by the board to have <I>The Times</I>   suspended indefinitely due to financial difficulties.
<P>
The Word Publishing board made its decision in the light of the hard economic situation being faced by the country. The trying times have further affected businesses and firms as our newspaper company is the only one that is nationally owned in this country. The recent birth of another daily newspaper, the Malaysian-owned <I>National</I>, has generally affected the print media advertising market.
<P> 
If <I>The Times</I>  newspaper, rated one of the best in the South Pacific, had to be sacrificed to keep PNG's only nationally owned newspaper company, Word Publishing, surviving, then probably it is worth it. Loyal readers must need to know that when good times return, there will be a rebirth of <I>The Times</I>   to a better publication than it ever was before. I recall 1989 when it was rated by a regional news magazine as 'best newspaper in the South Pacific'. Said the magazine:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The Times of PNG</I>.  Strength: the diversity of views and efforts to cover national life fully. Weakness: Loss of skilled journalists it develops to organisations like the <i>Post-Courier.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
On 12 September 1995, it would have been 15 years old. I remain proud always to have written for such a paper.  
<P>
<LI><I>Harlyne Joku is a Senior Reporter of The  Independent, successor to The Times of PNG. At the time of the closure of The Times, she was News Editor on that paper. This is reprinted from The Times of 25 May 1995.</I>

<h4>Vol 2 No 1, November 1995</H4><P>
<Font size=5>PEOPLE, NEWS AND GOVERNMENT</F5>
<P>
<Font size=4> Like all rights and freedoms, freedom of the press sometimes gets a rough handling by various authorities and governments throughout the world. In the Pacific, the right must be preserved for the interests of the people.
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By SIR CHARLES MAINO</B>
<P>WHEN I WAS invited to give a keynote address [at the Pacific Islands News Association conference in Port Moresby during February 1996], I accepted the challenge almost immediately, since I felt that if I were to seriously think about the issues and imagine facing the learned professionals like yourselves here today, I might find excuses to decline. In fact, when I received the final program and realised what learned and distinguished delegates you all are, then I began to regret accepting the invitation since I am not qualified to speak to you about your profession.  In any event I am happy to be with you all today, in order to share with you my views about your profession and I hope to be provocative so that your minds may continue to roll over the issues during the convention.
<P>In the course of preparing my address, I was mindful of the fact that I would be under the watchful eyes of all of you,  and whatever I say may later be torn into bits and pieces in order to see what lies between the lines.  I therefore continuously reminded myself to be careful with the words I use, not to be controversial but diplomatic, and kept reminding myself of the words: 'Say what you want to say and shut-up.'  
<P>Well, that is exactly what I propose to do today.  I'll say what I want to say, and shut up for fear that you may describe me as 'outspoken, angry, arrogant and a rebel', and tell me to be ashamed of myself as I have been described and told of, from time to time, through the media here in Papua New Guinea. One thing, I must admit, that I am happy about, is being provocative since that makes the minds of others go clicking -- then we all begin to think.  I like criticisms because they make me think and learn more. However, the keynote topic 'People, News and Government' leaves me no room but to open my big mouth a little -- but not too much.  In so doing, I will touch on issues relating to:<OL>
<LI>Freedom of the press;
<LI>People's right to know the truth; and
<LI>The  Government's obligation and responsibility to inform or ensure that the people are informed.</OL>
<P>These are very delicate issues so I hope that I will handle them with care. But if I don't do that, I will merely raise them so that you may have something to scratch your heads about in the course of this convention.  I don't know the answers to this topic 'People, news and government', so I will tear it up and throw it back to you. And as journalists, being experts in the use of words, you may formulate your own opinions, ideas and conclusions.
I am aware that we in the Pacific, whether Polynesian, Micronesian or Melanesian, tend to be easy going and quiet -- although things may not be right.  This could be because of our upbringing where we are constantly reminded to respect our chiefs and elders; and no matter what they say and do, we are not to say nor do anything about it.  I hope none of you journalists have found yourself in such a dilemma when writing about the Government, prime minister and/or ministers in your respective countries.  If any of you have experienced that then let me invite you to remember that as a journalist, you have a duty to express yourself freely in recognition of the people's right to know the truth. In other words, the people under the Constitution and various statutes gave you that freedom so that you may use it as a tool to tell them the truth without fear or favour.
<P>
<B>1. Freedom of the press</B><BR>
Like all rights and freedoms, freedom of the press sometimes gets a rough handling by various authorities and governments throughout the world. We have been very fortunate so far in our region since in most cases our governments and authorities have not really shaken this freedom, although in some cases freedom of the press may have been sailing in the high seas -- therefore it had a bit of rocking.  This may have been so due to some misunderstandings and in some cases because one may have been emotional about certain issues.  It is therefore important for all of us to remember, especially those in authority, that freedom of the press, like all other rights and freedoms, derives from the people so must be preserved and used only for and in the interest of the people.
<P>Without embarking on legal and constitutional issues which I know that you are all familiar with since they relate to your profession, I would like to refer to the Papua New Guinea Constitution just as an example. Many of your constitutions, or otherwise by an Act of Parliament, contain similar provisions on freedom of expression which includes 'freedom of the press'.  Section 46 of our Constitution specifically provides for freedom of expression which states under sub-section (1) that 'every person has the right to freedom of expression and publications...' and sub-section (2) defines 'freedom of expression and publication' to include:
<UL>
(a) Freedom to hold opinions, to receive ideas and information and to communicate ideas and information, whether to the public generally or to a person or class of persons; and
<P>(b) freedom of the press and other mass communications media.
</UL><P>
So in Papua New Guinea, we have this freedom specifically provided for in our National Constitution like all other rights and freedoms. Since most of you are journalists, let me challenge you by saying, 'Please do not abuse this freedom which is your tool.' Otherwise control measures and mechanisms may be introduced by the authorities in an attempt to control the abuses.  So please be professionals so that you don't provide the authorities with unnecessary justification to control you hereby deny the people's right to know the truth.
<P>Unlike other professions, journalism is one that can destroy a person, an organisation, a government and a  country.  So you possess a very important tool under the banner of  'freedom of the press'.  In my view, freedom of the press is not a privilege but a duty or responsibility imposed on all  involved in mass media to be independent, impartial, honest and fair in your news reporting.
<P>
<B>2. People's right to know the truth</B><BR>
As I have said earlier, freedom of the press must be exercised by the media organisations and journalists with a view to and in recognition of the rights of the people to know the truth.  It is, therefore, in my view, the freedom of the press is not a privilege but a duty imposed on you all to provide to the people through the media the truth. I invite you to remember that freedom has been given in recognition of the peoples right to know the truth.  It must therefore be used in the interest of the people and not abused by the media.
<P>It is therefore important to perform your duties professionally.  Like our Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, has recently said, our journalism must be professsional and investigative in order to bring about and provide balanced reporting so that the people may be able to make their own judgements on what they read instead of being influenced by the media to see only one side of the issues concerned.  I agree with our Prime Minister that there is a real need for professional and investigative journalism, at least in Papua New Guinea. 
<P>Further, I personally believe that media organisations have a responsibility to ensure that the people are correctly informed without being biased and that can only happen if our media organisations do not find themselves in a conflict of interest situation but exercise their responsibilities with independence, impartiality, fairness, honesty and without fear and favour in full recognition of the people's right to know the truth.
<P>I have come across cases where it has been alleged that certain media organisations were being biased for various reasons. But what concerns me most is the allegation of some interests in the ownership of such media organisations by our political leaders. It has been alleged that since some of our political leaders have an interest in some of the media organisations, the news reporting by such organisations is not fair and impartial since they tend to protect those individuals who have an interest in that organisation. I hope our newsrooms of those organisations conduct their responsibilities of news reporting independently, impartially and with honesty and without fear and favour.  Otherwise, depending on who is in power, unnecessary controls may be made and this could be to the detriment of the people and the country as a whole.  It is true that some of our political leaders have an interest in certain media organisations, I hope they do not put any pressure on the management for their own political expediencies or interests.  The management and editorial staff must be free to exercise their responsibilities in reporting news to the people without any interference or threat.
<P>
<B>3. Government's responsibility to inform the people</B><BR>
In the light of the principle that in any democracy, the government must be an 'open' government and in order to ensure that, it is the responsibility of every government to make sure that there are means and ways whereby they can inform the people on what the government is doing from time to time especially on major issues facing the country.  It seems that some governments within the region fail to fully appreciate and encourage the fulfilment of their duty or responsibility.  In a nutshell, if a government is to be an open government then it must not deny the people to know what it is doing.
The government must provide itself with means and avenues to inform the people on what it does. 
<P>
Being mindful of this responsibility, I note with some concern about certain actions or decisions made by various prime ministers within our region.  For instance, in order to be diplomatic, let me begin with Papua New Guinea where our Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, towards the end of last month called off or prevented the debate between two Members of Parliament on the current controversial [provincial government] reform Bill which is now before Parliament.  The Minister for Communications, John Momis, and the chairman of the Constitutional Review Commission, Ben Micah, were to debate the issues concerning the Bill. However, our Prime Minister intervened and the debate never took place.  With due respect to our Prime Minister, in so doing he has in fact put the interest of his Government over and above the right of the people to know what the reform Bill is all about through such a public debate.  It is the duty of any government as an open government to make sure that the people are well informed of major decisions especially laws, like the reform Bill, that are made to govern their lives.
<P>
Again one witnesses a similar control being made in this case by the Prime Minister of Western Samoa.  It was reported early last month that he had issued warnings to ensure that Government-controlled radio was not to be used by the Opposition to oppose the Government.  If that is correct, then I am afraid to say that it is again another case of a Prime Minister failing to recognise its duty or responsibility to make sure that the people are well informed. Likewise, most recently it was reported that the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Maxime Carlot Korman, had put a ban on any reporting concerning the French nuclear tests in Vanuatu.   With due respect to that Prime Minister, it again is another demonstration of a Prime Minister putting his Government's interests ahead of the people's right to know, especially on matters and issues that may affect their lives and that of their children. I have only referred to the most recent instances where our prime ministers within the region have made decisions which may be in the interest of their respective governments but certainly not in recognition of the people's right to know.  I hope our governments within the region will foster the spirit of open  government and thereby not deny the people's right to know thus live with the full spirit of democracy.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B><BR>
Before I conclude, I would like to emphasise again that the freedom of the press must continue to be maintained in our region and hope that those of you who are involved in the mass media will not abuse that freedom.  Otherwise, you may invite the governments and authorities to regulate and control that freedom under the pretence of controlling the abuses.  You have an important role to play in ensuring that the freedom of the press is not being abused but strictly maintained.
<P>In order to do that, I believe the media organisations and journalists must at all times maintain professionalism and perform their duties with impartiality, fairness, honesty and without fear and favour.  In my view accountability systems must also be put in place and strictly enforced. Otherwise, you may find yourselves being controlled just because of unprofessional conduct of the few.  It is therefore important to ensure that there exists a professional code of conduct both for the media organisations and journalists as a profession. If you already have a code of conduct both for the media organisations and journalists, then please don't use it as a window dressing only but strictly enforce it if it is necessary so that the integrity of the profession may be maintained at all times in the interest of your own organisations as well as the people.

<Font size=5>INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM IN MELANESIA: IS IT NEEDED?</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P>
Some argue there is no place for investigative journalism in Melanesia, particularly in Papua New Guinea. Such critics believe that for investigations to be effective then politicians must make changes. A media panel at a UNESCO-funded seminar at the University of PNG debates these issues.</I>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By WALTER NALANGU</B>
<P>HELLO AND WELCOME to this documentary program. I'm Walter Nalangu and in this program we'll mainly be looking at a Certificate in Investigative Journalism course just introduced by the South Pacific Center for Communication and Information in Development (SPCenCIID) at the University of Papua New Guinea. Investigative journalism -- is it needed in our society?
<P>
For the first time ever, within the Pacific Islands region, a full tertiary course on Investigative Journalism has been introduced. SPCenCIID introduced this 16-week course at UPNG's Waigani Campus in the second semester of this year. 
<P> 
Not many, if any at all, of the practising journalists -- especially in Melanesia -- have attended formal courses on investigative journalism. Similarly, few journalists and the public within the region have some basic ideas of what investigative journalism actually is. University of Papua New Guinea lecturer in journalism David Robie, who is coordinator of the course, explains what is involved:
<P>
DAVID ROBIE: <B>The term 'investigative reporting' is often misleading. In a sense, any good reporting should be 'investigative'. It is a question of degree. In the public eye, and among many journalists, investigative journalism is only thought of in terms of an exposé at the expense of the subjects of the investigation. In fact, investigative reporting can be much broader in scope and can also include interpretative and in-depth reporting, or evaluative feature writing.</B>
<P>
However, according to Mr Robie, much of what we call investigative journalism or reporting differs in important ways from routine reporting. These differences usually include the idea that the investigation will trigger some  action.
<P>
ROBIE: <B>Investigative reporting usually involves a longer time frame to research and write than other forms of reporting. An investigative report usually requires more resources in staff, time and money. And then the investigative report usually involves some risks, threats or legal obstacles that could be involved in the research and publication or broadcast. 
<P>
Another factor is that mostly experienced journalists are involved, and usually a high level editorial decision is taken over whether to investigate the story and publish or broadcast. Certainly it is vital for reporters to realise that they shouldn't attempt controversial investigations without the sanction and support of their news organisations.
</B><P>
Investigative journalism runs in Mr Robie's family. His great-great grandfather, James Robie, was the owner-editor of a famous Scottish newspaper, <I>The Caledonian Mercury</I>, and was presented with an award by the grateful citizens of New York for his role as a 'muckraker', or investigator, of his day.
<P>
If one ever gets down to tackling investigative journalism, it really is quite difficult. One of Australia's leading investigative journalists, Wendy Bacon, now an associate professor who has been resource person for the investigative journalism course, confirms that the difficulty exists. The basis of investigative journalism or a major reason why some reporters try to be investigative journalists is because of a belief in the public's right to know the truth.
<P>
WENDY BACON: <B>Governments have massive -- perhaps not massive in Pacific countries -- but certainly governments have plenty of PR people and so do big corporations. They put out lots of information but all too often that information leaves big gaps and doesn't really explain very much. In some countries it actually amounts to lies. 
<P>
So people think of investigative journalism as exposing. But often, really, all an investigative journalist is trying to do is just put things together, just to tell a story to people about what is actually happening to them. 
<P>
And so I think that's what the bottom line is. Why we try to do investigative journalism is so that the public actually know what the story is -- at least as far as we're able to find out.</B>
<P>
And from experience, Professor Wendy Bacon says it is likely that the attitude of governments and big companies towards investigative journalists may not be very positive.
<P>
BACON: <B>I don't think governments anywhere like investigative journalism. They like to control the flow of information and that's not in any one particular part of the world. Some governments can tolerate it more than others, but I don't think there's ever been a government that likes, really embraces, investigative journalism, nor do big companies because their bottom line is just making sure that the information creates an environment where they can continue to make as much money as possible. 
<P>
So obviously they're not going to like investigative journalism either.  And for that reason, if you approach it from their point of view, their job is to make life difficult for investigative journalists, and I think they certainly managed to do that in many cases. </B>
<P>                
Associate Professor Bacon has been renowned for exposing corrupt activities of senior New South Wales police officers. She was also involved in exposing foreigners implicated in the 1987 military coups in Fiji. She reaffirms that investigative journalism involves legal and official obstacles -- the way the law can frustrate what journalists want to do. Also the legal obligations and difficulties confronting reporters when working as investigative journalists.
<P>
BACON: <B>Often the most difficult thing for investigative journalists is that most journalists don't do investigative journalism. So that sometimes the people who are actually your biggest problem are the people who are prepared to be the outlets for the Government and company public relations. 
<P>
And if you look in newspapers anywhere, I would say that most of what appears in the newspaper is actually just regurgitating what people have said to journalists and what powerful people have said to journalists. 
<P>
Now I think that it is part of the role of journalism to actually report what people in official places say, but all too often it's reported without asking more questions. That's not to say that there's not a very strong group who do ask probing questions. 
<P>
There's almost an international, I think, group of journalists that in our region have given each other support and continue to do so, so that we can continue to do investigative journalism. And I think without that sort of support network existing, it's going to be difficult for people in any one place to keep going.
</B><P>
Associate Professor Wendy Bacon is currently director of  the Australian Center for Independent Journalism at the Sydney University of Technology, Australia.
<P>
Does the difficulties involved mean that investigative journalism should not be practised in Melanesia, let alone Papua New Guinea? Not at all. Many people in Melanesian society of today have expressed support, saying that investigative journalism is vital. One of the people who publicly supports investigative journalism in Melanesia is an elder statesman of Papua New Guinea, Sir Paulias Matane.
<P>
 SIR PAULIAS MATANE: <B>It is really needed in Papua New Guinea at this time. I was very much interested in the front page report of last's Saturday Independent on one of our so-called  national leaders. You know the rest of the story -- but that was a good piece of work.
<P>
As I see investigative journalism, it is tough, and we should not concentrate only on corruption. We should look at other things as well -- politics, economy, social issues, the whole range of things. And as I see today, the journalists -- you people here -- are the saviours of Papua New Guinea, and I'll tell you why I say this. 
<P>
The Government has decided to abolish the Department of Information and Communication. They have not even funded the National Broadcasting Corporation properly. Some of their stations are not working and I don't think they take reporting  as a very important issue. I really don't think so. 
<P>
So these issues are very serious. That's why I said in the beginning, you will save this nation. So I actually encourage you to go ahead and carry out investigative reporting, for that's important.
</B><P>
Sir Paulias is therefore encouraging investigative journalism to take root in this country and in Melanesia as a whole.  Other people who publicly support the need for investigative journalism in Melanesia include prominent Papua New Guinea journalists and the head of the South Pacific Center for Communication and Information in Development, Rhonda Eva. Sir Paulias Matane has even suggested areas in which investigative reporters could work on -- if we have that reporting power now --  so that the public is informed of the truth.
<P>
MATANE: <B>They tell us time and again that 1995 will  be 'flush with cash', that 'we beggars cannot be choosers'. No, we can choose, we can become choosers. And they say all kinds of nice things about the economy -- that the economy is okay. The economy is not okay. We have all the natural resources here, it's rich, but where is all the money going to? This is a very important area for journalists to look into, so that we can be told the truth.
<P>
 Our leaders, I'm afraid to say, are not telling us the truth. So that's why I say at the beginning, you're the saviours of this nation to tell us the truth. That's my first point. 
<P>
My second point is: I wonder whether you realise that the second nation with the highest investment in real estate in Eastern Australia -- particularly in Cairns and the Gold Coast -- is poor Papua New Guinea. This would be a very good area to investigate, we need to know. It could be that because there's no money here, because a lot of money is going out, it could be that, I don't know. So that’s one area you might like to look at.
<P>
The other area is that there is a rumour going around the country that some prominent people are now seeking permanent residence outside PNG. I would like to know who these people are if it is true. This is only a rumour but that's important. Why do they want to leave this country? This is our land. Are they running away from something? An interesting topic.
<P>
Another interesting topic is someone sold off something here. I don't want to give you the name of whatever business, but a business, to a big company -- a foreign company -- and bought it back with one eighth of the amount that he sold it for. I would like to know whether this is true and if it is true, in business terms. I find it hard to understand why you could sell a business for so much and buy it back for only one seventh of the price that you sell it for.</B>
<P>
However, that is not to say that investigative journalism is perfect. It does face problems, as the Australian long-time investigative journalist, Associate Professor Wendy Bacon, states experiences from her own country.
<P>
BACON: <B>For investigative journalism in Australia, defamation is a very big worry. It's a big worry because it's big business and involves a lot of money. Most of the people who sue for defamation are people who have a lot of money and a lot to lose. The average person in Australia, even though often the media is not responsible and is not accountable and there are many things wrong with our media, the average person could never sue -- it will cost far too much.</B>
<P>
What happens in Australia, according to Professor Bacon, is that unless journalists have strong media companies, defamation cases are normally settled behind the scenes or out of court. This is because court costs are too high. In recent years, Professor Bacon did a study of 27 investigative stories, and in every single one of those stories, defamation had been a problem to some extent, which sometimes resulted in pressure being put on media companies.
<P>
BACON: <B>The problem is not that you don't get to run the story at all, but sometimes the story is so cut, or has to be written in such a way, that actually the story is lost and  often becomes very difficult for people to read. But in the cases that have been settled, I want to mention to you that one was the Roger Rogerson case. There were two corrupt New South Wales detectives who did get payouts. 
<P>
But the other ones have been where people were able to exert enough pressure by withdrawing advertising -- Government advertisements or company advertisements -- from the media company. And because media companies depend on advertisements rather than sales revenue to be able to survive, then the threat of withdrawal of adverts is  often the best way of all.
<P>
The other thing, as I said, is confidential sources. We don't have any [shield] guarantee and in the last few years there's been five contempt of court cases in Australia. Three journalists have gone to jail for not naming sources.</B>
<P>
An inquiry in Australia into the rights and obligations of the media recommended that there should be some reform to give journalists rights over the possibility of not naming their confidential sources. At the same time, however, it was also recommended that the media needed to clean up its own act and journalists needed to become more accountable. 
<P>
When people make complaints they must be followed through. This tends to not happen in Australia and the Pacific Islands region which gives the media a bad name.
<P>
BACON: <B>I agree with the Senate that the media should improve its methods of accountability. And then maybe there'll be more public support for some reform, because if we're going to have the right not to name confidential sources we have that right because of the public. We've got that right on behalf of the public to do that so we have to be accountable back to the public.</B>
<P> 
On the investigative journalism course at the University of PNG, four senior Papua New Guinea editors and journalists and one Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation reporter are the pioneers of the course. One of the journalists taking up this course is Papua New Guinea’s Dominic Sengi. 
<P>
DOMINIC SENGI: <B>Something really inspired me to come back to university to this course because I understand in this country there is effectively not enough investigation done by journalists. A lot of issues have gone unreported. This  is either because journalists are not grounded or they have not read widely enough to see issues unfolding in the world as they relate to Papua New Guinea.</B>
<P>
One requirement -- among many others -- of this course is for participants to present a seminar on a topic being investigated. Mr Sengi was the first course participant to address a seminar organised by SPCenCIID in July . His seminar was on the topic of 'The Gene Hunters — Cultural and Social Protection for Indigenous People'. 
<P>                                          
SENGI: <B>I have specifically chosen this issue of gene hunting because in newspapers last year and also on EM TV, there were snippets of stories on the topic. One little newspaper filler said something to the effect that blood from an indigenous isolated tribe in Papua New Guinea was currently in a queue for application for patenting in the United States.  
<P>
My concern is, and as a reporter, that these people are predominantly unprotected. They don't know they are beginning to communicate with the rest of the world, they're the last tribe on earth to be discovered and gene hunters regard blood from such a tribe as equivalent to gold. 
<P>
I set out to read a couple of the latest medical journals on the subject and I was surprised to find that one of the magazines confirmed that genes of the Hagahai have gone to labs in the United States for 'genetic engineering' to determine the types of virus. In my paper, I want to link blood to commerce.</B>
<P>
Mr Sengi is a graduate with a bachelor of journalism from UPNG and has worked for several newspaper companies in Papua New Guinea. He is currently attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Port Moresby. And that too has been our program for now on Investigative Journalism.

This is an edited transcript from a radio documentary prepared by him on a half-day seminar on  the theme 'Investigative Journalism in Melanesia — Is it Needed?' at UPNG on 27 July 1995. It was broadcast on SIBC's daily current affairs program Wol Blong Iumi on 18 October 1995.</I>

<Font size=5>THE COPYRIGHT LAW AND PAPUA NEW  GUINEA<P>
<Font size=4>'Papua New Guineans would not be impressed by fancy arguments advanced elsewhere -- that it is immoral to copy somebody else's work and that a country should adopt copyright laws to enhance its international standing.'
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By JOHN NONGGORR</B><P>
EVERYBODY having an interest in copyright law first, and Papua New Guinea second, is well aware by now of the fact that Papua New Guinea has a copyright law that was passed in 1978 but that it has not been brought into force.  I discussed the background to the Act and the reasons why it has not been brought into force in a seminar held in Port Moresby in 1991 and the main points of which were published in a legal journal.(1) In another article I wrote for <I>Intellectual Property in the Asia and Pacific</I>, I recounted the efforts made since then by individuals and industry to debate the issue with the objective of ensuring the adoption of copyright legislation for Papua New Guinea.(2)
<P>
<B>The costs and benefits of copyright law</B><BR>
The important issue for Papua New Guinea is not what form a copyright law should take or what type of materials or works a copyright law should protect and so on.  These are issues of detail that can easily be sorted out, some requiring specific instructions, and hence policy decisions while others of a technical nature for the legal technicians.  I might add also that the drafting of appropriate legislation is not a problem.
<P>
The most important question on copyright law in Papua New Guinea and, which question that must be decided by the people of PNG, if copyright legislation is to be introduced, is whether this will result in increasing the costs of educating children; whether the prices of foreign songs in cassette tapes and CDs which our people  --especially the young -- have come to love, sold in shops around Papua New Guinea will increase; whether the costs of using a computer in the office will increase.  It is these basic questions -- its likely impact on the ordinary Papua New Guinean -- that are the crucial questions for us to address.
<P>
I have stressed before that, in the final analysis, the decision about whether copyright legislation is introduced must depend on the benefits to Papua New Guinea, as a whole, of having a copyright law.  I am not impressed and I doubt other Papua New Guineans would be impressed by fancy arguments advanced elsewhere about morality -- that it is immoral to copy (or 'steal') somebody else's work and that a country should adopt copyright laws to improve or enhance its international standing in the community of nations.
<P>
Obviously, the Papua New Guineans (both individuals and corporate entities) producing copyright work and who would benefit from having a copyright law introduced by legislation, are small but growing.  The music industry has really taken off in the last few years, especially with the growth of television in this country. Papua New Guinea now can boast of having talented song writers, musicians and producers with a number of modern class studios.  With the introduction of television, Papua New Guineans are potential owners of all types of copyright material, from advertisement jingles to full programs aired on the local station.  The literary industry also has shown promise, for example, in the use of locally produced school curricula in other countries.
<P>
The benefits of these developments, in terms not only of revenue generation for the individuals and the country but also in terms of the provision of employment, the incentive to encourage creativity and in turn the reduction into permanent form of the diverse and rich cultures of the country, need to be weighed against the costs of educating our children and meeting our populations desire for Western music and the use of computer programs that are now becoming indispensable in the offices of all types.
<P>
Again, I would call on the making of this cost analysis, for that is the issue that was important when the  <I>Copyright Act 1978</I> was passed and, I suggest, it is the question that must be addressed now and in the future, if the question of enacting copyright legislation is passed.  In 1978, it was clear that a copyright law could not be justified as Papua New Guinea stood to lose more than it could expect to benefit.  One cannot say the same today.  Certainly the scale may now be equally balanced or it may go the other way. 
<P>
The important question is to establish if the benefits that a copyright law will bring will offset the costs.  In other words, the revenue generated, the employment opportunities created, the creativity encouraged, the benefit of reducing the varied and rich local cultures into permanent form, etc outweigh the costs of education to our children and the increase in prices of foreign recorded songs in cassette tapes or CDs.  This cost/benefit analysis must necessarily be done at the national and not the individual level.
<P>
It will be recalled that the reason why the <I>1978 Copyright Act</I>    has been shelved up to now is because of its perceived costs to the educational institutions -- the costs of educating our children (and adults).  But today, this cost may not be as much as it is feared. Educational institutions continue to buy textbooks or other foreign books.  But, it is the copying of material that we are concerned with.  When a student buys a textbook, he or she is paying the full price that a student in Australia would pay. The benefit only comes when educational institutions make copies of that book or parts of such book to make available to students which would not be permitted if a copyright law with international protection existed.  I know that this is still done at the University of Papua New Guinea but I do not know how much of this practice currently prevails.  I also do not know how much of this is done in other educational institutions -- primary, secondary and tertiary institutions -- in the country.
<P>
<B>The form of legislation</B><BR>
As indicated earlier, the detailed issues of what form a copyright law should take and what its details should be are, at this stage, not so crucial.  On the question of form, what is important, I consider, is whether a copyright legislation for Papua New Guinea should give copyright protection to only Papua New Guinean material (or works, using the legal terminology) and enforced only within the country or should there be international protection as well.  This is the second important question that requires an answer in addition to the issue of the costs and benefits of adopting copyright legislation in the country.  The two issues are related in that the cost/benefit analysis needs to be done using firstly the scenario where the legislation will apply only within Papua New Guinea and secondly, where there will be international protection through Papua New Guinea joining any of the existing international copyright convention regimes.
<P>
The <I>1978 Copyright Act</I>   provided for domestic copyright law only as it provided a deposit system, which would not have accorded with international coverage régimes.  The National Information and Communication  Policy of the Government follows that line as it speaks of a domestic copyright law.
<P>
Enacting a domestic copyright law is a non-issue.  If the requirements for unnecessary deposits, etc which would be costly and administratively cumbersome to administer, are done away with and we draft a simple copyright Act that confers protection on creation and publication, this would be beneficial to the country.  I say that it is a non-issue because there is probably nobody against this.  Everybody would be for it and if we wanted this in fact, we should have had this in 1978 after doing away with the deposit requirements.  The practice by foreign owners of copyright work who publish their works at a number of countries at the same time to attract (as the first publication attracts copyright protection in that country) may do so in Papua New Guinea but this may be regulated in the domestic legislation.
<P>
The real issue concerns international protection.  The issue is this: if Papua New Guinea wants its copyright material (books, music, etc) produced by Papua New Guineans to be protected in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and other countries so that they are not copied by people there and exploited commercially or otherwise, it must join an international scheme providing such protection.  There are two major international Conventions - the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention.  But, in order to join those schemes, Papua New Guinea's copyright law must meet the standards set by those conventions.  One of the important standards is the observance of reciprocity -- that is, Papua New Guinea must give protection to all copyright works of the other countries which are members of the Convention.  The other standard is that formalities such as depositing of material to attract copyright is not allowed.
<P>
That issue needs to be decided first and foremost.  The details can come later.

<Font size=5>A PHOTOGRAPHER'S DATE WITH A NUCLEAR DEATH</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P> 
President Jacques Chirac's controversial final round of nuclear tests at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls in 1995 unleashed an unprecedented storm of international protest. And dilemmas for journalists covering the riots in Papeete and the junkets by French authorities. The Vanuatu government banned news reports on protests. A journalist on board the original environmental campaign ship <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   -- bombed by French secret agents a decade ago -- recalls the events. He was later arrested by the French military.

<P><A HREF="#Fernando Pereira">FERNANDO PEREIRA</A> was on board the <I>Rainbow Warrior's</I>   ill-fated voyage to the Pacific a decade ago almost by chance. Campaign coordinator Steve Sawyer had been seeking a wire machine for transmitting pictures from the <A HREF="#Marshall Islands"> Marshall Islands</A> and Moruroa Atoll. Sawyer phoned Fiona Davies, then heading the Greenpeace photo office in Paris. But he said he wanted a machine and a photographer separately.
<P>
'No, no ... I'll get you a wire machine,' promised Davies. 'But you'll have to take my photographer with it.' Agreed. The deal would save Greenpeace's campaign budget about US$8000. But it would also cost the Portuguese-born photojournalist Pereira his life. Less than three months later he was dead -- drowned as the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>, bombed by French secret service agents, sank to the bottom of Auckland Harbour.
<P>
The ship's successor, <I>Rainbow Warrior II</I>, returned to French Polynesian waters for another dramatic tilt at the French over nuclear testing. Again, American Steve Sawyer was on board for the first round of protests in July.
<P>
For thousands of people in the Pacific, the French plan to resume nuclear tests this year reopened a deep and bitter wound. New Zealand has long played a key anti-nuclear role. Twice in 1973 it dispatched frigates to the Moruroa Atoll testing zone to protest over atmospheric tests. A World Court case filed jointly with Australia forced France to switch to underground tests the following year.
Yet, in spite of persistent small boat protests over ensuing years, it was not until a decade ago that this major act of French state terrorism in New Zealand's largest port suddenly projected  nuclear tests at Moruroa firmly into the international limelight. 
<P>
<B>Irony of the saboteurs</B><BR>
The night was chilly as the Greenpeace flagship <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   lay moored at Auckland's Marsden Wharf on Wednesday, 10 July 1985. It had arrived in New Zealand from Vanuatu three days earlier -- a week after President Haruo Remeliik had been assassinated in Belau.
Greenpeace campaigners were preparing the former North Sea fishing trawler for the environmental group's biggest-ever protest voyage to Moruroa Atoll, one which they hoped would embarrass France over nuclear testing even more than the many brave forays of the yacht <I>Vega</I>. On board, supporters celebrated the 29th birthday of Steve Sawyer, the American co-ordinator of the Pacific Peace Voyage.
<P>
Unknown to the Greenpeace activists, two frogmen, French secret agents Jacques Camurier and Alain Tonel, had set off in an inflatable dinghy across the 2km stretch of the misty harbour from Mechanics Bay. It was ironic that the saboteurs were using a French-made Zodiac -- the craft used by marine commandos to chase the <I>Vega</I>   in 1973 (when they bludgeoned David McTaggart, Greenpeace founder in the Pacific), and later adopted by the Greenpeace 'commandos of conservation' in dramatic campaigns against nuclear waste dumpers and whalers.
<P>
Camurier and Tonel crouched low into the icy breeze as they motored slowly across the harbour. It was bitterly cold, even in their waterproof jackets and wetsuits. Stowed on board the grey-and-black craft were two explosive packs wrapped in plastic, a clamp, rope, and the rest of their scuba gear -- including two rebreather oxygen tanks, which did not release telltale bubbles underwater.
It was about 8.30 pm when they were close enough to switch off the little four horsepower Yamaha motor and paddle towards the <I>Rainbow Warrior's</I>   berth. They moored the Zodiac to a sheltered wharf pile. So far, so good. It was just as they had rehearsed this phase of the so-called Operation Satanic at their Aspretto base in Corsica, France.
<P>
Donning their flippers, oxygen tanks and masks, Camurier and Tonel slipped into the inky water. Then they reached over the side of the inflatable to grab the bombs, the heavier of which weighed 15 kilos. They both swam underwater with the bombs, clamp and rope to the stern of the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>. Tonel attached the smaller, 10 kilo bomb to the propeller shaft; Camurier fixed the clamp on to the keel and ran out of rope to pinpoint a spot to attach the larger bomb next to the engineroom.
<P>
The hull explosive would sink the ship, the propeller mine would cripple it. Both bombs were timed to explode in just over three hours, at 11.50 pm. The explosives laid, the frogmen headed back to their hidden Zodiac. The hardest part of their mission was over.
<P>
The first blast ripped a hole the size of a garage door in the engineroom. The force of the explosion was so powerful that a freighter on the other side of Marsden Wharf was thrown five metres sideways. As the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   rapidly sank until the keel touched the harbour floor, the shocked crew scrambled on to the wharf. But <A NAME="Fernando Pereira">Fernando Pereira</A> dashed down a narrow stairway to one of the stern cabins to rescue his expensive cameras. The second explosion probably stunned him and he drowned with his camera straps tangled around his legs. 
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>I had been on board the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>  for 11 weeks, and my cabin was opposite Pereira's. But I had left the ship three days earlier, on arriving in Auckland, to return to my Grey Lynn home. A planned visit to the ship that night with my two sons and their Scout troop had been cancelled at the last moment. When the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   was refloated and towed to the Devonport Naval Base dry dock, I discovered my old cabin had a huge bulge and hole where my bunk had been.  My passport had been earlier recovered by navy divers from the bridge. 
<P>
<B>Daughter's plea</B><BR> 
Fernando had fled Portugal during the colonial wars in Angola, Mozambique and East Timor while he was serving as a military pilot. He settled in Holland, the only country that would grant him citizenship. An amusing, engaging and likeable environmental photojournalist, he joined the Amsterdam daily newspaper <I>De Waarheid</I>. 
<P>
Fernando's daughter, Marelle, then aged eight, in June 1995 appealed in the French newspaper <I>Liberation</I>    to anybody who was involved in the bombing operation to tell her fully what had happened in the bombing.  'Now I am 18,  I am an adult and I think by now I have the right to know exactly what events transpired surrounding the explosion which cost my father his life,' she wrote. She also travelled to New Zealand to interview former  Prime Minister David Lange and Greenpeace campaigners who sailed on the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>.
<P>
Fernando and I were among seven journalists accompanying the Greenpeace campaigners -- he was also a crew member; the rest of us were independent reporters, filing for Australian, British, French, Japanese, New Zealand and Pacific news media. Our task was to travel to the <A NAME="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islands </A>to report on the evacuation of the stricken islanders from Rongelap Atoll. The Rongelap people had been contaminated by radioactive fallout, three decades earlier, in the most tragic disaster of American atmospheric tests of the 1950s-- the 15-megaton Bravo H-bomb on Bikini Atoll, on 1 March 1954.

<Font SIZE=3>French President Jacques Chirac's decision to resume the tests so close to the 10th anniversary of the Rainbow Warrior bombing fuelled outrage in the South Pacific, reopened a deep wound and gave New Zealanders a feeling of deja vu. France says it needs the tests to maintain its nuclear deterrent, and will only conduct eight underground tests between this September and May 1996. Chirac claimed the tests would have 'strictly no ecological consequences'.
<P>
Since 1966, France has conducted 175 atmospheric and underground tests at Moruroa and its sister atoll of Fangataufa. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation says the tests have left a radioactive core in the extinct undersea volcano that forms the base of the atolls. It said although the radioactivity was probably sealed off from the surrounding seas for the time being, there was a serious danger of leakage over the next 500-1000 years. What worries scientists is that the debris of past explosions was a half-life of at least 10,000 years. Greenpeace studies have shown radioactivity in plankton found near Moruroa, and plutonium in seawater. But most French health tests on the residents of French Polynesia are a military secret.
<P>
A decade after the bombing, the full reasons for the French sabotage operation in New Zealand are still unclear in spite of Paris eventually admitting responsibility after the cover-up was blown. A French government-ordered official inquiry headed by leading civil servant Bernard Tricot in August 1985 was widely rejected as a whitewash. While admitting French agents were involved, it cleared the government of ordering the sabotage.
<P>
However, in September, after further revelations of French involvement, Prime Minister Laurent Fabius admitted on state television that the French secret service DGSE had indeed sunk the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>,  and it had been covered-up. Defence Minister Charles Hernu was forced to resign and the DGSE chief, Admiral Pierre Lacoste, was sacked.
<P>
<B>Complicated plot</B><BR>
The scandal, dubbed 'Underwatergate', was a public relations disaster for France while Greenpeace's membership and finances soared. Thirteen secret agents -- one of them infiltrating the Auckland office of Greenpeace -- were used in the operation. One DGSE agent, tough former commando Christine Cabon, alias Frederique Bonlieu, made herself at home with Greenpeace and fed information about the Moruroa plans to her Paris headquarters. 
<P>
The plot by the DGSE -- codenamed Operation Satanic -- was complicated.  A Zodiac and Yamaha outboard motor were flown from Britain to New Caledonia. The bombs and diving equipment were obtained in Noumea and hidden on board a chartered 11-metre yacht, the <I>Ouvea.</I>   Four secret agents -- Chief Petty Officer Roland Verge, petty officers Gerald Andries and Jean-Michel Barcelo, and 'freelance physician' Dr Xavier Maniguet -- posed as tourists on a mid-winter diving voyage to New Zealand.  A second team of agents flew into Auckland from London posing as Swiss tourists on their honeymoon. They were Major Alain Mafart, deputy commander of France's Aspretto combat diving base, and Captain Dominique Prieur with the 'married' name of Turenge.
<P>
Eight days before the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   arrived in New Zealand on 7 July 1985, Operation Satanic's chief, Colonel Louis-Pierre Dillais (alias Jean-Louise Dormand), flew into Auckland from Los Angeles. He booked into a Kingsgate Hyatt hotel room with a birds' eye view of the environmental ship's berth. 
<P>
During the next two weeks, the <I>Ouvéa</I>   crew played out a Jacques Tati-like farce, seducing women and leaving obvious clues to their presence from Whangarei to Auckland. But they eventually linked up with the Turenges, and the bombs and sabotage gear were handed over. 
<P>
A third team of two divers, Camurier and Tonel, flew into Auckland a few hours before the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   arrived in Auckland from Vanuatu. Both men had false passports and claimed to be physical education instructors at Paofai Girls' College in Papeete. Their task was to mine the ship. After planting the bombs, Camurier was spotted by yachtsmen vigilantes on the lookout for petty thieves. He was loading  bags into the Turenges' rented campervan. The car number plate, LB8945, was jotted down and two days after the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   was sabotaged the fake honeymooners were detained by police on false passport charges.
<P>
<B>Evidence points to France </B><BR>
Evidence quickly pointed to French responsibility for the sabotage. Police flew to Norfolk Island to question the <I>Ouvea</I>    crew on their return voyage to Noumea. Although they had strong suspicions, the police did not have enough evidence for arrests. By the time the police got their act together, the <I>Ouvea</I>   had vanished. It had apparently been scuttled in the Coral Sea and the crew (apart from Dr Maniguet, who had earlier flown through Sydney) were picked up by the nuclear-powered submarine <I>Rubis</I>   which took them to Tahiti. Dillais, Camurier and Tonel posed as tourists in the South Island before quietly slipping out of New Zealand two weeks later. 
Meanwhile, the French Government denounced the sabotage and strongly denied any involvement. French press reports claimed the saboteurs were South African mercenaries, white New Caledonian anti-independence extremists or British agents -- anything to divert attention away from French involvement.
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../images/french.gif"  width=300 ALT="Cartoon about French secret agents.">
<BR><Font size=1>Cartoon: MALCOLM WALKER/Eyes of Fire<P>
<Font size=3>The dead photographer, Pereira, was claimed to be a KGB agent and the ship was said to be carrying secret espionage equipment -- claims which I found laughable after having lived on board for so long.  The Turenges were charged with murder and arson but they eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter and wilful damage. On 22 November 1985, Chief Justice Sir Ronald Davison sentenced them to 10 years' imprisonment.
<P>
Faced with steadily deteriorating relations with France after the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   bombing and threats to the country's trade future, the New Zealand Government sought international mediation.  Then United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ruled in June 1986 that France must make a formal apology for the attack and pay $13 million in compensation in return for a three-year deportation of Mafart and Prieur to Hao Atoll, a military base in French Polynesia. Greenpeace was warded $8 million compensation from France by the International Arbitration Tribunal. It finally towed the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   to New Zealand's Matauri Bay and 'buried' it off Motutapere in the Cavalli Islands on 12 December 1987.
<P>
But the affair did not end there. The same day the French government told New Zealand Mafart had a serious 'stomach complaint' and repatriated him to Paris in defiance of the terms of the United Nations agreement and protests from Prime Minister Lange's government.  Mafart was smuggled out of Tahiti as a carpenter called Serge Quillan on a fake passport on 12 December  1987 -- hours before New Zealand was told he was being repatriated. Prieur was repatriated in May 1988 because she was pregnant. France ignored New Zealand's protests over the blatant breach of the agreement. 
<P>
In January 1987, I was detained at gunpoint by French troops near a military outpost, while on assignment in New Caledonia. After veiled accusations of my being a 'spy' and being held for several hours along with a Kanak pro-independence local government official without charge at Canala gendarmerie, we were finally released. News media reports at the time linked my arrest with intimidation over my <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   book <I>Eyes of Fire</I>   and my coverage of the Kanak struggle against French rule.  
<P>
The <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>   saga still leaves a bitter taste with most New Zealanders. Although Lange's Labour government was revered for standing firm on its nuclear-free policy, many New Zealanders have felt disillusioned with it for backing down under trade pressure and handing over the two jailed agents to French jurisdiction.
<P>
'You cannot sink a rainbow,' claimed a slogan peddled by nuclear-free campaigners in the months after the bombing. A cliche, but it's true.

<Font size=5>SHARE THE WHOLE VISION, GOOD NEWS AND BAD</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P> 
Image-massagers sprucing up Pacific government images aren't enough. While issues such as the raskol problem, land disputes and Bougainville remain unresolved, there will continue to be a 'bad press'.
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By DAVID ROBIE</B><P>
A FEW WEEKS ago our first-year journalism students were doing their examination in practical reporting. Their task was handling a press conference after a tragedy at sea off the coast of West New Britain. In a role play, the reporters were questioning National Disaster and Emergency Services chief Leith Anderson about a barge that had sunk with a young football team on board. They were told five bodies had been recovered. The question by one reporter was: were the bodies dead?
<P>
At first glance, you might wonder well why am I using this anecdote in the context of today's discussion theme about how the media portray the region. In fact, it leads to an important issue when we consider many criticisms levelled at the news media reporting in the Pacific-- frequently the criticisms focus on semantics. Often at the heart of criticism is a misconception by governments and corporations that somehow the media should only reflect the 'good news', that it shouldn't be too negative or too picky -- especially when it is news for overseas consumption. 
In other words, it should perform some sort of quasi-public relations role. This notion doesn't accept a basic rationale for news media coverage of holding a mirror to society. It doesn't accept the argument that if well informed, a society is able to benefit from  genuine participatory democracy, informed debate and wiser decisions. This point of view hasn't got the foggiest idea of what news is really about.
<P>
The bottom line for the news media is that journalism is information in the public interest -- not information in the corporate  interest. Not information in the government interest. These are the hallmarks of public relations. Unfortunately, many journalists in PNG and in some other Pacific countries swap between public relations and journalism jobs with such regularity that it isn’t surprising that real journalism -- information in the public interest -- is forgotten.
<P>
This happens in other countries too. But the news media organisation usually has sufficient depth among its senior editorial staff to shrug off losses to public relations. In most Pacific countries, the loss of one or two top reporters, particularly specialists, to public relations or press secretary jobs leaves big gaps that are hard to fill. Hence the sort of problem that the Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, was talking about yesterday -- the glut of young and inexperienced reporters without background or a sense of history.
<P>
In the 1960s, as television was evolving into our principal source of information, the philosopher and media critic Raymond Williams wrote a series of essays with a vision for TV. Williams made a case for a broadcasting service that was neither commercially driven, nor paternalistic. He argued for something simple, but elusive -- that the media ought to be the voice of the people, not the voice of the state and its powerful friends. In other words, a free people deserve a truly free media.
<P>
Papua New Guinea today is perhaps better served by its constitutionally guaranteed free media than many countries in the region -- certainly this is so with its newspapers. In spite of overseas ownership of the two major dailies, there is a genuine choice with newspapers. The Murdoch-owned <I>Post-Courier</I>, Malaysian-owned <I>National</I> and the PNG-owned -- through its mainstream churches -- <I>Saturday Independent</I> and <I>Wantok</I> are very diverse papers with contrasting news values. Whatever arguments might be made about the <I>National's</I> perceived links with the logging industry, it has made a refreshing debut with technological excellence unmatched elsewhere in the region. It has also given a vision of the Asia-Pacific region which is rather more dynamic than that usually given by the traditional and rather parochial Australasian media influences in the Pacific.
<P>
The new <I>Saturday Independent</I> is really <I>The Times</I> dressed up for the weekend, but thankfully it still tries to keep its thoughtful and in-depth look at major issues. And this is the one paper that makes consistent and substantial use of non-government organisations — an important news source in environmental and sustainable development issues — which are too often neglected by some of the region's media. 
<P>
In recent years, governments in PNG and other countries have spent heavily on public relations consultants and other image-massagers to spruce up their international reputation. I would argue that governments doing this are barking up the wrong tree, particularly wasting money on propaganda exercises in these stringent economic times. There are always going to be negative stories, especially given the nature of some countries' serious social problems such as in Papua New Guinea today. The issues of 'raskols' and spiralling crime, landowner disputes over major resource development projects and Bougainville -- as long as they remain unresolved -- will continue to generate a so-called bad press abroad. 
<P>
Remarkably, the negative headlines get recycled here as well. For example, one paper earlier this year published a Page 3 lead news story headlined PAPER HITS PNG IMAGE: DAMAGING REPORT ON NATION'S PROBLEMS.(1) This is a case of semantics. The story paraphrased three articles written by visiting reporter Paul McGeough and published in the <I>Sydney Morning Herald</I>. It highlighted such factors as given by the headline, A NATION WASTED BY GREED AND CORRUPTION, accompanied by blow up pictures of men with guns, tomahawks, bows and arrows and clubs.
Other points made included the view that international lenders had lost patience with PNG and had demanded hard policy changes as a condition for loans. Yet the report in one of Port Moresby's dailies was itself a biased and selective summary of the articles. The PNG reporter indulged in editorialising in the report saying things such as: 'It could not be established whether the pictures run were genuine "rascals" which the paper referred to or just security guards or other people gathered for compensation gatherings  which is common in the Highlands.' Next thing we would have the reporter denying there is a rascal problem.
<P>
In any case, the story was published in <I>The National</I> next to an item about three villagers from the Darai Hills of the Wewi area who had come to Gordons armed with traditional hunting gear. (2) They were sampling city life and nobody questioned whether they were 'authentic'.
Earlier this year, <I>Pacific Islands Monthly</I> was castigated for an allegedly unfair report at the time of the Pope's visit.(3) Among complaints about the story were a mention of potholes in the roads. As somebody who has had his car springs wrecked on several giant-sized potholes, I cannot say that I could find much wrong with the report. 
<P>
Again, it comes back to semantics. A front page banner headline in the Post-Courier shouting the latest crime outrage is just straitforward news reporting. But an article about the process of crime and justice and the difficulties confronted by PNG dealing with them published in say, The Independent, a national business weekly in Auckland, is an outrageous embarrassment and might scare off investors. It doesn't matter that it is true. 
<P>
And when governments go overboard denying economic and social problems that are widely known to be true, their credibility suffers.
<P>Now to take a slightly different tack, I'd like to discuss a recent SBS Dateline television documentary, 'PNG: Under the Spell',(4) which caused more than ripples here. I will show you just a brief glimpse of the report so that you can get a sense of the context. 
<P>
<I>'PNG: Under the Spell'</I>
<P>
This report was by Helen Vatsikopoulos, who won a Walkley Award three years ago for her international reporting on the Commonwealth. She has also stirred controversy with a report on politics in Malaysia and covered the demise of the Berlin Wall. I watched her well-documented report one weekend last month. The report was particularly damning about some of the country's political elite -- not to mention Sir Charles' coup comment -- and I expected to see several followup stories in both PNG dailies on Monday morning.
<P>
Unbelievably, there wasn't a word -- apart from a paragraph in the Drum column in the Post-Courier which mentioned the 'hot' program and challenged EMTV chief executive John Taylor to show it. A challenge, I might add, that he enthusiastically took up. But I'll come back to that in a moment.
<P>
By the end of the week there was still not a single news story in either daily -- or even in the Times -- even though much of Moresby was talking about it. As I had taped the program, we showed it to student journalists a few hours after it was originally broadcast on SBS. We then led the front page in Uni Tavur on the program's allegations.
<P>
Yet it still wasn't until 11 days after the broadcast that the Post-Courier finally ran a news story and the National ran a letter of complaint about the program — only because by then EMTV too had broadcast the program. And it took two weeks for a response by the Prime Minister who described the program as exaggerated.
<P>
EMTV must be highly commended for broadcasting this program so the issues could properly be debated. And EMTV must be also commended for showing a sequel -- canvassing the strong public reaction -- which is being broadcast tonight under the title 'Are We Under the Spell?'(5) I would rate these responses as part of my vision for news media seeking greater interaction with the people and truly serving the public interest.
<P>
Pacific news media tend to look at major issues within a narrow framework usually defined by international news services as filtered by the major regional 'gatekeeper' Australian Associated Press (AAP). A classic example of this is how O J Simpson became a major story in the Pacific. Who gives a damn? And why have Pacific news editors so readily allowed their news values to be colonised?
<P>
Another example is the news debate, or rather lack of debate about privatisation and the World Bank GATT, NAFTA, and APEC etc etc ... Our news media only report on these issues with one-sided spectacles. 
<P>
When you next read about GATT, NAFTA and APEC look for any mention of the fact that these agreements of so-called free trade are resigned to ensure that the wealth of the world remains with one fifth of the world's population, controlling three-quarters of the world's resources. It is unlikely you'll see it -- or that in barely a half century one-seventh of the world's population will control most of its natural wealth. Where are the journalists questioning the real benefits or costs to the Pacific?
<P>
Now to move to another example, a program made by NZ's Frontline investigative reporter Rod Vaughan called 'The Tiongs' -- and understandably a damning report about the rapacious logging practices of Rimbunan Hijau in Sarawak and Papua New Guinea, and troubled investments in New Zealand. (6)
<P>
<I>'The Tiongs'</I>
<P>
Remarkably this program has never been shown on television in PNG. Nor has it been reported -- even though it had far more revealing information than the ABC's Four Corners 'Bush Bugarap' documentary last year. 'Bush Bugarap' was widely reported on two successive days in the Post-Courier but was ignored by The National. And I don't think the reticence over the Tiongs report has had anything to do with litigation threats reported in New Zealand.
<P>
In fact, Television New Zealand was later forced to broadcast an apology to Rimbunan Hijau's local subsidiary Ernslaw One Ltd for the allegedly 'unfair' Tiongs investigation.(7) 'The Broadcasting Standards Authority,' reported The National, 'ordered TVNZ to apologise after it found that the station's Frontline program was "neither fair nor balanced".' The Malaysian logging group  has a penchant for filing defamation or other cases against media and non-government organisations in the region. In PNG, RH has a defamation case pending against NBC's Radio Kalang and talkback host Roger Hau'ofa while in Malaysia it is pressing a lawsuit against a rainforest community action group.
<P> 
It is intriguing to see the extent to which the company apparently wants to 'sanitise' its logging reputation in PNG and Sarawak in New Zealand where it is a fast-growing newcomer as a forestry investor.(8) The BSA has a statutory duty to uphold NZ's Television Code of Broadcasting Practice (something PNG's own ill-fated National Information and Communication Policy was trying to do). A key element of this is the overall standard G6: 'To show balance, impartiality and fairness in dealing with political matters, current affairs and all questions of a controversial nature.' Another, standard G19, reads: 'Care must be taken in the editing of the program material to ensure that the extracts used are a true reflection and not a distortion of the original event or the overall views expressed.'
<P>
Of course, when it comes to the crunch any open-ended definitions such as these are bound to be subject to wide interpretation -- especially when dealing with investigative journalism which by its very nature sets out to establish a hypothesis, or case. So it wouldn't be surprising, given the facts of the Tiongs investigation, that this ruling itself would be rather controversial.
<P>
The ruling, following an exchange of letters between TVNZ and Ernslaw One's solicitors, found Frontline breached standard G6 by not dealing with Ernslaw One's environmental and business practices in a 'balanced, impartial and fair manner'. But the BSA also decided that the program did not breach standard G19 and declined to uphold any other aspects of the RH group's complaint. The authority said it seemed that TVNZ had adopted the approach that the operations of Ernslaw One in NZ were suspect 'because of the questionable operations of the Tiong family companies in PNG and Sarawak'.
<P> 
 Incidentally, award-winning reporter Rod Vaughan ran into a spot of bother recently in the Cook Islands too. After filming for six days for a report on the Cook Islands economy, his crew was ordered by Immigration to stop filming because they didn't have a work permit. And to add salt to the wound, the award-winning reporter and TVNZ were reported to have been accused by the Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry, of 'being a front for  a CIA plot to subvert government'.(9)
<P>
With such astonishing ability to shoot themselves in the foot, governments needn't bother wasting money on public relations consultants. Surely it makes more sense for governments to encourage journalists to come here. And the same applies to any Pacific country. If there is indeed a vision for the country, or the region, then share it with the world.
<P>
Abolish this nonsense of requiring journalists to have a special business or work permit. Allow them in on ordinary tourist visas without obstacles. Journalists don't fit ordinary business criteria -- they are not negotiating export markets, they're not working for profit. In fact, they have usually come here at great cost to their news media company -- or to their own pocket if they are freelance. They are simply dealing in information for the public.
<P>
After all, travel writers rarely face these sorts of problems -- their stories are always welcomed as safe, good news. I don't buy the argument that negative stories will necessarily harm development and investment. Potential investors want accurate information not 'glossing over' of problems. In any case, surveys show that they tend to rely on information from knowledgeable colleagues rather than the news media.
<P>
With a wider range of serious journalists on assignment in PNG and other Pacific countries, the more negative reports would tend to be balanced in the long run by a variety of in-depth articles and reports dealing with many of the positive developments and achievements of the nation. And at no cost to the national budget. 
<P>
Why not start now and open the door fully and enthusiastically to journalists for the 20th independence celebrations. Share the vision with the world.
To conclude, I'd like to share this quote -- thanks to Kunda Dixit. It is from Robert Savio, director-general of the Inter Press Service:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
There is no development without participation,
There is no participation without communication,
And there is no communication without information.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
And this is the vision I leave with you -- that the Pacific gains a truly free media that the free people of the region deserve.

<Font size=5>RABUKA AND THE REPORTER</F5><P>
<Font size=4>A controversy over a sexual liaison between Fiji prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and a <I>Fiji Times</I> journalist led to threats to deregister <I>The Review</I> -- the news magazine that broke the story.
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By editorial staff of The Review, Fiji</B>
<P>
<Font size=3>IN FIJI, during March and April 1994, there was mixed reception about a controversial sex scandal cover story about Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka published in the monthly news magazine The Review. The reveation stunned readers; many were appalled by the fact that Rabuka preached about Christian ethics and a way of life for the country while committing adultery. 'However unsavoury the details, the story had to be told," said The Review.
<P>
The Fiji Times reporter involved in the controversy sparked off the reports by openly discussing her brief fling with Rabuka -- and it appeared to become common knowledge.
<P>
The day after The Review hit the streets, the Daily Post ran a front-page story based on a statement supposedly issued by the Prime Minister's Office on legal action against The Review and Ratu Inoke Kubuabola. However, The Review defiantly weathered the controversy and threats to deregister the magazine. The following is a diary of the controversy compiled by The Review:
<P>
<B>Wednesday, 16 March 1994:</B> Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka's leadership was challenged barely a month after his election victory by Ratu Inoke Kubuabola, Cakaudrove member of Parliament, on the basis that the Prime Minister had offered the opposition National Federation Party a coalition partnership without consulting the Bose Levu Vakaturaga (Great Council of Chiefs) and secondly that the Prime Minister had committed adultery with a woman journalist during the Cakaudrove provincial meeting.
<P>
At a meeting of the Soqosoqo Vakavulewa Ni Taukei (SVT) caucus, Rabuka admitted the adultery accusation, saying his wife and taiatala (pastor) had both forgiven him. Rabuka, a lay preacher, was also stripped of his pastoral duties. A stormy session broke out but in the interests of party unity, the members forgave Rabuka and asked him to stay clean.
<P> 
<B>Thursday, 17 March:</B> The scandal, which had been common knowledge for sometime was confirmed to The Review. The fact that the scandal was also confirmed unsuccessfully used as a political move to challenge Prime Minister Rabuka's leadership. After cross-checking with various sources among those at the caucus meeting, The Review compiled its April edition, leading it with the political showdown.
<P>
<B>Wednesday, 6 April:</B> The review came hot-off-the-press and copies were delivered and air-mailed to subscribers.
<P>
<B>Thursday, 7 April:</B> The magazine hit the newsstands in the capital, Suva, promoted by the Daily Post's front page story reporting that Prime Minister Rabuka would sue The Review and Kubuabola.
<P>
The SVT issued a four-point statement confirming the story indirectly by condemning the 'leakage' of what it called confidential information, signed by party secretary-general Dr Filimone Wainiqolo.
<P>
<B>Friday, 8 April:</B> Information Minister Ratu Josefa Dimuri [a onetime Fiji Times journalist] slammed the Post front-page story saying the statement to the Post from the Prime Minister's Office was unauthorised. Dimuri told the Post that the SVT appreciated the Prime Minister's sincerity and openness in the way he handled the matter and the party had rallied to support him.
<P>
Kubuabola was also reported in the same story as saying he wasn't worried and that he would tell all if he was taken to court by Rabuka.
<P>
<B>Saturday, 9 April:</B> The Fiji Times first mentioned the controversy by quoting Information Minister Dimuri.
<P>
<B>Monday, 11 April:</B> The Fiji Times beat up the Post's Friday front-page story with the headline SVT LEAK A LIE and reported Dimuri as saying that if he had the power he would deregister The Review over its sources. The minister added he would push for a review of the Media Registration Act.  The story drew condemnation from news media organisations.
<P>
<B>Tuesday, 12 April:</B> Opposition Leader Jai Ram Reddy described Dimuris threat in the Times as 'disturbing, frightening and extreme'. All National Congress MP David Pickering, Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry and Fijian Association party chairman Josevata Kamikamica also condemned Dimuri's threats.
<P>
<B>Wednesday, 13 April:</B> Dimuri issued a statement saying that Rabuka had offered to quit as Prime Minister in March after the accusations of adultery were made. 'The Prime Minister told Ratu Inoke that he would not deny the accusation of adultery,' Dimuri said.
<P>
Kubuabola countered that Dimuri's statement contained inaccuracies and claimed it was designed to discredit him [Kubuabola].
<P>
<B>Thursday, 14 April:</B> The SVT, two Independents and the General Voters Party members supported the Budget in its second reading with 37 votes to defeat the Opposition. A pleased Rabuka told the Times that the scandal had been resolved and put to rest.
<P>
<B>Friday, 15 April:</B> The Budget was adopted.
<P>
<B>Tuesday, 19 April:</B> The weekly Weekender hit the streets, citing 'national security reasons' for not publishing the previous week. It was going to implicate Rabuka further, the paper said.
<P>
<B>Sunday, 24 April:</B> Weekender publisher Jo Nata was arrested and charged with criminal trespass.
<P>
[<B>The Weekender named the woman at the centre of the affair in its delayed April 15 issue as Fiji Times reporter Wainikiti Waqa. The weekly reported:</B> Wainikiti continued working with the Fiji Times despite an obvious breach of ethics. 'Skirt journalism' is regarded with contempt by the journalism fraternity outside Fiji. The Fiji Times is unabe to take any action unless Wainikiti is named as a woman journalist referred to in The Review disclosure. Rabuka later confirmed that the woman concerned was Wainikiti. Wainikiti neither confirmed nor denied that she was having an affair with the Prime Minister. The liaison with Rabuka occurred at Caukadrove Provincial Council meeting on 13 October 1993. Wainikiti was in Taveuni to cover the meeting for the Fiji Times].

<Font size=5>PAPUA NEW GUINEA: UNDER THE SPELL</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P>
Corruption and law and order problems beset Papua New Guinea in its 20th year of independence. Says former Governor of the Central Bank, Sir Mekere Morauta: 'This nation is under the spell of the statement that we are rich. So our riches will deliver us from the evils, from our own evils. They didn't. Where are we now?'
</I>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By HELEN VATSIKOPOULOS</B>
<P>
IT'S THE FIRST day of the year's parliamentary term in Papua New Guinea. One that this year, 1995, will see the country celebrate two decades of independence.
<P>
RABBIE NAMALIU (Speaker of Parliament): <B>In our 20th anniversary of independence, the country is at the crossroads. We need Christ's guidance if we are to get on the right road.</B>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu, in this, his first term as Speaker, has introduced the practice of prayer breakfasts -- to bless the decision makers. Well may he pray for divine intervention, for the failures of Government have been many and for spiritual guidance the've invited an infamous mortal-cum role model.
<P>
NAMALIU: <B>Please welcome Sitiveni Rabuka and Mrs Rabuka...</B> (Applause.)
<P>
BERNARD NAROKOBI (Agriculture Minister): <B>Let us pray... thank you for brother Rabuka, we have often misunderstood him... In our desire for power and wealth, we neglect our people, we are greedy... We fight in tribal fights... no wonder the country has been brought to its knees. In Parliament we are seen as cats and dogs.
<P>
Oh Father, wash our people, cure payback.
<P>
Oh Lord, we pray for peace in Bougainville.
<P>
Amid wealth we are poor, we cry for help.</B>
<P>
A big wish list, indeed.
<P>
Papua New Guinea, for all its Third World problems, has resources that are the envy of first world economies. Gold, copper, oil, gas, fisheries and forests in abundance. Yet late last year it faced a serious cash crisis, currency devaluation and float [of the kina] and faced the wrath of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for unsustainable and high risk economic management. This isn't surprising at all to Sir Mekere Morauta, the head of the country's Central Bank until he was sacked by Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan.
<P>
SIR MEKERE MORAUTA: <B>Because I publicly disagreed with Chan and engineered his removal as Minister of Finance in 1994. Because he had prepared in 1993 and 1994 the most disastrous and most inappropriate budgets since independence. [Besides these factors there were also] the fiscal and social problems enveloping us with the closure of the Bougainville mine.</B>
<P>
This country is seen by everyone to be very very rich, yet why is it still so poor?
<P>
MORAUTA: <B>I am the only one who has not agreed with that statement for a long, long time.  A true statement is that this country is potentially rich and I underline potentially.  One of the problems we're facing now [is] why did we not make the necessary and immediate adjustment post-Bougainville?  It's because this nation is under the spell of the statement that we are rich.  So our riches will deliver us from the evils, from our own evils. [They] didn't.  Where are we now?</B>
<P>
It's a question that many villagers want to ask their local members, politicians they hardly ever see. Where are the resource riches, will they ever see the benefits?
<P>
KALA BOGAGU (Village magistrate): <B>Nothing.  When the election comes they come here to help us, give some money to youth. the people and the women's fellowship -- that's all we know.</B>
<P> 
So they give you some money? 
<P>
BOGAGU: <B>Yes, they gave about K1000 or K2000 to the women's fellowship and youth group.</B>
<P>
Before the election. After the election, do they give you anything?
<P>
BOGAGU: <B>Nothing at all.</B>
<P>
The villagers cry out for development, some new fishing boats... and a sewerage system a little more modern than this one. [Visual of outhouse over the sea]. Politicians are given a yearly electoral development fund to spend on such schemes.
<P>
The Electoral Development Fund began as a rural development fund. MPs were given K10,000 a year to spend on their electorates in self-help schemes to better the lives of the people.  But over the years the fund grew to K300,000.  It became a temptation and a trap. [Multiplying] K300,000 times 109 politicians is K32 million a year and now people are asking can the nation afford it any longer?
<P>
BOGAGU: <B>I think in some villages [the MPs] give to them but not in my village. </B>
<P>
Do you think it's a good thing that politicians have K300,000 every year?
<P>
BOGAGU: <B>We heard the news about the K300,000 but we don't know where this money goes.</B>
<P>
Postponed by four months and eagerly awaited by all, including the World Bank/IMF, the Budget that promised to cut the fat -- 4,500 public servants would lose their jobs, spending would be cut.
<P>
WAYNE GOLDING (President, PNG Chamber of Manufacturers): <B>It's a responsible Budget, we couldn't go on overspending.</B>
<P>
And what about that politicians' slush fund?
<P>
SIR MEKERE  MORAUTA: <B>That should be eliminated absolutely immediately.  But now they've added another K200,000.</B> [Morauta mistakenly said K200 million in the interview]. <B>Added K200,000.  So each member will have half a million kina.  Each Member will have K500,000 -- K300,000 is for him to spend on the projects that he conceives as priority to himself.  The K200,000 is tied to projects that maybe provincial governments or electoral people, his electors, will elect. So he has K500,000.</B>
<P>
SIR JULIUS CHAN (Prime Minister): <B>No you have it all wrong. It hasn't increased.</B>
<P>
It may be a matter of interpretation. But most people agree, including the Australian Government, which provides K300 million in aid every year that the slush fund has gone up.
<P>
BERNARD NAROKOBI (at the prayer breakfast): <B>You all look so serious. What crime are you about to commit?</B>
<P>
And that's not a very funny joke in political circles these days. In the past ten years, politicians have been charged with misappropriating their Electoral Development Fund. It's become a disturbing trend.
<P>
For the past ten years, this man has been the bane of politician's lives. Sir Charles Maino was the Chief Ombudsman, until Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan had him replaced. Sir Charles is highly respected, and very outspoken, particularly when it comes to modern leadership.
<P>
SIR CHARLES MAINO: <B>Traditional leadership, I must say, is very strong. For instance, up in the Highlands we have a 'big man' system. This is a system whereby anyone from scratch, so long as he is wealthy, [becomes] a leader -- he's a big man.
<P>
He's a recognised figure in Highlands society.  The question then -- sometimes I have been sitting back days and nights scratching my head in my previous job as Chief Ombudsman -- has this sort of mentality had any effect on the current leadership at a political level?  And I'm afraid to say, it tends to be.
<P>
They tend to think OK, back in the traditional society of the Highlands no matter how I acquire wealth, so long as I've got wealth, I am a man.  Why not here now?  In order to be a big man, I've got to be rich. A lot of young people today think that the only way to become wealthy is to become a politician. A lot of stupid politicians smile about such a statement, when they should take it as an insult.</B>
<P>
In the past ten years, the Obudsman's Office has investigated 25 politicians. Fifteen have been charged with corruption, many resigned and so escaped prosecution, while ten went to jail.
<P>
Gabriel Ramoi works in the office of the Deputy Prime Minister.  He has finished serving a two-year jail sentence for misappropriating his Electoral Development Fund.  Several years ago, he was a young Minister for Communications and thought highly of as a prime ministerial hopeful.  That was until he chartered an aircraft to fly two rock bands to his electorate, just prior to an election.
<P>
GABRIEL RAMOI: <B>[I did it for] two purposes.  One, [it would] help raise funds politically, it would give me political mileage, it would make me look good -- there's a rock bank playing in those places.  
<P>
Second, members of these rock bands come from my electorate.  The court said it was wrong, I could not possibly have used that kind of fund for that purpose and the interpretation was that these funds had been used to promote myself and getting into Parliament. It is wrong. You're not supposed to do that and as a result of that I went to prison.</B>
<P>
But the cases referred to the country's Leadership Tribunal reveal worse abuses than that.
<P>
In 1991, Deputy Prime Minister and Forests Minister Ted Diro was found guilty of 86 counts of misconduct in office, including receiving money from a foreign army general, benefits from foreign companies, lying to an inquiry into the forestry industry and misappropriating Government money. He resigned before he could be fined and dismissed.
<P>
In 1992, Tony Ila, MP, was found guilty of 42 counts of misconduct, including abuse of his Electoral Development Fund, using public money to pay his medical bills and misleading the Ombudsman's Office. He resigned before he could be prosecuted.
<P>
Then there was the famous case of the ex-ministers, Melchior Pep, Peter Garong, Timothy Bonga and Galen Lang.  They'd written to the then Prime Minister, Rabbie Namaliu, seeking payment of money for various unauthenticated projects following their decision to volutarily resign from the ministry just before a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. They allegedly committed political blackmail. They were recommended for dismissal.
<P>
And, recently, the case of Phillip Laki, [who was] found guilty on 25 counts of misconduct, including misuse of his electoral development fund. His dismissal was recommended.
<P>
SIR CHARLES MAINO: <B>I have named a number of leaders who have been prosecuted under the Leadership Code who I said should have been prosecuted under the Criminal Code for misappropriating public funds.  Slush funds are public funds, therefore they should be prosecuted under the Criminal Code and these people should be behind bars.  
<P>
For instance, with due respect to Phillip Laki who we prosecuted last March.  He used about K800,000 of those funds to set up a wholesale in his province -- a couple of trade stores. Because the tribunal doesn't have the power to order the confiscation of these properties, the guy is enjoying the proceeds of his misappropriation.  I bet he's still running the wholesale. I bet he's still running those stores, so he has suffered nothing.</B>
<P>
As Papua New Guinea enters its 20th year of independence and loosens its ties with Australia, like Australia it is seeking closer ties with Asia.  A few years ago this motto translated into Government policy.  It was called 'look north' and its architect was the then Prime Minister Paias Wingti.
<P>
PAIAS WINGTI (Opposition Leader): <B>That is where our future is in terms of trade, in terms of investment. So when I decided to take that position, I took it on a bigger scale, looking at the future of this country in the region.  <P>
We belong to this region and we have to live with Indonesia, we have to live with China, we have to live with the Asian countries -- and Australia and New Zealand are now doing the same -- so we made the right decision.</B>
<P>
But there are members of the established business community of Papua New Guinea who are questioning the decision. They won't say it publicly, but certain economists and even the Ombudsman's Office have been questioning projects negotiated with Asian partners.
<P>
For example, Halla Resources, a South Korean company, was granted a cement manufacturing monopoly.  They were allowed a total import ban and a guarantee of 15 per cent profit above production costs.  Why do this?
<P>
JOHN MILLETT (Director, Institute of National Affairs):  <B>Would you like me do this without becoming angry or...</B>
<P>
Economists like John Millett say this development theory of pushing to industrialise despite the costs which was popular in the 1950s and 60s and since fallen into disfavour, is now being resurrected in PNG.
<P>.
MILLETT: <B>Unfortunately that sort of analysis doesn't take into account the jobs in the rest of the economy that will be killed off by introducing inefficient industries which tend to raise the general cost and price level in the economy. For example, the project you mentioned, cement. When we switched to local production there was roughly a 50 per cent increase in price.</B>
<P>
Yet another curious example is the decision to grant a  Malaysian company, FIMA, a tinned mackerel monopoly. Tinned fish is an important part of the local diet and the cost has already risen since the kina's devaluation and float.
<P>
MILLETT: <B>The only trouble is that it's a cold water mackerel so we're going to import the basic raw materials and of course we have no steel industry so we'll have to import the can that we put the imported raw material into. So the local value added is quite small and, unfortunately, the consumer will probably have to pay a substantially higher price for it.</B>
<P>
In Port Moresby, work is underway for housing for the country's armed forces valued at US$55.5 million. The contract went to a Malaysian company without going to tender.  All the materials are imported from Malaysia and neither the company nor its expatriate staff pay tax.  Some bureaucrats will insist that this is an aid project because US$5.5 million was donated by the Malaysian Government but the other $50 million was borrowed from four Malaysian banks.
<P>
The Ombudsman's report slammed the project, saying the people of PNG will be paying for this for many years to come.  It should have been vetted by a parliamentary works committee and approved by Parliament first. So how did it get through?
<P>
SIMON PENTANU (Chief Ombudsman): <B>I guess it was a decision, a very political decision, so it was a matter that was decided at a political level without going through the required procedures at all.
<P>
So for that to happen was there a finding that perhaps there is corruption on the scale of money being taken to push the project through?</B>
<P>
PENTANU: <B>There have been suggestions -- and everyone I know can only conclude that someone must have benefitted from that kind of deal.</B>
<P>
Business leaders in PNG privately express concern at the change in doing business.  One prominent identity said the importation of this practice from the 'tiger' countries of Asia is known as 'bribenomics'.
<P>
This form of economics entails four criteria.  First, the cost of facilitation -- it cuts the red tape. Second, it must be of nationalist benefit to the country. Third, the benefits must be from the top to the bottom, and last it must not be a burden on the people.  When these [factors] aren't met it ceases to be bribenomics -- it's just plain corruption.
<P>
PENTANU: <B>Bribenomics is already in PNG and I think it's a concern to a lot of people.</B>
<P>
SIR CHARLES MAINO: <B>I've been hearing that if you put Somare's head in a passport and hand it over the counter, [there is] no problem [for] you getting a visa.</B>
<P>
How much is Somare's head? 
<P> 
MAINO: <B>Somare's head is a 50 kina note. </B>
<P> 
And even a work permit...
<P>
SIR MEKERE MORAUTA: <B>It's got to a stage now [when] I think it would be fair for me to describe corruption as both systemic and systematic.  Systemic because it has invaded the whole process of policy making and decision making. It has drowned the whole system, so it's systemic.  It's systematic because it's organised.  
<P>
You talk to private sector people here, particularly [those] you call the whiteys and none of them will say this publicly because they will be deported. Nothing goes through cabinet without a minder approaching you and saying, 'Hey, K100,000 ? K200,000 kina? Because I can make sure that your submission for a licence to do this, or approval to do that, would be organised.' But there's a price. Everyone talks about it.</B>
<P>
There seems to be a lack of respect for the institutions of government?
<P>
SIR JULIUS CHAN: <B>In Queensland, you also have corruption. In the end, we're all human.</B>
<P>
Far away from the major cities, there's little development. The villagers struggle on in very much the same way they have been for decades.  But lately they've found that the resources on their tribal land are very much sought after by foreigners from countries in the north.
<P>
The most keenly contested sector is forestry. At the moment it is Asian-dominated, and of the Asian companies the Malaysians are the most active. They've been negotiating contracts directly with the landowners.  Contracts that the World Bank says are unfair. Many of the landowners are unaware of the true worth of their assets and are new to negotiating business deals.
<P>
SIR PAULIAS MATANE (elder statesman and author): <B>We invite people to come here and make arrangements sometimes with the village people.  Give say K300,000  to a group of people -- just cut, cut, cut. They don't care if there is deforestation or something, they just go and cut.  Then they take the timber away.  And I asked them, 'Do you really want to receive this K300,000  from these foreign people to develop your area?' They said: 'Yes'.
<P> 
I said: 'Why?'
<P> 
'This is a lot of money.'
<P>
Yes, it's true. It is a lot of money to the people in the village. But when we had a look at the timber and we made some very rough calculations we found that if they harvest the trees by themselves -- cutting only the trees they need and leaving the others so that the environment is intact -- if they did this, they would make K63 million. 
<P>
 And nobody tells them this.</B>
<P>
The province of West New Britain accounts for 70 per cent of all the country's log exports. But there are great social divisions developing as a result of this industry.
<P>
At the premier's office in the capital Kimbe, there's a steady stream of disgruntled landowners. Some landowners feel the less aware members of their communities have signed away resources without regard to the future.
<P>
FRANCIS AMON (a landowner): <B>Unfortunately, the people are not seeing the real benefit of the forest industries. [It is] kind of going only [to a] very few people who are really benefitting from it.</B>
<P>
So what has this done to the society -- some people getting money [while] others are getting nothing?
<P>
AMON: <B>For a start I see we have a kind of class system existing within the logging operation. You have the ordinary people down there and the managers up there -- way up there.  That's the problem.</B>
<P>
Francis Amon is the nephew of Andrew Posai, also a landowner, who until a few weeks ago was the Forests Minister. At that stage [Posai] denied he had a conflict of interest, and was lobbing to change the the Forestry Act in order to fast-track logging projects. He also downplayed allegations of corruption that were made against him.
<P>
ANDREW POSAI (sacked Forests Minister): <B>I don't think it's such a very important issue that it can be referred to the tribunal.  I believe in that. I know, for sure, that I can come out of it whether [or not] it's referred to the tribunal.  I will still come out of it, but it's all politics.</B>
<P> 
Andrew Posai has been referred to the leadership tribunal on 30 counts of corruption -- including the diversion of public money to a company in which he had an interest, and  failing to furnish the Ombudsman's Commission with details of his electoral development fund spending. 
<P>
He is one of two politicians currently facing the Leaderhip Tribunal. [In July 1995, Posai was found guilty on 30 counts of misconduct or misappropriation in office. He was dismissed from cabinet and the commisson was forced to discontinue its investigation.]
<P>
The forestry fortfolio has now been taken over by Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan.
<P>
The largest forestry company is Rimbunan Hijau, which is believed to control more than half of all logging licences.   It is also responsible for the majority of complaints as well.  Most of these seem to fall on deaf ears, but recently the Department of Environment and Conservation followed through [on their complaints].
<P>
TIM NEVILLE (former Forests Minister, 1992-94): <B>They came up with 22 cases of breaking the conditions under their permit and some of them are very serious.  
<P>
As a matter of fact, they'll all really serious. One was that they haven't been doing any reafforestation; they have been logging immediately around a protected lake, alongside streams; and they're supposed to stay back within a certain number of metres. They were going right up to the stream and going through it.</B>
<P>
Dateline sought to secure an interview with the PNG managing director of Rimbunan Hijau, Francis Tiong.  He declined.
<P>
POWES PARKOP (lawyer, Individual and Community Rights Advocacy Forum, ICRAF): <B>I think Asian business and Asian culture has very limited social responsibility. Subjected to other concerns, it is purely business -- it's a very crude operation.  We are here to make money and that's it.  Never mind the social impact.  Never mind the cultural impact.  
<P>
And the criteria is only money and this is a problem in itself  -- [as] we will start beginning to see things only in that criteria.  Money, money, money.</B>
<P>
We returned to Rimbunan Hijau with another request. We wanted to ask questions -- about breaking environmental guidelines; about not engaging in reaforestation, about breaking promises to landowners; and about engaging in divide and rule tactics in negotiations with traditional groups.  After several weeks of requesting the company, it suggested a spokesperson.  Curiously they suggested the Malaysian High Commissioner.
<P>
M. SANTHANANABAN (Malaysian High Commissioner in Port Moresby): <B>If any timber company, including Rimbunan Hijau, [is]  guilty or found to have contravened any of the laws in the country then it is for the PNG authorities to take action against them.  It does not help to make these allegations and not follow up on them.</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The Malaysian High Commissioner claims the Malaysian companies are here for the long haul, not just for the quick profit.  Rimbunan Hijau has set up its own newspaper, The National, known by some as the 'daily log'  to rival the other daily, Australian-controlled Post-Courier.  Malaysian companies are now into food processing, banking -- and even buying tea plantations. And there are quite a few PNG nationals who are becoming concerned.</B>
<P>TIM NEVILLE: <B>They're just becoming spectators in their own country and they don't realise we're going to have a situation -- I give it probably another 10 years -- very similar to Fiji which is predominately run by the Indo-Fijians and they control the power as far as all  economics is concerned in Fiji.</B>
<P>
Walking down Chinatown? The PNG leaders of the past few years have watched the tiger countries of Asia and are seeking to emulate them.  But the tiger countries have different political and value systems.  There is a growing fear that PNG will be pushed into Asia too quickly by its eager politicians and to the detriment of its people.
<P>
The new Chief Ombudsman is former parliamentary secretary Simon Pentanu. Mr Pentanu's greatest concern at the moment is the lack of accountability of the leaders.  He also wants better security for his staff who are constantly threatened. And more money to investigate because the guilty are becoming more sophisticated at covering their misdeeds.
<P>
SIMON PENTANU: <B>I'm looking at the assistance of AusAid, hopefully, to visit Australia -- specifically Canberra, NSW and Queensland -- where you have ICAC to establish some contact. So at least we can -- I mean it's not only a regional problem but an international problem -- so we can co-operate in the sharing of this kind of information.</B> 
<P> 
Dame Josephine Abaijah was the first woman elected to the PNG Parliament.  Today there are no women in the House.  Why not?
<P>
DAME JOSEPHINE ABAIJAH: <B>I maintain that I will not give money to somebody to vote for me. So I think that's one big reason.  The men can get money, the men can bribe. We are finding it very difficult for women to go around bribing people. I think this is where the country is going nowhere because here there is a lot of bribes, there is a lot of corruption, something that women don't want in this country.</B>
<P>
The nature of PNG politics is such that regular no-confidence motions limit the lifespan of any Government.  That means politicians face many elections and in PNG less than 60 per cent are ever returned.  Therefore they're in for a short time and some make the most of it.
<P>
CHRIS HAIVETA (Deputy Prime Minister): <B>There is a loss of faith. That has happened because the institutions are not functioning effectively.  For institutions to function effectively, you do not need just only politicians.  You need the public service, and also the people, and both the people and the public servants and the politicians have to understand how the institutions function. And in many cases where such instances have happened there has never been any marriage between the two groups.</B>
<P>
The Public Services Commission at independence was an independent body. Since 1986, it has been answerable to the Government of the day. And this has left it open to abuse. As politicians rewarded cronies and relations -- the wantoks -- with prized jobs in their departments, it has set into motion a bureaucratic malaise.
<P>
NAPOLEON LEOSI (Public Employees Association): <B>If you're in power you want someone to simply say yes to you and anybody who reasons with you is not worth employing. And that also is affecting the public service.  So we're weeding out people that should be in the system and bringing in people that should not in the first place be considered for employment.</B>
<P>
In the meantime, the law and order situation is a disaster.  So much so, that capital punishment is once again on the agenda.
<P>
LEOSI: <B>Broad daylight killings at gunpoint.  It's a daily happening.  We live in cages and inside fences.  What is happening?</B>
<P>
DAME JOSEPHINE ABAIJAH: <B>Now women can't go from their homes to their gardens because of fear of being raped.  It's unfortunate.  I don't want to paint a picture that is negative -- this is my country and when I talk about it I want to give a good picture of it -- because I want to be proud of it. But how can I be proud of it when these are things that are happening?</B>
<P>
For many leaders there is a direct correlation between the increase in corruption and the increase in crime. If those at the top can do it, then there is nothing wrong with those at the bottom, with far less, doing the same. But the fears grow of a more menacing connection.
<P>
SIR CHARLES MAINO: <B>It's one of the fears I have and I hope that some of our political leaders, our politicians, don't go to that extent and lose their heads just for power and perks and privileges.  And in order to stop anyone from competing against them.  I hope they're not going to use these so-called youth groups as gangsters to get rid of those who may be potential [threats].</B>
<P>
Papua New Guinea celebrates 20 years of independence in September. This resource rich country has just signed a deal to develop the billion dollar Lihir project -- the biggest gold mine outside South Africa. But this country cannot boast about having the highest maternal mortality rate in the world.
<P>
In the past few weeks, representatives of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have been in the country negotiating a bail-out package with the Government -- the budget may have been passed early in March, but so far there is no agreement.  The Opposition is concerned that the Government will seek 'funny money'.
<P>
CHRIS HAIVETA: <B>We have our traditional friends but we must as a country not put too many of our eggs in one basket and allow the World Bank, the Australians or anyone else to dictate to us how this country is going to be run.</B>
<P>
SIR CHARLES MAINO: <B>I think what we need is a coup.  With due respect, I was glad that the Prime Minister of Fiji was here to talk to them.  I think what we need is a coup in Papua New Guinea.  We really and truly need a new direction of leadership.</B>
<P>
Two weeks ago Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan met Prime Minister Paul Keating in Cairns to seek help. Wanting an advance in aid money to see them through their economic crisis, they got a conditional promise, but Australia hinted it should not be asked again.
<P>
Papua New Guinea has moved in new directions. It has established new economic ties and forged new relationships. Two decades into independence, its people will be hoping that its leaders are making all the right moves.

<h4>Vol 1 No 1, November 1994</H4><P>
<Font size=5>NEW MESSAGE WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOUR</F5><P>
<Font size=3>AS A TRAINED librarian in a developing country who continuously advocates the need for regular and current information, and especially for the indigenous population, I am always sceptical and pessimistic on the first issue of any periodical. Like everything else in Papua New Guinea today, you have to take your chances in the 'land of the unexpected'.
<P>
However, this first issue of <B>Pacific Journalism Review</B> offers a smorgasbord of journalistic skills from James Pinder to Jessie Waibauru -- the experienced to the potential --  of issues current, retrospective and concurrent on communication and information, some more contentious than others, such as 'ecological genocide'. But the issue that is most prevalent in <B>PJR</B> is that of professional ethics, responsibility and accountability by journalists and media agencies and their role in informing and being informed without fear or favour.
<P>
<B>PJR</B> provides not only interesting reading but also an informative and often thought-provoking account of recent events in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific.
<P>
Also discussed throughout <B>PJR</B> is the major bone of contention -- NICP. Rev Oria Gemo, by design or not, omits to mention the National Information and Communication Council and alludes to a NIC Plan. The NICC must be established in order to revise the policy and to criticaly look at its viability. Papua New Guinea is the only country in the South Pacific to have a NIC policy. Whether it works or not depends on the foresight of the current ministry decision makers.
<P>
The the three papers represented at the July seminar are interesting reading for students, media researchers and those interested in the history of the role of the churches and journalism in communication and information.
Don't be surprised by the emotions you feel. Being informed of the truth, the facts as they happen, is what the <B>PJR</B> writers are about.
<P>
I welcome this new publication and look forward to future issues.

<Font size=5>VIBRANT, STIMULATING VIEW OF REGION'S NATIONALISM AND MEDIA</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P>
<B>Blood on their Banner: Nationalist Struggles in the South Pacific</B>, by David Robie. London, Zed Books, 1989; Sydney: Pluto Press, 1990; Manila: Malaya Books, 1991; (available in the Pacific from UPNG Press, 1995), 313 pp.ISBN 0-86232-865-9. Price: K20.
<P>
<Font size=3><B>Reviewed by ALAN ROBSON</B>
<P>
EVENTS in recent years in the South Pacific have dispelled hitherto widely held perceptions of the region as a peacefully modernising backwater of traditional societies. In particular, the 1987 coups in Fiji galvanised the attention of politicians and academics. But in truth, this was just one of a series of crises besetting South Pacific island states.
<P>
David Robie's <I>Blood on their Banner</I> goes beyond the many accounts focusing on the Fiji coups to link together a range of events under the rubric of responses to colonialism and the emergence of Pacific nationalism. His credentials for doing this are excellent.
<P>
Robie, who earlier wrote the only insider's book on the French bombing of the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>, has worked as a journalist in the region for a number of years, winning the New Zealand Media Peace Prize in 1985 and Qantas Press Awards in 1987 and 1988 for his Pacific coverage. His personal experiences and political engagement give the book vitality and coherence.
<P>
<I>Blood on their Banner</I> ranges over a number of post colonial crises in the Pacific from the recolonisation of East Timor and West Papua to the various, sometimes comic opera, on-going colonial excursions of the French -- very timely with this reissue of this book in view of the recent Moruroa upheaval.
<P>
In this account of might triumphing over right the Indonesians and the French emerge as particularly cuplable, but the sometimes dismal exercises in <I>realpolitik</I> by Australia and New Zealand in response to these episodes is also rightly condemned.
<P>
Robie is at his best when he deals with matters he has followed closely as a journalist. His discussion of the Pacific news media, Kanak struggle and the sinking of the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I> is particularly engaging.
<P>
The long section on the Fiji coups differs from the other episodes discussed in the book in having no obvious colonial villain. Yet Robie sees the events in Fiji as a culminating act of forces resisting nationalist reconstruction in the South Pacific.
<P>
Successive British administrations had fostered an Eastern chiefly elite for the purposes of of mediating indirect rule and it was principally this group which governed Fiji until its defeat by the Labour coalition of Timoci Bavadra. 
<P>
Occasionally Robie overstates the case for the coalition. Some Western Fijians saw Bavadra as a political messiah but the election returns don't bear out the contention that they were all that numerous.
<P>
However, there is no doubt that the coalition government was seen by various traditional interests as a threat. Its anti-nuclear policies were obviously viewed with disfavour by the United States and France. And the new-found influence of economic nationalists evoked the hostility of foreign-controlled concerns like the Emperor Gold Mines. Thus there are grounds for viewing the resurrection of a government in cahoots with these interests as a defeat for the nationalist forces.
<P>
Yet while the Fiji coups were certainly the most dramatic culmination of the region's post-colonial unfolding, they were at least initially not seen as a defeat  for nationalism by many Pacific nationalists. Reflecting this, the island states of the South Pacific Forum were for the most part less willing than Australia and New Zealand to condemn the coups.
<P>
Nationalism per se, is a motor of limited potential for the attainment of distributive justice. It is often asserted by defensive elites in diversionary populist appeals and can sometimes be a mask for communalism and racism. Robie shows his awareness of the conundrum which arises out of this when he asks if the solution to colonial racism will be sought in the substitution of indigenous chauvinist supremacy.
<P>
<I>Blood on their Banner</I> is a remarkably stimulating and well-written introduction to modern political developments in the South Pacific. It takes a stand against injustice and compellingly presents the case for the oppressed which is not the least of its achievements.

<Font size=5>CHALLENGES OVER PACIFIC 'FREE MEDIA'</F5><P>
<Font size=4><P>
<B>Nius Bilong Pasifik: Mass Media in the Pacific</B>, edited by David Robie. Port Moresby: University of Papua  New Guinea Press, 1995, 274 pp. K20. ISBN 9980-84-052-8. Also distributed by the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism (University of Technology, Sydney), A$19.95.
</I>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>Reviewed by ROBBIE ROBERTSON</B>
<P>
THIS IS the first comprehensive resource book on the South Pacific news media. Its foreword, by Tongan Futa Helu, sets the agenda. 'Media freedom in the Pacific islands,' he declares, 'is in the balance' (p1). The 18 regional contributors who follow all agree -- but they differ widely about the cause or causes of the danger. Helu emphasises the role of the 'privilegentsia' and argues that 'the road to a free media in the islands is for media to be privately owned' (p2). 
<P>
What follows does not altogether vindicate that perspective, although as David Robie notes in his introduction, the style of today's press is predominantly a 'free market one' (p6). The issue is whether competition itself guarantees press freedom and higher standards.
<P>
Two themes are raised consistently throughout this book and should provide the basis for lively discussion among students and researchers of journalism. The first concerns the extent to which journalism in Third World countries -- sometimes called development journalism -- is unique, or at least significantly different from that practised in First World countries. Unfortunately this theme is not pursued consistently by all contributors, although most touch on and emphasise differences.
<P>
Pacific journalism is largely conducted in nonvernacular languages and when this handicap is added to national problems of literacy and the dominance of foreign ownership, special difficulties certainly emerge as a feature of Pacific journalism. Literacy is sometimes regarded as a foreign imposition or of low national priority in comparison with providing jobs [one chapter quotes Niugini Nius' 'books and other rubbish' description of vandalism in a school (p141)]. 
<P>
Consequently radio has traditionally had greater influence than the print media, a fact reflected by its continued dominance by state bodies. The answer, it seems, is greater use of the vernacular in order to reach more people and make newspapers more relevant; a point reinforced by Fr Diosnel Centurion's argument that Christianity only became relevant and widely accepted once the Bible was translated and printed in the vernacular (p108).
<P>
Certainly other writers touch on the distinctive characteristics of Pacific journalism, but they do not consistently pursue the issue of national underdevelopment or state vulnerability and its impact on state-media relations. Is the heavy hand of the state a consequence of the state's own fragility ['Akilisi Pohiva certainly suggests that officeholders are motivated by fear of losing their political power base (p205)] or of cultural fragility? 
<P>
Joseph Anyanwu sees television imposing 'a pace of dynamism ... too fast for a Pacific culture system which is built on gradual and regulated cosmic rhythm' (p53). 
Given the variety of cultures across the Pacific, not to mention urban-rural and educational divides, we might want to question the usefulness of such broad generalisations. 
<P>
In fact, Peter Cronau's examination of the Australian media suggests that notions of a simple First World-Third World divide have more political than academic meaning, especially if they are designed to promote national unity by fostering stereotypes of others or by enlisting national patriotism to minimise internal debate.
<P>
But the mere idea of such divides does not fully explain the attitude of Pacific states towards their media. Is it state fragility, fear of change, or an overbearing colonial inheritance which encourages states to increase controls over the media? In some instances the state regards its media in the same manner that it might its armed forces -- as an arm of the state and not as an independent entity. Hence the PNG Information Minister Martin Thompson's declaration in April 1994 that the National Broadcasting Commission must 'reflect our drive for national unity' (p192). 
<P>
That may be fair comment, but as Robie notes all too often 'governments tend to treat themselves as the sole judges of what constitutes the national interest' (p10). 
Many of the consequences of  such an attitude are case studies in the second part of the book. When national interest, cultural exclusivity, and personal ambition combine, the results are usually not favourable for media freedoms, let alone democracy. Does this make Pacific societies or Pacific journalism unique? The histories of Western societies do not suggest so.
<P>
The second theme of Nius Bilong Pasifik concerns the role of private media enterprises. Helu's enthusiasm for private ownership is not sustained by most of the book's contributors. 
<P>
If anything, the authors reveal that all forms of ownership have problems. Escaping the clutches of an authoritarian or domineering government does not in itself guarantee a free press. In countries with low levels of literacy where the price of newspapers is comparatively high, where media awareness is low, and where media sources of revenue are limited, 'free' newspapers may still be dependent on government advertising revenue or on income from large national or transnational companies. Such dependency reduces the scope for investigative journalism.
<P>
Of course, this situation is not unique to 'development' journalism. Recently Rupert Murdoch accused one of Australia's largest retail companies of threatening to withdraw advertising from his papers unless they reported its corporate affairs more sympathetically. The point is simply that private ownership does not guarantee a free press. Nor, as Cronau's chapter on Australia's 'shallow, sensationalist and ill-informed' treatment of Pacific stories reveals, does a free competitive press guarantee an informative press.
<P>
Indeed, Claude Marere points out that the political agenda of French Polynesia's privately owned press (to maintain French rule) not only dictates the parameters of investigative journalism but promotes silence over instances of government corruption (p185). And, he laments, when journalists went on strike in 1991, they didn't even list press freedoms among their demands.
<P>
Nius Bilong Pasifik focuses on news presentation at the institutional or enterprise level, but among its many articles lies the suggestion that media freedom also depends upon the actions of individual journalists. Says Wally Hiambohn, some journalists -- especially those preferred by the establishment -- 'turn a blind eye to corruption and other ills of society' and report only favourable and 'good' news (p198).
<P> 
Clearly there are many dilemmas associated with the mass media and journalism. This book brings them into the open for debate -- and within a highly informative format, including country profiles and other appendices. For doing this it should be welcomed across the Pacific.

<A HREF="http://pactok.net.au:80/docs/nius/library/9604301.htm"><B>NIUS BILONG PASIFIK:</A> MASS MEDIA IN THE PACIFIC</B>, edited by David Robie. ISBN 9980 84 052 8. Paperback. Published by: University of Papua New Guinea Press, Port Moresby, in association with the <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/">Australian Centre for Independent Journalism</A>, Sydney, 1995. Price: In the Pacific: K20; Australia: $19.95. Available from: UPNG Press, PO Box 320, Uni PO, NCD, PNG (Pacific); ACIJ, UTS, Box 123, Broadway NSW 2007, Australia.<P> 

The news media in the South Pacific may be small -- but the region has a diverse and vibrant mass communications industry. Ranging from the PNG <I>Post-Courier</I> (circulation 34,000) and <I>Fiji Times</I> to the fortnightly <I>Tuvalu Echoes</I> and monthly <I>Madang Watcher</I>, from EM TV's nationwide broadcasts via the Indonesian Palapa satellite to Niue's tiny television unit; or the PNG National Broadcasting Commission's Kalang and Karai services to Tokelau's traffic-and-weather broadcasts, the media caters for an audience and readership scattered over many islands and atolls.<P>

In <I>Nius Bilong Pasifik</I>, 18 leading Pacific journalists, academics and media commentators explore the nature and problems of the contemporary Pacific mass communications industry. This is a unique book for Pacific journalism educators, students, sociology and political science scholars, media watchers and professional journalists. <A HREF="http://www.pactok.net.au/docs/nius/library/jun96/9604301.htm">See review by Cratis Hippocrates.</A>

<P><B>TU GALALA: SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE PACIFIC</B>, edited by David Robie. ISBN 0 908912 14 5. Paperback. Published by: Bridget Williams Books, Wellington, NZ, and Pluto Press, Sydney, 1992. Preparation of the book was assisted by the Pacific Conservation Development Trust, a fund set up in New Zealand with compensation money from the French government for the bombing of the <I>Rainbow Warrior</I> in Auckland Harbour on 10 July 1985.<P>

The Pacific is in upheaval -- growing poverty, nuclear testing, independence struggles, militarisation and massive social dislocation are pressing, often intractable issues. In <I>Tu Galala</I> (meaning "freedom"), indigenous and palagi writers describe the impact of these influences on their people. <P>

Topics covered include the Bougainville crisis and the environmental impact of mining on indigenous communities in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea; hazardous waste dumping and the Johnston Atoll chemical weapons burn-off controversy; human rights violations in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and East Timor; "development" in Kanaky/New Caledonia, and tino rangatiratanga in Aotearoa/New Zealand.<P>

<B>BLOOD ON THEIR BANNER; NATIONALIST STRUGGLES IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC</B>, by David Robie. ISBN 0 949 138 35 5. Paperback. Published by:  Zed Books, London, 1989; Pluto Press, Sydney; 1990, Bridget Williams Books, Wellington, NZ, 1990, Malaya Books, Manila, 1991. Available in Australia and NZ from Pluto Books, 6a Nelson St, Annandale, NSW 2038, Australia; in the Pacific from University of PNG Press, PO Box 320, University PO, NCD, Papua New Guinea..Price: In the Pacific: K20; Australia: $19.95.<P> 

"David Robie has a well deserved reputation for reporting the South Pacific from the viewpoint of its own people -- as opposed to colonial myth. Students of the Pacific will find this book a valuable resource as the people of the region assert their sovereignty over what is rightfully theirs." -- Dr Timothy Bavadra, the late Prime Minister of Fiji, deposed in a coup d'etat.<P>

<B>Political system:</B> The republic of Belau (Palau) was a Japanese colony from 1914 until the Second World War. In 1947 it became part of the US-administered UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). A nuclear-free constitution was adopted on 1 January 1981. The Compact of Free Association agreed between the US and Belau in 1986 gave the islands independence subject to defence being the responsibility of the United States for 50 years. Successive referenda in Belau, however, failed to produce a 75 per cent majority.
<P>
In 1987, Belau voted to amend the constitution to allow approval of the compact by a simple majority. In a subsequent plebiscite, 73 per cent of the votes were cast for the compact. But the Belau Supreme Court ruled this invalid in August 1988. 
<P>
The court also ruled there were inconsistencies between the compact and Belau's nuclear-free constitution, which was incompatible with the US defence policy. Agreements with the Bush administration in 1989 provided aid in paying off foreign debt and funds for new development. The people of Belau were citizens of TTPI. On 9 November 1993, a 68 per cent majority voted in favour of the compact.
<P>
President Haruo Remeliik, who had strong anti-nuclear convictions, was assassinated in July 1985. His successor, President Lazarus Salii, died from gunshot wounds in mysterious circumstances although it is widely accepted that he committed suicide.  Salii was followed in office by President Ngiratkel Etpison.
<P>
After finally voting in favour of the compact, Belau became "independent" on 1 October 1994. Kuniwo Nakamura, a former teacher elected president in November 1992, steered the country to independence. Under the agreement, the US is to pay Belau compensation over 15 years for military and political control rights for 50 years.  Belau received US$450 for the first year.
<P>
Styled on the US Congress, Belau's legislature -- Olbiil Era Kelulau -- comprises a Senate with 18 elected members and a House of Delegates (16 elected members). Elections are held every four years. The country also has 16 state governments.

<B>Political system:</B> Until 1987, Fiji recognised the British sovereign as head of state. But in two coups -- in May and September that year -- Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka overthrew the elected government of Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra of the Fiji Labour Party, abrogated the 1970 Constitution and then declared the country a republic on October 6.
<P>
On 25 July  1990, President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau promulgated a new constitution. This constitution created a new bicameral legislature that is racially weighted against Indo-Fijians. The lower House of Representatives has 37 Fijian members, 27 Indo-Fijian, one Rotuman and five from other communities. The upper Senate has 24 Fijian, one Rotuman and nine members from other groups. Fijian senators are appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs which also appoints the president for a five-year term.
<P>
Rabuka was elected Prime Minister in May 1992 as head of a Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (Fiji Political Party) coalition. He retained the prime ministership in a snap election in February 1994. This time Rabuka's coalition government comprised SVT (31 seats), General Voters Party (3), independent MPs (2). The Opposition comprised the National Federation Party (Opposition leader Jai Ram Reddy) and the Fiji Labour Party and sought a non-racially biased constitution. 
<P>
In September 1996, a Constitutional Review Commission headed by former New Zealand Governor-General Sir Paul Reeves recommended that Fiji adopt a non-racially biased constitution as existed before the coups. It also called for a return to cross-communal voting.

<B>Political system:</B> Papua New Guinea became independent in 1975 having previously been administered by Australia under a United Nations mandate. It has a 109-member unicameral National Parliament elected for five years by universal suffrage.
But the government has changed several times between general elections on the floor of Parliament. This happened in July 1988 when Rabbie Namaliu took over as the country's fourth prime minister after Paias Wingti lost a vote of confidence. Wingti was reelected prime minister in the June 1992 general election. 
<P>
The prime minister normally heads a government that is an uneasy coalition of small, unstable parties and independent MPs, all prone to be split or being persuaded to defect. The governor-general represents the head of state, the British monarch.
<P>
<B>Political parties:</B> In June 1992, Wingti's Western Highlands-based People's Democratic Movement took over the leadership of the coalition government. The opposition is led by the Pangu Pati, which led the country into independence. Other parties are the Melanesian Alliance, People's Action Party, Papua Party, League for National Advancement, National Party, Papua Besena, United Party and People's Progress Party.
<P>
In August 1994, the Supreme Court ruled Wingti had acted unconstitutionally when he was reelected Prime Minister in a September 1993 parliamentary ploy. His deputy, Sir Julius Chan, formed a coalition with the Pangu Pati, Melanesian Alliance, League for National Advancement and other parties and was elected Prime Minister. Provincial governments and legislatures were abolished in 1995 and replaced with a local government structure headed by a governor in each province. The next general election is due in mid-1997.

<B>Political system:</B> French Polynesia is a French overseas territory whose high commissioner, appointed by the French Government, directs all local state services, including defence, foreign affairs, immigration, civil law, justice, information, foreign trade, international communications, higher education and scientific research. 
<P>
A French law of September 1984 permitted the conduct of certain local affairs (local budget, health services, primary education, culture, social welfare, public works, agriculture and sports) by a council of 10 ministers whose president is elected by 41-member Territorial Assembly, itself elected by universal adult suffrage. 
<P>
The territory is represented in the French Parliament by two deputies and a senator. The moves to a single common market in Europe in 1992 aroused fears of unrestricted access to the island by citizens and entrepreneurs of any EC member states. French nuclear testing at Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls, a controversial issue clouding France's relations with the South Pacific ended in 1995. 
<P>
<B>Political parties:</B> Government: coalition of Tahoeraa Huiraatira and Aia Api, mid-1991; Opposition: Te Tiarama, Tavini Huiraatira, Te Ea No Maohi Nui; Amuitahira'a No Oteania, Te Atira A Porinetia.

<P><B>Political system: </B> Tonga is governed by a hereditary monarch who appoints and chairs a Privy Council consisting of seven life ministers -- inclusing an executive prime minister -- and the governors of Ha'apai and Vava'u. A unicameral legislative council of 28 members meets annually but only nine of its places are filled by elected representatives of the commoners.
<P>
<B>Political parties:</B> Until 1994 there were no organised political parties, but the Pro-Democracy Movement, led by 'Akilisi Pohiva, won six out of the nine People's Representative seats in the February 1993 election. In late 1994 the movement formed the Democracy Party. On 19 September 1996 the kingdom was shaken when Pohiva, regarded as one of the leading whistleblowers of the South Pacific, and two editors of the Taimi 'o Tongan newspaper were jailed for 30 days for alleged contempt of parliament. The action drew wide international condemnation.

<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Ironically, the notion of Asian values may have sprung from an American academic idea that love of freedom is time-bound and place-bound. It argues that, despite more Asians, Africans and Latin Americans devoting their lives and giving them up for freedom, it is yet something they do not really understand and cannot therefore truly want. Not in their ethnic heart of heart.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Who came up with this idea? I don't know; maybe an American academic or journalist invited by a Third World dictatorship to paint a pretty picture of the country under its heel. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But the idea of special values suddenly became very attractive when the communist threat to democracy - as the justification for suppressing democracy - evaporated with the Cold War. For the old dictators, the situation became even more alarming with the peaceful People Power revolution in the Philippines.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
As President Aquino told the US Congress, she led the mass of Filipinos in a revolution, not for bread though they were hungry; nor for money, though they were poor, because they gave what little they had to her campaign. But for good old American freedom. And she was the daughter of one of the richest families in the country, surrounded by bankers and businessmen all intent on two things: the restoration of freedom and the impartial rule of law. It was possible, in fact, it could not be denied, that a people can rise up really for freedom, without awaiting instructions from Moscow.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Without the bogey of communism and the threat to business, Third World dictators were at a loss how to defend their continued suppression of freedom.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
That was when we started to hear in earnest that freedom got in the way of progress and clashed with the native values of countries that came to birth in freedom struggles. Struggles that resonated with the phrases and feelings of the Declarations of Independence and of the Rights of Man: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances or throw it out in the next election.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Against these values for which so many Asians fought and died, the authoritarians opposed a set of elusive excuses with a pedigree only in their sense of distress.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
A Philippine colleague attempted the following reconciliation of journalism with so-called Asian values: "Authoritarian governments limit journalistic activity to those values that observe the primacy of the state administration." Citing Siebert, Peterson and Schramm - people I never heard of in law school - instead of Chafee and Learned Hand - she maintained that "one classical theory of journalism ranks government as a higher force than the individual in the scale of social values." 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Nonsense. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In theory, journalism can never rank the force of government higher than its constitutional right. There is a guarantee of press freedom, while government is mentioned in constitutions only as a force to be curtailed.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In fact, governments try to limit journalistic activity, not to values upholding state administration, but away from acts of maladministration and malfeasance of which governments should be ashamed. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
When the country is in a real crisis, Asians would do better to consult Oliver Wendell Holmes on when to restrain journalism in the face of clear and present danger, such as German submarines off the Atlantic coast, than the Analects of Confucius on how to curry the favour of your master.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
My colleague would oblige journalism to justify its work in terms of the values that keep the people in power in their places. But journalism need explain itself no more than the truth it serves.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There are no two theories of journalism - one for liberal societies in the West and another for authoritarian dispensations in the East or wherever. There is only one kind of journalism - that which seeks the truth and tells it plain. The rest is propaganda.

<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 3</B><BR>
Mr Locsin I appreciate your textbook and simplistic view of press freedom in Asia, and I have a question as an Asian as well as a journalist. When you talk about there's no such thing as Asian values in journalism, because you say 'find the facts, tell it straight.' How about 'find the facts, and give it meaning'? Then where does Asian values, or any form of values, fit in this?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
Well, in my experience as a journalist, I find the facts, and I give it meaning in light of the criminal court. For example —  maybe I'm just a working journalist and not a theoretician — my idea is to find the facts, say in a financial transaction which the government is involved. My duty of interpretation is to know the Securities and Exchange Commission Act, the penal code, the law on fraud, the law on bribery, and see if I interpret these facts and the case, a plausible case, for favouritism arises. That's the kind of interpretation I do. I can never think of finding of finding myself in a situation where, as an Asian, I say 'oh, he's taking a kickback here' or 'It looks like he's taking a kickback': 'well, I'm an Asian and we do it, and that's fine'. I just never come across that. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Problems of interpretation are like this. Let me give you a concrete example since we're ... The Philippine National Bank just sold its principal asset in a bidding. They sold it to the highest bidder. The bidder had no money (it was for 1.3 billion). So the president of the bank lent him 1.3 billion [laughter]. And then he said — when I attacked it — he said, 'Well the other bid was 200 million'. I said of course it's 200 million, that's his money. 1.3 billion is your million. This is yours but there's nothing . . . the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Central Banking that says that I have violated the Single borrowers Limit. That’s the kind of interpretation I would confine myself to, but certainly not to broad cultural things that say 'Well it’s OK in the Philippines because we're Asian to extend these loans as long as they're within the Single Borrowers' Limit.' I thought it was improper, and I continued to attack it for that. A bid is a bid. The guy has to bring the money to the table, I'm not supposed to put the money on. So I'm just not, I just can't understand any vaguer values that should determine what kind of news you print or how you write it.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 4. John Tebbutt, Monash University</B><BR> 
Mr Locsin, I'm wondering if you could comment on the role of might be called 'public journalism' or 'public broadcasting.' Maybe given some experiences in the Philippines, but also just generally within the Asian region (and also maybe if you know about the Australian situation). 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
I’m not familiar with public journalism in the rest of the region. I hope we're referring to the same things — James Fowler wrote the book Public Journalism . . .
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 4. John Tebbutt</B><BR>
Maybe if I clarify it?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
Yes, maybe you should, because that's the only familiarity I have with public journalism. And he said that there has been an ongoing debate in the United States whether  public journalism was 'proper' journalism, and the New york Times took a position against it, the Washington Post I think took a position against it. In other words people who go out investigate issues like the environment and make it a special concern and hammer on it. I don't see anything wrong with that. I tell you I have an ongoing quarrel with some public journalists in the Philippines. They are in fact some of the best journalists we have: they're young, they're enterprising and energetic and they keep going after the same illegal logger — well, he's no longer an illegal logger, he's now a respected businessman. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
They keep doing this, all the time, they keep going, and I say 'With all your talent, with all your resources, I won't print your stories on the environment any more because I've asked you also to please investigate what this cabinet official has been doing stealing so much, and that other official has been stealing so much. Why is it that  we keep going after environmental polluters, and we don't go after these guys. These guys are picking the national treasury. These guys are affecting posterity. I think this is a more immediate danger. I'm not saying I won't print your story, but I wish you'd expand to more dangerous subjects, for example politicians in the North. Those guys tend to pack guns.' Public journalists in the Philippines do not touch them, but they certainly touch businessmen who pollute rivers. So let's just be even handed about this. If we're going to be brave, let's be brave across the board.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 4. John Tebbutt</B><BR>
Just a quick supplementary. Maybe something else though about independence and state-funded broadcasting which is one of the questions I was trying to get to too. Do you see a role for public broadcasting organisations that are state-funded that maintain some sort of independence from the state?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin </B><BR>
Oh yes. That is the first thing I tried to do. When we won the revolution the government ended up with four television stations, all but one in fact. They were owned by Marcos cronies, so they were under me [?]. And we wanted to turn one of them into a BBC type — we have no idea what the BBC type is in the details — but we have the idea that this is going to be a TV station that would broadcast intelligent, in depth stories about things that are not commercially viable. It never flew. The Congress said that as a reaction against the Marcos years when he was subsidising so much they refused to pay a cent. One station remains government but it supports itself by having basketball on from morning to night [laughter]. I think that's really wrong because Great Britain has shown that it can be done. I like watching BBC.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Section Two</B></FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In serving these two demanding sometimes merciless masters, the Singapore journalist at the same time has cope with three realities. Reality number one, there are limits to our job, limits to how far we can take a story. The government sets these limits. Mr Li Quan Yu described the situation quite vividly in his 1994 interview on his encounter with Lesley Hoffman. He said, 'So, we settle the OV markers. In the end, the Straits Time had to come back to Singapore and run it on our terms. And that's how it has been, and that's how Singapore progressed.' 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The limits were further enforced on Jan 1, 1975, four years after the demise of the Eastern Sunand the Singapore Herald. This is how they control the press in Singapore. The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act was passed. In this Act, which is our number one reality because it exercised control by requiring newspapers, publishers, printers and chief editors to be licensed. There is an additional reserve power: newspaper companies must issue management shares, but only to those with government positions to hold them. And these management shares are  for 200 times more voting power than ordinary shares. And they decide who to hire and fire in a newspaper. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now we all know that good useful newspapers have three basic obligations: one, to gather and disseminate relevant timely information accurately; two, allow citizens a forum to speak their minds on matters that impact on their lives and future (provided the comment is not defamatory, inflammatory or irrelevant); three, make their own position on these issues clear to readers so that amidst the different voices it is unambiguous. How a newspaper carries out these observations is shaped, I believe, by local conditions. The history, the geography, the culture of the society it serves. In Singapore for readers of the Straits Times the approach that is most familiar to them is the Anglo–American one, because of the language used, English. SO even within the company that I work we are often attacked by our own people for not taking out the cudgels against the government. But Singapore at the end of the day, by universal accounts, has a good government. On most accounts it has done well by the country. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Looking at the wealth and wellbeing of Singapore and Singaporeans I believe the Singapore media has achieved much by not opting to take the path of adversarial journalism. Being anti-establishment is not a newspapers' only path to greatness and glory, especially when the government is not a bad government. Singapore's prosperity could not have been achieved had the media not chosen this path. WE chose the path well travelled by the Japanese, so for us a second reality is we see our first and foremost role as to help build and maintain a national consensus amid the clamour for more democracy and debate. That is to serve the national interest. Sometimes, in the eyes of the westerner, this appears as not telling the truth. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Last night at a dinner to mark the opening of this conference, Mr Michael Mann, Chief Executive of Australian TV and former diplomat, who has travelled and worked extensively in Asia, said he sometimes wonders whether, on reading a Japanese report, he was at the same event as the Japanese journalist. Perhaps what is often not appreciated is that newspapers are information filters also. The world has a wide range of filters. The way the Japanese filters news for its people is best explained by Eamon Fingleton a long time observer by the Japanese. He writes in his book Blindside, on the Japanese press, and I quote: 'Where important national economic strategies are concerned, the work of journalists is not so much to inform as to persuade. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Even to the point sometimes of consciously withholding information. For example after World War ll Japanese journalists withheld from the public for years the fact that the cost of living was much higher in Japan that in other countries. They did not want the national consensus undermined. This restraint was lifted only after Japan surpassed the United States in per capita income in mid 1980s.' This is how a Japanese journalist explained it to Fingleton. I quote: ' We were doing what was in the best interest of Japan. Every society has things it does not tell the public. Even in America during the Vietnam War the Washington Postand the New York Times did not tell all they knew.' End of quote.

Section Two</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
How the world has changed.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
disrepute into which socialism has fallen, we are all capitalists now.  Daily
newspapers usually carry at least one major business/economic/ financial
story on the front page.  The Wall Street Journal enjoys the biggest
circulation of any daily paper in the U.S.  Business magazines have
international editions and have stepped up their international coverage in
most cases.  Business programs, even business channels, blossom on TV.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Here in Australia, BRW does a superb job covering the local scene. 
Australian Sunday morning TV, for example, used to be all about rehashing
the sporting events of the previous day.  Now there are business programs
all over the place.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Business is the big story of the day.  "It's the economy stupid," was
President Bill Clinton's successful rallying cry in 1992.  And it is the
economic stability of today, with the stock market and corporate profits at
record highs, that won him re-election, despite the serious questions about
his ethics and flexibility of principle.  It is telling to note that Bob Dole's only
serious competitive offer was also economics-based - a 15% income tax
cut.  In Europe, the European Monetary Union and the coming shakeout of
the social security blankets, especially in France and Germany, are the
biggest stories of the day - and tomorrow.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Yet perhaps the biggest of these business stories is Asia.  And it is likely to
remain so.  A born and bred New York friend recently returned from a trip to
Asia and reported: "I think I've seen the future."  This was a telling remark
because New Yorkers, for those of you who don't know the breed, are quite
as firmly convinced as the French or the Chinese that they occupy the
center of the universe. Now and forever. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Asia's economic boom has a sense of permanence to it.  That is not to say
there won't be busts. Of course, there will.  But over the long haul, Asia
seems likely to continue to attract an enormous amount of foreign
investment and equally large amounts of technology and skills transfers. 
Non-Asian companies will come to depend upon this region for more and
more of their sales and income.  Australia, as you well know, already is
inextricably linked to Asia - whether she likes it or not. To my mind, the
sooner she embraces that reality the better. The world is dividing into
economic blocs and Australia is far too lightly populated to stand alone as
the tyranny of distance, to employ Geoffrey Blainey's felicitous phrase,
continues to crumble.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Since journalism's job is to report such changes, its practitioners will go
where the action is. And the business action increasingly will be in Asia.  So,
too, will the political and social action but that is someone else's talk.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
To date, the Asian business story has been largely one of boom - of
expanding economies, massive infrastructure projects, emerging middle
classes, strong exports, and the like.  In short, a positive story.  But, as I
said earlier, all booms bust and the bigger the boom the bigger the bust. 
Mexico and Japan are two recent examples on the Pacific Rim.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Journalists enjoy both booms and busts are more interesting to cover - here,
of course, I'm referring to the business version.  I should admit right here
that the dirty little secret of journalism is that it is a lot more fun to practise
than most professions, especially when you are young and a touch anti-
establishment.  Besides, disaster stories sell more newspapers, magazines,
TV shows and advertising. The fall of the mighty, especially if they have
been up to chicanery, is the crux of great drama..  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Historically, most of this drama played to a restricted audience, the home
market.  That meant it was either easier for the establishment involved to
control.  If it did play to foreign audiences, they usually weren't really all that
interested or involved. And, in any case, that had little impact on the
domestic audience. But journalism, like so much else, is going global. And
that changes everything. The facts increasingly are out there for all the world
to see. If the Emperor has not clothes it is going to be hard for him to hide
that fact.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
That brings me to two major developments that will dramatically affect
coverage of the Asian business story - and the story itself.

<B>Question 2 Paddy McGuiness</B><BR>
Paddy McGuiness, Sydney Morning Herald and Age. I'd just like to pose a question to the panel. What was the difference in principal between the Nike corporation exploiting cheap labour for manufacturing purposes in Indonesia, and the Straits Times exploiting cheap labour for journalistic purposes in Sydney. Might it not be possible that both groups want the job?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Hugh Menzies</B><BR> 
How old are the Australian journalists?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Siva Arasu </B><BR>
Do I need to say anything to that [laughter]
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 2 Paddy McGuiness </B><BR>
I'd like a comment.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Siva Arasu </B><BR>
I think when you produce a magazine as a publisher you go where the supply is and basically supply right now is in Australia. Technology has allowed us to produce a paper of a certain quality within certain financial constraints using the best people we have. ... to limit ourselves to Singapore that's a narrow point of view. If tomorrow we can find good journalists who can do the job in India or in America or in Japan we will do it, because at the end of the day a good paper is useless if it is dead. So to achieve absolute quality you cannot ignore the fact that we give that quality at a cost that allows us to live the next day, the next year and after that.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Panel</B><BR>
Do you pay your workers $2 a day, army stationed outside their office or factory like Nike do? Perhaps you could put that to Paddy. [laughter]
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paddy McGuiness</B><BR> 
I'm aware of that famous saying that there's only one thing worse than being exploited in a third world country and that's not being exploited. [laughter] Against that I think the campaign to draw attention to these things given what the people in the west are paying for the shoes is not astray, or given that a black basketballer might get paid more for one ad than the entire 30 000 strong Indonesian workforce is something well worth reporting.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Chair </B><BR>
We're running out of time, can we make those two the last questions please.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question 3</B><BR> 
Just a question for Ms Arasu. You mentioned in your talk that - well, the feeling I got was that you were saying - that restrictions on press freedom in your country had not stood in the way of economic prosperity. Would you concede that restrictions on press freedom in other parts of South East Asia may in fact be standing in the way of a national consensus and the development goals of those countries. Indonesia I think would be an example.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Siva Arasu</B><BR> 
I think when we talk about press freedom, the word itself has different meaning for different people. And what is considered free in Australia or America or in Japan is not necessarily the way Singapore or Indonesia or Malaysia sees it. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Living next door to Indonesia and having visited it several times, I think that Indonesia today is much better than it was 20 years ago when I first visited it. The same with my neighbour Malaysia. And the speed or the methods America, Australian or British journalists want us to apply at a ... in our own country. My response to that is merely, in my country, in my society, the speed is fine and the speed that you want us to do things by may not work if there is complete upheaval of things. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So, at the same time you know I hate giving examples of countries that are  not my own because, if you look at - this is a favourite quote of the leaders of my country, and I do not like using it. But one of their favourite quotes is: look at India, it has very free press; look at the Philippines, it has very free press: but how well are these people doing? So there are two sides to it. Yes, sometimes a free press can help, sometimes a free press can be a big obstacle. Well, I think each country has to make its choice.

When I first joined AP in Asia, in Manila to be exact, we were still getting copy from Indonesia by morse code.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
We used radio to transmit AP news and photos from Tokyo to other points in Asia which were not then linked by cable. Satellites were still some way off.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Communications were the single most important aspect of a reporter's job, apart from getting the story. If you could not find a way to get your story out you may as well not have been there.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
At the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 I was amazed to see Japanese photographers carry baskets of carrier pigeons into the press room at Enoshima where I was covering the yachting.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
They used them to fly film back to Tokyo 50 miles away. It was quicker than road or rail and more reliable than any other communications available.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Over the two weeks I was there I often wished I had brought some myself, so often did the communications collapse. But carrier pigeons don't always work either.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
At the D-Day landing at Normandy in 1944 an AP photographer figured pigeons would be the best way to get his film back across the English channel.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
However the pigeons got lost and were captured by the Germans who processed the film and published the photos in their own newspapers - with the AP photographers by-line.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It was always a credo among wire service reporters that you were only as good as your communications. And that was true.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
When I first went to Laos there was no phone connection to the outside world. You had to take a taxi to the wharf on the Mekong river, take a boat across, clear Thai immigration, then find a phone that worked and an operator who could get a line to Bangkok. Not an easy job. It could day a whole day to dictate one story.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Often reporters would write a story, drive to the airport and try to find a willing passenger to hand carry copy and photos to the nearest city where there was a AP bureau.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Appropriately, these messengers were called pigeons in the trade.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Communications remained slow and unreliable during the 60s and 70s, most of the time I was in Asia I am sorry to say. Often it seemed the fastest way to file a story would be to put it in a bottle and toss it in the South China Sea and hope for the best.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Sunspots would wipe out radio teletype communications for days.

<B>Questioner 2 John Tebbutt.</B><BR>
A similar question maybe - John Tebbutt from Monash University - but maybe from a different angle. I'm wondering if you could talk about . . . with the very important aspects of speed in journalism and delivery of news, we're also getting an incredible volume of news and an incredible volume of words and pictures. I'm wondering if you could talk about the economic of that on your industry. Is that an advantage, is it a stage of overload and that it's too much. If you could maybe just comment on the situation of the increased volume of information and use that we're getting.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin</B><BR> 
Well, there's no doubt about it, the volume is much greater and will get much greater. But it's not like the old days where you had a photo-machine running and you came in the morning and you found there were 100 photos lying in a basket. Now they're electronically captured and if you want to look at them you call them up on the screen 16 at a time and choose the ones you want. So basically what this information flow's giving you is a greater range of options. Instead of AP choosing out of 100 photos ten to send you, we'll send you the whole lot and you can choose the ones you want. And it's the same with words. I mean you can keyword search your own database to pick what stories you're interested in. I think it's harder for us to gather all this, it costs more to gather it, but it doesn't cost any more to transmit it. So it just provides you with more choices at the other end.

<B>Questioner 3. Syd Aspery</B><BR> 
Syd Aspery from DPA. Like very many people I'm an ex-employee of UPI. UPI is a private company. AP is a co-operate. Zainoa you've told us that Bnahma is to be privatised.

<B>Questioner 3. Syd Aspery </B><BR>
Corporatised rather, in preparation for full privatisation. Could you tell us how the structure as a co-operative has affected you in terms of business? Has this enabled you to finance your movement into digital and away from conventional print media? Is it a question when you're a co-operative that you've been able to pass on the cost of this to your customers because in effect your customers are also your shareholders. Is this the business structure that has favoured  AP against UPI. Also perhaps if you look at Reuters, which is your arch rival, they're a private company and no a co-operative, could you just explore these things for us. Thanks.

<B>O'Loughlin </B><BR>
That's pretty difficult. Well I'm not privy to the secrets to the secrets and the decision making of the AP Board. But they are elected by the newspapers who are members of the cooperative. Now, they don't like spending money, I can assure you of that. So any proposal that we put up has to be brilliantly costed, and it has to show it's going to save them money. And most of the way we've been able to expand is that we've been able to get off terrestrial communications, for instance, which were costing us a fortune, and get into satellites. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now, the capital for that had to be found somewhere, so it was found and approved by the Board. Similarly television. The Board decided we had to get into television. Reuters were already in it, and the Chairman of the Board was out here a while ago, and he's from North Carolina, and he believes that we all have to be in the internet and multimedia, and he's got a big operation on internet. And he said, 'Look, you've, if you're not in multimedia online services - even though we can't make a buck out of it yet - sooner or later down the . . . we're going to finish up as road kill on the Information Super highway.' So that had to be funded somewhere. So we've got an attitude with the Chairman of the Board like that: the funding does come. Hopefully it's going to pay us back some money too (I don't think it ever made Reuters any dough, but we're hoping it'll make us some money). 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now, for UPI. UPI in my experiences over the years, was always under capitalised, and they couldn't keep up, they couldn't get the funding for computers. That's what set them over the hill I thought. They brought a  set of computers from RCA or somebody who weren't in the computer business really and were a complete flop. And they just simply had a cash flow problem. But AP is a widely-based and diversified in the news business organisation internationally; Reuters' emphasis (Michael Perry, you can speak for Reuters, I won't), but from my experience Reuters is much more widely into the financial markets than we are. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The AP is more a traditional news and photo agency and we have joint venture with Dow-Jones (which is called AP-Dow-Jones) which provides services that compete with Reuters. But Reuters has got very large investment in the financial market reporting, which we don't. Apart from that they're listed on the stock exchange at various places and have got sources to that sort of revenue.

"The United States' global industrial pre-eminence may be slipping, but the domestic output and international sale of one of its manufactures is booming--packaged consciousness, the one- dimesnional smooth-edged cultural product, is made by the ever- expanding goliaths of the message and image business. Gigantic entertainment-information complexes exercise near-seamless and unified private corporate control over what we think, and think about," writes Herbert I. Schiller, author of Information Inequality: The Deepening Social Crisis in America. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
No wonder the news menu is shrinking, the same news line-up is constantly repeated to fill the air time with "news on the hour every hour". Slabs of news come off the assembly lines of the Perpetual News Machines--processed, sugar-coated and packaged for the lowest common denominator in audience surveys. The worrying thing is that this Niagara of information does not bring more understanding, it hardly allows you to grasp reality, and it does not bring you closer to the truth. This is the trend: the more television people watch, the less they tend to know. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It is the same with the technology-driven dissemination of news through the wire services. We heard from an earlier speaker about gigabytes per second of news can now be sent up to satellites and bounced back to earth at the speed of light. Speed, capacity, quantity of information is all we seem to be concerned about. do we ever stop to ask ourselves what it is that we are communicating? Is it worthwhile information, does it solve any problems, does it bring the world closer? What is the quality of the information? Why do we need to know that Bob Dole fell off the stage the instant it happens, why can't it wait till the evening news?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In a recent cover story on the internatioal media, The New Internationalist magazine asks: "Do you really need to have the news as it is breaking? What are you going to do with it? How often are you left with a feeling that you don't understand what's going on? How often has the story been left hanging because it's not seen as 'news' anymore?" 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Many of us find it hard to remember, or believe, the euphoria we felt when the Cold War officially came to a close. We know now that history did not end then. Fair play and justice did not return to international relations. The Cold War may have ended but Third World wars became more virulent than ever. The two superpowers which had used warlords, guerrilla groups and freedom fighters as pawns to fight fratricidal proxy wars in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Somalia or Angola abandoned them with enough guns and ammunition to keep them fighting for decades more. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Today, looking back at 1989, we have to wonder whether the reason for that misguided euphoria was the breathless media coverage of the dramatic events in Europe which may have raised our expectations too high. During the Cold War, the media had an easy job labelling saints and villains. It reflected the interests of superpowers and multinationals and there was little done to explain events in developing countries in their proper context. The needs and suffering of the poorer two-thirds of the world was important only if they were somehow related to the strategic interests of politicians and businessmen in northern capitals. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now that the Cold War bad guys are good guys, the international media are confused, and seems to have given up trying to make head or tail of the mess that is left. They yearn for the good old days when things were black and white, or more precisely, red or not-red.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The Cold War's lessons for the media are clear: their most important role is not just to react to events but to cover the precursors to conflict. Media must fulfil the role of conditioning the public not to think that conflict is the norm. After the cruise missiles leave their silos and the heavy guns are unsheathed, the momentum of war muzzles media. And as Bosnia showed, even the saddest stories of human misery and sufferings of the innocent in the heart of Europe covered close-up and incessantly by the media is not enough to stop war once it has begun.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Satellite television has made war a spectator sport. Global networks pride themselves in being there first for the live coverage of mass death: "The Famine in Utopia" journalism. It can be Korem, Mogadishu, Kigali, Goma ... But what good is reporting if the carnage is already over? Isn't there a higher calling than to just "report"?

To us, in many cases, the question of who is right and who is wrong is secondary. Our readers will decide that. Our priority is to ensure that both sides of an ideological or political conflict have
equal chances to defend their causes.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
The challenge for us in wake of the liberalized environment that comes with greater democracy and the communications revolution is not the search for so-called Asian journalistic values. We believe that all over the world, such values should be the same. They should allow all people at all levels to share information equally and enjoy freedom of expression.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
We believe that the quest for so called Asian values as advocated by some Asian leaders is too self-centered and has a grain of anticivil liberty because the state still has too much control over the people.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Our newspaper's stand on human rights most of the times pits us
against Asean governments. Last year the Indonesian embassy pulled out supplementary advertisement with The Nation. This year one of our reporters received a visa to attend an Asean meeting in Indonesia only at the last minute.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	 	
The official Asean version of human rights on the other hand is at odds with the western version. Asean governments argue that human rights principles in the region must be based on its culture and history as well. We at the Nation newspaper disagree.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Maybe our newspaper's attitude and policy have much to do with a characteristic of the Thai people. Thais are very cynical about their government. There is no state-controlled paper in Thailand and there can never be. The only government newspaper that I remember was published some 20 years ago, and it lasted only a few weeks.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Even during a clampdown in the 1970's, Thai newspapers defy the government in their own ways. Siam Rath, which was owned by the late Kukrit Pramoj, a well-known writer and former Prime Minister, stopped doing political reports and opted for absolutely absurd stories. People woke up in the morning and saw these frontpage headlines:  "Birds sing beautifully at Government House"; or "We have counted for you: there are 300 trees around the Defence Ministry".
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This conference has heard that bad media can undermine a nation. I can't agree more. But I think the bottom line is that it is the people, not government, who are in the best position to teach the media to be responsible. Bad press can never get people's long-term supoort. Sooner or later, people will become smarter and they will find out. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Media should have its own responsibility. A decision to publish or not to publish a story should be made in the news room and based on public interest.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Having talked about all this, it would be unfair not to mention restrictions we face in Thailand. Thai newspapers cannot criticise the monarchy, the country's most respected institution. Some of you may think we have a double-standard, for being aggressive when it comes to security or sensitive matters of other countries while being silent to similar issues at home.

<B>Questioner 3.</B> <BR>
Syd Asprey from DPA. A couple of weeks ago the editorials in Thai English-language newspapers caused some controversy in Australia. One comment that was made was that the government didn't need to worry about these editorials because the English-language press in South East Asia was very small and not at all influential. That it was the vernacular press that was the premier [?] informer. Could I have your views on the role of the English-language press in, say, Thailand and Indonesia - non English-language speaking countries - and how you see that developing. Are you in decline, or are you growing: how do you see yourselves in say five or ten years. Thank you.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Taptin</B> <BR>
Before I came here, people in the office were joking that I could be arrested at the airport [laughter]. Now I wish I had been [laughter]. The whole thing about this Hansen debate, what we did is we just felt the need to make our opinions known. WE believed that we need some clear guidance, we need some clear directions from big country life Australia. And they upset last night [?] with us Asian people, they look at Australia, they feel like Australia is their big brother. And when the big brother one day say, when someone in the big brother's house says 'Hey you cannot come and play here anymore' [laughter]. So we need clarification. And when what we do to seek that clarification could be in an emotional way but we were sincere. WE just want to hear what the leader, the Prime Minister, the leader of a country as big as Australia, has to say about this growing trend. Somebody said that what she said, what Ms Hansen said, was the words of a person. There can be no denial that this kind of trend is rising in Australia and we just want to know what he leader of the country feels about it. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
And I think we are growing up - responding to your question . . .
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
[brief consultation off mark and indistinguishable]
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
. . . you asked about the Thai language media. Compared with English language media in Thailand they are re much more sensational. There are good newspapers but there are really really bad ones. You can see headlines like 'Government bite the opposition yesterday,' biting the legs [laughter]. And the government . . . I still remember my former Prime Minister Shun, his election [?] was that there are two things I know that bite: [?] and dogs [laughter]. And since [?] doesn't bite in the legs, I'm quite sure what the intention of the newspaper is.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So it was a sort of mutual cynicism, the Thai politicians and journalists. They're both - it is a [?] situation. It's like a 'we agree to disagree' situation. But not the situation at the moment.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 4</B>  <BR>
What sort of readership do you have, with Thai language newspapers?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Taptin</B><BR>
The readership is very small. The English language press has a really limited audience in Thailand. WE have about 50 000 copies, circulation. Our biggest rival, the Bangkok Postalso has the same circulation. So the leadership is really limited to expatriates, to well-educated people. But the influence of the English language newspapers is strong. You can have Thai newspaper making a lot of page one comments and nothing happens. But when we do a page one comment it has an impact.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 5</B><BR>
[?? from Hong Kong] According to the Hansen debate case, I want to ask both the panellist: is that the nationalism really have some role to play in affecting the objectivity of reports?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Taptin</B><BR>
I think reporting is one thing and commentary is another. When we make report, when we do our report we try to be as objective as we can. But when we make commentary we pull no punches.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>[interjection from floor, off mike. A woman following up her earlier question]</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
You talk about Thai language media: no objectivity! [laughter] Not at all, there are some good newspapers, but most of them are quite sensational, very very sensational. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>[clarification from floor, about nationalism]</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There is no nationalism in Thailand. Thais are so cynical. They attack everything. They attack their own government, they gossip about high press people, they . . . So . . . They are the people who have prejudice or bias in the media community, but it's not because of nationalism. There's no righties or lefties at the moment, just pure [?] problems [laugh]. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit</B><BR>
Can I just say something. I think that on racism there's very little chance that someone can be objective. I think what the Australian politicians have to realise is that whenever they're playing to a domestic gallery it will have repercussions internationally. Because they might think they're only talking for political reasons back home, but there's almost immediate reaction abroad.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 6</B><BR>
Richard Phillips from the University of Western Sydney, Nepean. Just ask whether you have a few of the question earlier in the afternoon about whether journalists should become more multiskilled. What you find in your organisation. Do you think that journalists are changing that way to become expert in also photography and so on, or what?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit</B> <BR>
Well, within our own organisation, in IPS, we'd rather make them multi-skilled in the software, you know, not in the hardware, so that they understand the subject and understand the multidisciplinary nature of the subject. That when they report on the WTO meeting in Singapore that they understand issues, they understand the various, the whole spectrum of concerns, of both developing countries and developed, not just from one side. so it's to expand your own mind before you approach the subject, and not just camera, or a video camera, or whether you can shoot it on your satellite from your suitcase. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7</B> <BR>
[?] from Charles Sturt University. First of all I'd really like to compliment you because they were both very inspiring talks, and I think that if you like - from an Australian point of view - we had professionals this morning who really have done wonderful work and they are really inspired idealist people (I won't embarrass them by mentioning their names), but the impression that came across was one of great cynicism. And although you say that the Thai media's cynical, I think that your idealism shone through. And all I can say is that idealism is very important for young people who want to become journalists. They don't merely chase the buck. It isn't the bottom line for them. It might be for the proprietors. You'll never get a journalist, a young one at any rate, purely interested in money.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now I'm getting to a really technical question. And this is to  Kunda Dixit. What I couldn't understand is, you told us how you can use the internet to spread out your material quickly and cheaply. And then you said - it seemed to me - that you had an encryption problem. People could raid you. Well I don't understand that. I subscribe .  . . 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>. . . [part way through question. mike rattle]</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit</B><BR>  
Yeah, I can tell you tricks about getting IPS for free. [laughter] Maybe I shouldn't. But there are tricks.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question cont. </B><BR>
But can you still get money from honest people?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit </B><BR>
Well we don't really mind if journalism schools rip us off, because it's all for a good cause, but if media does it we try to - yeah, there have been instances where we've talked to them and threatened to sue them. But as you know, this whole information thing, once it's out there, there's so many ways you can get it for free. You have customised passwords which one of your subscribers has, but can be 'subcontracting' it to someone else, you know. There are ways where they can get stuff from your website and read everything for free because they get your password from someone else. There are contracts we have with Nexus for example in the States, which is only for North American distribution but you can access it anywhere in the world. So they have this bulk rate for Nexus but they can also get IPS, and anyone else that Nexus carries. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
What I meant about the cost of delivery being zero was: just to send our service to some specialised client. So on the homepage side it's different. And I think, we're now working on it to raise revenue that way. In the States our US subsidiary is making a lot of money. We just have to internationalise it.

<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Draconian Laws in Place</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>The refusal of the government to press ahead with an omnibus broadcasting law will not in itself threaten press freedom. But this is not the case with the government's refusal to bring forward meaningful changes to security related laws.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>First there is the Emergency Regulations Ordinance. Its subsidiary legislation was scrapped, but this is not of great significance because the main ordinance continues to confer wide-ranging and ill-defined powers on the Governor and his closest advisers in the Executive Council to declare an emergency and subsequently to make regulations which provide, inter alia, for censorship and the control and suppression of publications. The law allows the declaration of an emergency "on any occasion which the Governor in Council may consider to be an occasion of emergency or public danger," and then empowers the Executive Council to make "any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>This ordinance is, in the view of the HKJA, excessive. If it survives the 1997 handover unchanged, it will represent an open invitation to abuse. We therefore call on the British and Hong Kong governments to amend the ordinance in such a way that it makes explicit reference to the limits placed on a declaration of emergency by section 5 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, which mirrors article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We also want the Legislative Council to be given the power to approve or disapprove a state of emergency once it has been declared.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>There has also been little progress by the government in talks with China about changes to the Official Secrets Act and the Crimes Ordinance, as it relates to treason and sedition. Draft bills have been submitted to the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group - the diplomatic body charged with overseeing the handover. Officials are refusing to give any details of the proposals, citing the group's confidentiality rules.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>However, sources close to the administration have indicated that much-needed liberalisation is not on the agenda. Indeed, the draft changes to the Crimes Ordinance have incorporated new offences - subversion and secession - which have to be incorporated into Hong Kong law under a provision in the territory's post-1997 constitution.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Other changes involve provisions with a colonial flavour. These include clauses in treason provisions relating to the British monarch and the British armed forces. Such provisions will lapse on July 1, 1997. Of particular concern to the HKJA is the excessively wide-ranging, often obsolete nature of the treason and sedition offences under the law. We believe that reform must, in particular, take into account more liberal thinking on the concepts of treasonable and seditious intention.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>It is debatable whether China wishes to reach agreement with Britain on these issues, given that they are highly sensitive and matters close to Beijing's heart. There is a feeling that China is likely to take unilateral action, possibly by pushing them through a hand-picked provisional legislature to be set up next year. It should also be noted that China's understanding of such offences as treason and sedition is far more stringent than Britain's. Further, the concepts of subversion and secession do not even exist in the British common law system.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>There are other items on our agenda, including the introduction of an omnibus broadcasting bill to replace the Television, Telecommunication and Broadcasting Authority ordinances, amendments to the Telecommunication and Post Office ordinances, as they relate to the interception of messages and mail, and the deletion of the outstanding criminal libel provision in the Defamation Ordinance.

<B>Unidentified questioner</B><BR>
This is not a question so much as a comment to Jon, who sees in the future the development in communication, net communication, the dominant centre with a lot of satellites. It's already here. The US  is the only email address is the only address where you do not have to identify the country.
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Jon Casimir </B><BR>
I know what you're talking about but I actually think that's just historical administrative accident more than anything else. It is also due to the fact that Americans see themselves as the centre of the universe by and large [laughter], and the thing has developed from there. But when I said a dominant centre in terms of satellite, what you seem to get in all forms of digital media is very large monolithic core groups and very small ones. What I'd be predicting in terms of media is that there'd be a few global media services - whether it's CNN or whoever - and a whole lot of very localised things.  I think that middle tier of media - your nationals or your regionals - won't really work in the commercial sense. You can actually apply that to almost any digital industry you can see it happening in. The thing about the net, the thing about digital technology, is it just wants to cut out the middleman.
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Unidentified questioner </B><BR>
I'd like to ask Jon about the difference between an on-line editor and - I mean, what is your actual day-to-day job and how does it differ from being an editor of a print outlet.
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Jon Casimir </B><BR>
Well right at the moment the main difference is that I'm - as I frequently bitch to people about - 'birthing'  that entire end of the company. An editor of a section of the paper now has a whole production set up: we know how to make newspapers, we know what a press is, we know all that kind of stuff. I spend an extraordinary, and frankly appalling, amount of my time in meetings I don't want to be in discussing hardware, software, advertising policies, administrative polices, how we're actually going to build the railroad and build the train before we can deliver the stuff. So at the moment that's the basic way it differs. I have an extraordinary large percentage of my day with stuff that as an editor and journalist I'd rather not be doing.
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Karen Glahn.</B><BR>
Karen Glahn, Danish newspaper This one's for David. I just want to know - it's probably ignorance on my behalf - but the Reuters news service, does it give what you have got and what you came here today, was that he sales pitch or information? [laughter] I mean, very charmingly done . . .
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>David Wilson</B><BR>
Thank you! Do they have it? to a certain extent sure. And Mike himself has identified Reuters as our competition worldwide. I mean that organisation. That said, you're talking about an organisation where Mr Reuter is dead - what? - 100 and some odd years, where Dow and Jones have long since passed, and Knight and Ridder and all these people. We're doing it in our time, like [...] is still going around the world giving speeches. It's something where we're trying to take the technology that exists today, and start from scratch. Literally an entire global organisation from scratch, and I was in on the ground floor back in 1990. If we had times I could show you things on this terminal you won't get on the Reuters news because literally the e-links [?] do not exist. [laughter] It's fact! Now you can laugh it off if you want, but the fact is, for example bond markets, blew [...] because you can say OK, either bond's cheap or bond's expensive, we've given people tools they don't have before. 
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Part of . . . is how to take those tools and turn them into pros. I mean Nat Winkle who's my boss and runs the organisation likes to say, that we're in the news business long before there was text. It was information in a different form: numbers, graphs, charts, tables etc. When the journalists came along, we brought in text, we brought in context and all the rest. I think what you were saying earlier it seems to me, kind of fits our model as much as it did the earlier example: the idea that you look at the posting from Sarajevo and then you read the international reporting and it gives you a different perspective than you'd have if you had one or the other only. And the same is true of perspective when it comes to the screens I showed you. There isn't a doggone thing I showed you that's going to tell you why . That's where the journalists come in, and that's how it all fits together for us. You know, sure, we're out there doing the same thing others have done. People in our organisation would be the first to tell you we didn't reinvent the wheel. I'd like to say we tried to work out a different way to make it roll.

<FONT SIZE="+1">Section Two</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It's very important in Australia that our coverage be genuinely international and genuinely global but with, I believe, a particular emphasis on the Asia-Pacific, because that's increasingly the part of the world in which our destiny as a country will be determined and shaped. But having made these points I'm concerned, first of all, about the extent to which we are covering the world properly. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
To what extent do you read much in the papers about the crisis of identity going on in the United Kingdom at the moment? And it's a genuine crisis of identity. Is Britain to remain an island off the coast of Europe forever? Is Britain to surrender its national sovereignty and join Europe in a comprehensive way so that the powers of Westminster parliament are subsumed eventually into a European federation, and Britain joins a European monetary union and the identity of its own currency the pound is folded into a new European currency? Britain at the moment is completely racked with the debate about national identity, national sovereignty and its own future: to what extent is this being sufficiently covered in Australia, to what extent is it being appreciated that this is a really fundamental debate judged by any measure.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
On the other hand, looking closer to home, to what extent is there sufficient appreciation in Australia of the enormous magnitude of political liberalisation going on in the Asia-Pacific and of economic changes going on in the Asia-Pacific? Again, I think these are enormously important issues, and I think too much of the coverage in this country is skating across the surface. WE must get beneath the surface. This brings us to the question of means. How do we do this? If I can just focus here on Australian newspapers, essentially there are two ways we do it. We do it by taking, by buying syndicated services or by putting out own correspondents into the region. They're essentially the two methods. Both are very expensive; neither is being handled terribly well. If I could just take first of all the cost of services. I think that Australian newspapers are not using their syndicated services - for which they are paying very substantial amounts of money on an annual basis - they're not using these services well at all and this goes to the question of how the newspapers are organised, their capacity to identify the copy that's on line and to get that worthwhile copy into a newspaper. That's not being handled well. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Secondly, when it comes to employment of their own correspondents, I think that far greater effort could be made here. It's very important that Australia sees the region through its own eyes. Absolutely fundamental. Now we are expanding, newspapers are expanding their number of foreign correspondents in the region, and the ABC has a very substantial network of foreign correspondents in the region. One of the difficulties of course is that the cost of a foreign post is conservatively a quarter of a million dollars, and if you're talking about some posts such as Japan it's an awful lot more. So it's a high cost exercise to put foreign correspondents into the region. However it's an exercise which must be tackled, an issue which must be confronted. It is very very important for Australia to cover the region with its own eyes. It's one thing for us to take American services - very important for us to take American services - but we cannot interpret and cover the Asia-Pacific just through American eyes. Frankly what we ought to be trying to do is to expand and build up our own coverage of the Asia-Pacific and then sell this coverage as a syndicated service to northern-hemisphere papers. That's what we ought to be doing.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I think that to a certain extent a lot of our foreign correspondents have great difficulty in trying to interpret the job of a foreign correspondent in the 1990s. There is so much material available in most capitals. What do you report on? what do you cover? And I think the answer to that question is that he job of the foreign correspondent is not just to duplicate what syndicated services might do out of a particular capital. It's to provide a value-added service. That's why the foreign correspondent's there. The foreign correspondent's got to be good enough to provide that value added service; the foreign correspondent has got to have expertise in the country and in the region - but expertise is not good enough, the foreign correspondent's got to be a good journalist in his or her own right. So I think you need experienced people as foreign correspondents, and you need people who've got a degree of expertise so that they can genuinely provide added value. We need a much greater emphasis in the Australian media on the need for genuine expertise in the region. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I think you need to be aware of the fact, frankly, that an Australian correspondent in Washington carries no clout whatsoever. An Australian correspondent in Jakarta does carry clout. Now what this means is we need to appreciate that there will be different types of foreign correspondents and there'll be different ways of operating. I was quite pleased earlier on this year - not long after the change of government - when you'll recollect that there was a lot of difficulty in our bilateral relations with a number of countries in the region, in particular with Indonesia. And I might just say something about the Australian's coverage of this as a newspaper. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
We as a paper do have considerable expertise when it comes to Indonesia, and I think frankly the Australian government - and senior people in the Australian government - were quite surprised at the fact that as a paper we were able to deal with the Indonesian government, with senior figures in the Indonesian government, on a one-to-one basis, and we were able to write in our paper what was going on in Indonesia and what was the feeling in the Indonesian government towards the Australian government. And were able to do that simply because we have very good contacts in Indonesia just as we have very good contacts in Canberra. And it's very important that Australian newspapers and Australian news outlets get to the stage where we have such contacts that we can deal with senior bureaucrats and senior ministers and heads of government through the Asia-Pacific. And it's when we can do that in terms of our newspaper operations that we'll know that we as a country and we as a media, enmeshing with the Asia-Pacific, meeting our responsibilities as a media in this part of the world. That means having sufficient contacts and access that we can break stories and we know what's going on, and often we know what's going on before the Australian government does. I think that in some countries we are now getting to this stage, and that's particularly important.

<B>Questioner 3.</B><BR>
Geoff Lee Paul, first of all I'd like to say that I think that the correspondents in the field from the Australian - particularly Patrick Walters on Indonesia - do tend to be very good journalists in what they do. I'm just taking this opportunity to raise a beef that I have with the Australian, so if it appears a bit parochial I apologise to some of the other people in the room. It would seem to me that the Australian is trying to do two things. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
One, it's trying to make a profit, and part of making that profit is the supplements that you run regularly on Asian countries - the individual countries in the region and on the region as a whole - and the information which goes into that supplement is largely geared around corporations and businesses and government departments who have interests and investments in those counties in the region and vice versa. Second thing your newspaper purports to do is to be a national leader and national flagship for this country in representing Australia's views to the region. But I think there is a problem with that in that we're really talking about two Australias and we're really talking about two Malaysias and two Indonesias. That is, the government-to-government level of cultural communications and the people-to-people level. More specifically, my beefs would be with such things as your newspaper sending correspondents out to cover major events such as the twentieth anniversary of Indonesia's de jure recognition or incorporation of East Timor as the 27th province, to a picket outside the Malaysian consulate last July 17th, having a journalist do extensive interviews, having a photographer there, and not running one word. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now that's one of many many examples when the East Timor issues has been totally - if I'd use the word censored it may be little too strong because it has competing priorities. On the Bougainville issue, a freelance journalist who was paid by your newspaper for 12 articles he wrote before the embargo was lifted on the Bougainville story when the new Liberal government got in and changed policy on that. His name is Max Watts. He was paid for twelve stories he wrote on that conflict between 1991 and 93 and all of them were spiked. My final example is, following the Sherman Report being released a number of people rang your features editor's desk and said they'd be prepared to submit an article in response to the death of the Australian journalists at Balibo. They were rudely told by your features editor, 'we will get our own person to do that' and in the end it finished up being [????] Sebrand  who was known to be - as you are through the Australia Indonesia Institute - more closely aligned to the establishment view on relations with Indonesia and hostile to the East Timorese independence lobby.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kelly</B><BR>
Look, I'll just respond to that very very briefly. We require from our journalists the highest decree of professionalism. I appreciate the point you made at the start about Patrick Walters. I regard Patrick Walters as one of the best foreign correspondents in Indonesia, across the board, from any country. And I think that he's a very experienced and a very competent journalist. Now you've raised some individual matters - I'm not aware of those individual matters - I'll just say this. That we take editorial decisions about who will contribute to the paper. No outsider has a right to contribute to our paper. Ultimately my editors will take that decision and I'm responsible for it. And it's quite wrong for any outsider to think that if they call our newspaper . . . 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
[answer cut off, end of tape]
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
 . . . that's a particularly important point to make, and often in discussions - such as some of the comments you've just made - one tends to blur them. Finally, when it comes to our coverage of various countries, I do insist on a balanced coverage. Therefore, when it comes to Indonesia, I would expect our correspondent to cover all events and developments in Indonesia. I don't want our correspondent to focus unduly on East Timor. I recognise that East Timor is an important issue, and therefore in our coverage I would expect East Timor to figure prominently. But I would not expect East Timor to dominate our coverage out of Jakarta. Again, it's a question of balance and judgment.

<B>Radio National (RN)</B>
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
RN has to be seen as the core of the radio networks, the spine that gives not only the rest of the network shape, but also informs the rest of the media by providing the first level of stories. While this is often part of the role of the news and current affairs teams which also service the metros and other networks, the standards set by Radio National affects the way that other networks operate.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The processes legitimated as ABC standards are implicitly set by RN. These involve time taken to check stories, production standards and a broad based acknowledgment that stories presented are complex and views and opinions are varies. The talk components on Radio National, the specialist and more generalist programs assume that items are researched and varied views and voices sought. Producers, researchers and presenters are expected to put to air items and shows which are professionally and ethically defensible. They incorporate aspects of an explicit and implicit charter of responsibilities to diverse communities.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Some stories break on the ABC because there is the time, sometimes, to follow up and investigate stories. Stories are based on material from here and overseas which comes from journals and contacts, rather than what was in the morning papers. There is a focus on conferences and on experts who have something new to say and therefore the content over any time period is both wider and deeper than what is accessible on the metros or on commercial media.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
The view held by some internal managers that this type of activity can be sustained  by 'buying in these types of programs in chunks through Metro strip programming fails to recognise that the loss of the network will have devastating effects. Specialist units without regular programs and time slots become atomised and vulnerable to change and elimination.
<BR><IMG VSPACE=6 SRC="/../resources/dot_clear.gif"><BR>
Publicly funded national radio is one of the stronger threads in our national fabric. In a diverse and scattered society, a widely available, free-to-air national broadcaster is essential. Tying together city and country, diverse cultural groups, religious, richer and poorer; all the rich tapestry of Australian life cannot be left to the vagaries of the market. The 'shock and schlock jocks' that dominate the USA airwaves indicate the potential influence of radio in creating conflicts, racism and other uncivil phenomena. We need to make sure that there are always countervailing voices on public radio as symbols of more civil societies.

<Font size=3><B>The case of the "payment" of a young woman in compensation over the death of a man in a poice shoot-out in Papua New Guinea has raised national interest and has renewed calls by human rights groups for the speedy establishment of a National Human Rights Commission. Yet women's non-government organisations and other groups have been reluctant to make an issue of this human "sale" 
<P>
By DAVID ROBIE in Port Moresby</B>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
Miriam Willingal, an 18-year-old woman from a remote village in the Minj area in Papua New Guinea's rugged Highlands, is torn between her tribe's ancient past and her
personal future. Her father, Koidam Dam Willingal, 45, was shot dead by Western Highlands police during a pre-dawn raid on their village, Tumbo, on 12 April 1996.
<P>
The authorities claim Koidam was a bodyguard for police renegade Robert Mond, who was being sought over alleged armed hold-ups against police, stealing firearms, rape and other crimes. Mond was also killed in the shoot-out.
<P>
Now, Miriam Willingal has been offered by her small tribe,
without her consent, to the Konumbuka clan as compensation for her father's death.
<P>
Her uncles from her maternal grandmother's tribe, the dominant Konumbuka, demanded that they be paid two young women, pigs and K20,000 for her father's death. She was offered in settlement by relatives on her father's side, along with 24 pigs.
<P>
Willingal is upset that her own tribespeople have stamped a ''no value'' sign on her. ''I'm not prepared to marry,'' she admitted in a local newspaper, the Murdoch-owned Post-Courier. ''My aim is to complete my commercial
training courses and get a job.''
<P>
Willingal's guardian, local deputy school principal Sam Imine in Goroka, said the tribesmen demanded two women or they would ''get their own'' -- an implied threat to abduct and rape women in the village.
<P>
He said the practice of including women in compensation deals had been abandoned since the arrival of missionaries in the Highlands in the 1930s.
<P>
The case has raised national interest and has renewed calls by human rights groups for the speedy establishment of a National Human Rights Commission. Yet, astonishingly, women's non-government organisations and other groups have been reluctant to make an issue of this human "sale" -- many have been fighting among themselves over whether the Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, should resign over his ham-fisted recent attempt to gag expatriate businessmen who have condemned the systematic corruption afflicting the nation.  
<P>
Legal sources say even Chief Justice Arnold Amet has asked his staff to investigate the compensation deal.
Representatives of the Individual and Community Rights Advocacy Forum Inc have meanwhile said they will try to prevent the transaction from taking place, saying it does not respect the individual rights of the young woman.
<P>
Human rights activists say that cases such as this are among many to be addressed when a National Human Rights Commission is finally established, probably later this year. Of particular concern as well are the scores of alleged atrocities that have taken place on the Papua New Guinea island of Bougainville where the Bougainville Revolutionary Army has been waging a guerrilla war against the Port Moresbynational government for seven years.
<P>
Since violence first broke out in 1988, more than 6,000 people have died, including many children and women (most from the genocidal blockade imposed on the island by the PNG government with barely a whimper from the international community). Few documented cases have even been dealth with by the authorities, let alone anybody being prosecuted.
<P>
I remember reporting on the aftermath of the so-called St Valentine's Day massacre in February 1991 when Australian-donated helicopters were used to dump bodies at sea. The PNG government ordered an inquiry, yet to date nobody has been brought to book. Even the sacking of Colonel Leo Nuia at the time in punishment meant little -- he is now back in the higher echelons of the military.
<P>
Ill-treatment by government security forces has not been limited to Bougainville. The patterns of human rights violations and abuse of authority have been evident in other parts of the country for several years. According to Amnesty International: "Members of police riot squads (Mobile Squads) have been singled out for abusive behaviour, but regular duty officers, prison warders and members of the PNG Defence Force engaged in controlling civil unrest have also been accused of the ill-treatment and in some cases unlawful killing of civilians."
<P>
One night in a Gerehu bar I listened to horrendous tales by a police senior sergeant of how he had summarily executed several criminals -- he had a penchant for dispatching rapists and hiding their bodies. When he discovered by chance that I was a journalist, his interest in me took a rather nasty turn. I abruptly left that notiorious pub.
<P>
Activists also say that refugees fleeing conflict on the western portion of New Guinea island -- West Papua (Iran Jaya), where the OPM (Free Papua Movement) guerrilla movement is waging a battle to make the province independent from Indonesia -- are treated harshly by the PNG authorities.
<P>
Human rights campaigners also want the Port Moresby government to abolish the death penalty and to investigate allegations of abuses of power by the police force. Although the death penalty was effectively abandoned in PNG some years ago, it was reintroduced with the Criminal Code Act 1991. The revised law provides the death sentence for treason, piracy with assault, willful murder and attempted piracy with violence.
<P>
Since then a young Northern province man, Charles Ombusu, was convicted in February 1995 by the National Court of wilful murder and rape, and was sentenced to death. He had shot dead the father of his rape victim in a ghastly case.
<P>
However, in a successful appeal, the Supreme Court quashed that decision in April 1996 on the grounds of procedural irregularities. The court has yet to rule whether Ombusu should be discharged or tried again by the National Court on separate charges of willful murder and rape.
<P>
The last person to be publicly executed in Papua New Guinea was in 1938 when a man was hanged for murder under the Australian colonial administration. Since then there has been one non-public execution in 1954 when a prisoner was hanged for killing another inmate.
<P>
The re-introduction of the death penalty was one of two moves recently taken by the government in response to a rising crime rate in the country.
<P>
The PNG government in 1991 also enacted a controversial
International Security Act (ISA) -- later ruled by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional -- which gave the police sweeping powers of arrest. The ISA was seen by critics as a fundamental assault on constitutional rights with government empowering its security forces with draconian powers to proscribe certain organisations regarded as a threat to national security.
<P>
Landowner groups seeking compensation against project development companies, non-government organisations (NGOs) campaigning on environmental or civil rights issues, opposition political groups and even news media were seen as potential targets of the law.
<P>
Since the law was deemed unconstitutional in a Supreme Court ruling, the government has come under renewed pressure from human rights activists to respect the basic rights as provided under the constitution.
<P>
In response, the government earlier this year set up a human rights desk within the Department of the Attorney-General as a step towards establishing the National Human Rights Commission.
<P>
Announcing the decision, Prime Minister Julius Chan acknowledged that despite ''excellent'' constitutional provisions, little action had been taken since independence in 1975, to enforce alleged breaches of rights and freedoms.
<P>
Activists however lament that since Chan announced the formation of a National Human Rights Commission last December, it has not moved quickly enough to have such a body in place by now.
<P>
It would for example, they say, have been able to arbitrate and take preventive measures in the Miriam Willingal case. As the situation stands now, the girl remains in hiding ever wary of her wantoks seeking to claim their compensation booty.

<BR>
<Font size=4>Pacific journalists brace themselves 
for their 'toughest fight'</Font size=4>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>Like governments and editors elsewhere, those in the South Pacific regularly trade accusations about press freedom. But the arbitrary detention of a Tongan journalist for publishing pro-democracy letters has shocked the region.
<P>
By DAVID ROBIE in Port Moresby</B>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
Concern about press freedom in the South Pacific has been growing following the suspended jail sentence for a journalist in one country and alleged moves to muzzle the media in three others. 
<P>
International protests followed Tonga's recent detention for 26 hours of Filo 'Akau'ola, deputy editor of the weekly newspaper Taimi 'o  Tonga, for publishing pro-democracy letters. Two letter-writers were held for even longer, and the journalist was eventually charged with angering a civil servant. All three were given suspended  prison sentences in April, but 'Akau'ola says he will appeal.
<P>
Meanwhile, in Vanuatu, a gagging order was placed on the media by former Prime Minister Serge Vohor to stifle press reports about moves to oust him from leadership. Vohor held the premiership briefly after the recent general election, but was replaced by Maxime Carlot Korman after a split in the ruling party.
In Fiji, the government has denied it plans to muzzle the press following claims by Opposition Leader Jai Ram Reddy, who told the public that members of a cabinet faction "don't want you to know all the details about the scandals in government".
<P>
And in Papua New Guinea, a hastily constituted Media Council, representing the country's leading news organisations, staged a two-day public seminar in March involving leading politicians, judges, academics, an archbishop, journalists and grassroots activists in an attempt to defend press freedom.
<P>
As part of a constitutional review, expected to steer Papua New Guinea towards eventually becoming a republic, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan's government is seeking to introduce legislation which could fetter a traditionally free press.The Constitutional Review Commission has been given a directive to produce a draft law by June. 
<P>
Just two transnational media conglomerates control all the major circulation newspapers in the South Pacific. Through their subsidiaries, Murdoch's News (South Pacific) Ltd - acquired in 1987 - and French media magnate Robert Hersant's Groupe Pacifique Presse Communication (1988) in the French territories own five of the nine dailies in the South Pacific.
<P>
The 10th daily in the region, Guam's Pacific Daily News, has been owned since 1970 by the Gannett newspaper group based in Rochester, New York.
The most recent - and most controversial - daily, The National, began publishing in Papua New Guinea in November 1993. It is owned by a subsidiary  company of former Malaysian Senator Datuk Tiong Hiew King's family timber group Rimbunan Hijau which dominates the logging industry in PNG and has provoked a series of controversial Australian and New Zealand television documentaries. At least one, TVNZ's Frontline report "The Tiongs", has drawn legal threats.
<P>
Just two independent, relatively small circulation, locally owned dailies compete in this far-flung environment - the Cook Islands News and the Fiji Daily Post. But in spite of the monopolies in the daily press, the Pacific has a diverse and vibrant mass communications industry.
<P>
Ranging from the Post-Courier and Fiji Times to the fortnightly Tuvalu Echoes and monthly Madang Watcher; from EMTV's region-wide broadcasts via the Indonesian Palapa B2P satellite to Niue's tiny television unit, the news media caters for an audience and readership scattered over thousands of islands and atolls.
<P>
In French Polynesia, for example, the radio and television stations broadcast to 190,000 people spread over an ocean territory as large as Europe. Niue has a population of 2,000; PNG has more than four million.
<P>
The weekly church-owned Independent (formerly The Times of Papua New Guinea) has established a niche for itself as arguably the region's most influential publication for debate of serious development and social issues.
<P>
The style of radio stations is mostly state-owned, public service as adopted from former colonial nations. The style of the press which has become predominant is free market but with a strong public watchdog tradition.
<P>
Media coverage of Fiji businessman Tony Stephens and an aborted F$10 million out-of-court settlement led to a commission of inquiry which eventually forced embattled Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka to call a snap election in 1994.
<P>
In Papua New Guinea, too, newspapers have in recent years highlighted concerns over politicians and national policies - such as the attention paid to former Deputy Prime Minister Ted Diro and a "corrupt and corrupting" timber export industry.
One regional news magazine, Pacific Islands Monthly,  has noted that journalism  in the Pacific is "coming of age" as more and more independent publications and broadcast stations emerge.
<P>
The magazine adds that there is a distinctive shift away from government-run or controlled media with management of the media being taken over from expatriates by  Pacific islanders.
<P>
Another example of this development of Pacific news media has been the establishment of Pacnews, a regional radio news cooperative, in 1987.
Originally based in Fiji, Pacnews was expelled by the post-coup regime in 1990. It now operates from Vanuatu.
<P>
Tongan philosopher and media critic Futa Helu is cautious about the prospects of media freedom in the region.
<P>
"The important point is the media is an institution with a distinct morality and set of values of its own," Helu says. "These values are a part of the morality of liberal democracy, for modern media culture is an institutional embodiment of freedom of expression and the right to be well and truly informed." It is this character that has grated on local Pacific cultures whose values are opposed to media values.
<P>
The major print media in the South Pacific in the four key mass communications countries or territories in the region - Fiji, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea - have largely been dominated by foreign ownership. Murdoch, of course, has been the best-known player.
<P>
Less known, but also very powerful and influential, is the French media baron Robert Hersant. Owner of the conservative French national daily Le Figaro and several big regional newspapers which command more than half of the daily readership in France, the Hersant group expanded its empire into the French overseas territories and departments: in the Caribbean, first with Martinique, Guadeloupe and French Guyana, and then into the Pacific with New Caledonia and French Polynesia.
<P>
Hersant's California-based Groupe Pacifique Presse Communication, which owns television and press interests on the West Coast of the US, now controls all the French-language dailies in the Pacific. The group is also said to have come close to publishing an English-language daily in Fiji after the coups when an associated company made a bid for the publishing press and plant abandoned by the closed Fiji Sun.
<P>
Hersant owns Les Nouvelles Caledoniennes in New Caledonia (bought in 1987 from a group of businessmen which included anti-independence politician Jacques Lafleur), and La Depeche and Les Nouvelles de Tahiti in French Polynesia. At the time of acquiring the papers there was a "cleansing" of editorial staff - journalists regarded as too liberal or too sympathetic to Kanak independence were removed from the staff. All three papers have a conservative French perspective of the region.
<P>
According to Claude Marere, news editor of the Tahitian radio station Radio Tefana: "As part of the Hersant scenario, Polynesia must stay French, independence is tabu, and silence must be kept about the corruption involved in the main political parties for the reason that they are pro-French."
<P>
In the case of Murdoch, News (South Pacific) Ltd subsidiaries own the paper with the biggest circulation daily in the South Pacific, the Post-Courier (South Pacific Post Pty Ltd) in PNG, which sells some 32,000 (it peaked at 43,000 in 1994) copies daily. News Ltd also owns the Fiji Times, the largest selling Fiji daily, and the regional news magazine Pacific Islands Monthly (part of the Fiji Times Ltd group) which was uprooted from Sydney and moved to Suva in 1989.
<P>
By comparison, Guam's Pacific Daily News sells fewer than 20,000 copies and Pago Pago's Samoa Daily News fewer than 3,000.
<P>
Fiji and the Cook Islands have the only independent, locally owned, daily newspapers in the South Pacific - the Daily Post, founded by a group of small Fijian businessmen after the closure of the Sun, and the Cook Islands News.
However, late in 1993 the thrice-weekly Samoa Observer, owned by a Samoan matai, Fata Sano Malifa, moved to publishing daily. The rival Samoa Daily News, owned by an expatriate American businessman, closed down the other major Apia paper, Samoa Times, in mid-1994.

<Font size=3>Papua New Guinea's media independence </Font size=3>
<P>
<Font size=3><B>A logging company that owns a national newspaper, the Pacific's 'best' newspaper renamed and revamped, and now an inquiry into media accountability -- Papua New Guinea's media is going through interesting times.
<P>
By DAVID ROBIE in Port Moresby</B>
<P>
<HR>
<BR>
Papua New Guinea's latest newspaper venture, the Independent, made an embarrassing debut in May last year. Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan was guest of honour at the gala launching. But when time came to cutting the ribbon on the first bundle off the press, the papers were not to be seen.
<P>
The flustered management of the publishers, Word Publishing Company Pty Ltd, admitted that press problems had delayed the paper. When the new paper finally left the press, some distributors complained of missing out on the 24-page main news section.
<P>
This was an unfortunate start for a new national paper that has replaced The Times of Papua New Guinea -- a major influence in the country's publishing industry. The Times was a South Pacific benchmark for investigative journalism in the 1980s, leading to the Barnett commission of inquiry into the logging industry, the Pelair and Placer Pacific inquiries.
<P>
Closure of The Times and the launch of the Independent is a recent development in a dynamic news media industry in Papua New Guinea. In November 1993, a new daily, the National, launched by the Malaysian logging group Rimbunan Hijau, took on the South Pacific's biggest circulation daily, Post-Courier (then 43,000), a Murdoch-owned stablemate of the Fiji Times.
<P>
In November 1994, NauFM (20 per cent owned and managed by William Parkinson's Communications Fiji Ltd) made a trail-blazing start in commercial broadcasting. Using the latest all computer driven technology so far adopted by just two other global radio stations (New York and Sydney), NauFM has already made a dramatic impact.
<P>
In June last year, the Pacific Islands News Association, a regional media publishers' and owners' organisation, staged its convention in Papua New Guinea for the first time since PINA was founded two decades ago.
<P>
Word Publishing, wholly owned by Media Holdings Pty Ltd (shareholders being the mainstream churches: Roman Catholic, 60 per cent; Evangelical Lutheran, 20 per cent; United, 10 per cent; Anglican, 10 per cent), has taken on a big challenge trying to tackle PNG's uncertain weekend newspaper market.
<P>
Both the Post-Courier and the National have shied away from using a six-day week publishing formula because of doubt that there is sufficient market at weekends. At the time of The Times suspension  -- it may possibly be revamped as a magazine in the future -- it was selling about 9,000 copies a week, about 6,000 less than its Tok Pisin stablemate Wantok, and considerably less than the two dailies.
<P>
Media critics lament that the new newspaper looks little different from the Times -- apart from a change in masthead design and colours. Editorial staff were divided about the new paper. Word publisher and editor-in-chief Anna Solomon, who has been with the publishing group for 15 years, was critical about the closure of the Times.
<P>
Solomon is acknowledged as the leading woman journalist in the Pacific and is a strong advocate for more in-depth, investigative and independent journalism in PNG. She was selected as 'Pacific Woman of the Year' in 1993 by Pacific Islands Business magazine for her contribution to the media and press freedom.
<P>
According to Independent general manager Ian Fry: 'This move into the mass-circulation newspaper market represents a major expansion for Word Publishing which celebrates this year as the 25th anniversary of the publication of its first newspaper, Wantok. ' 
<P>
Launching the new paper, Prime Minister Chan said it was a bitter-sweet occasion: The birth of The Independent marked the death of the Times. He challenged the Independent to ensure that the investigative journalism of the Times which in the past 15 years had often shaken the PNG political and business establishment, survived.
<P>
'It is important that the media confronts corruption and slackness in the public sector as well as dishonest businessmen and individuals,' Chan said.
<P>
While insisting that his government supported freedom of the press as enshrined in the Constitution, he said such freedom carried 'responsibility and accountability' which had too often been lacking.
<P>
Elected leaders were made to answer for their behaviour at the polls and under the Leadership Code; yet journalists did not face the same sort of accountability.
<P>
'Journalists also have a lot of power, but are rarely, if ever, made to answer for abusing it, ' Chan said. 'If I do something corrupt or wrong, I will be slammed hard. That is the way it should be. Let the same apply to journalists. ' The Prime Minister said he wanted to see news media pay a greater penalty for abuses.
<P>
'There is nothing quite like a hefty lawsuit to work wonders for journalistic accuracy and responsibility. There is a more simple term for it here in PNG -- compensation, ' he said.
<P>
A Word Publishing director, retired Bishop David Hand, condemned corruption within PNG's national leadership and  said the new paper should also strive to change the spiritual and social life of the nation which had been so corrupted.
<P>
The irony of both Chan's and Hand's comments about corruption was that a Australian SBS Dateline television documentary had just alleged 'systemic and systematic' corruption in the PNG leadership. The investigative report detailed several controversial business dealings involving Malaysian companies and claimed a system of 'bribenomics' had taken over.
<P>
A challenging time for The Independent's debut. Media critics believe it needs to achieve the authority its predecessor Times  managed in the mid-1980s, for the new paper to gain the advertising and market share it needs.
<P>
The Independent has been wasting no time pursuing the challenge vigorously. In recent months it has run a series of probing reports on logging, housing, political corruption and national development policies.
<P>
In 1993 a subsidiary of the Malaysian-owned logging company, Rimbunan Hijau, launched a national newspaper in PNG, the National.
<P>
Then Prime Minister Paias Wingti launched the paper at its converted South Pacific Machinery warehouse headquarters in Port Moresby on 10 November 1993, proclaiming the occasion 'historic'. The K8 million enterprise was a bold move as part of the  prime minister's 'look North' policy and immediately stirred controversy.
<P>
Malaysia's Datuk Tiong, chairman of Pacific Star, said he could not help admiring Papua New Guinea's vitality and potential: 'PNG can be likened to a glittering diamond that has become a new focal point in the Asia-Pacific region.' He added that he hoped the National would serve the people of PNG well by being 'truthful and impartial' and by 'serving as a bridge between the Government and the people'.
<P>
But this is precisely where the controversy came in. The owners of the new paper were seen by some media critics and Opposition politicians as too close to the Wingti Government of the time and to the powerful timber industry lobby, dominated by Malaysian and Japanese companies, to be considered genuinely independent.
Sir Frederick Reiher, PNG's High Commissioner in Canberra, was among outspoken critics. In his weekly column in the influential Times of PNG (now Independent), he warned about the newspaper's probable conflict of interest. This arose, he said, out of the need, on the one hand, to maintain media impartiality and, on the other to defend its commercial interests.
<P>
Reiher said: 'The policy makers must be wary of the other interests that the new media promoters have in the country. Companies are self-interested and profit-seeking in the first place.
<P>
'Their prime and foremost concern is the protection and enhancement of their economic gains, to which end their media interests will certainly be exploited to the full. This eventuality will be so much accentuated if the media investor is also a major player in the development of the nation's natural resources.
<P>
'The media will become a powerful tool to influence popular support in favour of the foreign investor against all opposition, be they in the form of government policies or landowners' benefits.'
<P> 
In this case, the new media investor was the single largest forestry development company in Papua New Guinea. One could imagine the outcry if one of the country's largest mining developers, such as Placer or CRA, decided to establish a daily newspaper -- not that they would ever consider doing so.
<P>
Four Malaysians, two Papua New Guineans (business and political associates of the then prime minister) and a New Zealand lawyer were on the board of directors at the time the paper made its debut. Majority stockholders (51 per cent) were from Monarch Investments (a Rimbunan Hijau group company) and the minority PNG shareholding was expected to be increased over a three-year period.
<P>
Rimbunan Hijau executive officer George Yong said the newspaper venture was consistent with RH's long-term thinking about Papua New Guinea: 'We have been invited to this country by successive governments. Timber is our mainstream business, but we are also good at publishing.' In Sarawak alone, the RH group employs 15,000 people. The group is involved in copper, gold, plantations, shipping, insurance, heavy machinery, banking, and it owns a Chinese-language newspaper in Kuala Lumpur, Sin Chew Jit Poh, with a circulation of about 150,000.
<P>
In PNG, the Rimbunan Hijau (PNG) Pty Ltd group dominates the export log trade, although while the Forests Ministry insists it has an 86 per share, RH says it is considerably less than that.
<P>
It directly employs 3,000 people and its activities in 1992 reportedly earned an after tax profit of K350 million. It has one of the world's largest timber concessions at Makapa, Western province, with timber rights over 7 million cubic metres of exportable log. In February, 1993, the RH group's chairman, Datuk Tiong, announced that the local company would build a K150 million integrated wood processing complex near Port Moresby.
<P>
Since then there has been little word about the project. This prompted the Post-Courier to remark recently in an editorial: 'The question that is begging is whether [landholders] should believe any of the big announcements about downstream processing projects? ' The National's owners tried to downplay the controversy over the paper.
<P>
Even the title was kept secret -- until a week before the launch date -- and this was said to be because of sensitivity over such a name for a foreign-owned paper. A 'national' denotes an indigenous PNG citizen. Until then the paper had been known as the Pacific Star.
The present editor-in-chief and executive editor are Papua New Guinean, however virtually all the subeditors are Malaysian or Filipino. Editor, Frank Senge Kolma, one of PNG's best-known journalists is Wingti's former press secretary.
<P>
Rival Post-Courier editor Oseah Philemon has been undisturbed by the new challenge. 'It is a good thing for us to have competition,' he says. 'It isn't good for a democracy to have a media monopoly. We have a good team to face the challenge. And now I think people realise how independent we are.'  
<P>
Meanwhile moves are afoot to check the independence that PNG's press has been able to exhibit. As part of a constitutional review, expected to steer Papua New Guinea towards eventually becoming a republic, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan's government is seeking to introduce legislation which could fetter a traditionally free press.
<P>
A hastily constituted Media Council, representing the country's leading news organisations, staged a two-day public seminar in March involving leading politicians, judges, academics, an archbishop, journalists and grassroots activists in an attempt to defend press freedom.
<P>
The Constitutional Review Commission has been given a directive to produce a draft law by June 1996. Commission chairman Ben Micah recently led a fact-finding delegation to five Asian countries -- including China -- regarded as having an authoritarian view of the news media or practising censorship.
<P>
'Is there a real justification for such a move? ' asked The Independent. 'Any attempt to tamper with the freedom of the media must be viewed cautiously.' Micah was asked to cite three examples of alleged abuse by the news media as evidence of a need for legislation. Micah listed two instances, both involving himself.
<P>
The Media Council argues that regulating the media is not a substitute for good government. Both the commission and the Prime Minister have pledged that the basic, constitutionally guaranteed, freedom of the media will be upheld, but that greater 'accountability' will be sought.
<P>
But community leaders and editors are sceptical. They say laws of defamation and an existing process of self-regulation based on a press council are adequate safeguards.
The arrest of the Tongan journalist increased concern in the region, including the media in Port Moresby, because Tonga's constitution -- like Papua New Guinea's -- guarantees freedom of speech.
<P>
Although Papua New Guinea has rarely figured on international lists of transgressing nations over violations of press freedom -- two gaggings of the National Broadcasting Commission in the past two years have been cited -- editors believe they are waging their toughest fight.
<P>
Professor David Flint, chairman of the Australian Press Council, told the Media Council seminar that United States constitutional protection for the press was an example the Pacific could follow. In effect, he said, the US First Amendment prohibited laws abridging freedom of the press.
<P>
Flint also highlighted safeguards within Papua New Guinea's own constitution. Under Section 46, every person in Papua New Guinea has the right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
<P>
Opposition Member of Parliament John Momis, one of the fathers of the constitution, said the objective of Section 46 was to be a 'formal guarantee' and a 'formal protection of the citizens' innate rights and freedoms'.
<P>
He recalled that the provision was founded on 'one of the great principles on which democracy rests [that] is the right to differ on any topic of discussion, be it social, economic, political, cultural or religious'.
<P>
If the government were to truly honour this constitutional provision, he said, a Freedom of Information Act would be passed.
<P>
A leading PNG journalist, Neville Togarewa, branded the constitutional media review as 'rash, ill-conceived and without justification'.
<P>
He said the review had been forced by the government's 'failure to financially support its own information and communication services to better serve government and the public'.

<Font size=3>By LYNNE AMEPOU<P>
A student injured in last month's [June] clash between police and university students plans to sue the police for alleged damages.
<P>
Philip Yobale, 28, a final-year creative arts student, was injured when trying to escape from teargas fired by the police into the crowd. 
<P>
He suffered a deep gash on the right side of his forehead, which needed seven stitches, and bruises on his body. 
<P>
"I was suffocating and couldn't see where I was going," he said. "I was pushed against the iron main gate."  
<P>
<P>
<P>The university doctor, Dr Ninikama Moiya, confirmed he had treated two students for injuries during the protest, including Mr Yobale.
<P>
Mr Yobale also had his four-year-old son, Raymond, with him who also suffered from teargas inhalation and scratches on his body. 
<P>
Mr Yobale said: "I have asked the doctor for a report and will take action in conjunction with the university's Student Representative Council."
<P>
SRC president Leslie Menei and vice-president David Arore could not be reached for comment.
<P>
A student leader, Aula Kobale, who was arrested during the clash alleged he had been beaten up and abused by police when taken to Waigani police station.
<P>  
"No charges were laid against me and I was treated like a criminal," he said.
<P>
He was released after an hour when Mr Menei called the police.

 STUDENTS CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH USER-PAY<font size= 3><p>

 
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>

By MADLYN AREK
<P>
Student leaders from both universities -- University of Papua New Guinea and the University of Technology -- are looking at every possible avenue to change the PNG government's controversial "user-pay" policy -- even if it means pursuing the matter in court.
<P>
Two conferences have been planned to be held in September and October at the UPNG campus and Unitech.
<P>
The students, general public, non-government organisation and prominent leaders will be invited to aur their views on the user-pay policy.
<P>
Awareness campaigns against the user-pay policy have been scheduled for tertiary students during the Christmas break.
<P>
The chairman of the awareness campaign, Sandis Tsaka, said: "The small Papua New Guinean will be the one whop is going to be severely affected by the policy, experiencing an increase in the costs of basic services."
<P>
The Governor of Manus, Stephen Pokawin, informed the students and members of the public at the sit-in protest at Parliament that fees would increase by 10 per cent next year and if the government stayed in power by 1997 then parents would need to be prepared to pay 50 per cent by the year 2000.
<P>
A student leader criticised the government for "mismanaging" the country's resources and blaming it on the economic crisis.
<P>
The Education Minister, Dr John Waiko, told the students that government introduced the new merit scholarships in 1997 for tertiary, technical and secondary students with proven academic excellence.
<P>
"Two hundred of these scholarships would be offered to tertiary students while the secondary and technical institutions would receive 100 each," Dr Waiko said.
<P>
The students who could not pay their way through their studies would borrow from the government, then repay their loan later.<BR>

PIPELINE TO LINK PNG GAS FOR QLD MARKETS<font size= 3><p>

 
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>

By JOSEPH MOROKANA
<P>
A Canadian company, International Petroleum Corporation (IPC), is embarking on plans to build a pipeline linking Pandora offshore gas field in the Gulf Province and the Kutubu gas fields in the Southern Highlands province, to deliver Papua New Guinea gas to Queensland. 
<P>
The agreement signed by IPC and Chevron Niugini in March this year will carry out a feasibility study to deliver one trillion cubic feet of PNG gas to Queensland markets for industrial demands. 
<P>
IPC manager Ted Webb has met with Chevron Niugini for discussions and construction of the pipeline will commence once the study has been completed.
<P>
Mr Webb said: "We have always thought that the Pandora project could be vital in making substantial changes to the Queensland energy market. It could bring large gas resources in PNG to the Queensland market. 
<P>
"By combining the gas resources in PNG, we may also consider linking North Queensland to Central Queensland. This could lead to long-term competitive energy prices permitting faster economic development in PNG and Queensland."
<P>
He said that developing offshore and onshore gas resources in PNG would bring significant benefits to the country. 
<P>
The feasibility study of linking Pandora and Kutubu gas fields was initiated in December 1995. It includes: 
<P><UL>
<LI>IPC 48.19 per cent.

<LI>Command Petroleum Gulf Pty Ltd 16.36 per cent. 

<LI>Ampolex (Pandora Reef) Pty Ltd 12.73 per cent. 

<LI>Pacarc (PNG) Pty Ltd 6.36 per cent.

<LI>Claremont (PNG) Pty Ltd 6.36 per cent. 

<LI>Secab Niugini Pty Ltd 5 per cent.

<LI>Oil Search Ltd 5 per cent.
</UL><P>
Mr Webb said IPC will negotiate with the parties concerned and ensure that contact and discussion with villages along the pipeline route, regarding environmental impacts and other issues relating to the proposed development will continue regularly.
<P>
Mr Webb said the PNG government was instrumental in initiating this approach to investigate the possibility of linking PNG's onshore and offshore gas to service the Queensland markets. 
<P>
Chevron's government and cmmunity affairs manager, Epoa Lalatute, said it would take time and effort to carry out the study to see whether the project would be economically viable for the country. 
<P>
He said it was important to reach a resolution with the parties concerned to enable the project to get underway.
<P>
"There has to be a continuity in discussions and resolutions with the landowners in the Torres Straits, Kikori and Kutubu areas where the pipeline is going to run," he said.
<P>
Meanwhile, earlier this year two Southern Highlands landowner groups threatened to shut down the Kutubu oil field and the pipeline carrying the key export commodity to the coast.
<P>
Mining and Petroleum Minister John Giheno when answering their demands said: "The law clearly states all forms of mineral wealth are owned by the state. It does not belong to one person, a group or a tribe where those resources are found."
<P>
Mr Giheno welcomed the negotiations, and promised to pay outstanding dividends to the landowners. However, he rebuked the landowners over their high demands.
<P>
IPC, the operator of the joint venture, is exclusively engaged in international oil and gas exploration and production.

FOCUS : Toothless Tiger? No. This watchdog knows how to bite.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Raphael Semel </strong><p>


<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>

If you're a politician, it wouldn't be surprising if you're nervous about a dog snapping at your heels. A dog? Well, a watchdog. <P>

	This watchdog, the Ombudsman Commission, keeps tabs on Government bodies and public figures as it carefully monitors this crucial period of financial crisis and corruption taking place in the country.<P>

	 It is an independent commission which is not subject to direction and control of any person or authority. And it safeguards the rights of citizens by preventing maladministration by Government agencies, abuse of power, bribery, fraud, misappropriation of public funds for personal gain and corruption. <P>

	The Ombudsman Commission is described as a "cleaner" which cleans up the backyard of public leaders and organisations. <P>

	The commission performs two major political functions in investigating "complaints" and "leadership". The complaints division can investigate any misconduct on state service, provincial service and violation of rules in government departments or statutory bodies by people in authority.<P>

	 A brochure says an organic law on the "duties and responsibilities of leadership" gives power and permission to the commission to bring to book all violations of the leadership code by leaders of the nation.<P>

	 The brochure also says public figures like the personal staff of the Governor-General, ministers and opposition leaders would lose their credibility and reputation if injustice casts a shadow over them.<P>


<strong>Malpractices: </strong>The commission is happy to investigate on its own initiative or on a complaint by a person affected by the Government agencies. It is understood that it cannot "bite" or "harm" the Government organs and leaders who get out off hand; it just carries out research and investigates malpractices.<P>

	But the commission has legal power to call upon the head of a department to produce all documents, files and relevant papers regarding the complaint. <P>

	The commission is currently investigating the alleged misappropriation of educational division funds in Oro province.<P>

	 The Provincial Administrator of Oro, Murray Maroroa, says: "The education auditor is under pressure to collate and submit the reports to the Ombudsman soon." The complaints division of the commission will put the jigsaw puzzle together by analysing reports to find the faults. <P>

	"The ombudsman would move a step closer to investigating the reports of each teacher," says Mr Maroroa. This would specifically identify where and what is the root cause of the malpractice and would give the commission an opportunity to make recommendations about the problem.<P>

	 The ombudsman can summon anyone who would give evidence or information in connection with the investigation and can enter any premises occupied by state services to inspect the place in relation to a complaint. It is responsible to instruct and put pressure on leaders if they do not behave according to the law or leadership code.<P>

<td width =270 align left>

	The commission project officer, Leo Oaeke, says leaders have to know laws on duties and responsibilities. Mr Oaeke adds, "the commission could take action against leaders who violate the regulations."<P>

	 Mr Oaeke worked with the Foreign Affairs Department and Governor-General's Office before going to the Ombudsman Commission.<P>

	 He is a new project officer in the public awareness and training unit of public relations.<P>

	He was attached to Uni Tavur for two weeks in March. And he now plans to do a desktop publishing short course in June, which would be held at UPNG by the South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information in Development <a href = "UniT_SPCenCIID.html">(SPCenCIID).</a><P>

	The commission is free to explore the untouched realm of politicians and can disclose information about malpractice and corruption.<P>

	<strong> Privacy: </strong>Individuals who hold on to the public purse and have access to public facilities must be aware that you are not well protected under the Privacy Act. <P>

	The leadership division of the Ombudsman Commission cannot physically touch you but it can make inquiries to take necessary action to enforce compliance by leaders, and also investigate violations and breaches of the leadership code. <P>
	The commission can take tough or easy steps to request leaders to submit vital documents such as annual statements of assets, incomes, business connections, business transactions, gifts and liabilities and accounts of public monies.<P>
	<strong> Legal process: </strong>If there is evidence of violation of the leadership code or misconduct in office by a leader then the matter is referred to the Public Prosecutor for legal process by an appropriate tribunal. <P>
	If the leader is found guilty then recommendation is made to the appropriate state authority to dismiss the person from office or impose other penalty on him or her.<P>
	The Ombudsman would easily identify wrong conduct if it is: 
<UL><LI> Contrary to law.
<LI> Unreasonable, unjust, oppressive and discriminatory - whether or not it complies with the law.
<LI> Based on improper motives and irrelevant grounds and considerations. o Based on mistakes of law or fact.
<LI> Conduct for which reasons should be given but have not been.</ul><P>
	The commission has restrictions which prohibit it from investigating some Government agencies.<P>
	It would not question a decision by a court unless it appears defective in law or administrative practice but would never make an inquiry into the setting up of rules by a local government body.<P>
	<strong>Major role:</strong> The Ombudsman Commission plays a major role in the country but has limited powers to publish its proceedings, reports and recommendations to the general public. Investigations conducted by commission are confidential. <P>
	Last year, The Independent published an edited version of the Auditor-General+s report of its investigation into two lease agreements by the National Housing Corporation with Neisenal No 77 Pty Ltd which was tabled in Parliament on March 28.<P>
	The Auditor-General did not have access to some documents such as board meeting minutes for 1993 and 1994. The secretary of the NHC said the documents were under the custody of the Ombudsman Commission but the Auditor-General was unable to obtain them.<P>
	Once a year the Ombudsman Commission presents a report on the functions and work of the commission with its own recommendation for improvements to Parliament.<P>
	An informed source says the commission is not working at full capacity and is not covering all provinces so that it can carry out its duty. The source says: "This is because the National Government is not fully using the commission by allocating sufficient funds to the Ombudsman to carry out its function." <P>
	Many people say "the commission isn't a toothless tiger nor a creature of the Government in power to whitewash the sins of Government agencies and politicians."<P>
	It is there to perform its constitutional duty, ensuring that Government agencies do the right thing regardless of colour, creed, wealth or poverty.<P>
	 The Ombudsman Commission wants justice to prevail as a flag of the nation rather than abuses of power to overshadow the less powerful people.<P>

VIEWPOINT : An embarrassing bias over aid.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Sorariba Nash </strong><p>


Doesn't 21 years of journalism education expertise in the Pacific count? <P>
	The University of Papua New Guinea has produced more than 150 journalism graduates - many of them in prominent positions in the media around the Pacific today.<P>
	According to one survey, 68 per cent of PNG's journalists have tertiary qualifications. UPNG was the base for UNESCO's Pacjourn (Pacific Journalism) program.<P>
	In return for the expertise it shared with other Pacific countries before the pendulum swing to Fiji, it has become an aid pariah in the region even though we have time after time demonstrated our value.<P>
	 Only one UPNG application under the Pacpress program (US$168,000 for the region) over the last three years - funding for a consultant in our Certificate in Investigative Journalism program launched last year - has been accepted. The other two were not even given the courtesy of an acknowledgment. <P> 
	Fiji-based applications get favourable treatment.<P>
	 The bias is so blatant we'd think twice about applying again to UNESCO. Thanks to organisations like the Post-Courier, Canada Fund through CUSO, the Dutch media aid agency CAF and the NZ High Commission we have had some welcome assistance in recent years.<P>
	Now we hear that AusAID has come up with a five-year aid package called the Pacific Media Initiative to the value of A$3 million. And introducing the scheme, it has put out a project design document. <P>
	This flawed document was supposedly compiled after "wide-ranging consultation" with organisations and individuals within Australia and the Pacific region. <P>
	Although we hear that Papua New Guinea is one of the beneficiaries of this package, none of the individuals or media organisations from this country were consulted. 
UPNG was named as one of five peak journalism training institutions in the report but nobody from this end was consulted. <P>
	The names and organisations are entirely Australian and Fijian apart from regional bodies like the Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association (PIBA), Pacific Islands News Association (PINA), the South Pacific Commission (SPC) Media Centre and the University of the South Pacific - which are all Fiji based!<P>
	This is quite embarrassing. We from this end feel "inadequate" or more so, we don't count anymore. Australians would have been better off calling this package: Australia-Fiji Media Initiatives.<P> 	This is a blatant act of bias and discrimination. If it is a crime to be a member of the Melanesian race and state, I have no regrets at all. <P>
	Maybe I'm just a dumb Papua New Guinean crying "foul" for no good reason. But I think with such persistent attitudes of the outsiders, we have grudgingly fought of such a defeating sense of inferiority complexes over the years. <P>
	However, I am proud of what PNG media has achieved and what it still strives to do.<P>
	On the other hand, I am too embarrassed to attend the coming PINA convention in Tonga later this year and face those "super humans". I'd prefer to stay home and pray that AusAID entertains all our applications under this package. <P>

<IMG alt=UniTavur Icon BORDER =0 ALIGN=BASELINE WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=30 SRC="Unit_slug.gif"><Font size= 5> Uni Tavur wins best student  paper  prize <font size= 3><p>

<strong> Staff Reporter </strong><p>


	Uni Tavur has won another journalism award  - this time the best newspaper prize in the latest JEA Ossie Awards.<P>
	Announcing the awards this week, judges convenor Roger Patching of Charles Sturt University said Uni Tavur had won the prestigious print prize in the Best Regular Student Publication category of the 1995 Ossie Awards for student journalism.<P>
	The annual awards are competed for by individual students, newspapers, TV and broadcast programs at more than 22 universities in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific.
	This is the first time an award has gone to a Pacific tertiary institution. The judge, Max Suich, chief executive of the <Emp>Independent Monthly<emp> in Sydney, said Uni Tavur was  "by far the most impressive" of the student publications. 
"It has a level of maturity in its writing and editing and a concern with serious national issues that made it stand head and shoulders above the others," he said.<P>
	Journalism lecturer David Robie welcomed the award, saying it rewarded the paper's "tireless efforts".<p>
	Uni Tavur last year won a Pacific community newspaper award. Students from QUT and Charles Sturt University dominated  most of the individual awards.<P>
	David Robie, lecturer and managing editor of Uni Tavur, said: "We've been on the right track in our editorial approach. This is a credit to our students as we have been up against university journalism departments in Australia and New Zealand with publications produced by far greater resources than we have."<P>
	 The Ossie Awards are sponsored by journalist, educator and author Sally White in memory of her father, the respected  author and journalist Osmar White. <P>
	The Journalism Education Association (JEA) represents lecturers at the 22 professional journalism courses at Australian universities as well as journalism teaching staff at institutions in Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand.<P>

The new face of UPNG law and order.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Rapheal Semel </strong><p>



	THE ADMINISTRATION of the University of Papua New Guinea has taken strong steps in the past three months to restore the well-being of the campus and to win back its high reputation and credibility. It has succeeded in drastically reducing the level of lawlessness on campus. <P>
	Vice-Chancellor Dr Rodney Hills gave this message last month at the 41st graduation ceremony to public, staff and students. <P>
	"The 'situation crime report' has successfully indicated that less crimes are committed every two weeks on campus - not like the past, when the crime record was high and committed regularly," he said. <P>
	A positive indication of a reduced law and order problem has boosted university morale. The administration's new direction is to socialise and cooperate with other university body units to "weed out" criminal activities. <P>
	<strong>Public outraged : </strong> Also at the graduation, founding father Sir Michael Somare said the situation on campus had developed to a point where the public was outraged at the number of students and teachers being killed on the campus, and students being intimidated against doing their studies. Sir Michael added that the violations and destruction of property were uncalled. <P>
	He said the campus should be a source of national pride not disgrace. <P>
	Several constructive, preventative measures have been taken to fight crime. <P>
	"Neighborhood watch" groups have been set up to monitor staff houses and other areas within the university community. The management has increased security manpower by employing 20 more temporary staff. <P>
	The registrar, Thoa Iamo, said the Vice-Chancellor had written a letter to Deputy Police Commissioner asking for a stun-gun licence to be granted to the university security unit.<P>
	This is to protect security men dealing with dangerous criminals entering the university premises.<P>
	"The stun-guns would also be beneficial to assist security safeguarding students and staff," said Mr Iamo.<P>
	Temporary security guard dogs are now operating effectively within the main campus, and medical and creative arts faculties.<P> 	Security chief Mark Alu said: "The new security personnel are the right calibre with a better background of education and security techniques." <P>
	The security unit have mace and flare-guns for protection. However, the unit still wants the administration to issue them with bulletproof vests to protect them from rascals using high-powered firearms. <P>
	Mr Alu has asked the Vice-Chancellor to install alarm devices in all academic staff houses and student dormitories.<P>
	The devices would be of great assistance in case of accidents, where they would press the alarm to inform the security about the accidents. He believes there should also be a road built around the university fence which security could patrol at night to keep outsiders from coming in.<P>
<strong> Firm support : </STRONG> The president of the Student Representative Council, Lesley Menei, said the SRC had firmly supported the moves initiated by the Vice-Chancellor to fight crime.<P>
	"The administration has cooperated well with SRC, student services, security advisory committee, security unit, regional groups and provincial groups," Mr Menei said. "The on-going problems which have been demoralising the reputation of the university are now declining."<P>
	Mr Menei said despite the cooperation to weed out crimes there was a list of students who would be facing the student-disciplinary committee for allegedly breaching the bylaws of the university.<P>
	He added that they would face different charges, according to the degree of crimes being committed.<P>
	The "situation crime reports" have indicated the law and order problem on campus has been reduced. However, the student female warden, Rosa Au, criticises the reports saying serious crimes are still being committed. <P>
	Mrs Au backed up her criticisms, saying female students were still reporting cases of harassment and assault by male students.<P> 
	"One female student was assaulted by her outsider boyfriend during the graduation," she said.<P>
	Some factors contributing to the reduction of criminal activities are: 
<UL><LI> The students now pay "user" fees and think about studies.  <LI>No fortnight allowance pay to students. 
<LI> An alcohol ban on campus.
<LI> Closure of the university club.
<LI> A tough stand and cooperation among university administrative units.</UL><P>
	 The accommodation of staff and students on campus are far apart and students do not share ideas or play games with staff. <P>
	There is no peace and harmony among both parties - but isolation and hostility. Perhaps the administration should consider building staff and students accommodation closer together in future. <P>

Council votes to sack Rali.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Staff reporter </strong><p>


The University Council of the University of Papua New Guinea yesterday decided to dismiss a senior national academic.<P>
	The head of the chemistry department, Dr Topul Rali, is being dismissed by the council for his involvement in the destruction of university property late last year.<P>
	Dr Rali was suspended in January for being allegedly involved in a violent incident in which the office of the Vice-Chancellor and accounts office were ransacked on December 22 - the day after anthropology lecturer Janet Kisau was murdered.<P>
	Dr Rali was protesting over the tragic death. About K10,000 worth of damage was caused by the rampage.<P>
	An investigation was ordered into the incident. It was completed about a week ago and the report handed to the council. <P>
	Sources said the report was considered yesterday and a unanimous decision was reached to dismiss Dr Rali.<p>
	"There was indisputable evidence that Dr Rali was a party to the ransacking of the offices and destruction of property," one source said. <P>
	The sources said the council was taking a tough stand on misbehaviour by both staff and students.<P>
	Earlier this month, Vice-Chancellor Dr Rodney Hills announced a strict new code of conduct for academic and other staff. <P>

PACIFIC : Papuan flag prisonor's death shock.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Special correspondent in Jayapura </strong><p>


Mystery surrounds the death of West Papuan anthropologist Tom Wainggai, whose body's return to Jayapura this week triggered rioting in the Irian Jaya capital.<P>
	Witnesses said three people were killed, scores injured and 37 arrested as protesters burned vehicles, shops and other buildings.<P>
	 Mr Wanggai was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in 1989 for raising a West Papuan flag - the "Morning Star" - in Jayapura seven years ago.<P>
	 He died last week while being driven to a hospital from Cipinang Prison in Jakarta.<P>
	Mr Wainggai was not known to have had any health problems until, a few days before his death, he complained of feeling unwell.<P>	
	 Suspecting that his food had been poisoned, he refused to eat the prison food supplied by the guards, sources said.<P>
His condition rapidly worsened and he asked the prison governor, Mintardjo, for permission to go to a Christian hospital for examination and treatment. But this was refused.<P>
When his condition deteriorated, he was taken from his cell last Thursday for transfer to an Indonesian Government hospital but died on the way.<P>
	 His Japanese-born wife, Teruka, wanted the International Red Cross to conduct an autopsy of her husband's body but the Government said this could only be done at a Government mortuary.<P>
	She first heard of her husband's death from a Jakarta-based NGO. Teruka herself served four years in prison. She was sentenced to eight years in 1989 because she had sewn the flag which her husband unfurled on December 14, 1988. She was released in November 1993.<P>
	Military authorities have said Mr Wanggai died of natural causes.<P>
	 West Papua Movement (OPM) rebels are still holding 11 hostages, including six Europeans, after 75 days in captivity to highlight their struggle for independence from Indonesia. A Madang-based OPM leader, Moses Werror, has appealed to the rebels to free the hostages. <P>
	The European Parliament last week passed a resolution seeking communication with the OPM in a bid to free the captives. The resolution cited the difficult human rights situation, environmental destruction and the pressure on maintaining West Papuan culture and heritage. <i >Tapol </i ><P>

INSIGHT REPORT : Press freedom at risk.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Raphael Semel </strong><p>

Judges, politicians, academics, civil servants, an archbishop, media executives, journalists and grassroots activists have debated the future of the nation's news media and the freedom of the press at a two-day public seminar in Port Moresby.<P>

Organised by the Papua New Guinea Media Council, the seminar+s theme was "Freedom at the Crossroads - The Media and the Constitution". <P>

Council chairperson Anna Solomon pledged this week that it would help media organisations and the Government to improve the industry. <P>

"The council is now in place. It is now finalising its regulations which will help its media work," she said.<P>

She added that the Australian Press Council, whose chairman, Professor David Flint, was a guest speaker at the seminar, would assist the PNG council. <P>

Freedom of expression as provided in the constitution was a focal point of seminar discussion because of the Constitutional Review Commission (CRC) task to review freedom of the press and media accountability. <P>

Views contrasted sharply, although most speakers strongly defended the principles of freedom of speech and self-regulation by the news media. <P>

One of Papua New Guinea's constitution "fathers", <strong>John Momis, </strong> said section 46 - freedom of expression - was based on the fundamental principle of democracy lying in the rights of individuals.<P>

Different rights gave an opportunity to each person to contribute creatively and constructively to the political, economical, social and cultural life of the country, he said. <P>

<strong>Unjust laws : </strong>"To fulfil this obligation may mean exercising the feedom of speech to criticise unjust and ineffective laws and policies of the government of the day," Mr Momis said.<P>

He believes the media is accountable to the nation's citizens rather than any particular department, group or organisation. Therefore media is an active instrument to promote people's awareness and consciousness about events in the country.<P>

However, <strong> Chief Justice Sir Arnold Amet</strong>, who opened the seminar, highlighted the CRC+s terms of reference "whether changes need to be made to ensure that, while freedom of the press is maintained, owners, editors and journalists of all elements of the media are accountable and that persons aggrieved by the media abuses have accessible redress."<P>

<strong>Fragile subject : </strong> Sir Arnold said freedom of the press was a fragile subject. <P>

"Do not pretend for a moment that a free press is perfect and has no faults and does not produce ill-effects or consequences," he said. <P>

"You all have a powerful influence on that which can be good, so does a free press with hidden political agenda, malicious intent and irresponsibility be a powerful destructive influence in a community." <P>

Media organisations played an important role in society in facilitating freedom of expression and publication of ideas and opinions. <P>

"No individual, private or corporate, has any absolute right to do or say anything that has the potential to harm or denigrate the reputation of another, without justification," Sir Arnold said. <P>

He encouraged media organisations to report events and issues accurately and with balance. Culturally, many Papua New Guineans were far more offended by untrue stories, immorality, explicit sexuality and violence in media than in western countries.<P>

Vital issues discussed at the seminar included: 

<UL><LI> The constitution.
<LI> What is accountability.
<LI>Community expectations.
<LI> The role of media or press councils.
<LI> Public information services.
<LI> Journalism training for the future.
<LI> Experiences from other lands.</UL><P>

The Archbishop of Port Moresby, <strong>Sir Peter Kurongku</strong>, said media must provide information which people had the right to know. <P>

"Things are happening in the country which people need to be informed about," said Bishop Kurongku. He said news media should explain satisfactorily about the happenings because they were responsible and accountable for disseminating information.<P>

<Strong>Code of ethics :</strong> However, he said media must first be accountable to God then to their own conscience to respect others in terms of the code of ethics, integrity and commitment.<P>

The media should not be accountable to one particular organisation like Parliament or the government of the day. But the media must be responsible for inaccurate, incomplete, unbalanced or defamatory information. <P>

The general manager of Word Publishing, <strong>Ian Fry</strong>, outlined the role of mass media to inform the community on current issues and to comment on them; to educate the people in matters affecting human and community; to provide open access for community; to entertain and to provide access to the market for business, goods and services.<P>

Mr Fry said the important issue was the mechanism of accountability and the status of the body to which each group was accountable. <P>

There were formal mechanisms to ensure accountability of leaders. He said an important aspect of the role of the media was to seek the truth, to oppose injustice, inequality, violence and the destruction of environment and to hold a mirror to society and all its institutions. <P>

The Opposition spokesman for finance and planning, <strong>Masket Iangalio</strong>, said freedom of expression was under threat. The country was entering a "dangerous" time for the constitutional democracy.<P>

Mr Iangalio said some unthinking and uncaring leaders who did not want to be exposed to public scrutiny and debate threatened the provision of freedom of expression.<P>

<strong>Bad images : </strong>However, the chairman of the CRC media committee, <Strong>Professor John Waiko</strong>, told seminar participants that the CRC did not intend to abolish "and will not abolish" section 46.<P>

But the CRC would closely reconsider information available through Internet. This was to control or stop the offensive and bad images such as pornography that come through the internet channel.<P>

Prof Waiko challenged the media to analyse and reevaluate its present condition to promote unity in the country.<P>

<strong>Professor David Flint</strong>, chairman of the Australian Press Council and chair of the executive council of the World Association of Press Councils, said the essential role of the news media was to "subject public life to scrutiny". <P>

He cited Justice Black of the US Supreme Court in his ruling denying injunctions sought against the New York Times and Washington Post in the 1969 Pentagon Papers case:<P>

<blockquote>"In the First Amendment the founding fathers gave the press the protection it must have to fulfil its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.<P>

"The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people. <P>

"Only a free and unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in government."</blockquote>

A senior Post-Courier journalist, <strong>Neville Togarewa</strong>, stressed several misconceptions and weaknesses of the government and the media. Media as the fourth estate and watchdog of the country had been misconceived by bureaucracy of being constantly in conflict with government. <P>

"Government is concerned about the selection and placement of stories in the press and electronic media - but this is obviously the job of the editorial committees," he said.<P>

Mr Togarewa blamed successive governments for failing to provide adequate resources to make the National Broadcasting Corporation truly "the voice of the nation". Thus the overnment needed other media avenues to publicise information.<P>

It should not restrict or regulate the media but instead pass a freedom of information act to allow journalists to have access to cabinet records - the official documents which citizens needed to know about. <P>

<strong>Some mistakes :</strong> He admitted that journalists sometimes made mistakes through bias and misreporting and said they must be held responsible. The code of ethics was an essential element of accountability. <P>

Mr Togarewa encouraged the employers to provide on-going training to give reporters necessary skills to confidently do their job. <P>

He said the Government should help the training of journalists by allocating sufficient funds every year to UPNG's South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information in Development and the Divine Word Institute in Madang. <P>

A lecturer in journalism at UPNG, <strong>David Robie</strong>, highlighted the "significant and valuable" training and input the university had provided for students in PNG and the South Pacific in the past two decades. <P>

Mr Robie said research had shown 68 per cent of Papua New Guinean journalists had a tertiary qualification, contrasting with other South Pacific countries such as Fiji which had 16 per cent.<P>

He added that many of UPNG's graduates today held high positions in the media industry and other respective areas. He praised the assistance of the Post-Courier, New Zealand High Commission, UNESCO and CUSO through the Canada Fund in recent years.<P>

The training newspaper Uni Tavur had last year become a commercial tabloid. Last month an electronic newspaper version had been launched on the World Wide Web.<P>

"Students now graduating from UPNG have a level of computer literacy undreamed of three years ago," he said.<P>

<strong>'Hard realities' : </strong>Many graduates could now produce publications with their firsthand experience of the "hard economic realities" of advertising and distribution.<P>

But Mr Robie also appealed for further funding for air conditioning in the newsroom, a major revamp of broadcast facilities and development of resource materials.<P>

Broadcast lecturer <Strong>Sorariba Nash</strong> made a plea for the purchase of vital equipment for training students in radio and television journalism basics. <P>

"Courses in electronic media are divided into two categories - radio and TV," he said.<P>

"There is an old studio with broken down machines. Our TV camera was taken away by another university department which has nothing to do with training media personnel," Mr Sorariba said.<P>

"With the cutback in Government spending on tertiary institutions, this is the time for for the business houses to lend a helping hand." <P>

FOCUS :  The tragedy of Janet Kisau.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Michael Miise </strong><p>


December 1995 was crisis time. It was the most lawless month on Waigani campus
that senior staff of the University of Papua New Guinea can recall.<P>

Break-ins happened everyday as the atmosphere of crime and fear worsened. Then
four days before Christmas Janet Kisau, a lecturer with the department of
anthropology and sociology, was tragically murdered.<P>

She was shot dead just a day before she was due to fly to Australia to begin a
doctorate at La Trobe University in Melbourne.<P>

A day later a group of drunken academic staff ransacked the accounts offices
and assaulted the acting bursar in protest over the death.<P>

An expatriate professor and his wife were threatened and the academic was
forced to take research leave.<P>

The crisis rounded off a year of unprecedented violent incidents.<P>

Last May, commerce lecturer Oigen Konio was stabbed to death in a gang attack
just meters from his house on campus. Two students were also murdered and there
were scores of break-ins and car thefts.<P>

<strong>Safer place </strong>: New Vice-Chancellor Dr Rodney Hills took office in the second week
of January and quickly pledged to make the sprawling campus a safer place for
more than 2500 staff and students.<P>

"Urgent action has to be taken to improve security for individuals and property
on campus," he said in a "state of the university" address to academics and
university employees.<P>

"Staff, students and property are threatened by unlawful behaviour. The
situation is causing morale to deteriorate.<P>

"Staff are leaving - recruitment is becoming difficult.<P>

"Staff and students are fearful, and female students have found it unsafe to
move around after dark. Evening academic activity has all but stopped."<P>

Some of the problems had stemmed from outside the campus; others had been been
caused by "undisciplined personal behaviour" by staff and students, Dr Hills
said.<P>

Often the behaviour had been associated with drunkenness.<P>

"If the university is to be a credible centre for higher education, these
trends have to be reversed."<P>

He added that "protecting the people" on campus must be his first priority.<P>

Dr Hills quickly followed his promise with the installation of floodlights in
strategic sites around university buildings.<P>

<strong>Strong attack </strong>: But while Dr Hills made a strong attack on "aggressive and
threatening" behaviour from some staff and students, he did not discuss action
or investigations over specific violent incidents such as Ms Kisau's death.<P>

Janet Kisau, in her mid-30s, was a mother of two. From Yakandanda village,
Wabag, in Enga province, she did her grades 11 and 12 at Aiyura National High
School in 1981-82.<P>

She graduated with an honors masters degree at La Trobe University in 1993 and
was to return there to do her doctorate when she was slain.<P>
Ms Kisau was held up outside her home at Fort Banner with two friends after
returning from a Christmas party  about 2.30am on December 21.<P>

The two companions, off-duty policemen, reportedly fled to warn the campus
security office about the hold up when she was shot.<P>

Ms Kisau is survived by her daughters, Eva Nemba,12, and Gloria Nemba, 10, who
were living with her at the time of her death.<P>

Janet Kisau was well known by staff and students and was regarded as a great
loss to her department, the university and the country.<P>

"I'm very saddened by her death", says anthropology lecturer Vincent Warakai, a
lecturer with the anthropology and sociology department.<P>

"She was very friendly to all, speaks to people of all works of life and was an
approachable person. She had academic potential that she was going to pursue
and she would have made a great sociologist."<P>

Campus Review, the Sydney-based newspaper circulating to universities in
Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, reported that a La Trobe senior
anthropology lecturer, Dr Martha Macintyre, who was to have been Ms Kisau's PhD
supervisor, described her death as a tragedy.<P>

<strong>Graduate  studies </strong> :  Dr Macintyre said Ms Kisau would have been one of the few
PNG women who went on to do graduate studies and was a "very intelligent and
extroverted person who was enthusiastic about anthropology".<P>

The death of Ms Kisau led to the ransacking of the university accounts office,
causing K10,000 damage.<P>

Protesters also assaulted the acting bursar at the time, Everest Mwesigye, and
a security guard. Mr Mwesigye returned to Uganda.<P>

Professor Hal Markowitz, director of the university's Institute of Continuing
Development Education, was threatened and told to leave the country. He left
with his wife in early January for research leave.<P>

Acting dean of arts, Professor Ron Huch, told staff: "As usual, the
perpetrators had been drinking. It is incomprehensible that such actions
should occur on a university campus - especially one in such a state of
distress.<P>

"To say that UPNG and all of us are in peril is an understatement. Please take
as much care as you possibly can over the next two weeks."<P>

Dr Topul Rali, head of the chemistry department and a former UPNG disciplinary
committee chairman, was alleged to be one of the protesters in the rampage and
the university is investigating his case.<P>

On January 3, police raided six staff houses on campus during the investigation
over Ms Kisau's death and charged two academics and a civil servant with
firearms offences.<P>

Anthropology lecturer Jo Mangi was fined K200 by the Boroko District Court for
possessing a rubber bullet and a gas gun bullet said to be of a type used by
police to disperse rioters.<P>

Agriculture and Livestock Secretary Dr John Kola was also fined K200 for
possessing 250 .22 rifle bullets and nine shotgun cartridges.<P>

Dr Rali has been charged with  possession of a high-powered firearm and
pornographic magazines. He has pleaded not guilty and his case has been
adjourned to next Wednesday.<P>

Acting university security chief Mark Alu said the homes of three other
academics  -  current disciplinary committee chairman Dr Paul Mawa, education
lecturer Joe Kerpei and law graduate Gibest Kerekere - were raided but none
were charged.<P>

<strong>'Families fear' </strong>: "Academic staff cannot teach to the best of their ability
because they always think about their families back home and fear that they
might be attacked," Mr Alu said.<P>

Mr Warakai was later assaulted in an attack believed to be linkedwith the
police raid.<P>

City police chief Philip Taku appealed to UPNG residents to immediately
surrender any unlicensed firearms or amunition.<P>

Addressing students on campus earlier this month, Mr Taku said he was also
concerned at the many cases of rape and other crimes on campus and in the
residential areas.<P>

"The university authorities have pledged to support police in weeding out
criminal activities on campus," he said.<P>

Mr Taku appealed for student cooperation with police.<P>

The Vice-Chancellor, Dr Hills, has called for "neighbourhood watch" groups.<P>

"The university has a boundary that is too long to manage effectively with
present resources," he said. "However, we'll introduce guard dog patrols in
sensitive areas." <P>

<h4>Vol 2 No 1, November 1995</H4><P>
<Font size=5>EDITORIAL</F5><P>
<Font size=3>LAST YEAR we launched this journal for the first time. It was a modest effort to get the first regional magazine dealing with Pacific media, mass communications and journalism issues based at a Pacific tertiary institution up and running. But the high level of interest in <B>Pacific Journalism Review</B> is heartening. A steady flow of subscriptions have come from regional news media organisations and libraries. We also already have a number of articles being contributed.
<P>
However, last year we promised the content would be more regional for this second issue. Once again it is heavily concentrated on Melanesia, particularly Papua New Guinea. We make no apologies for this. It is appropriate for this issue as a number of news media developments during 1995 focused attention on Papua New Guinea. In September, Madang hosted the South Pacific Forum -- with the biggest ever international news media contingent -- and later in the month the whole of Papua New Guinea celebrated its 20th anniversary of independence in colourful style. 
<P>
Earlier, in late June, a regional media organisation held its annual convention in Port Moresby. During that time the Chan Government gagged Roger Hau'ofa's talkback show on Radio Kalang when three prominent Papua New Guineans, including former Chief Ombudsman Sir Charles Maino, were barred from discussing controversial legislation which abolished the provincial government system. The gag was condemned by the Paris-based Reporters sans Frontières and regional media groups as an infringement on the constitutional right to free speech and a free press.
<P>
Ironically, the gag came just two two days after the PNG Prime Minister told the media convention that news and debate should be seen 'as the lifeblood of democracy and freedom ... as the people’s right to know'. And equally ironical, the gag was effectively imposed by a former editor of one of the Pacific’s finest newspapers.
As the year drew to a close, speculation that the Government might impose some form of media controls in Papua New Guinea became a growing concern for media organisations and journalists. Commented the <I>Post-Courier</I>, by far the region’s biggest daily newspaper: 'Moves by the Constitutional Review Commission to legislate against press freedom is the beginning of a move towards a dictatorship style of government for Papua New Guinea. If Parliament goes ahead to restrict freedom of the media, it will destroy democracy in this country.'  As the paper pointed out, PNG has enjoyed a relative media freedom which has allowed a free exchange of views and opinions on a wide range of issues. A healthy exchange that has made PNG the envy of many developing nations throughout the world. Added the <I>Post-Courier</I>: 'Parliament must stand up for the right to free speech and freedom of the media.' 
<P>
So must the journalists. Lack of a professional organisation at present makes the  PNG news media vulnerable to such curbs. One factor troubling the Government has been the sympathetic view of the landowners often given by the news media over resource development compensation disputes such as the Ok Tedi mine pollution and logging exploitation.
<P>
Media controls have again become an issue in the Cook Islands. Government bans on  journalists, attacks on the media by Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Henry, obstacles making it difficult for foreign journalists to visit the country, threats over the residency status of journalists, and finally draconian legislation have been the name of the game for several months. More than 1000 Cook Islanders signed a petition opposing the draft bill. We hope journalists and the public in the Cooks and around the region vigorously defend their media freedom. 
In future issues we expect to have more articles, and contributions for the Forum section, from the Eastern Pacific countries -- and also some of the countries with large Pacific Islander populations. There are many media stories to be told. So how about it?
<P>
In this issue we include several papers from the Pacific Islands News Association convention, the first ever in PNG. Prime Minister <B>Sir Julius Chan</B> makes a plea to serve 'truth' with development and calls for greater professionalism among the ranks of media practitioners. Former Chief Ombudsman <A HREF="95maino.html"><B>Sir Charles Maino</B></A>, now a practising lawyer, observes that freedom of the press sometimes gets rough handling by authorities and governments around the world, but in the Pacific the right must be protected for the people. Foreign Affairs Secretary <B>Gabriel Dusava</B> argues that some 'mischievious' foreign news media present a caricature of PNG and other Pacific countries. Journalism lecturer and author <A HREF="95vision.html"><B>David Robie</B></A> defends the media, saying that image-massagers sprucing up Pacific government images aren't enough to prevent a 'bad press'. His colleague, <B>Sorariba Nash</B>, sums up a seminar debate on how well the mass media in the South Pacific has covered military, social and political conflicts in the region such as Bougainville. A Manila-based journalist, <B>Kunda Dixit</B>, gives a refreshing overview of the touch of paranoia displayed by some Pacific governments toward the news media.
<P>In other articles, <A HREF="95times.html"><B>Harlyne Joku</B></A>, gives a personal tribute to <I>The Times of Papua New Guinea</I> which sadly closed in May. Peter Cronau discusses 'self-censorship -- the most insidous gag'. <A HREF="95invest.html"><B>Walter Nalangu</B></A> reports on a new postgraduate investigative journalism course at the University of PNG. An edited script of  the controversial <A HREF="95sbs.html><B>Helen Vatsikopoulos</B></A> SBS <I>Dateline</I> report on corruption in PNG follows. <I>Saturday Independent</I> columnist <B>James Pinder</B> pokes fun at the hypocrisy of Pacific politicians who take themselves so seriously at the media's expense while <B>David Robie</B> recounts the latest attacks on the press.  Some of the problems of PNG's National Broadcasting Commission are analysed by <B>Ian Boden</B>. <B>Sorariba Nash</B> reports on a new international news flow research project. Professor <A HREF="95copyright.html"><B>John Nonggorr</B></A> examines the copyright dilemma and <B>William Ferea</B> the death penalty issue for PNG. From Fiji, <B>Philip Cass</B> presents a devil's advocate case for why a free press could not work while <B>Kiery Manassah</B> reports on the pressures facing Vanuatu's state-run news media.
<P>
Concerning the resumption of  French nuclear tests in the region in the face of unprecedented international opposition, <B>Ekonia Peni</B> gives a commentary  about nuke protests at the South Pacific Forum in Madang and PNG's 20th independence celebrations. <A HREF="95rainbow.html"><B>David Robie</B></A> recalls the fate of photojournalist Fernando Pereira on board the bombed <I>Rainbow Warrior</I>  a decade ago.
This edition also begins a regular series of profiles of leading journalists. Included this time are <B>Neville Togarewa</B>, special writer of the <I>Post-Courier</I>, <I>Saturday Independent</I> senior business reporter <B>Abby Yadi</B> and investigative journalist and academic Associate Professor <B>Wendy Bacon</B>, who exposed foreigners involved in the Fiji coups and who conducted workshops for investigative journalists in PNG in July. 
<P>
One of the major objectives of <B>PJR</B> is to to provide a forum for critical analysis of the news media in the Pacific today and to contribute to a climate of debate that will help improve professional and ethical goals for the future. As one senior newspaper executive mused: 'Unfortunately our journalists in the South Pacific are not yet real investigators. They handle the stories as one-off events and then leave the junior reporters to carry on with the follow-ups -- if they remember!'

<h4>Vol 1 No 1, November 1994</H4><P>
<Font size=5>EDITORIAL</F5><P><Font size=3>Journalism and related information and mass communication issues have a dearth of outlets in the South Pacific. While the region's news media has developed technically in leaps and bounds in the last decade and journalistic standards have risen, the region's information profile remains much the same. The major daily newspapers remain dominated by foreign ownership -- the newest daily, The National in Papua New Guinea, is Malaysian-owned -- and television/radio remains, in spite of the increasing number of privately owned FM broadcasters, in the hands of the state or, in the case of PNG's EMTV, an Australian television network.
<P>
Given this situation there is surprisingly little reflective journalism or analysis of the state of the media today in the Pacific, or of issues such as freedom of information, freedom of expression, ethics, ownership, gender in the media, development, and the public relations industry. None are better placed to provide this sort of insight into the media than the tertiary research and teaching institutions of the region.
<P>
Besides the long-established University of Papua New Guinea journalism diploma and degree program (which was founded in 1974 and has educated a generation of Papua New Guinean and other Pacific journalists) and Divine Word Institute's communications arts courses at Madang (1981), the Pacific Journalism School was launched at Manukau Polytechnic in New Zealand (1987) and the University of the South Pacific has started a French-funded journalism degree course this year. It is timely then that we at UPNG's new South Pacific centre for Communication and Information in Development should produce this first issue of <B>Pacific Journalism Review</B>.
<P>
Planned as an annual publication, <B>PJR</B> will combine the characteristics of an academic journal and a professional industry publication. It will include both research and articles of general interest by journalists and media people -- anything that will enhance the quality of journalism and the study of it in the South Pacific will be considered for publication by the editorial board. Indeed, this issue includes an article by a first-year journalism student at UPNG, and a senior journalism student, <B>Tande Temane</B>, is one of the co-editors as part of his requirement in an advanced print media production course.
<P>
Perhaps some may say that for a publication with 'Pacific' included in the title there is surprisingly little regional content. We make no apology for this. Papua New Guinea has by far the biggest news media industry and academic media research tradition among South Pacific island countries. In recent years, information about the media has tended to be dominated from Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. This first issue of <B>PJR</B> is intended to restore some of the balance. However, future  issues will be far more regional in content and we invite contributions. Should readers wish to debate any issues raised in this edition we have a Forum section and we welcome your views.
<P>
Papua New Guinea is the first country in the region with a national communication and information policy. It is a contentious issue in PNG and several contributions address it. <B>Neville Togarewa</B> points to the anomalies and contradictions of the NICP policy while discussing a ban imposed by the former Wingti Government on the National Broadcasting Commission reporting of a supposed 'secessionist' summit among Islands region premiers. 
<P>
This is of particular interest as no such ban was ever imposed during the six years of the Bougainville civil war which appeared to be finally drawing close to peace in October 1994. Three papers from 'The Role of the Media in PNG' seminar in July 1994, sponsored by the PNG Council of the Churches, also discuss the issue -- <B>Rev Oria Gemo</B> defends the policy and explains its objectives; another member of the policy making committee, <B>Fr Diosnel Centurion</B>, discusses the 'prophetic role' of Christian media; and <b>David Robie</B> examines some of the ethical dilemmas posed by the policy.
<P>
In other contributions, <B>James Pinder</B>, in his wry Times of Papua New Guinea column Pinder's Watch, gives an amusing account of how things 'are going down the gurgler' in the media; <B>David Robie</B> describes the occupational hazards of journalists globally and what this means in the Pacific; Fiji's news magazine The Review tells how it came close to being deregistered over a revelation about an unprofessional liaison between Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and a reporter; <B>Anna Solomon</B> discusses the role of women in the media; and we publish part of the transcript of ABC Four Corners reporter <B>Deborah Richards'</B> 'Bush Bugarap' documentary on the plunder of forests which caused such a stir in PNG.
<P>
Also published are <B>Sorariba Nash's</B> disturbing account of the media 'propaganda' trends in PNG, particularly in government press offices; <B>Jessie Waibauru</B> pays a tribute to two decades of the UPNG student journalist newspaper Uni Tavur; and the <B>Times of Papua New Guinea</B> contributes an editorial on the abortive Bougainville peace conference.
<P>
Happy reading and we look forward to a wide selection of contributions next year.
<P>

<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The real conundrum is presented by deeply theocratic societies like Iran today or Afghanistan under the Talibans tomorrow, or intractably primitive communities. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Can there be journalism in a society where the most important truths were revealed once and for all one thousand four hundred years ago? Do you report female genital mutilation as such, or as a Bar Mitzvah? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I don't know the answer, but I do know that if a moral exception or a suspension of judgement is made in such cases, they should not extend to the wives of an Asian dictator's sons who wear not purdah but Chanel.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Communist China occasionally rumbles on about unique values, yet its official philosophy denies such things as Asian values. And China remains hard put to explain why it was wrong for foreigners to kick around Chinese in the past the way Chinese officials kick them around in the present.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I have never heard of an Asian liberation movement that demanded national slavery in place of foreign domination. It was always liberty, fraternity, even equality or at least progress for the majority and not just a select or foreign few. I would be insulted if it was ever suggested that I, as an Asian, ever raised my fist to have it manacled as an assertion of cultural identity.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So far we have yet to stumble upon a single viable Asian value.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Lee Kuan Yew paid lip service to the primacy of the family in the Asian scheme, yet wasn't he reported as having proposed a two-tiered system of rewards to discourage procreation by the less smart and encourage it among the gifted? That's not Asian; that's pre-war German eugenics. In fact, the foundation of Singaporean success is the abolition of the traditional Oriental family and the eradication of its corrosive influence on public administration.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The model for Meiji Japan was not Confucian China on its knees before the European powers but Prussia. On the other hand, the historical parallel of the Philippines under Marcos or Indonesia under Suharto would be England under the Stuarts.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The secret of Asian success, where it has happened, was not Asian values but British-style administration, German-style tactics and the French Civil Code. The story of modern China is the struggle to overcome the anarchy of its Confucian roots for the cleanliness, order and prosperity of the foreign legations - spread nationwide. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Thousands of years of Confucianism, said the Economist in its New Year's issue, coincided with the same number of millennia of famine, crime, weakness, corruption and science going the wrong way. “If Asian values encourage clean living,” said the Economist, “why are so many booming Asian cities bywords for vice and corruption? Until recently, these ancient traditions were blamed for Asia's backwardness. The authoritarian systems they bred stifled individual initiative.”
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
At no time in Asian history has individual freedom conflicted with national survival or economic development. Chinese liberals did not obstruct Chinese progress; Chinese authoritarians ripped the country to shreds in the attempt by each to take all of it for himself. Until the communists took over it all.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It was the communists in the army who attempted to seize power in Indonesia; the power held by the army today. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The idea that journalism in Asia must, as this one writer put it, "respond to the surge of [Asian] value aspiration rising from underdevelopment" is drivel.

<B>Questioner 5</B><BR> 
I'm just wondering if you're familiar with the term 'development journalism' in the Philippines and what it in fact means to Filipino journalists. One interpretation is that it is a method by journalists to counter the very negative images that are portrayed of societies and peoples in the developing world. DO you have a particular view on that.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
In the Philippines 'developmental journalism' is known as 'envelopmental journalism'. It's a journalism that's basically fuelled by the envelopes the politicians and the public officials pass out. Just tell it, tell what you see. We don't hesitate, the newspapers don't hesitate to say something that's good about the country — why not? it's our country — if it's there. But if it turns out that there's a kidnapping of a Chinese businessman's son every day, I don;t care what it does to foreign investments I'm going to have to write it and say it.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 5</B><BR>
So did that mean journalism is just a form of — an ideological journalism?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
It's an excuse, an excuse for hiding the truth. I don't think that's ever good. There are exceptions of course, in the case of ethnic conflict, but that's something else.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 1</B><BR> 
I'm sorry, I'm going to ask you another question. It's just that your lecture seemed to give a very positive view about, or a somewhat Utopic view of how journalists should operate, be it in Asia, Africa, Europe whatever, as a continent. While the Philippines is a very free and open press, the same cannot be said about other countries, for example Indonesia where you have so-called private radio and television stations which are forced to re-broadcast the news bulletins from the state owned. Where you have people having their magazines closed and cannot exercise their rights and freedoms. That involves self-censorship, it involves laws that forbid opening of newspapers, of magazines, giving of licenses. How hard do you think it is to operate as an independent, outside of the 'values', just as a plain old following-the-code-of-ethics journalist in Asia?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>

You're right. In a previous conference someone put me in my place there. If I have suggested that we Filipino journalists, because we are free, are superior to everyone else: well, that's what think and that's what Americans and they're right to think that, because anyone who exercises full freedoms and expresses his conscience is really better than the man who cannot. But then I do recognise that I can say what I please within the limits of the libel law in the Philippines, but it takes much more courage for an Indonesian to say half of what I would say in total freedom. Because he's going to get shot if he doesn't watch out. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I fully appreciate that some newspapers in some of these countries have to settle with half the truth, and that's not to put them down. I must say that during Martial Law in the Philippines, although we had profound contempt for the only newspaper allowed by Marcos to operate (by his friend), that paper tried at least once in a while to tell a story. When Senator Aquino was assassinated, first they didn't print it, they said it didn't happen, then they put it out small. That's better than nothing. It took courage for that editor to put it out as a small item under 'community news' [laughter]. So, as I say, it's easy for me to talk now, it's harder for him.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 6. Paul Thomas.</B><BR> 
I'm just interested to know your opinion in the growing English press in South East Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia and Thailand, and how they're directed at an elite or ex-pat community, and how the issue of Asian values may be implemented slightly different between the press printed in the vernacular and the press printed in English.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
I can't comment, I wouldn't trust my comment, on the use of Bahasa Indonesia in Indonesian newspapers or in Malaysian newspapers. In the Philippines — there was a question last night about whether English language newspapers are just talking to themselves — in fact in the Philippines the English language newspapers dictate the political agenda. There are, the vernacular is used for the tabloids, which basically — I'm not joking — what they deal with is crime, the pin-up girl and vampire visitations [laughter]. It's true. It sells. It's the broadsheet English newspapers that determine the political agenda. They decide what's a truth, what's a fact, even the interpretation of it. So far in the Philippines the English language journalism's what really counts. And of course it reflects libertarian values.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Chair. </B><BR>
Just on that question — and I think it's a very good question — but I refer you to the fact that this afternoon we have in the segment on western perspective on news, there is some comments from Khun Tulsathit Taptin, who's the deputy editor of Bangkok Nation, who's with us this morning. But I think it might be best to invite him to perhaps expand on that very good question this afternoon. Any more questions before we close? I think we have time for one or two more.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin </B><BR>
I'd like to make a comment. Because — the Bangkok Post?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>

Bangkok Nation
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin. </B><BR>
Just a peculiar thing. Thailand is a very, almost an insular culture. It's really unique. And the funny thing was that when Mr Aquino was assassinated by the military one of the strongest newspapers to denounce it was the Bangkok Post, and that's where we were getting our news. They were printing both American journalists who covered the assassination and their own feelings of outrage. There was even a student demonstration against the Marcos government in Bangkok, so that says something about Asian values and whether Asians are distinctly Asian as [?word?] are or are not capable of feeling the same outrage towards political crimes and suppressions of individual freedoms.

Of course the danger is that working with rather than against the govern-<BR>
ment can become such a habit of mind that we would not recognise the need to break ranks even when it is staring in our face. But let us not forget at the same time that there is no such thing as freedom of the press. The degree of freedom enjoyed is determined by political and commercial considerations. Every newspaper and TV station determines for itself how much freedom it can possibly enjoy. This tradition and practice is universal. both in the east as well as the west. In recent years commercial considerations have become more prominent. Journalism is a business. That is reality three. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
A most dramatic demonstration of this was disclosed recently in a book by Mr Andrew Neil, Full Disclosure, which came out last week. Mr Neil said Mr Rupert Murdoch sacked him as editor of the Sunday Times in 1994 because the paper had alleged that kickbacks were paid for contracts in Malaysia. Mr Neil writes: 'Mr Murdoch had seen the row with Malaysia as a potentially disastrous threat to his business interests.' Mr Neil contends that the articles jeopardise the success of Star TV in Malaysia. Mr Murdoch had paid $US525 mill for Star TV. So naturally he wants a return on that half a billion dollars. He seems to have got it because four weeks ago Star TV finally gained access to the Malaysian market.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now given these realities you might wonder what there is to cheer about. No, we are not disheartened. The media is full of reports on the economic boom in Asia, Singapore's economic success is legendary. WE went form being a basket case in Asia to the second richest country in Asia in 30 years. No government is going to let this hard earned success be jeopardised, especially not now. The end of the Cold War has started a new race. Countries now jockey for competitive positions in trade and business. To keep and improve its position, business and government too would need good timely information. So the pressures to provide such information will grow. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The challenge for journalists is whether they can provide such information to help their country stay ahead in the economic race. For their own good newspapers have to help their countries stay ahead. As their country prospers, so will they. And profitable newspapers are in a better position to provide wider range of services. This is, I believe, a new dimension to the practice of journalism. If newspapers don't or can't rise to this challenge readers will go elsewhere, and technology will make it easier and faster to find alternative sources and to gain access to the information they want. Already in Singapore 150 000 out of 750 000 households are on line. The rest are expected to go on line by 1999. It is going to get harder and harder to control what people see, read and communicate. Ban a publication and people will turn to the internet. It's already happening. Cosmopolitan magazine, banned in Singapore, can be read on the 'net. So the inevitable end result of economic success and the push towards high tech society is a happy one. The OB markers will move, and launch a new age. And age in which there will be a freer flow of information and a freer press. And on that cheerful note ladies and gentlemen I thank you for your attention.

Section Three</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The first is the communications revolution.  Computers, modems, satellites,
and the Internet are combining to eliminate political and geographical
boundaries.  Reaganites would have us believe that the arms build-up
destroyed the Soviet empire.  I'm more inclined to believe it was the inability
of the Soviet leaders to control the flow of information from West to East. . 
Once enough Soviet citizens could compare the end results of communism
to those of capitalism for themselves, the jig was up.  No propaganda in the
world can hide a reality in plain view.  And so the Berlin Wall came down
and the Iron Curtain rusted away.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The Internet is one of the great democratizing forces in the world. Anybody
with a computer and a modem can gain access to it.  And through it can
gain access to the world at large.  What's more, the Net remains largely
untamed.  Governments will attempt to rein it in and no doubt will have
some success - the potential replacement of personal PCs with networking
terminals in offices is seen as one move along this route. But I suspect the
Net is a bit like the AIDS virus.  You can obstruct it for a while, but it
eventually finds a way around the blocker.  I suspect scientists will have
greater luck controlling AIDS than will government in controlling the Internet. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Let me provide an example. The news media is rushing to put its stories on
the Net.  None of them have quite worked out how to make this pay - though
the Wall Street Journal is experimenting with charging - but they feel they
have to be there because it is the future.  (Personally, I would have grave
doubts about starting a print publication as a stand-alone business in this
day and age).  Not long ago, Reuters put a story on Cambodia on the Net.
Not long afterwards, the agency received a furious protest from that
country's government.  The complaint created initial confusion at Reuters
because the story was generally favorable.  Eventually, management
discovered that someone had done some minor but key on-line editing,
turning a generally favorable piece into a critical one.  This sort of thing will
continue to happen. There is no lock created that people don't quickly learn
how to pick.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The other force for change is the steady evolution of the so-called First
World economies from industrial bases to service bases, with a strong focus
on the information/entertainment sector.  When allied to the
communications/information technology revolution and the steady decline of
barriers between nations, this development fosters the creation of global
media giants.  Ted Turner's CNN was a forerunner of this trend.  Rupert
Murdoch's News Ltd. empire is the archetype.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But there is something else. Historically, media empires have been owned
by individuals with an strong interest in news gathering.  Even the owners of
commercially-based TV networks like NBC and CBS in the U.S. took their
greatest pride in their news operations, even though the entertainment side
paid all the bills.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This is no longer the case.  A growing number of today's media empires are
owned by companies whose managements are not all that interested in the
truth-seeking aspect of journalism.   They may not even see it as vital to the
functioning of a true democratic society.  Here, I am talking primarily about
the U.S., where General  Electric owns NBC, Disney controls ABC,  and
Westinghouse calls the shots at CBS.  But we are seeing similar shakeups
and developments elsewhere.  The new owners want their empires to have
a piece of the Asian business action and are not about to let their news
operations, which contribute little or no profits, mess things up by revealing
too many naked emperors. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The full ramifications of this development are yet to play out.  But there has
been at least one straw in the wind.  During the opening ceremonies of the
Atlantic Olympics, NBC commentator Bob Costas make a passing remark
about China's less-than-scintillating human rights record.  Other
commentators subsequently discussed charges of drug-taking by Chinese
swimmers, observing that their performances at the Games fell far below
previous efforts when drug-testing was less strict.   Beijing complained and
NBC subsequently apologized.  In an earlier time, there is no way NBC
would have done any more than accept the complaint and perhaps offered
soothing words.  But now GE runs the show at NBC and GE has a massive
commercial stake in retaining good relations with China.  News coverage
does not contribute much to GE's bottom line.  And, today, bottom lines
matter more than prestige.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Taken together these developments raise intriguing questions for news
coverage of the Asian business story.  The western view of journalism,
especially in nations deriving from the British tradition, is vastly different
from that held in Asia.   Good journalism is essentially adversarial.  It
winkles out the truth from whatever source and publishes it.  More often than
not that truth has to be winkled out of those who hold power and revealed to
those who do not.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This creates the potential for serious cultural clashes.  Everybody here is
familiar with the actions of many Asian power structures when subjected to
serious journalistic scrutiny.  Local reporters are censored at best, jailed and
severely punished at worst.  Foreign correspondents are warned, ejected or,
more recently, sued along with their employers. And come July 1, the one
bastion of free press in Asia - Hong Kong - passes from British to Chinese
rule. Finding a base from which to cover the Asian business story without
will be tricky.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Traditionally, business journalists have not been as adversarial to their
subject as their political and social counterparts.  But that doesn't mean they
have been toothless.  And they are becoming more aggressive as better
minds come into the field and the story moves from the back pages to the
front.  Personally, I'm not into ideological confrontations with my subjects -
and most business journalists I know are much the same - but I do hold with
truth-seeking.  A lawyer/politician member of my family once remarked that
evidence not subject to cross-examination is useless.  I might say the same
about journalism.  It is an adversarial business because its raison d'etre is to
present the truth, insofar as the journalist can unearth it, about a given
subject.  And while there are those who hold that much of the media
diligently separates the wheat from the chaff and publishes the chaff, there
are a those who do attempt to publish the wheat on a regular basis.

<B>Question 4 Kalinga Seniveraine</B><BR>
I would like to ask Ms Siva about training of journalists to report what I would call an 'Asian perspective' and specifically a Singaporean perspective. And also I would like to add something more before you answer that. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now recently, just last week, we had this experience in Australia where two Thai newspapers have written very strong editorials which I would say were the Asian perspective's about Australia's race problems. And the Prime Minister Howard said in parliament that they misrepresented Australian government's policy. Which sounded really similar to what Le Puan Yu and Dr Mahathir has described Australian media over the years when they have reported about the two countries. Now if you are to train journalists to report with that Asian perspective (I'm not talking about 'Asian values' more Asian perspective), because, the media as it is, the international media ... 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
For example what we are seeing in Asia is rapid urbanisation, which is really often described as 'westernisation'. Now ... building the world's first cyber city Pukhaja ..., and when that city's built I'm sure the western media will say that Islamic Asian nation has become secular and westernised, but you will find any such city anywhere else in the world. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So how do you . . . for example when you look at the western societies, you see an ... of western societies, what is called a new age is really the age old tradition of Asia, for example yoga is being prescribed by doctors here to treat hypertension and heart diseases. And also there's yoga teachers in suits teaching stress management  in big corporations. So also earlier you said there are Singaporeans who go overseas, learn western techniques of news production and all that, when they come back, how do you train a journalist - in other words if I use this unfashionable word in this age of globalisation - how do you colonise their mind [laughter]? To report from a western perspective, but probably using the techniques, the production techniques they use in the west.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Siva Arasu</B><BR>
I think there are some things that are universal, that's not east and west. I think we're all agreed on that. And, how do I decolonise their thinking: I don't try to, because I think living in Singapore - they're smart for one thing. When they go away they come back, they can see the difference. And the way to train a person, not necessarily a journalist, is to train their mind to think. I do not want them to think the way I do, but they way that they think for the good of their own community. And at the same time that they can live with themselves, that is what I think is the other objective of my training program. Not to make them think the way we all do. If they think the way I do and I am very much older than them, what's going to happen is Singapore is not going to progress very far. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The way I think is determined by the circumstances and the history during which I grew up. They are going to grow up in a different era, different time, and they'll have their own history. So they cannot think the way I do. So the way to do it is I think for them to apply the universals of searching like all of us for what it best for our own community, the truth for our own community. And at the same time on an individual level to live with our conscience. I think that's all I can do as a trainer. There's no special method I use.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question 5 Annmarie Anton</B><BR> 
I'm Annmarie again, freelance journalist. I'd be very interested to hear more on the side of Ms Arasu in terms of the Pauline Hansen debate. I'm giving an overrun again, but I'd really like to hear it from you, working for a company like Singapore Press Holdings. How was the Pauline Hansen debate covered in Singapore, and how has it filtered in a company like yours, and if you could also mention other companies, and whether there is truth in the statements that it's actually effecting badly the business relationships between Australia and Asia. And how that's filtered in your training as well: did you discuss it on a training level as well?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Siva Arasu </B><BR>
We ran the statements made by Pauline Hansen and a few days later we ran an unfortunate story which happened to our defence personnel in Perth. Three groups of them at three different times were assaulted, pelted with eggs and attacked by various people. And every story that we got from Australia suggested that Pauline Hansen  is to be blamed. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Anyway, what happened is that there was a statement released by both the Perth government as well as Singapore government saying this will not effect relations. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Within the organisation what happened is that we of course - Singaporeans being like any other community - reacted to what they see as a racist attack. And so we got our fare share of letters from people who were emotional, whose points of view were certainly rather hysterical. We did not suppress all those points of view, but we did not run all of the letters we received. What we did was we picked letters that presented the different points of view in what we considered was a non-inflammatory way.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Did we discuss it in our training program? We didn't discuss it in our training program, we did discuss it in our news rooms. And I think our overriding concern is the bigger picture. Most of us have been to Australia at least once. For many Singaporeans they have been to Australia more than once, and I can't say I know of any Singaporeans that did not enjoy their time in Australia holidaying. And many of them also read Australian magazines, they have friends here, they have relatives here. We know that for the vast majority of Australians they are not what they re made out to be, they are not racist. And if you want to be cynical all of us are racist, it's just that it's not politically correct or civilised to talk about it. So for once somebody did bring it out to the surface and it had unpleasant repercussions. But at the end of the day I think the Singapore reader as well as the Singaporean, is sophisticated enough person to be able to differentiate what is and what is perceived to be just a person representing a point of view and not necessarily the Australian point of view.

During the 1971 war in Dacca a magazine reporter who had been on top of the story for weeks filed his story to New York through the local ptt- after paying the operator to ensure it went ahead of everybody else. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
He got a brief message back from New York saying " got take three seven nine and eleven. Can you repeat those missing ?"
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
That proved impossible as the Indian air force had bombed the transmitters so his story remained unpublished. He went back to New York and had a nervous breakdown.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Disasters like that rarely happen any more. Satellites, cellular telephones and lap top computers allow you to transmit from your almost anywhere these days with speed and reliability.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
During the Vietnam war AP's communications out of Saigon depended primarily on what was then called a half speed circuit. Copy moved at about 33 words a minute. It seemed to take all day and often did. Contrast that with what is happening today.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
AP in Asia has just linked up to Asiasat. We are now moving data at 256 kilobytes - that is the equivalent of 256,000 words a minute.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Twenty years ago newspapers in Asia had a Teletype machine that delivered copy to them 66 words a minute. It was connected to the AP bureau by telephone line. Everytime it rained, and that is every day in the monsoon season, the line would die. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
These days newspapers can stick a dish on their roof and suck in the highest quality digital news and photos at mind bending speeds.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The problem of filing from difficult places has almost been overcome.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
If we have to report a war or a famine in a country without first class communications we take our own in the form of a collapsible satellite dish that fits into specially designed suitcase.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The efficiency of communications and the continuing fall in their cost has opened up the world of the news services to a vigorous new form of competition and that is finance and business news.
 It is the fastest growing area of international journalism.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Peter Kahn, the Chairman of Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal among other things, was in Australia recently.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I knew him in Asia where has was a Journal reporter and won a Pulitzer prize for his coverage of the India Pakistan war.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"Do you remember when I was the only Dow Jones employee between Delhi and Tokyo?," he asked. " Well now I've 1,000 people working in Asia." 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
That illustrates the huge growth of business journalism.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The AP had two news reporters in Australia in 1975. Now the combined news room of AP, AP-Dow Jones numbers 30 reporters.

My question is, is that it seems to me that there's been huge developments in word processing and distribution. Has the word processing and distribution part of journalism outstripped the technology ... and also taken away all the time journalists had for reflection ...

<B>Answer 1</B><BR> 
That's one way of putting it, but when I think of the time that it used to take to write - I was going to bring a Letra 22 typewriter in here for people who hadn't seen one. When you used to travel you'd take a Letra 22 typewriter, about 8 kg of paper, carbon paper, ribbons. you'd write your story on the paper, and then what do you do with it? You spend the next half day trying to find a way to file it, because the TTP was closed, or the communications group wasn't working. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So, I think I wasted more time of my life buggerising around with that sort of end of the business, than I would these days. I mean, you don't waste any time these days. You write your story, press the button, and it's gone. And you should have plenty of time to reflect . The only thing is that in the speed side of the business - and we're all still in it, in fact it is more brutally competitive now, particularly on the financial markets reporting. I mean the competition between Dow-jones and Reuters is something to behold. I mean they count it in seconds. we used to think we were pretty good if we got a beat of five minutes. If I beat Richard by five minutes, I'd ring him up! But these days I mean, Reuters and AP and Dow-jones are hard at it there, and the times are all measured, because they're all logged on to a screen there at the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank Foreign Exchange Dealing Room. And that's how your business survives. You've got to be able to prove to these people that you're giving them the information very slickly. But that doesn't - on the news side - doesn't mean to say that you (because basically all you're doing is telling something that's going to affect the price, and you get that right and that's a one line delivery). But if you're going to sit down and craft a story it's the same old business. I mean you've still got to sit down. Some people are quicker at it than others, and I don't think it takes away any creativity at all.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer 2</B><BR> 
I think I'm getting the drift of the questions, which is whether the technology the newsagencies has means that we can move news instantaneously almost as it happens. And will this not affect us as journalists, and will this not affect the production. now I have to say that yes, journalists must be extremely careful. They can move things in nanoseconds. They can press a button and it's irreversible, un-reversible, and it's out straight away. Before, you could tear the band out of the telex machine, you could phone people up and say 'Ah, forget it, spike it!'. Now it's gone. And this puts an even greater responsibility on journalism. But journalism remains and will remain, whether you're transmitting it by mice, pigeons, satellites, a product that's crafted by humans. By people. And therefore all the qualities that human beings have and as journalists you must just apply the same standard of truth and credibility. The fact you can file it faster to me makes absolutely no difference to the profession at all.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer 3 </B><BR>
... newspapers have the deadlines, and maybe in the evening. But for us in Reuters you know we have to be very very fast. So if you were  ... that you know ... when the editor realises that it could be better presented in such a way that you can find a new story ... That might be a better answer for your question in terms of the quality or the standard you're putting in the copies.

<B>Questioner 5. Kim Greggs</B><BR>
My name's Kim Greggs, I used to work for Nightrider for ten years so I've done a lot of business journalism, but my question is: I think it's today that Microsoft's Australian editor starts work after having been in Redmond [??] for some months, and I just wonder: I think Australia's the first place Microsoft has put its own bureau aside from Redmond and I'm wondering how you see that affecting what the newsagencies do if you can get online information just as quick as we've been doing it for years, how that's going to change the scope for wire services? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin</B><BR> 
I can't make any reflections on Microsoft, but I would say that newsagencies such as are represented in this room here, including Reuters over in the corner, have been in business for 160 years and are the best brand names around. Of course we're always interested in watching what the competition's going to do, but I think newsagencies are well positioned to put out an excellent product which has a very high reputation and this information rich age, it's the brand names that are going to count.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>[Indistinguishable question from the floor, possibly a follow up from Kim Greggs.]</B><BR>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer</B><BR>
[Gates is?] a niche player, and it's not anywhere as diversified as Reuters or AFP or AP and I don't think it ever will be. I don't think it'd trying to be. And if you dive into the internet you'll see there are lots of new services coming up there, but the one thing we keep stressing here - all of us, I'm sure - is that you're talking about credibility here. I'm not saying that Microsoft is not going to be credible, but I think it's going to be a long time before it's as credible as AP or Reuters or AFP. And it'll be even longer for the other news services that are cropping up on the internet.

<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
If the international media do not show much interest in the precursors to conflict, they seem even less inclined to cover the the "soft" topics that concern human well-being: people's health, education, shelter and nutrition. Nearly 50,000 children die every day all over the world in a "silent emergency": most of them from preventable causes like undernourishment, dehydration, measles or respiratory infections. In his desperate plea to get journalists interested in the story, the head of the United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), James Grant, often asked them if a thousand jumbo jets full of children crashed every day, whether it would make a "story".
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There are two reasons why the media agenda in the New World Order must change. Firstly, the most powerful nation is worse informed than ever before. A people that is scantily informed about the rest of the world, and therefore cares less and less about it, today commands our collective destinies. It is this under- informed electorate that will choose its future presidents and commanders-in-chief.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Secondly, even though editors who determine the news agenda and the companies that own the media are both predominantly U.S.- based, but also to not just clients in North America and Europe but also to the rest of the world. Ted Turner of CNN recently called Americans "some of the dumbest people in the world", and admitted that this was the case because complex foreign stories got the lowest ratings. At least he knows, but when is he going to do anything about it?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
International media schools have for long propagated a model of reporting that magnifies attention grabbing details: this is the Headless-Body-Found-In-Topless-Bar school of journalism named after an actual headline in the New York Daily News. The three cardinal rules are: news is NEW, news is NEAR, news is NEUTRAL. And to this we may add: news is NORTH.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
An event is deemed important enough to file only if it concerns the rich and famous, the movers and the shakers or is important to them. What happens to the poor, the underdogs, the silent majority is news only if they die by the thousands, commit a gruesome crime, migrate by the millions, provide a market for free traders or threaten the lifestyles of the privileged with their sheer numbers. <B>[WIND VANE DRAWING WITH N-E-W-S]</B> 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This prevalent news formula is inadequate to confront the challenges of equity, justice and global survival. The crisis of the planet is caused in part because the poor and the voiceless have never counted, and they have not counted because the media mostly ignores them. Even as the world becomes more and more interdependent, most mass media still reduce racism, migration, terrorism or recession to discrete isolated factoids and fail to link them to complex global conditions. Journalists are also required to show superhuman aloofness and not be moved by injustice and greed. And even if they are moved, they are not supposed to let their feelings show.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Proponents of this media school claim that such "balanced" and "neutral" reporting is a time-tested model of journalism and the only one that works. But status-quo journalism is also biased because it cannot take sides against wrongs. And by denying their bias, they are actually showing partiality. Observers change reality by the very act of observing, so reporters are a part of the story they are reporting. And yet, "objective" stories appear everyday in the papers and on television: reporting that is scrupulously accurate on facts but misses the nuances of the larger truth because it does not analyse events and come to a conclusion.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There is a way to write stories by not blaming anyone: by just recording what happened. Counting the bodies after a flashflood without looking at the causes, adding up the statistics on dwindling fish stocks without asking why. This is the sterile one-dimensional reporting of the kind we see everyday in newspapers and on television in our countries. And if there is a feeble attempt to look at causes, the stories invariably blame the slash-and-burn farmer and not the logger, blame the squatter and not the rapacious real-estate developer, blame the fisherfolk who dynamite corals and not the foreign trawlers that sweep offshore seas. That is "neutral" and "balanced" reporting-- blaming the poor.

But journalism is not only about what we write and publish. It's also about our ideology and attitude. There are bad journalists in fully democratic countries and there are good journalists in repressive nations. My point is we can acknowledge each other's constraints, and support each other.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
The communications technology revolution should serve this purpose. Laborious cross-border cooperation between journalists of different countries have been made much easier. Governments are finding it harder to halt the flow of information. When barricades were up and down around her house recently, Aung San Suu Kyi made her feelings known all over the world in an article she sent to a Japanese newspaper and The Nation. "Ridiculous" was what she said.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
But let me share with you our feeling toward the information technology revolution. We are optimistic, but only cautiously.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Eliminating or reducing the distance between information and its audience is always welcome. With the advent of satellite television and the birth of cyberspace, information is flowing much faster
 and the growing audience has more sources of news to compare and judge for their accuracy.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
The ability of the media to relay events as they are happening is making policy-makers work harder to respond or react to swiftly unfolding events. Decision-makers are under pressure to act more, and they have less to hide.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
But in this fast-paced development of digitalised journalism, two forces might prevail. They are consumerism and commercialism.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Along with the liberalization of the media sector comes the capitalist influence. And, as we have always experienced, competition often brings with it the herd-instinct and make reporting to serve minorities in society difficult.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
The obsession to serve the middle class, the group that can afford to consume more information, may lead the media to overlook the interests of the mass of people who live in rural areas. News about the latest computer model, for example, may gain priority over a three-day power blackout in a small village.

<FONT SIZE="+1">Kunda Dixit, Tulsathit Taptim. Section Three.</FONT></B>
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question [?] from Monash.</B><BR>
 Taptim you mentioned that the English language press was very influential in Thailand. I was wondering if there's any risk at all of the growing English press taking in resources - I think it was Brian Toohey earlier this morning who said how expensive good journalism is - I was wondering if there was any risk of the English language press in Thailand drawing the resources that may have gone to Thai language press. And secondly that political debate, or serious political debate, was seen as being put into the English language press as the appropriate realm, and therefore it being isolated from the greater majority of Thais who don't speak English.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Khun Tulsathit Taptim </B><BR>
There's no obvious risk of drawing resources from the Thai language media because, for one thing, Thai people have very limited English education at the moment. One of the first qualifications for joining English media in Thailand is you have to know English. Of course we have some reporters who cover a story and send their report to us in Thai language and we have translators to translate into English. But there has been no problem of brain-drain from the Thai media into English language media. It's the other way around, actually.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
And yes, on the second question, I believe that political debate in the English press somehow is more - if you like to say - intellectual, because we've got academics, we've got a lot of educated people contributing to us. We've got articles from foreign governments. We've got replies we've got questions we've got letters, from everywhere in the world. So the debate is like, in a higher level if you want to say so. But is not totally isolated. If there is an issue that the English language press want to pursue and if you want cooperation from the Thai media, then it is easy to mobilise support. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner</B><BR>
Yes, my question is also to the speaker from the Bangkok Nation. In comparison between your style of reporting and that of the Australian press - because I noticed with interest, your senior editor was covering the Asia–Pacific conference on East Timor in Kuala Lumpar over the weekend and was one of the people detained - I'd be interested in the comparison between how you would cover the issue of the editor or one of your journalists being detained, and how the Sydney Daily Telegraph  depicts a senior ABC correspondent in the region in the middle of a group of Filipinos with clenched fists being released from gaol. And the caption reads: 'Catherine McGrath, centre, with Timor activists outside prison yesterday,' to give the Australian media the impression that the people with clenched fists are from East Timor for a start, and that they are somehow militant for another thing, when all they were doing was celebrating their release from prison, and that she is in the centre of the picture more-or-less depicted as their ringleader rather than as a professional journalist doing her work, prejudicially put under a heading 'You broke the rules PM tells detainees.' 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So it's got a negative heading then it's got the senior Australian correspondent in the region, depicted somehow as being a professional agitator rather than a professional reporter trying to do a job. And I may add to that the Channel 9 news update coverage at the end of their news last night did a similar thing by showing the Ulnar youth, government sponsored group of 200 thugs who broke up a prayer session that was starting this conference where people were peacefully sitting around, the Ulnar youth group who burst in smashing up glasses and chairs and all that - that was, it was cut on Channel 9 news last night, you'd get the impression that these were the conference delegates rather than the people breaking up the conference. So I mean, the overall point I'm trying to make is the Australian media, whatever happens out there in Malaysia, Thailand or whatever, has a stereotyped view that if any Australian is over there at an event offering solidarity with East Timor or whatever, they must be an agitator. Even if they're a professional journalist covering the issue. Is this how you depicted Suny Abraham in your coverage of the issue over the weekend?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Khun Tulsathit Taptim </B><BR>
You really scooped me. I haven't contacted the office over the weekend, I haven't heard it, but I can bet that this is going to be a very very big thing back home. I can't imagine the presentation of this story in the Nation  newspaper. As I told you, our stand is to ensure that both side of either political or ideological conflict have equal chances to defend their causes. It's like a - it's not the question of who is right and who is wrong. It's like two men were having a shouting match. One side is having a microphone, a big loudspeaker, a perfect sound system. The other side is just bare mouth. What we do is just patrol in the microphone for them, let the opinions be heard, and our readers will make a decision on that. Thank you.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question off mike, from the floor and indistinct.</B><BR>
Perhaps the other speaker could reflect on use of prejudicial graphics and captions and headlines. Does the IPS have any qualms about whether its material is used in a prejudicial way with captions added and photos in a certain way?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit </B><BR>
We have it all the time. Newspapers use it, with - we used to have a Libyan subscriber, and every time Reagan was mentioned in our copy, said 'childkiller Reagan'. [laughter] We didn't say 'childkiller', but they put it in, so wire services have very little say over headlines, captions, even the copy of the story. I mean, where do they cut it? They might splice it, they might cut it after the second paragraph, all your context is gone. So it is more difficult for wire services.

<B>China Steps In</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>We may believe that the efforts by the Hong Kong government to reform media-related laws are insufficient. But China believes the government has gone too far.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>In October 1995, the legal sub-group of the China appointed Preliminary Working Committee recommended that three sections of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance should be repealed, including a provision enabling the ordinance to override other laws. It also recommended that provisions in six security-related and broadcasting laws should be reinstated. They had been deleted to bring the laws into line with the Bill of Rights. The deleted provisions include the following:
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>1) Sections in the Television Ordinance allowing the authorities, inter alia, to pre-censor and prohibit programs, revoke television licenses for security reasons and stipulate approved sources for news programs.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>2) Sections in the Telecommunication Ordinance allowing the authorities to prohibit radio programs.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>3) Sections in the Broadcasting Authority Ordinance granting powers to the Broadcasting Authority to vet and prohibit television programs.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>4) Sections in subsidiary legislation under the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, allowing the executive authorities, inter alia, to censor and suppress publications.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>5) Sections in the Public Order Ordinance allowing the authorities to license public rallies and marches.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>6) Sections in the Societies Ordinance allowing the authorities to prohibit links between Hong Kong and overseas organisations.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>The exact reasons for these recommendations have never been made clear. The Preliminary Working Committee stated that "the British-Hong Kong Government, by introducing without consulting the Government of the People's Republic of China a series of amendments to the pre-existing laws of Hong Kong in light of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, has violated the principle under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law that the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall remain basically unchanged. Some of these major amendments will hamper the administration of Hong Kong and are not conducive to the maintenance of stability in Hong Kong."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>This statement raises many questions. Did the amendments really breach the Basic Law, which should be the sole criterion for amending pre-1997 laws? If they breached the provisions in the Joint Declaration that Hong Kong's laws shall remain unchanged, then why not target the many other laws that had been changed? It leaves us wondering whether China actually wants the post-1997 government to have, for example, draconian powers of control over the electronic media.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>These recommendations are now being considered by China's Preparatory Committee, which is tasked to prepare for the handover. We hope that the Preparatory Committee will think twice about endorsing these proposals. However, present indications suggest that many if not all the proposals will be adopted in the coming months.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>They could be adopted by the provisional legislature, which will replace the existing Legislative Council on July 1, 1997. The provisional legislature will be elected by a 400-member Selection Committee in late December. However, legal experts have questioned the legality of the provisional legislature, since there is no provision for it in Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, the Basic Law.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Another consideration is the composition of the Selection Committee, which was chosen by the Preparatory Committee earlier this month. The 400-member selection committee is dominated by pro-Beijing individuals. About three-quarters of the committee members are Hong Kong delegates to the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference or the Preparatory Committee, or have been appointed by China as Hong Kong affairs or district affairs advisers.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>With such a predominance of its own supporters, it is that much easier for China to exert its influence on the composition and agenda of the provisional legislature. This in turn would make it easier to ensure that its legislative plans can be implemented. A further possibility is that the National People's Congress could declare the Bill of Rights invalid on the ground that it contravenes the Basic Law.

Stephen Quinn. I teach on-line journalism. This is a question to Jon but I'd welcome the comments from the other people. There's a man called Bill Gates in America - richest man in America - he's starting a web-based non-paper news service. He's got a lot of money behind him. Should some of the news agencies be worried? Should some of the current off-line agencies be worried? What's your take on Bill Gates and the internet.
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Jon Casimir </B><BR>
I've got a lot of mixed feelings about Citizen Gates. There's different views you can have on this. One is that Microsoft is a computer company and that really content is a foreign word to them, and to be honest from their experiments on the web, I'd say content is still a foreign word to them. But as you rightly point out, Bill Gates sidelined 1.5 billion dollars from his slush fund this year, and said to his company 'I want you to build web projects and I don't expect a return.' And there really aren't many [laughter] companies in the world that are doing that right now. And I know for a fact that Microsoft in Sydney - we basically know what plan Microsoft's building around the world, it's building a plan called City Scapes, and we know that because we developed it at Fairfax last year and gave it up, and Microsoft had bought it up. So we actually have a pretty good insight into what they're doing. We also know it because they're poaching people. AS a web editor myself I'm looking at a situation where really I've got a competitor who probably has fifty times the budget coming into the next year that I have. Does that worry me? yeah, to an extent.

<B>Question from the floor</B><BR>
 Have they tried to poach you?

<B>Jon Casimir </B><BR>
No, the stupid, stupid people! [laughter] I'm waiting, cause they're paying really terrific salaries to people!  [various interjections]. . . It is putting us in a position where we have to consider a whole lot of things where, as David says, I'm not a great believer that multimedia is some kind of god, but I do concede that we're going into a different place. I do concede that even as a newspaper we'd be looking in the next year, on the Sydney Morning Herald site of going into more audio and video directions. We'll be doing other things. Certainly the video technology of the web is not there yet. They can set up MS NBC as much as they want. But one of the strange things about going to MS NBC, this joint venture between Microsoft and the NBC network, is that unless you're American it makes no sense. You don't even know what NBC is. And they're doing all these things that relate to NBC programs and if you go the site now you're like scratching your head thinking, 'well, what does that mean?' It's a very strange site that they've built. They've got a long way to go and they've got a lot of money to get there.

<B>Unidentified questioner</B><BR>
Just a very quick one to Wendy. given the reticence of the majority of academics including social science academics to stick their neck out into the third world environments, social action fields, apart from  - it seems to be that with the cutbacks in tertiary sectors there seems to be a lack of social and political commitment from within universities. I mean, maybe this is a superficial thing. Obviously the Signposts is designed to overcome that to some extent, but do you see any limitations being imposed from the institutions apart form lack of funds to sort of do it? Is the thing, once it's established, off and running under its own steam, or are there any political or censoring limitations that may develop if it . . . I mean, to the extent that because of the interactive nature of it, if some overseas government complains that it's presenting a tool for some NGO to. . . I mean, it seems to me you're saying if you got to the point where it was instantaneously interactive, where there's hundreds of different NGOs putting stuff in so that it's a news database up to date for the moment, where people can take political action emanating from the screen in front of them - you know, if we saw something coming up in front of us now that said: 'There's been another Aboriginal death in custody down at Long Bay. There's a demonstration in 10 minutes time outside the State Parliament House,' would that sort of information flow lead to some sort of constraint imposed institutionally upon the operation?
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Wendy Bacon</B><BR>
You're assuming there that there'd be a press release from the Aboriginal Deaths In Custody or some other organisation saying, making a statement about it and saying they were going to have a demonstration. If we had the resources to put it on Signposts, it actually automatically downloads every night, so it wouldn't come up that quickly, but I'm sure we would be prepared to put it there. But rather than just stating that I would say that the university is an incredibly politically sensitive environment to work in at the minute, and I'm very concerned about the impact on the way changes to the way research is being funded, of the pressures on the university to go into user-pays in almost every aspect of its activities. And as someone who was in universities earlier and went back into universities later in my career, I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of vigorous intellectual debate within the university sector. 
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now I think like any other institution, I think that within the university there is a huge range of different views and approaches to this. I have been so far, I can only say that within my own institution, UTS, we published for example a report on Mt Lyall mine which had been suppressed effectively by the University of Tasmania, and that was broadcast on Channel 9, SBS, and the university welcomed that move. I think perhaps some universities - I mean, everyone is going to have to have their market - and some universities are hopefully going to have to go for a defence of intellectual freedom, equity and access. 
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now I also think that what we're looking for is to develop relationships with our colleagues around the country and around the globe who think like we do and for example, David Robie over here who teaches journalism in Port Moresby, UPNG, we've developed a relationship we value a lot with the university journalism department up there where we publish their newspaper which won a prize last year. SO I guess I think it's like journalism. In journalism it's always a question of negotiating the environment in which you live to the best of your ability, and we'll have to do the same in universities. But I guess being a bit of a - I mean, I can't imagine the situation. I can imagine the technology I suppose conceivably being removed, but there's no hint of that. I think the biggest problem - this is the only way I can see anyone managing to stop us, and I can't see any hint of this being likely to happen. 
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But the biggest challenge for us will be to get the fairly small funds that we need to keep this project viable on an ongoing basis. To maintain a pretty big virtual library at ANU they only need one research fellow half time to do that, to process the amount of work. Now that's not a large amount of money. Now we have to set about working out for our project a funding an ongoing arrangement which will see it continue on and there's someone there to receive the messages, put the information on, do the links. I think it's got a healthy future but I agree that we work in a politically sensitive environment.

Stephen Quinn. A little story about postage stamps. Did you know that there is no 'England' on the British postage stamp, because they invented it so they didn't need to, like America doesn't need the US tag. I've got to come back to Bill Gates, because if you've got 1.5 billion dollars, you' can buy an awful lot of content. I think that should be a worry to a lot of media organisations. 
<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>David Wilson </B><BR>
If I could just spend a moment on that one because I like to tell people that competition in that sense is really good, right? If I can get my information from Bill Gates or I can get it from Mike Bloomberg or I can get it from Reuters or I can get it from AP or CNN, what's gonna make me choose one site as opposed to another? The answer is simply the quality of the information that you get there. I don't see how that can be a bad thing. I don't see how more competition can be a bad thing, in the sense of raising the level of the competition and making us more focussed on how factual are we, how much information are we providing to people. Who is it that's talking in our stories? Are they real people or someone that is understood, right? The confidential source that the journalist has, he or she won't tell the reader about. To me, having Microsoft or anybody else in the game is a good thing not a bad thing, because it forces us all to take a look at what we're doing every day and say 'how can we make it better?' And that's got to be to the benefit of readers everywhere.

<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I'd like to say something about the tone of our coverage. The question of cultural differences is quite important here. I know there's a big discussion about Asian values. My view on that's quite simple. My view on that is that at the end of the day there's very little difference between core Asian values and core western values, and I don't accept a lot of the debate that takes place on this particular issue. I do however believe that it's very important for Australian journalists in approaching coverage of Asia to be sensitive to cultural issues and to be sensitive to cultural differences. And I think frankly it's unprofessional if we're not. That doesn't mean that we compromise our coverage. What it simply means is that we are sensitive in terms of the tone of our coverage. I don't want my journalists reporting out of Asia and South-East Asia the way - in the oldfashioned days of Sydney journalism - you would have had a correspondent from the Sydney Daily Mirror reporting on the police round in Sydney. And I think that this cultural sensitivity is being addressed in journalism. I think more and more the journalists who do cover foreign affairs and cover the region are alive to this particular issue. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I'd note the fact that one of the phenomenons in the region has been a very dramatic political liberalisation over the decade in a number of countries. It's important that we don't forget that. What it means is that it is becoming easier for the Australian media to do its job properly in the region. And if you compare the extent of political liberalisation in the region today as opposed to ten years ago or twenty years ago then the differences have been  very significant. And I think that it's noteworthy  to observe that historical perspective. I think that it indicates there's a lot of change going on in the region. And one of the interesting features is the extent of professional development in journalism and in the media right through the Asia-Pacific. And what the Australian media industry must do is it must develop relations with our colleagues right through the Asia-Pacific. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I'm on the board of the Australia-Indonesian Institute, and one of the initiatives that we've introduced in recent years has been meetings of Australian and Indonesian newspaper editors. We've had two such meetings so far, one in Sydney a couple of years ago, and one more recently in Jakarta. These meetings have been I think very beneficial. They've been extremely frank meetings. At the first meeting in Sydney it was very interesting for Australian editors listening to the Indonesian editors describe the way they see the Indonesian media operating; the extent to which they feel that they have discretion, and the extent to which they feel they're operating within a framework composed by the government. And I think this sort of exchange between editors is enormously beneficial and that there should be more journalistic and editorial exchanges.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
However, I would like to close simply by reiterating the point that I've made that within the Australian media I think we've got a lot more to do in terms of coming to grips with the South East Asia, North East Asia, with Southern Asia and with the Asia-Pacific generally. I think that we still find it difficult in as much as our cultural predilections are to the United States and to the UK, and we must continue to cover those part of the world because they're important in their own right and their certainly very much the areas of interest for a lot of our readers. But by the same token it's enormously important for us to expand and improve our coverage of Asia far more than what we've been able to do. I think this is going to be an ongoing and difficult challenge for the Australian media.

<B>Question. Paul Thomas.</B><BR>
Paul Thomas from Monash.  To what extent are correspondents improving in their ability to gather news from non-English language sources, including contacts that they make as well as reference to the printed media?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR> 
Well, that's really a function of language skills. Some journalists have them, others don't. Frankly, more should have them. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>[interjection from the floor, incomprehensible]</B> 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR>
Our Jakarta correspondent has them. Very relevant point: Greg Sheridan, is our Foreign Editor, he travels widely throughout the region. But the answer to your question is: more correspondents should have them. But having made that point, I would also say that sometimes one can exaggerate the value of language skills. Is suppose my experience increasingly is that it's very important for the foreign correspondent to be a good journalist , that is to have a high degree of general journalistic skills. That's enormously important because essentially I think it's more difficult being a foreign correspondent operating in an overseas city than it is being a journalist operating at home in Australia. you simply need a higher degree of skills to do the job properly. I must say that this is a conclusion I've come to over a period of time and therefore I put a very high premium on those general journalistic skills, but I agree with you on language - we should do better, we should do more. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question. Karen Glahn.</B><BR>
Karen Glahn, correspondent for a Danish newspaper You're talking about dealing with your subjects in a sensitive manner. Terry Watson was talking about how you didn't take kindly to him when he was writing about weapons dealings in Singapore. Some matters you can't deal with sensitively, can you? Maybe that's why you've still got good contacts in Indonesia and on the highest level, because maybe you skirt some of the more sensitive - the things you can't deal with sensitively.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR> 
Well, I think that's a very good question. There's absolutely no question that the standards which apply to the media in a number of Asian capitals are different to the standards that apply to the media in this country. There's absolutely no question about that. I mean, we are very very well aware of what those standards are, simply because we have our own dealings with Indonesia editors. We are quite familiar with them. I think that is a particularly good point. There are some issues which at the end of the day - whether one's talking about issues in Singapore or issues in Indonesia or in other countries - which are going to defy that sort of approach, I think that's right.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>[follow up from the floor, a bit indistinct: Which means you can't have it all from an Australian perspective, can you?]</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR>
Well, I've already said that it's quite clear the framework in which the media operates in a number of countries in Asia is different to the Australian framework. I think we all know that. That's simply a given. I mean, the entire situation is quite different.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>[follow up: You said we had to have the news from the Australian perspective. Obviously that can't happen all the time then.]</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR>
No, what I was saying there was, I think it's very important for the Australian media to have its own foreign correspondents in the Asia–Pacific, so we're not just relying on an international news services or other syndicated services, if we have our own correspondents on the spot to provide an Australian perspective. That was the point I was making.

<Font size=5>PRESS FREEDOM, ETHICS AND THE CONSTITUTION<P>
<Font size=4>Do journalists need to make a stand?As tellers of the truth  and watchdogs, do those in the news media need to decide whether they are the agents of power -- or of the people? And how is the journalist's code of ethics upheld? These  are crucial questions about freedom of the press. 
<P>
<Font size=3><B>By DAVID ROBIE</B>
<P>
ITEM: Kenya: Journalists are up in arms about two draft laws introduced in January that would establish a Government body with far-reaching powers to monitor and restrict the national news media.
<P>
ITEM: Liberia: In a reaction to a move towards censorship by the Information Ministry, the Liberian Journalists' Union has called on its members to boycott coverage of Government activities. The call has been heeded by the entire profession.
<P>
ITEM:  Nigeria: Onome Osifo-Whiskey, managing editor of the magazine Tell, escaped in December when State Security Service agents raided his home, but 20,000 copies of the magazine were seized later that day.
<P>
ITEM: Vietnam: The weekly Thuong Mai was suspended in December for publishing 'false and non-objective' information. The newspaper had printed an article accusing a leading official of corruption.
<P>
THESE ARE random examples from the most recent newsletter of Reporters Sans Frontieres, a Paris-based worldwide organisation working to defend press freedom. (1) The following paragraph wasn't -- but it is bound to be in the next issue.
<P>
ITEM: Tonga: The deputy editor of the weekly Taimi 'o Tonga has been detained for 26 hours and two pro-democracy letter writers jailed for even longer without charge. Eventually the editor was charged with 'threatening' a civil servant.(2)
<P> 
Ironically, the Tongan detentions happened less than a week before a two-day seminar organised in Port Moresby to defend press freedom in Papua New Guinea in response to the Chan Government's pressure for more 'accountability'. 
<P>
Yet in spite of international protests over the Tongan assault on press freedom, the case of deputy editor Filo 'Akau'ola and the letter writers was ignored by the news media executives, journalists and communications observers at Sir John Guise Stadium. Why? There were some suggestions among media executives that not enough was known about the affair.
<P>
Yet there were at least four news stories published in the Post-Courier and The National in the days leading up to the seminar organised by the fledgling Papua New Guinea Media Council. Radio New Zealand International and Radio Australia carried stories. And there were many more stories being distributed on the news agency wires. Do we assume that journalists don't read or listen? In any case, it takes just a phone call or a fax message to check out a few facts.
<P>
<B>RSF protest:</B><BR> 
This is what Reporters Sans Frontieres director Robert Menard had to say in a letter sent to King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV to 'strongly protest' against the raid of a newspaper office and the arrest and detention of the deputy editor: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
According to our information, on February 23, Filokalafi 'Akau'ola, deputy editor of the weekly Taimi 'o Tonga, the kingdom's leading newspaper, was arrested and detained following the publication of letters concerning Minister of Police Clive Edwards.
<P> 
He was kept in custody for 26 hours before being released on bail and ordered to appear in the Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, February 26, to face criminal charges that he had threatened a civil servant, under section 57 of the Tongan Criminal Code. Filini Sikuea, an unsuccessful pro-democracy candidate in last month's general election, and letter writer Vaha'akolo were also arrested and at least one of them was still in prison late on Sunday, February 25.
<P>
The police also raided the newspaper office in search of the original copy of the offending letter.
<P>
RSF acknowledges that press freedom and freedom of expression are to be practised with due regard to other laws which regulate defamation, innuendo or derogatory remarks. Nevertheless, raiding a newspaper's office. arresting and detaining a journalist, staff member and writers is clearly disproportionate to the [alleged] offence.
We protest the arrest of Filokalafi 'Akau'ola as a direct attack on press freedom and ask that you do everything  in your power to ensure that this fundamental freedom exists in Tonga.(3)</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
<B>What guarantees?</B><BR>
Like Papua New Guinea, Tonga's constitution guarantees freedom of speech. The point of this cautionary tale is that if journalists and editorial executives of news media would like to be supported from abroad in their current struggle to defend press freedom in PNG, then they should also be diligent about supporting others who are under threat.
Although Papua New Guinea has in the past rarely figured on the RSF lists of transgressing nations over violations of press freedom -- both gaggings of the National Broadcasting Commission in the past two years were two occasions when it has been cited -- it wouldn't take a great deal for this to happen. 
<P>
Press freedom can be a very fragile flower indeed if journalists and the public are not vigilant.
As Professor David Flint, chairman of the Australian Press Council, said at the recent seminar: 'One of the disadvantages for Australians in not having to fight for their freedom -- as the Americans did -- is that you always don't appreciate how precious it is. That's why the Americans in their famous First Amendment guaranteed the freedom of the press. They ensured that the press would be accountable to the public and no one else.'(4) 
<P>
In effect, the First Amendment not only prevents Congress from making laws abridging freedom of speech, it also prohibits laws abridging freedom of the press. Professor Flint also highlighted the safeguards within Papua New Guinea's own constitution. In the preamble, for example, are the words: 
<P>
We, the people of Papua New Guinea by virtue of our inherent right as ancient, free and independent peoples do now establish this sovereign nation and declare ourselves, under the guiding hand of God, to be the independent State of Papua New Guinea.
<P>
And we assert, by virtue of that authority, that all power belongs to the people -- acting through other duly elected representatives.
<P>
Under Section 46, every person in Papua New Guinea has the right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
<P>
How inalienable is that right? According to Chief Justice Sir Arnold Amet the right is restricted. As he says, 'The first fundamental principle [about constitutional rights] is that there is absolutely no right in life that is absolute. This is a profound truth that is so often overlooked and ignored in many deliberations and debates and assertions of rights.' (5)
<P>
The Chief Justice gave the right to life being curtailed by capital punishment as an example. However, John Momis, one of the fathers of the constitution, insists that the objective of Section 46 was to be a 'formal guarantee' and a 'formal protection of the citizens' innate rights and freedoms'.(6) He recalls that the provision was founded on 'one of the great principles on which democracy rests [that] is the right to differ on any topic of discussion, be it social, economic, political, cultural or religious'. 
<P>
People view any issue in different ways. We in the Constitutional Planning Committee believed firmly that they should have the right to express their own views, within very broad limits, on any particular matter, and that in principle every citizen should be free to criticise the policies of the government of the day.
<P>
The media has a particular responsibility in this regard, as unless those who wish to express independent opinions are reported in the media, their effectiveness is likely to be much reduced, and the opportunity for meaningful debate on important public issues may be lost. The formation and expression of public opinion is vital to the kind of participatory democracy we believed our people wanted. (7)
<P>
Momis added that the constitution framers made particular reference to the freedom of the press which, of course, did not mean freedom without responsibility. 'In an emerging nation such as Papua New Guinea, we believed the media had a very important responsibility to report news accurately -- and to give equal opportunities and facilities for the expression by the citizens of opposing or differing views,' he said.(8) Closely related to Section 46 of the Constitution is Section 51 which says<P> 
<Blockquote>
every citizen has the right to reasonable access to official documents, subject only to the need for such secrecy as is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society in respect of matters relating to national security, defence or international relations, records of meetings and decisions of the National Executive Council and other elected bodies as are prescribed by an Organic Law or an Act of Parliament.
</blockquote><P>
If the Government were to truly honour this constitutional provision, a Freedom of Information Act should be legislated in keeping with the vision of the Constitutional Planning Committee.
<P>
<B>Media freedom defined</B><BR>
What do we mean by 'freedom of the press'? According to the International Federation of Journalists, the major international working journalists organisation, the phrase means freedom in the collection of information, freedom of opinion and comment, freedom from interference by public authority -- in accordance with the United Nations (Article 19) and European Declarations of Human Rights -- including the freedom to criticise and oppose governments and political bodies and freedom in the dissemination of news by all forms of news media.(9)
<P> 
Of the 28 'official' speakers at the recent 'Freedom at the Crossroads' seminar organised by the new Papua New Guinea Media Council, a body hastily established by the country's news media organisations to put their house in order, only one could be truly described as a working journalist. That is to say a senior journalist, Neville Togarewa, of the Post-Courier, who does not have an editorial managerial role. 
<P>
No rank-and-file Papua New Guinean journalists or student journalists were invited to give their perspective although some did raise their concerns from the floor. Neither was a member of the interim executive of the now defunct PNG Journalists' Association given an opportunity to discuss the fate of this organisation, the reasons why Papua New Guinea has not been able to establish a viable journalists union protecting the profession’s industrial and ethical foundations as in other countries, and where journalists should be headed in future.(10) In the circumstances, critics could be forgiven if they regard the seminar as being more concerned with the 'freedom of the owners of the press' rather than the freedom of the press and the public's right to know per se.
<P>
However, Neville Togarewa, who was interim treasurer on the defunct PNGJA, made several crucial points in his address. He summed up the Government's decision to press for a new media law using the Constitutional Review Commission's directives as window dressing  as 'rash, ill-conceived and without justification -- a knee-jerk reaction based on the Government's misconceptions of the role and operations of the media'.(11) His explanation for this was that the media directive had undoubtedly been forced on the Government by its 'failure to financially support its own information and communication services to better serve Government and the public'.(12)
<P> 
Togarewa's perception is that the Government is mostly concerned about 'selection and placement' of stories. He suggests this is a matter best addressed by editorial managements adopting guidelines to assist news selection and layout rather than leaving 'obviously important editorial decisions to a select few who have their own biases and prejudices'.(13)
<P> 
But he insists that editorial decisions should remain the preserve of editorial committees as is currently the case. The Government concerns, in his view, do not call for a Government-sponsored legislative initiative, nor do they warrant a bipartisan-supported constitutional reform of the news media.
<P>
Togarewa, reflecting a widely held view among PNG journalists, supports calls for a Freedom of Information Act to 'ensure transparency' in Government decision-making. He also refers to criticisms that the news media is allegedly 'trying to play, or take over, the role of the elected government in setting [a] national agenda — or even running the country'. He goes on to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't agree with this criticism. A Government is made up of supposedly like-minded elected representatives with common philosophies and programs, working in unison to achieve their objectives.
<P>
Journalists, on the other hand, are very individualistic, rarely agreeing with each other and collectively; they are very disorganised. This is why the [old] PNG Press Council is defunct, the PNG Journalists' Association is defunct, and the PNG Press Club is in hibernation.(14)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
<B>Code of ethics</B><BR>
The journalists' code of ethics is the third cornerstone of the self-regulation triangle, the other two being a body such as a press or media council to adjudicate complaints against the media and the legal framework governing issues such as libel and contempt of  court.(15) However, while a code of ethics might sound impressive on paper it does not amount to much if there is no mechanism for enforcing the code. 
<P>
In New Zealand, there has been no censure of journalists under the code of ethics by their peers in the national journalists body, now known as the NZ Print, Packaging and Media Union, in the past decade. But the PPMU has now set up an ethics committee that will more closely monitor the situation along with a committee to also monitor the performance of the NZ Press Council.
<P>
In Australia, state ethics committees and a federal judiciary committee have been in existence for some years but there has been concern about their performance and the fact that deliberations and verdicts are made in secret. The Australian Journalists' Association section of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance has been conducting a comprehensive overhaul of the journalists' code of ethics in the past 18 months. 
<P> 
In Papua New Guinea, there has been no mechanism at all for journalists themselves to deal with ethical complaints among colleagues and ethical breaches are relatively common, although less frequent than in other Pacific countries where tertiary education of journalists is not the norm.(16)
<P> 
While the Media Council representing the publishers and broadcasters of Papua New Guinea have done a commendable job opening up public debate on media freedom issues and in starting to overhaul the self-regulatory mechanisms already in place, it now remains for working journalists themselves to get their house in order.
<P>
It would not be appropriate or desirable for journalists to be represented solely by a Media Council in whatever form. Journalists should seek to have their industrial, professional and ethical concerns addressed by an active national journalists union affiliated to either the International Federation of Journalists or the International Organisation of Journalists, as is the common practice of most countries in the world.
<P>
Like Australia, New Zealand is affiliated to the IFJ; the Philippines (several Filipino journalists work with The National), along with many developing countries, is affiliated to the IOJ. Although the PNGJA code of ethics is modelled on the old Australian code and was incorporated in the former PNG Press Council constitution and rules, it looks rather dated in the light of the Australian code reforms which are notably being carried out by journalists themselves as part of a self-regulatory process.
<P>
Some of the problems of accountability in Australia are worth highlighting. The cost of defamation actions there and the implication that someone 'must have a reputation to defend' means it is only the rich who can afford this. As Monash University journalism lecturer John Tebbutt, who has considerable experience of journalism in an Asia-Pacific context, points out, 'ordinary citizens who have had to face misreporting and invasion of privacy have little redress at all'.(17) Examples he cites include:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The television reporter who, while implying he was representing the police, secured a photograph from grieving relatives for the TV news bulletins. The [Australian] Press Council found he had not said he was with the police, only that the police needed a photo, so he was not found to have done anything wrong.
<P>
Recent coverage of unsubstantiated allegations in a coronial inquest by police implicating a woman in the murder of her husband also allow little redress.
<P>
In this respect, there are real problems in the Australian media with the way 'persons aggrieved by media abuses have accessible redress'. Prominent apologies and rights of reply are obvious areas where the media could improve its relationship with citizens.(18)</BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
However, there have also been several important decisions recently in Australia concerning the use of media for political expression. A High Court case in Victoria which found an implied right of freedom of political speech could indicate that criticism of political figures in good faith -- in other words, not reckless or malicious and unfounded -- would not be considered as defamation.(19)
<P>
Also, the recent Parliamentary Inquiry into Shield Laws for journalists to allow them to limit provision for the protection of sources is worth considering. (At least five Australian journalists have been jailed or fined in recent years in contempt for refusing to reveal sources in a court of law.) 
<P>
Probably the most used yardstick for national codes of ethics is the one adopted by the International Federation of Journalists at Bordeaux in 1954 (modified and updated since then).(20) This is the norm for some 300,000 journalists worldwide represented by more than 80 national unions affiliated with the IFJ:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
This international Declaration is proclaimed as a standard of professional conduct for journalists engaged in the gathering, transmitting, disseminating and commenting on news and information and in describing events.
<P><OL>
<LI>Respect for truth and for the right of the public to the truth is the first duty of the journalist.
<P>
<LI>In pursuance of this duty, the journalist shall at all times defend the principles of freedom in the honest collection and publication of news, and of the right of fair comment and criticism.
<P>
<LI>The journalist shall report only in accordance with facts of which he/she knows the origin. The journalist shall not suppress essential information or falsify documents.
<P>
<LI>The journalist shall use only fair methods to obtain news, photographs and documents.
<P>
<LI>The journalist shall do the utmost to rectify any published information which is found to be harmfully inaccurate.
<P>
<LI>The journalist shall observe professional secrecy regarding the source of information obtained in confidence.
<P>
<LI>The journalist shall be aware of the danger of discrimination being furthered by the media, and shall do the utmost to avoid facilitating such discrimination based on, among other things, race, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinions, and national or social origins.
<P>
<LI>The journalist shall regard as grave professional offences the following:
<P><UL>
	<LI>Plagiarism.
	<LI>Malicious misrepresentation.
	<LI>Calumny, slander, libel, unfounded accusations.
	The acceptance of a bribe in any form in consideration of either publication or suppression.</UL>
<P>
<LI>Journalists worthy of that name shall deem it their duty to observe faithfully the principles stated above. Within the general law of each country, <B>the journalist shall recognise in professional matters the jurisdiction of colleagues only, to the exclusion of every kind of interference by governments or others.</B></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The emphasis is mine. This is a crucial factor. It needs to be emphasised that unlike doctors or lawyers who have statutory accountability, journalists have no extra rights and privileges from ordinary citizens. They do not even have the protection of 'shield laws' to avoid imprisonment when defying an order from a law court to divulge a professional confidence when they are bound by their code of ethics to protect their source.
<P>
<B>Agents of power -- or the people?</B><BR>
According to the investigative journalist, filmmaker and author John Pilger, who has exposed many international scandals from the supply of Western arms to the genocidal Khmer Rouge in Cambodia to the Indonesian atrocities in East Timor, journalists need to make a stand.
<P>
'I believe we in the media have to decide if we are going to be agents of power -- or of people. And only as the latter, can we be the guardians of history as we should be,' he says. (21) Pilger argues that many journalists in developing countries work in conditions that are 'not insidious, but brutal'. As he explains: 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
And yet many of them see themselves as allied not with the established order, but with the people, as tellers of subversive truth. I suggest we emulate them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Too often journalists and broadcasters in the West take refuge in the spurious notions of 'objectivity'. The great American reporter T. D. Allmann once defined objectivity as that which not only gets the facts right but understands the meaning of events, so that what we report stands the test of time.
<P> 
In the past, the best journalists have written history's first draft. In the Crimea more than a century ago, William Howard Russell, The Times correspondent, wrote about the waste and blunders of sacrificial battles. In the 1950s, Ed Murrow, the American TV reporter, dared to repel smear upon smear in his reporting of the vendettas of Joe McCarthy while most of his colleagues reported the lies of McCarthy as 'objective fact'. (22)
<P> 
More recently, during the Gulf War, veteran war correspondent Peter Arnett reported from Baghdad for CNN on the horrors of the casualties inflicted upon Iraqi citizens while most of the press corps presented a 'star wars' spectacle for the allies. He was accused of treason -- but he was right.
<P>
In this age of globalisation of information and telecommunications technology, argues University of PNG journalism lecturer Sorariba Nash, the news media is becoming increasingly privileged and powerful.(23) If society demands that the media becomes more accountable, then  it is a matter of answering the question -- who is watching the watchdog? To win the public trust in a democracy, the media can no longer cling to 'traditional catch cries' about a free press.
<P>
'The media must be prepared to reevaluate the substance of those catch cries and reexamine their own operations and the nature of the implicit contract they make with their audiences,' says Nash. 'And that is what I call being honest with themselves and others they serve.' (24)
<P> 
Finally, I would like to pick up on a thought raised by Neville Togarewa when he cited government concerns about the media perceived as an 'all-powerful beast prowling Waigani' and a law unto itself.(25) An editor-in-chief I worked with many years ago in Kenya, George Githii, once said: 'For governments which fear newspapers there is one consolation. We have known many instances where governments have taken over newspapers, but we haven't known of a single incident in which a newspaper has taken over a  government.'(26)

ON 10 MARCH 1996, the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, or West Papua, erupted in a series of riots aimed at halting the operations of Freeport-McMoran, a New Orleans-based mining company that runs the world's largest gold mine and third-largest copper mine on the western half of the island of New Guinea. 
<P>
The three-day rebellion began after a vehicle driven by a Freeport employee accidentally struck a local tribesman, Wilenus Kogoya. Rumors spread that the man had been killed, whereupon hundreds of indigenous people armed with sticks, spears, and knives began attacking Freeport facilities, ransacking buildings, breaking windows, damaging an environmental lab and scores of company offices and homes. They eventually forced the temporary closure of both the mine in Tembagapura, and the local airport in neighboring Timika, where rioters rushed to meet the incoming plane of Freeport chief executive officer James Robert ("Jim Bob") Moffett. 
<P>
'We fight against Jim Bob Moffett, Freeport, and the government,' read a statement from local people connected to the protesters. 'We fight because our rights are not recognised, our resources are extracted and destroyed while our lives are taken.' A spokesperson for the Amungme, Komoro, Dani, and Moni tribes of the region addressed the Freeport CEO directly: 'You and your workers live in luxury on our property. We, who own the rights to the properly, sleep on rubbish. Therefore, from today, we don't give you permission for this company, and close it.'<P>
<P> 
On March 14, as the rioting calmed, indigenous leaders met with Moffett. Mama Yosepha, a woman who was forced to sit inside a Freeport shipping container by Indonesian troops last year, said, 'My son Moffett, in the past I put you inside my noken [a bag used by Amungme women to carry babies and piglets]. I took you with me wherever I went, but I did not realise that you actually suck my blood until it's all drained, and I remain only in bones without flesh. Now, I pick you out of my noken and will throw you far away'-- at which point she hurled her noken to the floor. Moments later, she and others presented Moffett with a list of demands, calling for more jobs for local people, a right to control what happens on their land, and the dismantling of Freeport's security force, which is embroiled in allegations of human-rights abuse. 
<P>
Situated on the eastern fringe of the vast Indonesian archipelago that stretches across much of Southeast Asia, Irian Jaya seems as far removed as possible from the epicenter of global politics and commerce. But in this day and age, no place is remote enough. Cursed with an abundance of timber, copper, and other natural resources Irian Jaya has become a magnet for companies like Freeport, which extract the riches while trampling on the rights of native peoples. 
<P>
Irian Jaya is by no means unique. Indigenous people of disparate regions are fighting an enemy of common form. The Amungme, Komoro, and other native tribes in Irian Jaya-like the Ogoni people struggling against Royal Dutch Shell in Nigeria; the Quichua and Hourani confronting Texaco in Ecuador; the Zapatistas in Chiapas -- are at the front lines of a battle between indigenous people and transnational corporations. It is a battle over environmental justice, human rights the preservation of indigenous culture, the right to control development, and the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth -- fundamental issues that Western corporations have long assumed could go ignored within the friendly confines of Third World dictatorships. 
<P>
In this respect, it's hard to rival Indonesia, which granted Freeport the formal right to exploit Irian Jaya's mineral resources in 1967. This was two years before Indonesia formally declared the region its twenty-sixth province, following an Act of Free Choice in which 1,025 representatives preselected by the Indonesian government were allowed to 'choose' Indonesian rule on behalf of 800,000 people. Indonesia has since become the glittering star in Southeast Asia's market economy, luring US corporations with cheap labor, abundant resources, and a government that rules in capital's favor with an iron fist. 
<P>
Jim Bob Moffett refers to General Suharto as a 'compassionate man' -- this of an autocrat who slaughtered some 500,000 people upon coming to power in 1965, and has since killed 200,000 during the illegal occupation of East Timor. Suharto obliges Moffett by keeping a heavy troop presence near the Freeport mine. For Jakarta, this 'vital national project' generated $380 million in revenue last year alone, and rests atop reserves worth an estimated $60 billion.  Freeport says the Indonesian military in  Irian Jaya 'serves the role that the police would serve in a more developed area.'
<P>
The latest State Department annual Report on Human Rights, however, notes that this 'police' force routinely subjects civilians to 'kicking with heavy boots; beating with fists, sticks, stones, and rifle  butts; starvation; shackling thumbs, arms, and legs; taping eyes shut; stamping on  hands; and forcing victims to stand for prolonged periods while bearing heavy weights.' 
<P>
In the past year, allegations have implicated Freeport itself in some of these abuses. In April 1995, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) released Trouble at Freeport, a report detailing the  killing or disappearance of 22 civilians and 15 alleged guerrillas in and around the mine since June 1994. Prepared in Irian Jaya by local people, the report alleges that Indonesian troops carried out abuses in Freeport facilities, and that Freeport security cooperated with the army during some incidents, including a Christmas Day, 1994, attack that killed three people and in which five others disappeared. 
<P>
Freeport vehemently denies any involvement; the company points to investigations by both the Catholic Church and  Indonesian government allegedly clearing it of any responsibility. But local people, along with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, are calling for a full, independent investigation into Freeport's role. 
Freeport's environmental record is also cause for concern. <P>
It reportedly dumps 115,000 tons of tailings (refuse from the mining process) daily onto the pristine environment below the mine. Critics have long complained that the company has poisoned the waters and damaged the lush surrounding rainforest. In October, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which provides political-risk insurance to American companies operating abroad, canceled Freeport's policy due to concerns about the impact of its project. Although Freeport has since utilised its political clout to have its OPIC insurance temporarily restored, reports of atrocities and environmental problems at the mine prompted the company to launch a huge public-relations campaign. 
<P>
Freeport took out numerous full-page ads in The New York Times vaunting its overseas operation as a 'model of development'. THE TRUTH IS PUTTING ON ITS SHOES, the ads declared.  The company flew two dozen investment analysts out to Irian Jaya, portraying the situation as stable. It produced a glowing company video presenting life at the mine as a paradise for all. Behind the scenes, top executives threatened critics with lawsuits and pulled political strings to muzzle independent groups. Orchestrating this performance was Planit Communications, a collection of former journalists and PR hacks brought together by Freeport to handle media relations. 
<P>
Planit's promotional material boasts: 'If your name is fast becoming mud in the public eye, if your project reels in the wake of public assault, Planit will initiate a proactive communications campaign to truthfully inform your community and decision-makers so that your story -- not "their story" -- leads public opinion' s later Planit closed down. As a Freeport spokesperson now grudgingly concedes, 'Obviously we're not doing this perfectly or this [the rioting] wouldn't have happened.'
<P>
The problem runs far deeper than anyone at the company will admit.  Freeport's recent ads in The New York Times trumpet the 'roads, schools, and hospitals' the company has built 'to help make a better life for our employees and their community'. Yet only 15 percent of Freeport's roughly 15,000 employees are locals, and most of them occupy the lowest-level jobs. The Amungme, a highland people, have been displaced from their land in a series of forced removals that began shortly after Freeport launched operations in 1973. Although a 1974 agreement between the company and some local tribal leaders gave Freeport formal permission to launch operations, many Amungme feel the deal went through without their input or control. 
<P>
'The local communities have lost their rights,' wrote Tom Beanal, chairman of LEMASA, the Amungme tribal council, in a 1993 letter to Freeport. 'The environment has been severely degraded ... Local people's self-respect has been eroded, cultural norms have been abandoned, all as a result of Freeport's mining activities and blatant disregard.' According to Beanal, the smiling faces in Freeport's PR videos mask the grim reality of residents living in clapboard shacks, children scrounging for food, and communities ravaged by malnutrition and preventable disease -- this while Freeport's privileged employees enjoy modern apartments, travel benefits, and more. 
<P>
'Freeport is digging out our mother's brain,' says one Amungme leader, referring to the mountains being blasted to extract ore. The tons of tailings dumped daily onto the ecosystem have allegedly destroyed roughly twenty-six square miles of once-verdant rainforest, ruining palm trees that are the source of sago, a traditional staple of local people's diets. The tailings have also reportedly clogged the Aghawagon and Ajkwa rivers that pass below.  Freeport steadfastly defends its environmental record in Irian Jaya, and denies any part in the devastation of the local environment. 
<P>
WALHI, a Jakarta-based environmental group, has long been pushing Freeport to neutralise its tailings before disposal and open the area to independent monitoring -- standard practice for mines in the rest of the world. The group has apparently asked for too much. On September 7, 1995, Paul Murphy, executive vice president of Freeport Indonesia, sent a letter to the U.S. Agency for International Development requesting that it cut off all funding to the 'newly radicalised' WALHI, whose crimes included 'openly affiliat[ing] with radical international NGOs [nongovernmental organisations] such as Earth First!, Friends of the Earth, Global Response and Greenpeace,' 'organis[ing] protests,' and using 'access to the media to manipulate public discourse.' 
<P>
Only a month and a half later, OPIC seemed to confirm everything the 'newly radicalised' WALHI had been saying for years when it cancelled Freeport's US$100 million risk insurance.  After a November story in the New Orleans Times-Picayune speculated that OPIC's decision was based on environmental problems, Freeport CEO Moffett stormed into the paper's offices to demand that it print a correction, insisting OPIC's decision was based on future considerations which 'might pose difficulties'.  Hours later, the Times-Picayune and others received a letter from OPIC to Freeport (dated October 10, and released under the Freedom of Information Act) stating that 'massive deposition of tailings' from Freeport's operation 'has degraded a large area of lowland rainforest', posing 'unreasonable or major environmental, health or safety hazards with respect to the rivers. . . the surrounding terrestrial ecosystem, and the local inhabitants'. The OPIC letter also cited problems associated with 'acid mine drainage from overburden and tailings . . . toxic metals . . . and the mismanagement of solid and hazardous wastes at the site'. 
<P>
Just six months later, in April 1996, OPIC restored Freeport's insurance through the end of the year in exchange for the company's creation of a $100 million environmental trust fund, to accrue over 40 years. It’s not difficult to guess why. Since 1984, Freeport's nimble PAC has disbursed money to three-fourths of the Senate and one-quarter of the House. For example, $9500 has gone to Representative Billy Tauzin, Democrat of Louisiana, and $6O00 to Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. Immediately after OPIC canceled Freeport's policy, Tauzin rushed out several op-eds bashing the decision, warning that the agency (which is up for Congressional reauthorisation in the fall) was putting its 'bipartisan backing' at risk. 
<P>
Senator Breaux, meanwhile, temporarily blocked action on a Senate review of a Treasury Department nominee who had served on OPIC's board of directors. The Clinton Administration also got an earful from Henry Kissinger, who made $40O,000 last year as a consultant for the company. 
<P>
On the very day that OPIC officials announced the settlement and lauded recent improvements at the mine, Tapol, a human-rights group in the very day that OPIC officials announced the settlement and lauded recent improvements at the mine, Tapol, a human-rights group in London, reported that Indonesian soldiers had raided the offices of a group representing the Amungme people, 'adding to the sense of intimidation and crisis' enveloping the area. Since the March riots, thousands of Indonesian troops have been swarming around the mine. a around the mine, buttressing a vast Freeport security apparatus. Freeport insists there is a strict division between the two, a point bearing added emphasis since last year's publication of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid human rights report. On Christmas Day of 1994, that report says, Indonesian military and Freeport security interrupted a peaceful flag-waving ceremony and opened fire, killing three civilians, disappearing five, and torturing 13 others. 
<P>
Freeport categorically rejects this charge, and says its own security force does not even carry guns. John Matthews, the pseudonym of an American who recently passed through the mine, was told otherwise by an English-speaking Freeport employee (whom Matthews wishes not to name). 
<P>
'As we stood in the highest security post inside the mine, surrounded by men carrying guns, this employee told me that the only way to tell the difference between Indonesian soldiers and Freeport security guards is that the soldiers carry M16s and Freeport security carries AK-47s,' Matthews says. 
<P>
One morning, Matthews was awakened by an entourage from the mine firing a gun into the air (Matthews has a picture of this group smiling and holding a gun, which has the characteristic curve of an AK-47). 'When I told my acquaintance at Freeport about our wake-up call,' Matthews says, 'he guessed that it was Freeport security.'
<P>
Like others who have visited the mine without being shepherded through by the company, Matthews found it difficult to distinguish between company security officers and the military. 'To me, there was absolutely no visible difference. The company works with the troops and the troops work with the mine, and their interests are aligned, so unless you're really splitting hairs, there's no effective difference.'
<P>
Several environmental groups, including the International Rivers Network, the Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth, have urged Freeport to press Jakarta to drastically reduce the military presence around the mine, noting the company 'shares a moral responsibility for the recent tragic events since the military is protecting Freeport operations, and Freeport provides the military with logistical support and equipment.' 
<P>
Freeport admits it is under contract to provide the military with food and equipment, including shipping containers that, as a Catholic Church report gruesomely described last year, have been used by the Indonesian military as torture chambers. Mama Yosepha, the woman who hurled Moffett from her noken after the riots, survived detention in such a container. So did another, who explains in the Church report: 'They took turns beating and kicking us. They stripped us stark naked. I only could look on . . . afraid and powerless.'
<P>
Freeport, though, insists that both the Catholic Church report and a subsequent one by the Indonesian Human Rights Commission conclusively show the company is not to blame for any human-rights abuses. It quotes Bishop H.F.M. Munninghoff, author of the Church report, who says, 'My report is not about Freeport. Freeport is not at all involved in these violations of human rights.'
<P>
Freeport enlarged, boxed, and highlighted this statement in its New York Times ads, and also had it videotaped. But according to Theo van den Broek, a Franciscan missionary who heads the diocese office at Jayapura and was present when Munninghoff spoke, Freeport has twisted the statement and taken it out of context. Neither Munninghoff nor others at the Church, he says, believe that their report investigated the full range of abuses near the mine, or sought to establish who is responsible.
<P>
'The bishop's report is limited to a certain number of cases that we could get facts about. In one or two of the cases, it is clear that Freeport material has been used. This should be investigated. Exactly who is responsible is an open question.'
<P>
In a letter to authorities in both Irian Jaya and Jakarta prior to the recent riots, LEMASA, the Amungme tribal council, requested that a full investigation be conducted into abuses at the mine, presenting a long list of alleged atrocities, including several of those detailed in the ACFOA report. Adding to the demands, a community worker who wishes to remain anonymous notes that after the riots, local people specifically asked Moffett to remove four Freeport security employees. 
<P>
'The people say it's not just the army but Freeport security,' says the community worker. 'It's true that Freeport will deny it, but the victims are there, the families are there, and an investigation needs to take place. The American people should know about this. These are gross human-rights abuses.'
<P>
If a full investigation into Freeport's role ever does take place, it ought to begin by closely examining the events that precipitated the military's crackdown in late 1994. In November of that year, Freeport admits that it called in the military, claiming that one of its employees, Gordon Rumaropen, had been shot dead by a member of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM), an indigenous rebel movement that seeks independence from Indonesia. Articles in Business Week and elsewhere repeated Freeport's charge that Rumaropen was killed by OPM snipers without checking the facts.
<P>
Greg Roberts, an Australian journalist with the Sydney Morning Herald, did check them, and he learned that the person Freeport says witnessed the murder -- an Australian named Pat Harris -- believes Rumaropen was killed not by the OPM but by Indonesian military forces. 
<P>
Driving one morning, Harris says he heard gun shots and saw two Indonesians in camouflage -- easily distinguishable from Papuans. He turned around and found Rumaropen's body alongside an Indonesian base camp where Indonesian soldiers were standing around. When Harris told Freeport what he had seen, he sensed nobody was interested. During his visit to the mine, Roberts says he spoke with several Freeport employees who speculated that the incident was a convenient pretext for a crackdown.
<P>
Freeport has tried aggressively to clamp a lid on the truth. In the United States, Freeport threatened to sue seven individuals -- including two reporters, three professors at the University of Texas in Austin, and the head of International Rivers Network -- for repeating allegations about Freeport's involvement in human-rights abuses.
In Irian Jaya, Freeport took a different tack. On 13 April 1966, Freeport unveiled a package of initiatives designed to better the lives of the people of Irian Jaya. Among the initiatives is an 'Integrated Timika Development' plan, along with a new job-training centre to increase the number of locals in the company's employ. (The plan will be financed by 1 per cent of Freeport revenue over the next ten years -- roughly $18 million, which is less than half the $47 million in salary and stock options granted Jim Bob Moffett alone in 1995.)
<P>
The next day, LEMASA denounced the plan. 'It fails to answer the roots of the problem between Freeport and the Amungme,' the council said. The plan does not provide a way for the Amungme to sustain their livelihood; nor does it offer 'compensation for the damage inflicted on their environment, for their resources, and for the human-rights abuses to which they have been subjected.'
<P>
Having seen their land expropriated, their environment devastated, their brothers and sisters subjected to repression and abuse, the people of Irian Jaya want more than a trickle of the wealth that Freeport has extracted from their land. Like victims of corporate offences elsewhere, they seek some measure of justice and retribution as well. In a statement that echoes from Jakarta to Washington, from Irian Jaya to New Orleans, they've made it clear to the company that they will no longer pay for its profits with their lives.
<P>
On April 29, Tom Beanal of LEMASA filed a $6 billion lawsuit against Freeport in a U.S. district court in New Orleans. The suit charges Freeport with responsibility for a range of human-rights and environmental abuses 'which have terrorised the tribal communities . . . destroyed their natural habitats,' and resulted in the 'demise of a culture of indigenous people whose rights were never considered.' The company dismisses the suit as 'frivolous and opportunistic'.<P>

Tan Bri (Dr.) A. Samad Ismail attempted a more down-to-earth case for special values that limit what we know better as inalienable rights like freedom of speech and the press. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In his 1994 Ramon Magsaysay Lecture, he linked values to geography and experience. Only areas colonised by democracies will tend to respect democratic practices, like a free press. Yet, all the colonial powers were democracies - England, Holland, France and the United States. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Perhaps he meant only what Ian Buruma observed, that colonial powers did not practice their democracy in the colonies. The autocracy of colonial administration spoiled the native soil for democracy. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But how do you explain the democratic exuberance of Japan, formerly ruled by military cliques under a system of emperor worship? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Or Taiwan, a former military garrison? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Or Korea, more than half a century under the heel of the Japanese Army?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Dr. Ismail tried next to link values to stages of economic development and social organisation, and proposed a certain respect by journalism for the values pertinent to each stage. For example, the poor may as well have no rights like free speech since they cannot assert them effectively or at all. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But doesn't that try to make a value out of necessity? It does not prove the weak don't need rights. Quite the contrary. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In fact, it is not the weak who must stand up for their rights but the government. The ineffectiveness of certain rights shows, not their irrelevance to the individual, but the weakness or indifference of governments.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It turns out, however, that this Asian pundit did not have the rights of the people in mind but those of countries and governments. He quoted approvingly a certain Dr. Chandra Muzaffar who said that poor countries are in no position to exercise their right of free expression at international forums, especially if they are in debt to foreign banks. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This is incredible. Freedom of speech and of the press pertains to individuals against the state and not to a state in the community of nations. Any first year law student knows that.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The issue is not whether poor countries with big debts stolen by dictators have a right to complain to creditor banks for extending the loans, but whether people should enjoy the protected right to speak out against the profligacy of a bad government, and make its officials return their ill-gotten wealth.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The Philippines could complain anytime, anywhere, about bad loans to their crooked government, but the banks would only reply: So why didn't you stop it?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
And the answer to that yields the one indisputable Asian value that explains a great deal of Asian behaviour. That value is life and the fear of losing it, and the unwillingness to risk it by being picked up, roughed up or put against a wall by government agents.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
President Aquino said in a speech at Johns Hopkins: "I worry about the argument that democracy is responsible for instability in free societies. Instability in a democracy is caused by the refusal of elements in the military to tolerate the freedom that the people want. Nowhere in my part of the world did people ever reject democracy. Only the military did."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
About Asian values, she remarked: "This notion that democracy must be culture - compatible paints a sorry picture of races of men allergic to freedom and uncomfortable with the dignity that liberty alone can confer."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"Asians love freedom as much as Americans. And while the last time Americans defended their freedom was in 1865, Asians have been doing it more recently - in the Philippines, in Korea and Burma. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"I worry when the burden is on democracy to prove its stability and conduciveness to progress. The burden should be on authoritarianism which was responsible for the collapse of the debt - ridden countries of Latin America, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"Democracy is stable by nature. It is its critics who are unstable - desiring more power by shorter means than the people will freely allow.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"It is dictatorships that are chaotic. Democracies hold elections, dictatorships wage wars on their own people."

<B>Questioner 7. Annmarie Anton.</B><BR>
My name's Annmarie Anton, I'm a freelance journalist. Two years ago there was a Filipino journalist I heard .. from the Philippines. She wrote for Manilla Times and Chronicle at one stage, and the Enquirer. My question first, the comments she made, that since Ramos came into power apparently business is booming like nothing in the Philippines, and newspapers as well as magazines and new radio stations, are coming out in big numbers. Apparently it's as easy to print out your own newspapers for your own advertising (and there's a lot of editorial sacrifices made because of that). How true are these comments from her.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR>
I think you're speaking about Amanda Donilla [?].
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7 Annmarie Anton.</B><BR>
That's one of them, yes.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin </B><BR>
You're saying that there's been more and more newspapers. No in fact that's not true. The number of newspapers from the time when Mrs Aquino came to power with the restoration of democracy was 22. And we're down to nine. A lot of them have gone out of business. The number of TV stations remains the same. One of them was captured about 80% of the market, that's the Lopez owned group, it's a private group, as against the government run stations which will be privatised next year.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7 Annmarie Anton.</B><BR>
She was making comments along the lines of that it's easier to set up and release your own newspaper for advertising purposes.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin </B><BR>
No, that's impossible. We all depend on advertising from real businesses.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7 Annmarie Anton.</B><BR>
What I'm saying is, companies themselves, businesses themselves, find it easier to just print out their own newspapers and put in their own advertising in it.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR>
No, they don't. You have to be specific. John Gocumway [??] now owns the Manila Times. He's not the original owner. The original owner was a publishing family of 100 years. This man came from making basically corn curls and chicken and became very successful (some real estate, some department stores) and bought the Manila Times. He hardly ever advertises in his own paper. And what would he gain from that?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7 Annmarie Anton</B><BR>
Just very quickly . . .
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR>
Because his newspaper's circulation is very tiny.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7 Annmarie Anton</B><BR>
Just very quickly one other question. And he was saying on the same breath that — you mentioned earlier (I came late in the talk), you said that you were actually pushing your journalists to cover more corruption cases or corruption issues in government. He's saying that it's quite dangerous for investigative journalists to go that way now in the Philippines, and he quoted the death of about 42 journalists who were doing business investigative journalism, especially in the regional areas and rural areas. How true are his comments? [pause] That journalists tend to actually move away from investigative journalism?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin </B><BR>
I don't have any sympathy with — there's a certain movement in the Philippines about the safety of journalists. There was one journalist who claims he was being followed and some journalists have the cheek to actually organise a rally for his safety. So that's what journalists do is take risks, but actually I did not see any risks to that journalist. In fact most of the journalists shot in the Philippines were shot because they were playing around with somebody else's wife [laughter]: no, I'm serious about that, because if we sensationalise these cases of these journalists getting shot in private, either for gambling debts or refusing to pay or playing around with somebody else's wife, if you sensationalise that and make it common, one day they're going to shoot someone who is a real crusading journalist. And the police and the public will just throw up there hands and say 'oh, here's another one of them.' That's a very dangerous thing, so they should take their causes.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Chair </B><BR>
Can we have one last question? I think Paddy McGuiness wants to.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 8. Paddy McGuiness</B><BR> 
Thanks. Well of course I think most people would agree with you that when we're talking about liberty and freedom of expression 'Asian values' don't exist or are less important than universal human values. Nevertheless, did you occasionally find the continual reproaches and berating of Asian government by people who live in democratic societies where it's easy to be critical, sometimes rather patronising and racist?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Locsin</B><BR> 
I'll tell you. I was in the government and as you know our government came to power basically with the help of the American media. They attacked Marcos like anything and we were happy about it and the attacks were so bad that even after Mrs Aquino technically lost the election, the count, the Spanish parliament, basing itself on the very favourable reports we got from the western press, proclaimed her the President of the Philippines. By the act of the Spanish [??}. It served that purpose. When we were in power the western journalists, I  thought wrongly, became disenchanted with her government, saying that she should have instituted radical land reform etc, things for which frankly we weren't fighting. We were fighting  for pure English freedom. But they insisted no! we were fighting for equitable distribution of wealth and from three months after the revolution we were attacked by the western media. I couldn't find it in my heart to criticise them for what they were doing for us before, now they were doing it to us, it would just be hypocritical. From there point of view this is how they see it. We took advantage of it then because we believed in freedom; we'd have to suffer the consequences now that we're in power. I had no problems with that. We really took a beating from the western press. I don't think she's recovered from it either.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Chair</B><BR>
Well, thank you once again Mr Locsin.

Section Four</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The business of business journalism is largely to follow the money trail. 
Who has the money, where did they get it, what are they spending it on and
why, where are they spending it , and how great a return is being made and
who is getting it.  The questions remain the same whether those involved
are governments, corporations, the military of family companies. Business at
bottom is about power, money, and counting coup.  If money is the mother's
milk of politics, as an American politician named Tip O'Neill remarked, how
much truer is this of business.  What happens to that money and how it is
used affect the nation and its people as a whole.  Not to mention foreign
investors.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In Asia, where government, the military, and secretive families play so large
a part in the economy such questions are often perceived as rude and
intrusive, let alone impertinent.  But these controllers of money and power
are going to be opened to scrutiny as never before as the world is linked
very more closely together by global trade, investment, and technology.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Social and political questions also will come into greater play in the business
equation.  As we have seen, those with business agendas invariably attach
them to pocket-book issues that matter.  When Nike started making
sneakers in Indonesia to take advantage of that nation's cheap labor,
American workers grumbled about the export of jobs.  That led to press
stories about Nike, especially in regard to the use of child labor.  And that
led to pressure on Nike to do something about it.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Two other examples of business deals prompting scrutiny by the broader
press and carrying political implications. . McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s $1.6
billion deal to make planes for China is now front page news because of
alleged Chinese efforts to shift some of the high-tech equipment into military
production.  The blatant ignoring of copyright in India and China, in
particular, continues to be a regular feature of news coverage.  As the
business story broadens into a more general story, the heavy hitters of the
media get involved.  And that being to affect the broad strategic policies of
nations.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Such stories will multiply as the world's business press follows its national
business sector to Asia.  For journalism, despite what many of its critics, and
even some of its proponents, charge, is more a mirror of society than an
arbiter of change.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Nobody can know how these culture clashes will play out.  Beijing's recent
severe punishment of Wang Dan, who though not a strictly a journalist was
performing a similar function, highlights the potential for collision.  Wang's
treatment is widely regarded as a warning to those who would threaten the
establishment with democracy and a message to the West that things are
done differently in Asia.  But the old order is changing and its replacement
will live in a very different world.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
For as the IT revolution links Asia more tightly with the rest of the world, it
challenges mores and traditional behavior.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
If successful Asian businessmen  continue to send their children off to be
educated in the U.S., Canada and Australia, notably at business schools,
can they expect them to come back home and run the outfit as in the old
days.  Or will they push for more modern management methods and
perhaps even contemplate, heaven forbid, taking the family empire public.  
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
As middle classes expand will they be content to focus on making and
spending money and not challenge the establishment for a greater say in
the running of society?  Nowhere else in the world where a strong middle
class has emerged have they not demanded a great say in the fate of the
nation. I doubt Asia will be much different.  Witness recent developments in
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.   From those middle classes sprout,
among other activists, crusading journalists and editors.

Not many Australian realise that the international news services like AP report every aspect of Australia.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Stories on Pauline Hanson and her attitude to race went to all 112 countries where AP news services are used. Add the Reuters and AFP subscribers and you can safely say there are few editors on the planet who didn't get the opportunity to publish it.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Treasurer Peter Costello's unguarded remarks in Washington about US interest rates hit more than 100,000 dealing screens around the world and caused a major flurry in the bond markets.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Few people are aware that general news filed by these agencies does not only go to newspapers, or radio and television stations. It also appears on screens around the world where decisions are
made that can effect stock markets and currency markets the world over.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Although the early AP was a much different organisation than the one today, the objectives have not greatly changed.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"My business is to communicate facts,": said Lawrence Gobright, who began reporting Washington news for AP in 1848, its first year of operation. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"My instructions do not allow me to make any comments on the facts. My dispatches are sent to papers of all manner of politics. I therefore confine myself to what I consider legitimate news and try to be truthful and impartial." 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
As communications makes our global reach much greater, it also increases the scrutiny of our work. Lawrence Gobright's dictum remains as true today as it was 148 years ago.

<B>Questioner 6</B><BR>
 Can I just ask you to cast your minds forward about ten years or so - you've given us a great background on where we've come from with these services - but where you see us being in ten years in terms of the role of wire services vis a viz local newspapers, the sorts of products you see being offered. There's a lot of experimenting going on at the moment. Do you have a sense for which of those products might succeed. Just a bit of crystal ball gazing . . .
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin </B><BR>
I don't really. I just think we're going to get an exponential growth of what we've already got. I mean, you'll get more online services, but until people can find out how to pay for it I'm not quite sure that it's got any value. We've gone into it in a big way, as I was telling you about the Presidential visit, and the way we do it is different to others. You can only get our online multimedia services through the website of one of our member newspapers. So I think the way it will develop will be the way those newspapers develop their sites. And they will then tell us what they'd like to provide for it, because we are after all just a provider. AP is, unlike some other agency, we're not out trying to develop new products and repackage things to sell individually, and go down the foodchain to smaller organisations and customers. What about you, do you have a feel for the future?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Zainoa Sulaiman </B><BR>
We try to bring . . . as daily as possible to the people, instead of just relying on the newspapers and TV and radio stations. For example we have started what we call the VBI service. You can on the PC, you can get . . . television signal for example. Of course you need a decoder for that to receive our service. There is a limited service, especially you know, the small man playing the stock market for example, they get the ... information there at the same time they get what's related on the news. So I think we have to be read to follow through. Even for example one Malaysian newspaper, the vernacular newspapers, have on the website, six languages. They have the main copy in English, they also have it in Spanish, in French, in German and some other languages. They do it everyday. They are not getting any revenue yet, they have over a million people you know, so we also are on the internet, but we have to see how much then it will effect our business.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer </B><BR>
Yes, I'd like to say that yes the internet poses a lot of problems to newsagencies. Particularly in the control of the information. What's happening is that people scrounge around the internet and pick up information that comes from the newsagency that has been legitimately put ton the internet, then reproduce it and sell it for profit. Well obviously as it is newspapers are not paying, or traditional media clients, do not really pay what it costs to gather information, so internet does pose some problems in that regard. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
We have to ... be very carefully used. But one thing that I do think we're getting towards, and it would be helpful for a lot of people, in smaller countries and in smaller media, is that they will be able to download material that specifically interests them. They don't have to get 80 000 words a day and extract from that 10 000 words that they're interested in. For example in the Pacific countries there are very small media outlets and they may wish and prefer to have just regional Pacific news, and we hope to provide that, so they can dial in and pick it up.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 7 </B><BR>
I'm from a small operator newsagency, it's a domestic newsagency of Portugal, and I'd like to ask the same question to both from the big player perspective and from a national newsagency. As the speed gathers pace in terms of delivering the news and even if a domestic newsagency like myself has tried to put itself on the internet with an English service and a French service and even a Mandarin service and so forth, that as the speed gathers pace, particularly in terms of information about business news and so forth, that what the newsagency is doing is making correspondents like myself doing more in depth work and more analysis rather than giving news per such. Let's call it more current affairs. Do you think that small operators will move more towards that way, more specialised analytical work as opposed to fast - because it's impossible for me as an operator here to beat a ... although I've done it in very small minute details - when Agence France can send it much faster. How do you see both from a big player perspective and from a small agent.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Sulaiman </B><BR>
It's very small beer ... We look at areas of say in our own interests. For example you look at certain - as a Malaysian national agency - we look at something which is of direct interest to Malaysia. So, that would be our focus. And of course the media in Malaysia, and even the other ..., we're more keen to see those stories that effect Malaysia. So I think there's no conflict here. Whereas the wires will be more on general terms, maybe regional or international angle, where we still have I think quite an important role to play to feed the ...stories more pertinent to the country.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin </B><BR>
I'd agree with you. But I also think there's probably going to be a role for your smaller agencies, because the big newspapers aren't doing as much as they used to. When I started on newspapers here in Sydney part of the job for young journalists was to report the local councils. I don't think the newspapers bother with those any more. I think the Sydney Morning Herald has two people who do courts, whereas in London there's an agency that does nothing but courts and sells the reportage to the national dailies. There's one agencies that does Heathrow Airport only, cause the newspapers can't be bothered sending anybody out there if they can buy coverage from these guys at the airport. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
So, I think there's going to be quite a lot more opportunities will come out of this, and the big organisations will concentrate on the things they do best, and that's deploying a lot of people to big events and doing it very fast with a lot of good background. But I think there's also probably room for well-backgrounded pieces that are timeless, there's good opportunity there. Although, you know, we're all doing that, we all do analysis and background on almost every event that's of significance. But I do think yeah, there are opportunities.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer </B><BR>
Yes, that makes three of us in agreement here. But yes I do think that the smaller newsagencies would be better off if they concentrated on the particular angles that their client newspapers are interested in. Because the newsagencies are now definitely moving general stories much faster, and so therefore I think a great deal of emphasis is given to covering the major stories. I think there is room for angles, and I think journalists should go abroad with that in mind and try to set up their own small agencies to supply their newspapers back home.

<br><IMG vspace=8 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Today's journalists have to see the links between northern over- consumption and southern deprivation and report on these twin threats to the planet's viability. The beef that hamburger multinationals buy could come from cattle that graze on land cleared of Venezuelan rainforests. Exotic aquarium fish in Singapore's shops may have been caught by a ten-year-old Filipino boy diving down to the corals to squirt cyanide on the reefs. The elegant carpets for sale in shops in Hamburg are woven by overworked and underpaid women and children in Nepal, where the dyes and chemicals needed to treat the rugs have blackened rivers and poisoned ground water.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Poverty, population growth, climate change and the loss of cultural and biological diversity are such serious challenges to future life on the planet that reporting them calls for a new breed of journalists--journalists without mental borders who have the energy and vision to move beyond the traditional classroom concepts of reporting and writing. Reporters who do not just report, but look behind the headlines to examine cause and effect. They must be reporters with wider horizons who constantly explore regional or international linkages to national problems. Journalists shouldn't just hold a mirror to society, but be a part of its reflection. And most importantly, journalists must feel part of the societies and the planet that they write about and care for it.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Today, traditional economic thinking is being revised to take into account ecological realities, social justice and equity. Like economists, journalists also need new parameters. Present rules dictate that stories on the rich and powerful are hard news for page one and articles on landless peasants and the reasons for their plight are for the weekend section. Old fashioned journalism that reduced everything to event-oriented spots needs to be replaced by contextualised coverage that looks at the linkages and true nature of change.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The question of how far journalists should go in taking a point of view without hurting their credibility is something that every reporter has to take very seriously. The squabble between subjectivity and objectivity is the oldest debate in the world's second-oldest profession. Journalism schools today preach the gospel of balanced reporting: a concept inherited mainly from the Anglo-Saxon media schools which during the darkest days of apartheid, for example, behaved in an impeccably balanced manner to report on South Africa by treating institutionalised state racism as if it was a minor corruption scandal. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In a report on a global conference of spiritual leaders and parliamentarians in Moscow in 1988, Anuradha Vittachi wrote: "With each gulp of news, our "objective" reporters chew down the complexity they receive, simplify it to the level of their prejuidices, and them amplify their prejuidices in print. Their loyal readers buy whichever prejuidices correspond with their own, denoucning the other versions as written by liars." 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Narrative neutrality in print and broadcast media has been elevated to a journalistic credo, neutering reporters and making them incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. "Balanced reporting" treats a reporter like a robot, with no power of analysis and comprehension and capable of only a monochrome view of the world. Reporters should concentrate on shovelling facts, it is said, and let the experts handle the more intellectually demanding op-ed stuff. This is not reporting, it is stenography. And as one American journalist put it, "it is relentless factuality, stories without conclusions and journalism without a point of view which is biased in favour of the status quo, relying on its substance on the facts and opinions supplied by the prominent and powerful".
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Objectivity makes journalists only responsible for the method, not the content. It exposes them to manipulation by the elite, who already have greater access to mainstream media. The role of the media is not to serve as a megaphone for those in power: its job is to "place responsibility for the failures of our society on the people and institutions that control society". The biggest problem with the doctrine of narrative neutrality is that it favours the institutions that control society.

Journalism as we know it is facing a big ethical challenge. Now we are experiencing a "fast food" era of journalism. Competition has never been so fierce to serve the ever hungry news consumer. Today the definition of a good reports is a report that comes first. In Thailand, criminal suspects have been known to demand money as TV stations scrambled to be the first to interview them.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
One English-language newspaper in my country has adjusted its writing style. Stories have been shortened and the language simplified to allow readers to absorb news more quickly. We haven't done that we may be forced to do so one day.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
Media organisations will have more intertwined business interests. There will be continuous expansions and frequent mergers. But as media empires grow and become more powerful all over the world, how they will treat small voices of unorganised dissident or individuals is a major question.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
The new generation of news organisations will contain broadcast, telephone, satellite and fibre optics. This will subject them to government regulation or control. My newspaper has ventured into TV and radio businesses and we are calling ourselves a multimedia group. Clashes with the government over how to handle an issue have become increasingly common.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>	
These are the challenges facing journalists all over the world. We are required to be fast, fair and objective at the same time. We have to cope with changing habit of news consumers while world's problems of suffering, poverty, oppression remain unchanged. The future is full of hope, but it will test journalists' ability to adjust themselves.

<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question, David Robie </B><BR>
This is a question for Kunda Dixit that's really a marketing question. In the South Pacific the news media generally speaking and particularly the print media has very limited range of news services. Basically all the daily news services have largely relied on Australian Associated Press feed, which as included limited coverage from Reuters and AP and so on, and also includes some from Agence France press. That changed three years ago when Malaysian-owned National was launched, and they brought in an Agence France Press news service and the coverage changed quite dramatically in Papua New Guinea, where there was a lot more extensive coverage of Asia–Pacific Region and the had an effect on the competitive Murdoch-owned Post. It seems to me that IPS has a very good service that would be very well suited to news media in the South Pacific. I just wondered if IPS has approached that possibility, and are there any papers that might be likely to take their service?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Kunda Dixit </B><BR>
Well, when I was in Port Moresby, David, when I met you, I did go to see the National and the other papers there, and they are very sympathetic to what I said, that we had a different perspective on world events, but I also heard the same old story: that we have information overload, we have so much, we cannot even in the course of a day read all the wire services that we subscribe to, we don't really have space. And I said what I always say, which is that there's a qualitative difference, that what you're getting from us is different, it's not competing with them but it's supplementary. Yeah, I put them on a three month trial and never heard from them again. And also the problem is that our stories are longer. They're more in depth. And I suppose they have limited space. That National is a tabloid, they have very little space, they have a lot of ads. But yeah, I think there is a lot of possibility for having a partner agency in the South Pacific which would do the distribution for us, which already has a network, and we just feed into that. With not our whole service, but perhaps a selection of stories that would be interesting to South Pacific clients. For this I would say stories on global warming for example, or negotiations of the IPCC in Geneva, what happened to govern the outside emissions (it really effects all the island countries); what's happening to other island counties in the Indian Ocean or the Caribbean. These sort of stories are the sort of stories we can offer that would be different, and, well, let's talk.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question [a bit crackly and occasional word missed]</B><BR>
 I would like to get comment from both of you - you mentioned something about journalists having to be a part of society and then also have a representative of these quality papers, the English papers in Bangkok, also that you are independent news source - when we look at the popularity of the tabloid or the sort of popularity of the nationalist kind of news media, you sometimes wonder there is a dilemma being part of the society and representative of most of the population, and the sort of integrity of the media. As you mentioned, many of the quality kind of documentary or the good TV program does not seem to reach the area while the nationalist kind of thing seems to have a much popularity. I would like to get some of the comment from both of you about this dilemma between being part of society and the integrity of the journalism.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer </B><BR>
In Thailand people, like everywhere else, they love to read sensational stories. But they treat those stories like entertainment, like everywhere. There's freedom still fracturing(?) in Thailand, but I think the process should go on. Today some people might believe in some nonsense story if you see it in a sensational newspaper. But sooner or later the people will become smarter and will be more selective about believing in news stories. Of course they will never stop reading tabloids, they like stories about movie stars and other gossip, political allegations and false political allegations, stories like that. But they will get smarter and they will know what to believe. It will take some time but I think that's a process. We have to start somewhere.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer </B><BR>
With us, we really don't do tabloid journalism so much. Maybe we should be doing it. But I'm reminded of the famous headline in the New york Daily News that boosted their circulation, double of what their daily circulation was. The headline was 'Headless body found in topless bar'. [laugh] So that kind of journalism gets you circulation, so it's a dilemma as you mentioned for journalists and media groups. I mean, how populist can you be, and how can you do responsible intelligent coverage. I think the way for media groups who have difficult making intelligent newspaper ends' meet, is to have both. SO you have a tabloid where you make all your money and you subsidise the other one. And I think some newspaper groups are doing that. Others do it by having large circulation vernacular press which is sensational, make money from it, and then subsidise the  English.

<B>China Sets the Parameters for Press Freedom</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Despite provisions in the Basic Law guaranteeing press freedom after 1997, there may be other ways to restrict what media organisations can write and say after 1997. Recently, Chinese officials have spelled out restrictive ground rules for journalists.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>The most recent statement was made by China's Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, during the closing session of the sixth plenary session of the Preparatory Committee early this month. He stated that press freedom should be protected by Hong Kong laws. But he said rumours and personal attacks should not be regarded as press freedom. He further explained that there were objective criteria in judging right and wrong, and different professions should be governed by professional ethics recognised by society.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>However, the explanation did not square with criticism sounded by legal scholars in Hong Kong. According to these scholars, the law cannot deal with personal attacks, and there is a grey area between criticism and personal attack.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Mr Qian's line was similar to remarks he made in an interview with the Asian Wall Street Journal. In the interview, the vice-premier said that "(t)hey can put forward criticism, but not rumours or lies. Nor can they put forward personal attacks on the Chinese leaders. For that would not live up to the morality of the occupation. And that is not compatible with personal moral ethics as well." Mr Qian was also quoted as saying that "Hong Kong should not hold those political activities which directly interfere in the affairs of the mainland of China." This has been taken to mean that activities marking the anniversary of the 1989 suppression of the pro-democracy movement in China would not be allowed in Hong Kong.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Similar ground rules were spelt out in May by the Director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Lu Ping, who asserted in an interview with America's Cable News Network that the Hong Kong media would not be permitted to advocate "two Chinas" or to write about Hong Kong or Taiwan independence. It would seem that from China's perspective, any call for independence for a part of the country would be going against the principle of "one country".
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Mr Lu reiterated his views in August, during a meeting with a delegation of Hong Kong journalists. He said: "I don't want to create any illusions for you. After 1997, it will not be possible for you to advocate two Chinas, or one China and one Taiwan, or Hong Kong independence, or Taiwan independence, or Tibet independence. The press will not be allowed to do so. It is a
 different issue from press freedom." He also stressed that the post-1997 government had to legislate against seditious or subversive acts, and there had to be a differentiation between advocacy and objective reporting.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>During the same visit by the Hong Kong delegation, a senior Chinese official in charge of media policy said that China would of course like the Hong Kong media to consider his country's point of view, but that China would not achieve this goal by implementing a high-handed policy.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>It has become obvious that China will try to set some parameters within which the relatively free Hong Kong media will have to operate after the handover. However, it is essential for the people to stand up for their rights, because China has promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under the one-country two-systems concept, with Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>We should let the Chinese government know about the contribution that a free press has made in ensuring Hong Kong's success, and about the adverse effects if restrictions are imposed on the media. We should also let Beijing know that the expression of ideas, however unrepresentative, will not harm Hong Kong. I remember that in the early 1980s, some people called for Hong Kong's independence. The suggestion faded away following a thorough discussion in the media. Hong Kong did not suffer as a result. Rather, it continued to prosper.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>I should add here that the HKJA has recently compiled a 10 point agenda for action on freedom of expression. Among other things, the paper calls on the chief executive-designate and the post-1997 government to uphold the right of the public and the media to advocate opinions and ideas, so long as this is implemented peacefully and does not constitute a real and immediate threat to public order or safety. It also calls on the future chief executive to uphold the right to criticise the government and individuals, subject only to the law of libel.

<B>Question. Kate Fry</B><BR>
Kate Fry from UTS You talked about the trend to insularity that you pick out in Australia at the moment in our own coverage, and you gave some examples from the UK elections - sorry, the US elections and the UK crisis of identity, and talked about our cultural predilections being in those areas. You haven't actually said whether you think this is occurring, this sort of insularity, with regard to Asia and our Australian coverage. And if you think it is, what do you think are some of the issues we should be looking at in more depth, and perhaps bringing it back to the introduction of this conference, some of the issues to do with changing social structures in Asia, as you're obviously wanting us to deal with them in the US and the UK. What sort of things do you think should be getting more depth and more attention in the Australian media?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly </B><BR>
Well I think the issues are the underlying issues. And this gets back to the point I've been making that the foreign correspondents have got to be very good journalists. They've got to be experienced journalists and they've got to be able to handle things conceptually. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Now in answer to your question, I think that they've got to be able to look at the trends that are going on in Asia. And by the trends I'm now talking about: economic changes; social changes; political changes; technology; telecommunications. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
If you want to be a little bit more specific I mean - the magnitude of Japan's financial crisis over the last several years, and the extent of demoralisation this has fed into Japan's corporate sector is one very very big issues. The nature of Japanese democracy, the genuine nature of Japanese democracy, following the initial loss of the LDP you know, what is the real nature of the decision making process there? It's very different. I mean while Japan has a process of democracy, at the heart the decision making process there, it's a very different sort of democracy to what we understand. How the bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan is being transformed as the old resource-based relationship surrenders to a more complicated relationship, and Australia does not have the clout we once had in Japan and we don't have the personal associations we once had in Japan, and how we handle that as a country. So there are three examples in relation to Japan.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In relation to Indonesia: we've got to try to come to grips with this transition that's going to occur, which will be a unique event for the New Order government, a unique event for Indonesian society. And the fact that institutions in Indonesia are pressing for change - I think there's a very strong feeling in Indonesia that things have got to be done in a different way. There's a real - I believe - feeling of dissatisfaction about the President and about the status quo, outlook, approach and policies of the President. A feeling not just at some levels of Indonesian society for change. Well, there's feelings within the armed forces, feelings within the commercial sector, feelings within the educated people (among students, among academics). 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
We've got to try to come to grips with this and it's a very difficult thing to do, because there are so many different views within Indonesia society about what's going to happen. The increase in religious tensions. Now, these are some examples in relation to Indonesia. Again, these are complicated issues. They're very complicated issues, they need to identified, they need to be written about, they need to be addressed. I think it needs to be done in a sensitive way but it needs to be done. You really need competent reporters to do it. These are very serious journalistic challenges. So in relation to Japan and Indonesia they are some examples.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question</B><BR>
[Name unclear], President of the Foreign Correspondents' Association. You mentioned that you thought it would be a good idea to syndicate stories about South East Asia, particularly Indonesia, to the rest of the English speaking world, which I think is a very good idea. (Often frustrating, for example, my newspaper sending people from Paris here and there in the region who lack in-depth knowledge about what they're writing about). So why isn't that done, or do you know anybody who would be prepared to launch something like that?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Paul Kelly</B><BR>
Well, I think it's something that needs to be addressed, something that needs to be done. It's very important. It's an area of priority I think for Australian media organisations. This is an issue we have under consideration at the moment.

<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Let me just wrap this up by addressing some specific issues suggested by the organisers. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Does technological change threaten notions of national cultural integrity?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In my view, no; exposure to outside trends by advanced technology strengthens strong cultural aspects, and distils them to their finer parts. Arts, crafts, and systems of thought. The most technologically advanced society today may be Japan, which retains a uniquely impenetrable culture.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Are there such things as Asian news values? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Not specifically Asian, but I think that some conservative Asians worry about the same things that the Christian right worries about in the United States: the influence on the rising generation of too much sex and violence on TV and outrageous hairstyles and clothes. The young everywhere ignore these concerns until they are as old as those who hold them now.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In Bangalore, however, we have again another of those intractable problems raised by the universalist claims of ethics. A group of traditionalist feminist women have threatened to set fire to themselves if India will persist in hosting a beauty pageant. They find these events demeaning to womanhood. Here we have a Western and modern concern - feminism - espoused by a traditional group - Indian women - who would articulate their protest in what was widely regarded as a uniquely Asian fashion - self-immolation - until Norman B. Morrisson set himself on fire on the steps of the Pentagon to protest the Vietnam war.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Will growing affluence lead to more freedom of speech in the region? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Singaporeans tell me they are every year more tightly controlled as the man fades away whose indisputable intelligence held everyone in a stronger thrall than the police could exercise.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
What role should journalists play in the economic and social development of the Asia-Pacific region in the late 20th century? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Dr. A. Samad Ismail, in that lecture of his, proposed that a journalist has a special role. I said no. There is no special mission for a journalist to build his nation separate from his duty to find the truth about it, and tell it as it is. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There is no such thing as an Asian truth distinct from another kind. Standards for determining what is true and what is a lie do not change from climate to climate. Truth is the only foundation of a valid value system. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
That truth must, in a time of crisis, be protected by a bodyguard of lies is a proposition I find difficult to accept, when there is a more honourable alternative: Hold the story until the crisis passes.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Truth is one. The police club striking the head of a Chinese protester stings as much as the club landing squarely on the head of an American black.  And stealing by the daughter-in-law of an Asian president is stealing plain and simple, and not a form of governance traditional to Asia. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
In no country is there an authentic need to reshape journalistic standards to fit national developmental requirements because journalism's best contribution to nation-building is to be true to its calling - find the facts and tell them straight.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
And, finally, is it possible to predict the future of journalism in the region?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Only if you can predict the price of newsprint until the end of the century, and keep it steady or make it less. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I was invited to answer the question: 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Do Asian values tend to deny freedom of expression? I hope I have shown that the question begged another: Are there Asian values?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
There are things uniquely Asian, distinctive ways of living and coping. But rather than being opposed to such values as free speech, open assembly and democratic elections, these things find purer expression under such values.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I want to know what my Indonesian brother and Malaysian sister really think about his country, my country, the rest of the world. I do not care to know what the President's daughter-in-law, stepping out of a Paris boutique, says the people of her country believe. How would she know? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
I concede that there are, not Asian values, but realities - Asian, African, Balkan - that call for some qualification of free speech. Such as real ethnic or religious divisions that can spill out in blood, as in Bosnia. I will not defend the right to cast a racist slur in a room where somebody has a gun. But with slurs, the press should have little to do, unless it is against politicians, in which case they are to be warmly encouraged.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
But the President's son and daughter-in-law grabbing yet another national resource is not one of those realities that call for any measure of understanding. That reality should invite only attack. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
A century of Asian striving for universal values like individual autonomy, dignity, freedom suggests that the real issue is not between distinct sets of values, but between clashing values within the same set: such as national security versus speech, order versus provocation, art versus conventional morals. Do some of these values tend to deny freedom of the press? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
From time to time yes, as in times of genuine crisis - America in the Great War, Germany in the Depression, and again America in the time of Joseph McCarthy. But, lately, they have tended rather to make freedom strong.

Section Five</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Of course, not all business journalism is adversarial.  While investigative
stories are the most fun and brings the prizes, reputation, and advertising, 
they take huge amounts of work and cannot meet the appetite of TV shows
or publications that must be produced on a regular basis. Besides,
audiences demand useful information even more than a good or insightful
read. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
They want up-to-date market information that is accurate, has been
organized and intelligently distilled for them, and provides a point of view
driven by the facts rather than philosophy or ideology. (In this context,
someone recently remarked that already we are moving from the
Information Age to the Intelligence Age. That suggests a bit of job security
for the editors among you). 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
What other intelligence does the business press audiences desire. They
want to know everything from broad economic outlooks through exchange
rate prospects to, whether to use distributors or agents in a given country. 
They want to know who to do business with and who to avoid.  One of the
more useful pieces I have seen in recent times appeared in WorldBusiness,
a magazine put out by the accounting/consulting firm of Peat Marwick
(speaking of new-style media owners) that bluntly and precisely told readers
who to do business with in Vietnam if they expected to get anywhere.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
That brings me to the question of who will practise this journalism. The
current wave of cost-cutting and downsizing in the developed nations has
prompted many news-gathering organizations to cut back on their foreign
bureaus and even their foreign coverage.  (It is one of today's ironies that
traditional U.S. media, for example, is trimming foreign coverage at a time
when, economically-speaking, the nation is more intricately involved with the
rest of the world than ever before.  In the 1960s, for example, U.S. foreign
trade equated to only 4% of GDP. today it is more than 15%.  And small
companies that never dreamed of exports or foreign investments are
pushing abroad by the thousands.  The contemporary wisdom is that the
end of the Cold War and the triumph of capitalism, along with tougher
economic times, has turned the American focus inward).
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
These cutbacks suggest non-Asian news organizations will rely more on
their own expatriates and locals to provide stories for them.  This may well
impact the quality of those stories for the worse, not least because such
reporters are susceptible to the establishment pressures mentioned earlier. 
Still, that is by no means certain.  An editor of Global Finance, a New York-
based magazine whose title is self-explanatory, recently assigned a
sensitive financial story to a new Japanese stringer.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"I can't ask these important Japanese executives these questions,"
complained the stringer to her New York editor.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"Oh yes you can and you will, if you want to the story to run and to get paid,"
came the reply.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
She did and got her answers.  Most came from the very people she feared. 
Foreigners based in Tokyo filled in the blanks.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The story ran.  She got kudos, her money and a byline.  That did it. Today,
she is one of the magazine's more aggressive and informative writers.  Now,
Japan is not, say, China.  But it wasn't all that long ago, the Japanese were
as quite as anti any sort of unfettered journalism as anybody else in Asia.
They still aren't crazy about it but they have limited choice in the matter if
they want to operate in the larger world and to keep building an economy
that is ever more intricately tied to that world.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It is worth noting that the journalist in that story speaks both her own
language and English.  Command of more than one language is, in fact,
becoming more important than ever for journalists.  Diplomats increasingly
have to speak the language of the country to which they are posted, and are
rewarded financially for doing so.  Why not journalists, even if English is
increasingly the lingua franca of world business.  The China reporting of
Sheryl WuDunn and Nick Kristoff for The New York Times and their
resulting book, China Wakes, demonstrates the immense advantage of
being able to discuss complex manners with interviewees in their own
language rather than through the strainer of an interviewer with an agenda.

<B>Questioner 8 Michael Perry </B><BR>
Michael Perry, Chief Correspondent, Reuters Australia. I'd like to ask a human question here. The discussions have been about the technology, the explosion of news that we're all now providing and now we're providing in a multimedia format. But what of the journalist? What do you see is the future. There's talk of the 'multimedia journalist': is that a myth? is that a reality? Is the journalist of the future going to be expected to supply text, photos, television product, audio. Or is this a technology myth and really we're going to have to have specialists in those areas still?
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer 1</B><BR> 
yes, I do think there's going to be specialists. I don't think people, journalists, will be required to file the multimedia products. And anyway, one of the problems as far as I'm concerned, is very little training is given at all in newsagency journalism. People are taught to be newspaper correspondents and so on but when it comes to training people to work in newsagencies it's virtually non-existent. And I think that there is definitely going to be very specialist people, particularly in the photographic area alone.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin </B><BR>
I dunno, I think we've all had a look at this multimedia person. When I was in Indochina, I mean we didn't have enough staff to send a reporter and a photographer on every assignment, so the reporter would be trained up to use a camera in a basic way, and a tape recorder, and then go out and report, take a picture, get back to the office. Somebody would look after the pictures. He'd write a caption, write a story, and then feed the audio to AP radio in Washington. So the multimedia person has been a round a bit. But when we started AP television, it was an absolute that we would not ask existing photographers or news people to file for AP TV. And with the exceptional case here and there where AP TV was off base or we were off base and they were the only there, that's been held to. I think it's just too difficult to ask a photographer to carry a still camera and a video camera. It's just not possible. And the photographers I know wouldn't do it anyway. I think reporters could be convinced to carry a video in extremis, but by and large it wouldn't be part of the routine job. I think it still has to be a specialist event.
<B>Answer</B><BR>
I'd just like to say that in my experience that journalists never been properly trained in photos. Journalism's a very strong branch of the business, and I think every writing journalist should be really up to speed on what happens on the photo side, and should be able to take a photo and get rid of it back to the office. And I don't mean by pigeoning it with some passenger on Qantas. Should be able to put it in Photoshop and send it. And it may not become compulsory but I think it'd be useful  if journalists were taught to do it.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Questioner 1 </B><BR>
May I ask our Malaysian guest whether or not the technological change has influenced the news values/ Asian values debate in terms of everybody using technology now: does that mean everybody using English language for example as a common currency. I'd like to ask the other speakers whether or not technological change has meant that the public relations expert entering the media and government public relations experts, now will have the upper hand over their critics because they have greater access to the technology.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Sulaiman </B><BR>
No, I don't think there should be any change, because you can go on any language you know. Because in Malaysia [you can be on] the internet in Arabic or Mandarin. In fact we are moving one step ahead by even maybe start submitting our news copy in Mandarin, within the country. Because we have a lot of Chinese newspapers and we have resources say from China and even from Taiwan and Hong Kong. So because ... foreign news into the country, so we must allow this ... to make some money out of this. So, I think the question of English or what level language I think is just - the language is not a problem here. I don't believe English even ... , the technologies or the language you develop accordingly. Of course English has been the second language all the time in Malaysia.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer </B><BR>
I'm sorry, I wasn't sure of the thrust of the second part of that question.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Question 1</B><BR>
The thrust of my question is basically (and I'll raise it because a former employee of mine is in the room here today). When BHP are up against the environmentalists over Ok Tedi, they have the technology and resources to go out and shoot their own propaganda films, put it on the internet, get it out on the wire services, far more effectively than say the Australian Conservation Foundation,  operating on a much smaller budget. What I'm saying is: does the changes in technology allow the powerful to squeeze the meek more, or do we take the other view, that the increase in technology allow everybody to become their own editor and publisher whether they're online or offline? I'm looking at it in terms of the shift in power relations. Particularly with the public relations industry. It sort of seems to - well, in my experience as someone who works on an issue such as East Timor, I find that there's a lot of black propaganda from the Indonesian government which gets on the internet ... , and people who want to counter that can spend their whole time trying to discount it as black propaganda, you know, which is coming out from government sources.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>O'Loughlin </B><BR>
Well, that's one of the problems with internet: you can't control what's on it and who puts what on it. But whether a big company like BHP and Ok Tedi, whatever they put out it still gets  down to the same question in the end. It's going to come to an editor of Reuters or AP or the Sydney Morning Herald and they're going to say 'This sounds like a lot of BHP propaganda to me,' and throw it in the bin. Which is where it should go. They've got the ability to take it anywhere else they like except to buy it into a newspaper, or into a reputable news service. And I don't think they've got any more power than they ever had.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
<B>Answer</B><BR> 
I want to back Peter on that because I know what you're talking about. We do get an awful lot of stuff coming over faxes and various forms, through the internet and so on, but nevertheless the same old journalistic skills and qualities are used. You just sift it through and then you try to put out the balanced story: this is what we're looking at. The fact we get more in actual fact, more from a personal level, tends to turn me off a bit. An awful lot of the stuff that is pumped out by these PR companies does end up in the bin. There's just too much of it.

Balanced reporting gives those who have power and wealth an unfair advantage, it is biased against change and ignores the fact that impartiality can also mean taking sides. To sum it all up, objectivity is highly subjective.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
This debate has relevance in Asia, since it is here that nearly half the world's population lives. How Asians live, how they prosper, the numbers of them that will remain poor will determine global environmental trends in the next century. And how is media going to cover environment and development in this region so that it can have an impact on lifestyle and policy? 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Asia is not one continent, it is at least three. A fluke of history led early empire builders in Europe to classify Asia ("everything east of the Ottomans") as one monolithic mass. Marking Asia off as one continent has become even more absurd with the phenomenal growth of East Asia's tiger economies in the past decades, the oil-fed affluence of the Gulf states, Australia's economic and cultural integration with Pacific Asia and the impoverishment of the South Asian subcontinent. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Africa may get more publicity for its famines and grinding poverty and pictures of babies with bloated bellies, but South Asia has three times more truly destitute people: 600 million of them. A shocking half of all under-five children in South Asia are underweight. In comparison, only one in every three in sub- Saharan African children are underweight, according to a 1996 UNICEF survey. The disparities within Asia now resemble the gaps between sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It is clear that environmental threats in the Asia-Pacific stem from both poverty and prosperity. More than half the world's population lives here, and they are forced to burn forests or blast corals just to survive from day to day. In the dynamic Asia of the NICs, per capita incomes are now approaching First World levels. But this affluence has often been attained at a high environmental cost to themselves and to poorer neighbours. If China's Guangdong province with its population of 70 million [CHECK] was a separate country, it would be the fastest growing national economy on earth. Rising affluence in the coastal regions of southern China is creating new demands on natural resources and consumer goods. Tigers and rhinos in sanctuaries of the South Asian sub-continent are threatened by demands of traditional medicine, swallows nests from caves in Borneo are ending up in Guangzhou's restaurants, while sharks in the Bay of Bengal are hunted for their precious fins. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Environmental awareness has grown in Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong but it is not spreading fast enough to keep pace with Asia's rising affluence. The growth model of East Asia is fashioned by the same wasteful extravagance that the West has now learnt is not sustainable. As its huge population gets richer and consumes more, Asia today has become the locomotive for global growth. It would be much cheaper for Asian countries in the long term to learn from the North's mistakes and invest now on sustainable policies and new environment-friendly technologies. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Maurice Strong, who sheperded the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 on behalf of the United Nations, says: "The battle to save our planet through sustainable development will be won or lost in Asia. It is inconceivable that there could be an effective global transition to sustainable development unless Asia develops sustainably.Asians make up more than half the world's population. How Asians live, how they prosper, how many of them will remain poor, will determine global environmental trends in the next century. The challenge for the Asian media is to cover environment and development with intelligence and integrity so that coverage makes an impact on lifestyle and policy.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
It is possible, for Western journalists or for Asian journalists trained in Western news values, to strike the cultural balance and to find the proper niche in society. And they do not need a label to describe themselves: eastern or western, "Asian values" or Anglo-Saxon ones. In the end it is just a question of professionalism, commitment and a conscience.

<B>Self-Censorship in the Media</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>To reiterate, it is time for us to uphold press freedom. However, there are problems within the media industry itself.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>According to a survey co-sponsored by the HKJA and conducted among journalists in early 1995, 90 percent of respondents believed there was self-censorship in the industry, and one third admitted that they themselves had exercised self-censorship.
 They also indicated that greater "care" would be taken in dealing with criticism about China, than that directed against the Hong Kong government.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>While the clandestine nature of self-censorship means that it is difficult to pin down actual examples, there has at the same time been little evidence to suggest that the situation has improved. Television documentaries vilified by the Chinese government have been bought and then never broadcast, popular but critical TV programs have been axed, and critical newspaper columns and cartoons suddenly dropped.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>There are many reasons for self-censorship. Proprietors might wish to maintain good relations with the Chinese government to ensure post-1997 survival and a stake in the huge China market. Front-line journalists may exercise self-censorship to maintain a harmonious relationship with their contacts.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br><B>The Future</B>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>The future of press freedom depends on proprietors, news executives and of course front-line journalists. I hope we can all treasure the freedoms we now enjoy and fight for those freedoms after the handover. However, there are some factors which are beyond our control. The most significant factor is the political situation in China. Given the close relations between China and Hong Kong, Beijing is unlikely to allow Hong Kong a free hand if the political situation on the mainland becomes more tense. The media tends to become the first casualty in any such situation.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Despite this gloomy picture, there are some rays of light. One is China's open-door policy. When China opens up, and there is no sign that this will change, it has to consider international reaction to its policies. The other is the way the Chinese media is changing. After much interaction with the Hong Kong media, journalists in China have become more energetic about seeking news. We hope these changes will help ease the minds of Chinese leaders.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Another factor is how Hong Kong politicians, and in particular the chief executive, strike a balance between maintaining good relations with the Chinese government and upholding Hong Kong's autonomy and its way of life.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>Support from Hong Kong people and international circles is also important.
 Overall, prospects for press freedom in Hong Kong are not totally gloomy. The most important thing is not to give up. I do not want to see Hong Kong change from a colony under British rule to a Chinese colony. We deserve better than that. We wish to have our promised autonomy - which includes media autonomy - while remaining part of China.

Section Six</FONT>
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Be they locals or expatriates, journalists who cover business successfully
will need to call on the usual accoutrements of the trade - innate curiosity,
street smarts, a large supply of chutzpah or gall, and a continuing
willingness to be the eternal outsider.  If you want to join the establishment,
you probably should seek out another career.  But they will need something
else - a sound basis of economics, knowledge of how business works and
some financial training.  I'm always surprised by how many business
journalists can't read a balance sheet or don't realize that it's cash flow that 
tells the tale not profits.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
The necessity of this knowledge is reflected in a story told me by an
acquaintance took a quite senior communications job with a large American
retailer only to discover - to her dismay - that the company was in serious
business trouble.  She expressed her unhappiness in a conversation with
her former boss. 
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"Oh yeah, I know," he replied.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"How do you know," she asked. "Even the analysts haven't caught on yet.
Have you been golfing with the CEO."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"No," came the reply. "I don't even know the man.  But it's clear from the
financial. They're doing it all with smoke and mirrors."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"Why didn't you warn me," wailed my friend.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
"It wasn't our business and we assumed you could tell."
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
For business journalists, above all, it is important to see through the
financial smoke and not be fooled by false reflections in the mirrors. 
Because no one is going to tell you.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
Another vital requirement of a business audience is a sense of context.  Too
often, we journalists write only about how companies or entrepreneurs from
our own country are doing abroad.  But that may distort the picture.  If
Australian or American companies are doing poorly in the Chinese widget
market, for example, but their Japanese and Europeans counterparts are
making out like gangbusters, then the latter information should be included
in the story. Why? Because those competitors must be doing something
right. If so, it is vital or the Australian or American readers or viewers to
know what and how and why.  Parochialism is a dead end.
<br><IMG vspace=3 hspace=0 SRC="../resources/dot_clear.gif"><br>
One final remark on the emerging globalism of journalism of all types. Just
before leaving New York, I caught an item on the Bloomberg television
channel.  The reporter, who possessed a distinct Australian accent, was
reporting on the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Thailand.  Film rolled of the
British queen talking to the Thai king.  The reporter observed that it is illegal
to criticize the monarch in Thailand and remarked that Queen Elizabeth
surely must wish she enjoyed the same protection.   My immediate reaction
was to wonder how long the Thai king would escape such protection as the
outside world invaded his sanctum. Not for much longer, I guessed, not for
much longer.

<H3><I>Media Magazine</I> as an educational resource</H3>
</CENTER>
<BR>
Each week <I>Media Magazine</I> provides an unique insight on the media and communications sector in Australia.  From our position in community media we give no favours and over the last sventeen years the program has developed a reputation for indepedent analysis. 
<BR><BR>
Debate about media and communications is often peppered with jargon, acronyms and other barriers to understanding.  At <I>Media Magazine</I> we attempt to cut through that approach and provide anlaysis which is accessible while still being of a high standard.  
<BR><BR>
And while the program approaches issues from a variety of perspectives - political, technological, aesthetic, economic, cultural - we try to emphasise the role of communication as it impacts on people's lives.  Our programs tend to give more weight to consumer and community issues than most of our competitors.  
<BR><BR>
For these and many more reasons we belive <I>Media Magazine</I> to be a highly useful addition to the resources available to media and communications students.  We'd ask you to consider recommending your students listen to <I>Media Magazine</I> if a community radio station broadcasts the program <a href="../broadcast/index.html">in your area</a>.  
<BR><BR>
If not, please lobby your local station or consider <a href="../buy/index.html">purchasing a subscription to <I>Media Magazine</I> </a>for your school, department or university library.

<I>Media Magazine</I> programs have been produced continually since 1980.  One of 2SER's first programs (the station began broadcasting in 1979) it was also the only specialist media program in Australia at that time.  ABC TV's <I>Media Watch</I> and ABC Radio National's <I>Media Report</I> are Johnny-come-lately's to the scene. 
<BR><BR>
Some things have changed significantly from those days.  For its first five and a half yearsthe program was two hours long and one of a number of magazine style programs - for example there was also a Politics Magazine program.  The program was produced by volunteers and was only broadcast in Sydney.  Due to requests from other stations in the sector, in 1986 <I>Media Magazine</I> switched to a one hour all talk format with programs distributed to community radio stations around Australia.  While <I>Media Magazine</I> started distributing the program on cassette to sixteen stations this quickly became a najor drain on resources.  In mid 1987 the distribution was taken over by the National Program Service (NPS) of the then Public Broadcasting Association of Australia.
<BR><BR>
Since then the program has slimmed down to just under half an hour and is now distributed through the Community Radio Satellite service.  The satellite service replaced the cassette distribution system of the NPS in 1993.
<BR><BR>
<I>Media Magazine</I> has from its early days been recognised as a quality, independent program providing much needed analysis of media and communications issues in a form relevant to specialists yet still accessible to the general listener.  <I>Media Magazine</I> has won several awards for its programming, including awards from the PBAA Golden Reel Awards and the Australian HI-FI Awards.  
<BR><BR>
Many producers have been involved in the program - both as volunteers and as paid staff.  Some of these people are still working in community radio while others have gone on to other parts of the media and some to academia.  Some of the early producers include:
<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Trevor Thompson</B>
<BR><BR>
Now employed at the ABC, Trevor has been involved in a range of community radio and ABC radio projects and programs.
<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Christina Spurgeon</B>
<BR><BR>
One of the original volunteers, Christina currently lectures and is completing a PhD at the University of Technology, Sydney.  She has worked for a variety of media policy organisations including the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the Communications Law Centre.
<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Michelle Brown</B>
<BR><BR>
Another UTS graduate, Michelle worked at 2SER as Talks producer before freelancing for a range of commercial radio staions and the Sydney Morning Herald.  She has worked at the ABC since 1987.
<BR><BR><BR>
</UL>
Other producers over the years have included:
<BR><BR><BR>

FEATURE PROGRAM ON MEDIA REPORTING OF THE PORT ARTHUR MASSACRE
<BR><BR>


<B>Item One		Overview</B>
<BR><BR>

Given the scale of reporting of the massacre, can comparisons be made between media coverage of this tragedy and other events?  Associate Professor of Media and Communications Studies at Macquarie University - Phillip Bell - argues that media reporting of the massacre shares much in common with reporting of natural disasters…
<BR><BR>

<td>in</td><td>"Well the style of reporting...</td><tr>
<td>out</td><td>...problems of people."</td><tr>
<td>duration</td><td>6:46</td><tr>
<td>talent</td><td>Associate Professor of Media and Communications Studies at Macquarie University - Phillip Bell</td>
 </table>
<BR><BR>
<B>Item Two		The Community Radio Perspective</B>	
<BR><BR>
Community radio is supposed to present an alternative viewpoint to that put by the mainstream media.  This is particularly the case in news and current affairs reporting where the mainstream media is often criticised for taking a narrow or sensationalist approach.  So how did community radio's national news and current affairs service Public Radio News, deal with the massacre? I spoke to Undercurrents Presenter, Glen Bartholomew…

<table>
<td>in</td><td>"I think what a...</td><tr>
<td>out</td><td>...stay right away from."</td><tr>
<td>duration</td><td>4:04</td><tr>
<td>talent</td><td>Undercurrents Presenter/Producer, Glen Bartholomew</td>
 </table>
<BR><BR>


<B>Item Three		The Mental Health Angle</B>
<BR><BR>

Early reports from Port Arthur suggested that the alleged killer suffered from a mental health problem.  These reports were misleading and some mental health professionals are worried about the consequences of the negative media reporting in this case.  Bronwyn Scanlan spoke to President NSW Association for Mental Health - Professor Ian Webster....


<table>
<td>in</td><td>"I think that's probably...</td><tr>
<td>out</td><td>...deems people should work."</td><tr>
<td>duration</td><td>1:48</td><tr>
<td>talent</td><td>President NSW Association for Mental Health - Professor Ian Webster</td>
 </table>
<BR><BR>


<B>Item Four		The Australian and Digital Manipulation of Photographs</B>
<BR><BR>

The Australian has admitted to altering a picture of the alleged killer that appeared on its front page on the Wednesday following the massacre.  Michael Dwyer spoke to Editor of The Australian, Malcolm Schmidtke ....

<table>
<td>in</td><td>"Er, what I'd say...</td><tr>
<td>out</td><td>...was an accident."</td><tr>
<td>duration</td><td>2:47</td><tr>
<td>talent</td><td>Director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, Peter Cronau</td>
 </table>

<BR><BR>

<B>Item Five		The Largest Massacre?</B>


As the body count rose, the media was able to call the massacre the largest in Australia and then the world.  But while it was the largest massacre by a lone gunman, Director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, Peter Cronau explains that this was not always the message that came across...

<table>
<td>in</td><td>"The initial report...</td><tr>
<td>out</td><td>...clear reference to it."</td><tr>
<td>duration</td><td>1:26</td><tr>
<td>talent</td><td>Director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, Peter Cronau</td>

<H3>A Program on Journalism and Indonesia ...</H3>
<BR><BR>
<B>Item One		Dr George Aditjondro - Exiled Journalist and Academic</B>
<BR><BR>
A conference on the future of East Timor held recently in Sydney brought together many people including activists, academics and journalists.  While many issues were discussed, the media was high on the agenda.  Speakers at the conference included Alan Nairn - an American journalist whose skull was fractured by Indonesian soldiers during the 1991 massacre at the Santa Cruz Cemetery in Dili - and several Indonesian journalists now working in Australia.  One of those is Dr George Aditjondro - an exiled journalist and academic now working at the University of Newcastle.  While in Indonesia he worked for many years as an environmental reporter for the now banned magazine - Tempo.  Dr Aditjondro spoke to Michael Dwyer about his experiences as a journalist in Indonesia ...

<B>Item Two		Australian Journalists and Reporting of East Timor</B>
<BR><BR>
Some people - particularly those who support an independent East Timor - have been critical of the Australian media’s coverage of the Indonesian invasion.  Exiled Indonesian journalist and academic Dr George Aditjondro is critical of Australian media coverage from 1975 to this day.

<BR><BR>
Last Thursday the Sherman Report into the deaths of six Australian based journalists was tabled in Federal Parliament.  The report was set up to consider evidence that the journalists were deliberately killed by soldiers under Indonesian command.  Activists including Shirley Shackleton - widow of Greg Shackleton - have long argued that significant evidence has been ignored by successive Australian and Indonesian governments who have been engaged in a cover up.  Shirley Shackleton spoke to Michael Dwyer shortly before the release of the report ...

The Alliance of Independent Journalists was one of many organisations represented at a recent conference on the future  of East Timor.  A representative of the Alliance  - a Indonesian journalist now working in Melbourne - spoke about the alliance and its work in supporting journalists who choose not to work for media controlled or heavily influenced by the government.  He talked to Michael Dwyer about the formation of the alliance and the current situation for independent journalists in Indonesia...

<BR><BR>
Media and Aboriginal Deaths in Custody</H3>
</Center>
<BR><BR>
In 1991 the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody presented more than 300 recommendations.  Four of those were directed at the media.  In making these four recommendations, the Royal Commission recognised that media representation of indigenous people helps to shape the cultural world in which they live and shape opinions of indigenous and non-indigenous people alike.
<BR><BR>
In summary, the recommendations proposed:

<UL>
<LI>increased training and job opportunities for indigenous people in the media<BR><BR>
<LI>increased funding on indigenous media outlets<BR><BR>
<LI>that journalism schools to incorporate training in regard to indigenous people and issues<BR><BR>
<LI>that codes of practice be developed for covering indigenous affairs<BR><BR>
<LI>a prize or award for indigenous journalism
</UL>
<BR>
Some five years after the Royal Commission handed down its report, the number of indigenous people dying in custody has not significantly changed.  Some have called for a second Royal Commission while others have questioned where the money dedicated to implementing the recommendations has gone.
<BR><BR>
This documentary considers some different approaches which have been used to meet the recommendations about the media.  The program does not set out to judge the relative merits of different organisations - but to explore the strategies used.  Some organisations have created guidelines - others have placed more emphasis on personal contact including cross-cultural awareness camps for journalists.  Some have provided specific indigenous programs, others look to employ indigenous people in every or any role in general programming.  Indigenous media outlets have their own strategies and goals.
<BR><BR>
While many strategies have used, the continuing level of aboriginal deaths in custody is forcing us to ask any of the measures taken so far have been sufficient.  
<BR><BR>
Some of the speakers include:
<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>John Harding - a producer with ICAM on SBS TV<BR><BR>
<LI>Anne Babeliuk - news editor with the Daily Telegraph in Sydney<BR><BR>
<LI>Majorie Anderson - ABC<BR><BR>
<LI>Wal Saunders - Manager, Indigenous Branch, Australian Film Commission<BR><BR>
<LI>Dr Michael Meadows - Lecturer in Journalism at Giffith University
</UL>
<BR>
This documentary was produced by Tanja Dreher and Michael Dwyer.

<H3>A Brief Introduction to Community Broadcasting in Australia...</H3>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=3>(Sources used in compiling this introduction are listed below).</FONT></B>
<BR>
<BR>
The development of community media in Australia began in the early 1970's with the emergence of public radio.   While radio has been the dominant form of community media in Australia, the 1990's has seen the development of trial community television services and some forays into online services.
<BR>
<BR>
While aspects of the early history of the sector is contested ground, it is generally held to have begun in the early-mid 1970's with 5UV recognised as the first station.  5UV began 'broadcasting' in 1972 although its frequency was just off the AM band.  The station was in fact licensed under the Wireless and Telegraphy Act and not the then Television and Radio Act.  Although 5UV is held to be the first such station it is in fact predated by 2UV - a similarly licensed station at the University of New South Wales which had first operated in 1961.  
<BR>
<BR>
The emergence of community broadcasting had been hamstrung by the acceptance of the frequency scarcity mantra.  At this stage Australia only had AM broadcasting and FM was seeing strong resistance from governments, existing broadcasters, and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board.  At one stage it seemed FM would be introduced, but on the UHF band rather than the VHF band as it is evrywhere else in the world.  This view did not prevail in the end.  The MacLean Report cut through most of the trumped up resistance to FM and paved the way for its introduction into Australia.

 In 1974 a conference sponsored by the Commonwealth Department of Media brought together interested parties in the development of the sector and a meeting following the conference established the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia.  The dominant interested parties were educational institutions and potential fine music broadcasters.  Out of the conference came a recommendation to start community broadcasting in Australia - although at this stage it was quite a conservative bunch of people and organisations involved.   This conservatism later led several stations including 4ZZZ and 3CR to withdraw from the PBAA to start up the Alternative Radio Federation.  Most of these stations have now returned to the current version of the PBAA.
<BR>
<BR>
Following the decision to introduce FM broadcasting in Australia and community stations were the first to gain FM licenses.  This occured in 1975 when licenses were issued to 2MBS in Sydney and an AM license awarded to 5UV.  A major problem was that there was no official way to license community broadcasters under existing legislation.  Between 1975 and 1976 Australian federal politics was in turmoil -  the Whitlam Labour Government was dismissed by the Governor General and a caretaker Liberal  Government led by Malcom Fraser was given power.  The licensing of community broadcasters got caught up in this turmoil and a number of different stations were licensed by different Ministers in different ways.  The Minister for the Media for most of the Whitlam Government was McLelland who while  reasonably supportive of community broadcasting was not very active in making it happen.  In the dying days of the Whitlam Government a new Minister was appointed - Dr Moss Cass.  Toward the very end of the government he organised a licensing procedure for the the co-called 'Cass Dozen' of stations to be owned by educational organisations.  Around the same time two stations - one in Sydney(2CT) and one in Melbourne (3CR) were licensed as commercial stations not allowed to run advertising.  All in all it seems to have been a confusing period.  An interesting account of these times can be found in an article written by <a href="#thornley">Phoebe Thornley.</a>
<BR>
<BR>
In any case community broadcasting survived and even flourished under the Fraser Government due in no small part to the support received from Tony Staley - the Minister for Communications in the latter years of the Government.  The sector continued to grow through the 1980's  - a relative period of calm before a stormy period at the turn of the decade.  It was revealed that the PBAA - the sector peak body - was bankrupt.  Out of the wreckage was born a new organisation - to become known as the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia.
<BR>
<BR>
That organisation is still the peak body for the sector.  While most radio and television stations fall under the umbrella of the CBAA, several smaller organisations exist to represent stations of particular kinds.  These include the National Indigenous Media Association of Australia (NIMAA), the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasting Council (NEMBC), the Australian Council of Radio for the Print Handicapped (ACRPH), and the Australian Christian Broadcasters (ACB).  Other organsations and forums of importance include the Community Broadcasting Foundation (CBF) - a body charged with policy discussion and distribution of government funding to the sector, and the National Community Media Council (NCMC) - a forum attended by the different community representative bodies including those mentioned above.
<BR>
<BR>
Stations within the sector are now licensed through the Broadcasting Services Act (1992) - an act administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority.  As part of the requirements of the BSA the sector has developed codes of practice which form part of the license conditions of all community stations.  The radio sector has grown in several phases and is now made up of more than 130 licensed stations and around 80 aspirant stations hoping to gain licenses.  The Broadcasting Services Act brought several other changes - including a name change from public broadcasting to community broadcasting and the opportunity to develop community television.  

Community Television has been operating in Australia on a test basis since 1992.  Across Australia there is one television channel which has not (in most cases) been allocated to a commercial or national service.  This channel - the so called 'sixth channel' - has been allocated to community television trials through section 215 of the Broadcasting Services Act.  The Act will allow this to continue until mid 1997 when the channel will be awarded to a permanent user.  This still could be community television although there are competitors for the channel.  <a href="#ctv">The Australian Broadcasting Authority is conducting a review</a> of the best permanent use of the channel and will report to the government by late February.  In the meantime test licenses (actually open narrowcast licenses) have been awarded in the following areas: Adelaide, Perth/Mandurah, Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Lismore and Bendigo.  
<BR>
<BR>
The sector is also becoming involved in online services.  Twelve radio stations from the sector were involved in the recent Community Information Network project.  In the 1996 Federal Budget the government provided funding for two projects involving the sector in online services: the Community Access Network (CAN) and the Community Broadcasting Database.  You can read more about these projects <a href="#cbf">here.</a>
There has also been a move afoot to change the name of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia to the Community Media Association of Australia.  At the same times moves are also being made to change membership critieria for the sector to allow television members full rights.  In the longer term these changes may see the CMAA also representing some non-broadcast community media organisations.  However both of these measures are very controversial.  
<BR><BR>
So that's where we are in 1996.   This has been a very barebones outline of the development of the sector - resources for further reading are included within this page.<BR><BR><BR>

Freelance journalists often live life hard - trying to guess the interests of
different media outlets and needing to satisfy the whim of demanding editors,
usually for slim payments not reflecting the effort involved. But a special
award for freelancers helps give some recognition to those efforts.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Freelancers' efforts win recognition</H1>
<p>
<B>Freelance journalists often live life hard - trying to guess the interests of
different media outlets and needing to satisfy the whim of demanding editors,
usually for slim payments not reflecting the effort involved. But a special
award for freelancers helps give some recognition to those efforts. Peter
Cronau reports.</B>
<hr>
<p>
For the first time, the George Munster Award for Freelance Journalism has been
won by two journalists. The 1994 award has been shared by John Birmingham andMatthew Ricketson.<p>
John Birmingham's article, titled "Exit Wounds", appeared in Juice magazine in
November 1993. It described the lives of young Vietnamese in Cabramatta in
Sydney, and asked whether youth gangs really exist or are the product of media
hype.<p>
Matthew Ricketson's article, titled "A Lone Wolf", appeared in the December 11,
1993 issue of The Australian Magazine. The story provided a profile of
controversial right-wing Professor Geoffrey Blainey.<p>
The 1994 awards were announced to a gathering of journalists, friends and
colleagues of the late George Munster in December at the University of
Technology, Sydney. Media writer and winner of the inaugural Munster Award, Liz Fell, presented the $1,000 award which will be shared.<p>
The annual award, administered by the Australian Centre for Independent
Journalism, is open to journalists in either radio or print. It is awarded for
journalism which in the opinion of the judges is characterised by liveliness,
accuracy, independence, integrity and elegance of expression.<p>
The call for nominations for the award is advertised nationally after July each
year, and interested freelancers can get details and entry forms from the ACIJ
at that time. Entries can be either for a series of articles or radio programs,
or for a single outstanding article or program. "People involved in critical
investigative journalism should apply for this award," says a spokesperson for
the trustees of the award.<p>
The award came about 10 years ago when a group of George Munster's friends
decided to commemorate both his life and the outstanding contribution he made
to journalism by instituting an annual award for freelance journalism.<p>
George helped found the independent fortnightly magazine Nation in 1958, which
later merged into the Nation Review in 1972. In its time, Nation had set the
standard for a new generation of journalists to attempt to achieve.<p>
George later became an editor with publishers Angus and Robertson, where he
commissioned some of what have been described as "the most interesting
political books to be published in this country".<p>
In 1981 George reverted to writing, not within the structures of a big
publication but as a freelancer, working as a journalist and writer in both
print and radio. George Munster died in 1984 and his book, Rupert Murdoch: A
Paper Prince was published in 1986 by Viking Penguin Australia.<p>
After his death a tribute in the National Times stated, "George's contribution
to journalism in Australia, his life-long pursuit of the truth, his rejection
of cant in all its forms, his encouragement of other writers, his championing
of civil liberties, and his mastery of the art of intelligent gossip, will
leave a great gap in Australian life and letters."<p>
The award seems a fitting tribute to the man and his work.<p>

<H2>Guidelines for the 1996 Award</H2>


<H3>About George Munster</H3>

George Munster was a co-founder of the <B>Nation</B>, a fortnightly journal (later to become <B>Nation Review</B>), and a freelance editor, journalist and writer of books. He later became an editor with Angus and Robertson Publishers and reverted to freelance work both as a journalist and book writer.<P>

When George's book <B>Rupert Murdoch:  A Paper Prince</B> was launched in October 1985, a little over a year after his death, a number of his friends decided to commemorate his life and the outstanding contribution he made to journalism by instituting an annual award to a freelance journalist.<P>

<H3>The Award</H3><P>

The award is for the best article or series of articles in the print media in the twelve months to 31 July 1996 OR the best program or series of programs on radio in the twelve months prior to 31 July 1996. Applicants must have been ordinarily resident in Australia for no less than twelve months prior to 31 July 1996.<P>

<B>Closing Date:</B>   Applications must be received by 14 October 1996.<BR>
<B>Award:</B>   $1,000<P>

A "freelance journalist" for the purposes of this Award is a person who was not a full-time employee of the media at the time that the submitted material was published or broadcast. Persons who were tenured academics during the course of the twelve months to 31 July 1996 are not eligible to apply.<BR>

Applicants must forward an Application Form and it must be accompanied by FOUR COPIES of the article/s in the print media, or by FOUR COPIES of relevant tapes and transcripts in the case of radio applications. <P>

Applicants may apply directly, or may be nominated by other people, including the management and editors of the newspapers, magazines and radio stations.<P>

The judges in their discretion may make the Award to a person who has not been nominated or who has not applied - and they may make the Award either for a specific work or for the journalist's general contribution to freelance journalism. <P>

The Award will be made to the applicant whose material is considered by the judges to be most in the spirit of the journalism of George Munster himself, which was characterised by independence, integrity, accuracy and lucid and elegant prose.<P>

The Award Presentation will be made in November 1996.<P>

<head><title>Aboriginal deaths in custody - A dead issue?</title></head>
<H1>Aboriginal deaths in custody</H1>
<H2>A dead issue?</H2><p>
<p>
<B>Reporting of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues has shown some signs
of improvement. But mainstream media reporting of the failure of governments to
implement recommendations of the Royal Commission Aboriginal Deaths in Custody has been virtually non-existent.<p>
Wendy Bacon and Bonita Mason report how the media have failed to analyse why
the deaths are continuing.</B>
<p>
<p>
The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is in danger of becoming
a tragic farce. A fundamental objective of the Commission was that the number
of Aboriginal people imprisoned be rapidly reduced. Instead, more Aboriginal
people are being locked up and more are dying in Australian prisons. <p>
Key Aboriginal spokespersons have been warning for three years that there has
been little real change. Although politicians all claim to be doing everything
possible to reduce deaths in custody, many recommendations of the Commission
have not been implemented.<p>
Investigative media reports into deaths in custody, spurred by sustained
Aboriginal activism, played a role in bringing about the Royal Commission. And
in their report, the Royal Commissioners commented on the importance of the
media's role and made recommendations on how overall reporting of Indigenous
affairs might be improved. So it is timely to look at what role the media has
played in reporting on deaths in custody since the Commission.<p>
There has been passing media interest in the issue. But the coverage has been
based on isolated news events, such as the publication of official reports. The
full impact of what is happening remains hidden. There has been little in-depth
analysis or reporting of what is happening on the ground. The media has lapsed
into a passive, rather than an active role.<p>
A recent example of this is the media coverage of the Australian Institute of
Criminology (AIC) report - Deaths in Custody Australia, Australian Deaths in
Custody &amp; Custody-related Police Operations, 1993-94 released in March. The
report has become an annual event since been the Royal Commission gave the AIC
the task of monitoring, and regularly reporting on, Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander deaths in custody.<p>
Reportage has analysed the media coverage of the report's release. [See box on
page 21: The Coverage.] The Institute distributed a press release, along with
the report on which it was based, to the entire Canberra press gallery. On the
same day, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs also
released a press release drawing attention to the issue.<p>
The story was widely reported around Australia on March 2 and 3 most of the
major metropolitan newspapers and on ABC Radio. In some areas there was no
coverage.  As far as Reportage has been able to determine, there was also no
coverage on any television station or on commercial radio.<p>
The report's release was picked up by major metropolitan print and ABC radio
outlets around Australia but, overall, the coverage was brief, even cursory,
and often buried late in the paper. Reports were focussed on details; some
taking on the quality of a well-written list. <p>
The report contained devastating news for those concerned about the
implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations. It said that 14
Aboriginal people died in custody during 1993-94 - this is the highest figure
in the past four years and more than double the previous year's figure of six.
The report also said that deaths in police custody have gone down but that all
deaths in prison custody are at their highest level since figures were first
collected in 1980-81.<p>
According to the AIC "The central reason appears to lie in the increasing rates
of imprisonment of Australians in recent years. The more people are locked up,
the more people die in custody." The number of Aboriginal people imprisoned has increased by 50 per cent since 1988 and in some states it has more than
doubled.<p>
Adam Graycar, Director of the AIC, said in the report, "While the Aboriginal
population is less than two per cent of the total population, it comprises 16
per cent of the prison population and Aboriginal people account for 19 per cent
of deaths in prison custody. This unacceptably high incarceration rate of
Aboriginal people, combined with [a poor] health status, presents a truly
regrettable and preventable situation." <p>
The report concluded, "Key recommendations of the Royal Commission are either
not being fully implemented or, when they are, are not operating effectively.
In order to significantly reduce the number of deaths in custody, there is
clearly a need for strong action by all governments to implement the
recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and
to evaluate their effects on the frequency of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
people alike who die in custody." <p>
The Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, made a media
statement on the same day as the AIC report. In the release he said he found
the "gross over-representation" of Aboriginal people in custody disturbing and
that "State and Territory governments need to ensure reforms were enacted in
their area of direct responsibility for the criminal justice, police and prison
systems".<p>
While nearly all major metropolitan papers covered the release of the AIC
report, only four made a clear and direct link between the report of the deaths
and the failure to effectively implement the Royal Commission recommendations.
Six of the ten ignored Tickner's media release. As far as Reportage is aware,
no papers have followed up the story. <p>
The Cairns Post, the major daily newspaper servicing people in north-eastern
Australia, did not cover the story at all. [ For more on the Cairns Post's
coverage of Aboriginal affairs, see Reportage  issues Summer 93/94 and Winter
`94.]<p>
The AIC figures themselves were not fresh news. The 1993-94 figures had been
published in July last year in Jennifer Searcy's Deaths in Custody Newsletter.
The newsletter comprehensively and accurately monitors events relating to
deaths in custody and is widely distributed to news outlets who usually ignore
its contents. On that occasion the Searcy newsletter was only picked up by the
Sydney Morning Herald. <p>
Apart from reporting the official press release, there seems to be little
impetus within the media itself to independently follow up the numbers of
people dying in custody. The figures provided in the AIC report cover the year
to the end of June 1994 - nearly twelve months ago. At the time of going to
press, no media outlet has asked - what has happened since then? A quick phone
call to the AIC establishes that deaths in custody are continuing at the same
high rate this year. <p>
Another step, which journalists might have taken, is to have included a
response from an Indigenous spokesperson. The Royal Commission recommended more
contact between media and Aboriginal organisations and certainly there is no
shortage of organisations on the ground which could have been easily
interviewed: state-based deaths in custody watch committees, the Aboriginal
Legal Service, Aboriginal lands councils, or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Social Justice Commissioner at the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission, Mick Dodson.<p>
Dodson has recently taken up a number of public opportunities to criticise the
failure of governments in this area. He sees one of his most important roles as
independently scrutinising the implementation of the Royal Commission
recommendations in the Commonwealth area. <p>
In a speech to the Evatt Foundation in November last year, he said of the
Commonwealth's annual progress report on implementation: "It is virtually
unreadable, full of bureaucratic humbug, padding, self-justification and empire
defending. It is simply an account of bureaucratic activity which tells us
almost nothing about what impact, if any, bureaucratic activity is having on
the ground. In this account, the main point of many of the recommendations is
entirely missed. While not actually having the guts to say so, the Commonwealth
has clearly rejected many of the recommendations or regards them as `too
hard'." [our emphasis]<p>
Dodson, doesn't say the Royal Commission was a waste of time. "The broad
bi-partisan support for pursuing the recommendations of the Royal Commissions
was a watershed in Indigenous Affairs." But he also said: "There is a real
danger of it all being lost." <p>
Only four weeks after the AIC released their annual figures, Dodson's annual
report, devoting a whole chapter to the short comings of the Commonwealth's
annual report on the implementation of the Royal Commission, was released. <p>
"It is essential that all the vision, passion, urgency and the statesmanship
which he [Keating in his intitial June 1992 response] should not degenerate
into the bureacratic mishmash which marks this report. ... One is irrestibly
reminded of the sex life of elephants: much trumpeting, a lot of activity at a
high level and no outcome in three years." His scathing and again newsworthy
comments were highlighted in a press release but were not reported. <p>
Dodson's comments reflect the feeling on the ground. Ray Jackson of the New
South Wales Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Watch Committee says, "That they [the
Royal Commission's recommendations] have been implemented comes down to
semantics. What does implemented mean: the royal nod or day to day checking
that it's being done. We're arguing that they have to be utilised by the front
line troops - the police on the street, and in their cars, and custody
officers. They are not.<p>
"They have produced all these wonderful reports that float around at the
bureaucratic level but they're not getting down to the coal face - to the
people who should be putting them in place. Racism and lax attitudes are still
there - it's the whole culture. There needs to be a sea change, as they say."<p>
At the time of going to press, as far as Reportage is aware, there has been no
follow-up reporting of any of the many issues raised by the AIC report. One of
these is remand rates. According to the AIC, remand prisoners die at three and
a half times the rate that would be expected from their proportion of the
prison population. <p>
During 1993-94, one-third of custodial deaths were people on remand. Twelve per
cent of the prison population was on remand as at June 30, 1992 (the latest
available figures). These are people who have not been found guilty of any
crime. The Royal Commission made many recommendations designed to bring down
the number of people held on remand - to make arrest the "sanction of last
resort". <p>
The media could also ask questions about: the continuing rise in imprisonment
rates and the over-representation of Indigenous people in custody; why deaths
in police lock-ups have gone down while deaths in prison have gone up; why some
state governments agreed with but refuse to act on Royal Commission
recommendations to strike offences such as public drunkenness, offensive
language and vagrancy off the books.<p>
No media outlet has investigated why the number of Indigenous people dying
through illness in custody seems to be increasing. Most of the 1993-94
Indigenous deaths in custody were due to illness (10 out of 14) and half of the
deaths were caused by heart disease. <p>
Thirty-seven of the 99 deaths investigated by the Royal Commission were due to
illness,  just over one-third compared with over two-thirds in 1993-94. <p>
The Royal Commissioners found, "Generally, there appeared to be little
appreciation of and less dedication to the duty of care owed by custodial
officers to persons in custody. We found many system defects in relation to
care, many failures to exercise proper care and in general a poor standard of
care." Has anything changed? <p>
A reading of Searcy's Death in Custody Newsletter, which is the only
publication of its kind, suggests that poor medical care remains a crucial
issue. In her July 1994 edition, Searcy reported on the death of Janet Beetson,
an Aboriginal remand prisoner at Mulawa in New South Wales. Janet Beetson, who
died in June 1994, had cardio-vascular disease and a serious drug problem. <p>
According to Searcy, she arrived at the prison, "in an extremely poor condition
[and] was initially placed in the prison clinic but unfortunately was then
transferred to the Conlon [main prison] wing. She continued to deteriorate and
was taken back to the clinic where she died the next day." <p>
Searcy said in the newsletter that "sharp questions" should be asked about why
she was not taken to hospital immediately and treated for her serious illness.
(An inquest into this death will be held later this year.) <p>
She also told Reportage of the death of 37 year old Kim Nixon who died in a
Western Australian police cell in September last year. According to Searcy he
should not have been there. The court gave him a non-custodial sentence but he
was put back in the cells. Nixon had high blood pressure. After seeing him in
his cell, the Aboriginal Visitors Scheme appealed to the police to provide him
with proper medical attention. <p>
It is unfair to blame failures of the media to follow-up deaths in custody on
individual journalists. Part of the explanation for the lack of follow-up must
lie with management and editorial decisions which leave reporters  inadequate
resources, time and space to report on issues. <p>
Following Royal Commission recommendations for improving media coverage, a
conference on reporting Indigenous affairs was organised in Brisbane last year.
The conference which was attended by editors and other senior members of media
organisations developed guidelines for reporting. <p>
But as Dodson says "the national summit" created a "warm inner glow which was
then forgotten". He says he noticed a definite improvement in the coverage of
Indigenous affairs during the Native Title debate, " I thought the media was
pretty good but now they have slipped back."<p>
Concern is shared by some journalists. Jan Mayman is an experienced Western
Australian journalist who won a Gold Walkley award for her coverage of the John
Pat case. (John Pat was a 16 year old Aboriginal who died in a police cell in
Roebourne, Western Australia.)<p>
"As a journalist who worked hard to expose the issue of black cell deaths I am
profoundly disappointed that the media has not campaigned harder for
implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations.<p>
"I have covered many Royal Commissions and they seem to me to be simply a way
of defusing public anger and concern and exhausting critics of the government
by a process of legal attrition.<p>
"Sometimes they even conceal the truth by creating an illusion of action, when
the bureaucracies move along behind the scenes at their usual glacial pace."	<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The coverage of the report<p>
<p>
Reportage examined the 10 newspaper articles appearing in each of the capital
city newspapers on March 2 and 3 following the release of the latest Australian
Institute of Criminology report on deaths in custody.<p>
Six out of ten of the articles failed to emphasize the key point of the AIC
release which was: "The central reason [for the increase in Aboriginal deaths
in custody] appears to lie in the increasing rates of imprisonment of
Australians in recent years. The more people are locked up, the more die in
custody."<p>
Reports tended to mention the fact that imprisonment rates were increasing but
did not link this with the increasing number of deaths, instead focussing on
the detail of how people died - whether by hanging or heart disease, for
example - rather than why they died. <p>
Only four of the ten articles reported that both the Institute and the Minister
for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs expressed concern at the
failure to implement the key recommendationof the Royal Commission which was to
reduce the number of Indigenous people in prison. <p>
This point was completely missed by the report in the Australian which did
place the story prominently on page three with a photogragh. Its second
paragraph gave the opposite impression by stating, "Despite the implementation
of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in
Custody, indigenous Australians are still dying in custody, the report found."
[our emphasis]<p>
The Canberra Times and the Age were the only two papers to strongly emphasise
the link between the numbers of people in prison and the number of deaths and
Tickner's concern at lack of implementation of the Royal Commission
recommendations.<p>
A possible reason why the AIC report got little attention could be because
there was another major Aboriginal affairs story, the Land Fund Bill, running
at the same time. This was linked to the political drama of a possible
parliamentary dissolution.<p>
Does this suggest that while the overall coverage of Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander issues has increased, the press is unlikely to cover more than
one issue at the same time?<p>

<H1>DEATHS IN CUSTODY<BR>

A TIMELINE</H1><p>
<p>
Eight years after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths In Custody was
announced, and four years after it made its report, deaths in custody are
rising. Governments around the nation are failing to implement key
recommendations despite ongoing warnings and protests from Aboriginal
organisations and their supporters.<p>

<p>
<B>1983</B><p>
* The high number of Aboriginal deaths in police and prison custody is
highlighted by the brutal death of 16 year old John Pat, killed by police in
Western Australia. After five police are acquitted of manslaughter, the
Committee to Defend Black Rights (CDBR) is established and a campaign to stop
the Aboriginal deaths in custody commences.<p>
<p>
<B>1986</B><p>
* The Aboriginal-led CDBR builds a national campaign through lobbying,
protesting, and networking with Aboriginal and other organisations. As the
campaign gathers strength, a national tour by families of Aboriginal people who
have died in custody, calls on the Federal Government to hold a Royal
Commission.<p>
* Mainstream media attention is negligible with Aboriginal deaths in custody
rarely reported by more than a one sentence item in some newspapers. There is
however extensive reporting in alternative newspapers and community radio.<p>
<p>
<B>1987</B><p>
* Reports on the continuing deaths in custody finally begin to attract
attention of mainstream media outlets, like the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age
and ABC's Four Corners. <p>
* Following the deaths of seven young Aboriginal men in custody in a period of
six weeks, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Clyde Holding,
announces a Parliamentary Inquiry into Aboriginal deaths in custody.<p>
* A packed Sydney Town Hall meeting hears from relatives of Aborigines who have
died in custody. Helen Corbett, chairperson of CDBR, says, "A Federal Inquiry
... will not work towards a solution on a national level, as deaths in police
and prison custody are happening around Australia." The meeting supports the
establishment of a network of local Watch Committees to monitor the problem,
and calls for a Royal Commission to inquire into causes and solutions. <p>
* Aboriginal groups and their supporters draw up plans to use media attention
to Bicentennial celebrations in 1988 as a platform for showing Australia's
human rights record to the world. With CDBR's Helen Corbett in Geneva speaking
on Aboriginal deaths in custody to a UN meeting on human rights, the Federal
Government in October announces it would open a Royal Commission into
Aboriginal deaths in custody.<p>
<p>
<B>1988</B><p>
* The Royal Commission's interim report is released in December.<p>
<p>
<B>1991</B><p>
* The Royal Commission's final report is released in April.<p>
* The Royal Commission after examining 99 deaths of Aboriginal people between
1980 and 1989 makes 339 recommendations. A central objective of these
recommendations was to reduce the rate of aboriginal imprisonment. The
Commonwealth says it will spend $400 million over five years to implement the
report.<p>
<p>
<B>1992</B><p>
July <p>
* Amnesty International releases a report criticising the State and Federal
governments over lack of action in implementing the recommendations of the
Royal Commission. <p>
September <p>
* Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) reports that Aboriginal people are
jailed at 18 times the rate of non-Aboriginal people, with NSW and the NT
actually increasing their rate over the 12 months since the Royal Commission.
<p>
Helen Corbett, interviewed in alternative newspaper Broadside, says about the
implementation of the Royal Commission recommendations, "The political will is
not there. It's a question of state and federal governments showing to the
international community it is taking steps to rectify the situation. Their
interest is to promote themselves as doing something on the issue."<p>
<p>
<B>1993</B><p>
March<p>
* Amnesty International reports that imprisonment conditions for many
Indigenous people are "cruel and inhumane". The report condemns governments for
failing to implement the Royal Commission recommendations.<p>
April<p>
* The office of  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice
Commissioner is created within the Human Rights Commission partly as a response
to the Royal Commission into Deaths in Custody. Mick Dodson is appointed
Commissioner. <p>
November<p>
* Daniel Yock, an 18 year old Aboriginal man is arrested and carried by paddy
wagon to the Brisbane watchhouse. He dies on the way. Demonstrations by
Indigenous people bring deaths in custody back into the headlines for the first
time since the Royal Commission. <p>
December <p>
* A number of leading Aboriginal spokespeople are dissatisfied with the
implementation of recommendations of Royal Commission, reports the ACIJ's
multicultural newspaper, Voices.<p>
Particularly critical is the NSW Watch Committee's Ray Jackson who says "The
sum of $430 million has been spent and yet deaths in custody are still
continuing. In fact, there have been 52 deaths since May 31, 1989 and nothing's
changed".<p>
* In WA, the Aboriginal Legal Service in Perth reports that WA Government is
ignoring key recommendations of the Royal Commission. The study says that 43
per cent of the people sent to prison in Western Australia this year were
Aboriginal, although Aboriginal people comprised only about 2.5 per cent of the
state's population.<p>
<p>
<B>1994</B><p>
February <p>
* Australian Institute of Criminology reports a 40 per cent increase in deaths
in custody in 1992/93. Its report says that since the Royal Commission cut off
date in May 1989, 43 Aborigines and 225 non-Aborigines have died in custody.
"There is clearly a need for strong action by all governments to implement the
recommendations of the royal commission," it says. A total of 72 people died in
custody in 1992/93, compared with 57 and 58 in the two previous years.<p>
* The Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, releases the
first of the Government's annual reports into progress on reform .The report,
which examines 1992/93, finds that "the picture is not positive" on
imprisonment rates of Indigenous people.<p>
"The number of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in prison and
their imprisonment rates are increasing," it says. "Aborigines are still 14
times more likely to be imprisoned than non-indigenous Australians." <p>
The report finds that NSW, WA and SA have higher indigenous imprisonment rates
than the national average. It fails to mention that the number of people dying
in custody is not falling.<p>
Tickner refers the report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who begin an inquiry. <p>
April<p>
* The Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland finds the six police officers
who arrested Daniel Yock are not responsible for his death.<p>
June<p>
* Lawyer Chris Cunneen completes a report for the National Committee to Defend
Black Rights on 55 Indigenous deaths between 1989 and 1994. The report
concludes that many deaths would have been avoided if governments had acted on
Royal Commission recommendations. It finds 169 breaches of recommendations -
the most common is the recommendation that police services move immediately to
examine the delivery of medical serves to people in police custody.<p>
* Australian Institute of Criminology reports that the number of deaths in
custody has risen to its highest level since the 1991 Royal Commission report.
The number of deaths in police, prison and juvenile custody rose from 64 in
1991 and 65 in 1992, to 74 in 1993. <p>
Indigenous people who make up only one per cent of the population accounted for
11 per cent of the deaths. "This would appear to suggest that the
recommendations of the royal commission are either not being fully implemented
or, when they are, are not operating effectively," the report said. The report
notes that none of the deaths were in a police lock-up.<p>
* A new Deaths in Custody Watch Committee is formed in Western Australia.
Committee member and chairperson of the Human Rights Commission Ronald Wilson
says that in 1988 Aboriginal people were 43 times more likely than other people
to be in police custody. By 1992 the level has jumped to 60 times. He says only
30 of the 339 recommendations have been implemented in WA. In reply, the WA
Attorney General Cheryl Edwardes says the state's response has been "second to
none." The committee attacks her claim as a "gross misrepresenation of the
facts".<p>
September<p>
* Four people die in custody in Western Australia in 11 days. <p>
December<p>
* The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
affairs report Justice Under Scrutiny is critical of governments' failure to
involve Aboriginal people more in the implementing Royal Commission
recommendations and of  government reports which have "glossed over
deficiencies and not accurately portrayed the implementation process." It notes
that there has been "no substantial change" for Indigenous people as a result
of extra funds supplied by the Commonwealth.It warns that annual reporting by
government is in danger of becoming an "exercise in bureaucratic activity" and
that "without reforms being implemented, further deaths are inevitable". <p>
The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has three months to coordinate a
government response to the Justice Under Scruitiny report. <p>
* A few weeks later, and a year late, the Victorian Kennett government tables
its 1993 Implementation Report. The State Aboriginal Affairs Minister, John,
said the report was "an indication of the depth and breadth of action taken by
the State Government and Aboriginal community" in dealing with the
recommendations of the royal commission.<p>
But the Victorian Aboriginal Justice Advisory Committee's Wanda Braybrook says
the committee is very concerned by the increasing prison rate. "Aboriginal
people continue to be disadvantaged by their contact with the criminal justice
system, and ... to suffer at a greater rate than any other section of the
Victorian community," she said.<p>
<B>1995</B><p>
February<p>
*The Australian Institute of Criminology issues its report for 1993/4 which
shows deaths in custody are rising along with rates of imprisonment. <p>
*The deadline passes for Federal government to respond to the Justice under
Scrutiny report. According to the  Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander affairs it requires a detailed response which will not be available
until later in the year.<p>
March <p>
*Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson
releases his annual report. He describes the first Commonwealth Annual report
coordinated by the unit as a "self serving account of bureaucratic activity
designed to bury failure in a sea of words, reports and committee meetings
rather than expose it to public scrutiny and discussion. The report is a
monument to the worst tendencies of bureaucracy run wild." <p>

<H1>Framing the forests debate</H1>
<p>
<b>The battle for the forests of Australia is not only taking place in the logging camps and conservation zones. The press release and the media conference are also battle grounds. Sarah Ford reports.</b><p>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=5>W</FONT>hen seasoned environment reporter, Alan Tate, put a news story to air last August on ABC TV, he was prepared for the repercussions. It came as no surprise to him when the Forest Products Association (FPA) issued a press release stating that he was trying to destroy the timber industry.
<P>
His story on the release of internal documents that showed intensive logging practices had caused severe soil erosion in NSW's south-east forests would inevitably fuel the "forest war" between conservationist and industry groups.
<p>
What his report couldn't reveal was the behind-the-scenes battle that occurred while Tate was researching the story. He was pursued by both sides of the logging debate. One south-east conservation group even threatened him over the phone to treat the story the way they wanted it treated or they would spill the story to other media.
<p>
This may be one of the more extreme examples of how serious the situation has become in the fight for the forests. However, it is not an isolated case. Both sides are battling to win the hearts and minds of the media. Their number one target, the environment reporter, has become skilful in identifying and assessing their strategies.
<p>
While conservationists accuse the forest industry of emotionalism and vice versa, neither deny their use of emotions to gain coverage. The more emotive the issue, the better.
<p>
NSW Campaign Co-ordinator for The Wilderness Society, Tom McLoughlin, believes that a good story requires "emotional buttons pushed, like an Aboriginal or koala angle, which are very powerful symbols in their own right but also have a fashion about them".
<p>
What McLoughlin calls images of "terrible looking destruction shots" or "totem symbols" such as endangered koalas, seem to be central to the conservationists' campaign. The Daily Telegraph Mirror's environment reporter, Simon Benson,
believes this has given the conservationists the edge in the media war.<p>
In October the National Association of Forest Industries (NAFI) launched a $2
million advertising campaign to "confirm people's traditional love of wood
products". Of course, on the same day conservation groups announced that their
united forest campaign would intensify.<p>
NAFI is not shy about its motives. Its press release heralded, "The new
advertisements are highly emotive and feature a little girl's ultimate joy at
seeing her grandfather restore an old wooden rocking horse". According to
NAFI's media manager, Peter Russell, they intend to pursue this tactic that he
believes has guaranteed the conservationists "a good run with the media".<p>
Their previous campaign consisted of a classroom scene where children were
informed by their teacher about "forest facts". Russell thinks that using
children increases the emotional value.<p>
The Sydney Morning Herald's science and environment editor, Bob Beale, detests
the classroom scenario which he claims exploits two concepts; the child's
innocence, and parental concern for their children's future. <p>
He is equally critical of conservationists' exploitation of the rainforest
logging issue due to its emotive appeal. Meanwhile the not-so-lush forests west
of the Great Dividing Range are being cleared "without a squeak from the
greens".<p>
The recent battle over the logging of Wild Cattle Creek in north-east NSW
highlights this point. It received wide media coverage and is identified by the
North-East Forest Alliance as the largest stand of tall, wet, old growth forest
in the Dorrigo Plateau.<p>
NAFI's attempts to present the "forest facts" in their classroom commercials
have failed to impress Peter Jacklyn of Radio National's Earth Beat program. He
says the commercial grossly oversimplifies the situation with black and white
answers which are not true.<p>
"NAFI set themselves up as saying, `Look, it's all very complicated but this is
what's going on'."<p>
So, what indeed is going on in the forests? According to Jacklyn the impact of
logging on the environment is still a "massive unknown" that requires further
scientific research before the facts are determined. Ever since the logging of
native forests became an issue, both sides of the debate have espoused their
own interpretation of the "facts".<p>
When dealing with the media the scientific complexity of the debate is useful
in more ways than one.<p>
Alan Tate explains one of the industry's tactics to gain favourable media
coverage is to select journalists that are sympathetic or pliable and then use
science to confuse the issues that it presents to the journalist. This
technique may not be effective with the metropolitan media but he claims it is
successful particularly, and importantly, in the rural media where the
communities that are directly effected by the issues live.<p>
Some of the rural press printed the FPA's press release that attacked Tate.
FPA's NSW Executive Director, Colin Dorber, describes his relationship with the
rural media as "excellent". He says they publish almost everything he puts out
and he can depend on at least 12 interviews on country radio if he sends a
press release.<p>
The rural media also prints press releases issued by State Forests, the NSW
government body responsible for the seemingly contradictory tasks of both
supplying timber to the industry and conserving the state's forests.<p>
Their Corporate Affairs Manager, Teresa Mannix, says she uses the scientific
complexity of logging to minimise unfavourable media coverage. She says that
scientific detail is helpful in making a negative story seem as boring as
possible, particularly if it has the potential to receive metropolitan
coverage.<p>
"If you go into a lot of technical detail it just seems too hard. The story
just seems too difficult."<p>
The staff in the State Forests corporate affairs team boasts a list of
impressive credentials. Mannix, herself, won a Walkley award in her 10-year
journalism career. Add to this two other journalists, one a previous chief of
staff at the Daily Telegraph Mirror and the other a news director on commercial
radio with experience in TV production.<p>
Their expertise is matched by NAFI's Peter Russell whose achievements include
news presenter on Canberra's Capital TV, deputy manager of public relations for
the Department of Industrial Relations, and the director of public relations
with the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy.<p>
Such is the expertise required to control a thriving PR machine - a machine
thats exponential growth in the past five years has led one conservationist to
despair, "We've bred a monster".<p>
According to the executive officer of the Nature Conservation Council, Sid
Walker, this has been the one real success of the national forest protection
campaign. He believes that this PR phenomena has managed to undermine the
conservationists media campaign.<p>
In the hands of Russell, the forest industry's sophistication in dealing with
the logging issue is set to escalate along with the continuing injection of
millions of dollars. As the combat for coverage intensifies, PR power is
crucial to both sides.<p>
The NSW branch of the Wilderness Society meets regularly with journalists to
discuss their campaign issues. Tom McLoughlin explains that meeting in a social
context imprints in the journalists' mind that if he needs information these
are the people to talk to. "It's in the realm of a PR firm, I guess."<p>
The North-East Forest Alliance is increasingly using its own professional
camera crews to take footage of protests or arrests. Its director, John
Corkill, describes this as "direct market footage" which is supplied to the
media with a vision fee.<p>
Lobbying journalists via personal visits, letters, organised lunches and
offering exclusive stories are mutual tactics. Of these, exclusives top the
list of media-grabbing methods.<p>
The Sydney Morning Herald's Bob Beale describes how they work. If State Forests
knows that conservation groups are particularly concerned about an endangered
species it offers a journalist an exclusive with its top scientist who will
give information favourable to their cause The bonuses are two-fold. Coverage
of that organisation's perspective is guaranteed and the story is given
prominence because it is exclusive to that outlet.<p>
Paying for journalists to "go bush" and inspect a logging site is practised by
both State Forests and NAFI. In May last year State Forests held a "wildlife
school" in south-east NSW to teach loggers about the forests' inhabitants. In a
May 30 article, the Daily Telegraph Mirror's Frank Zeller wrote that he was
invited due to the government agency's eagerness "to dispel the perception that
loggers are environmental vandals".<p>
According to the article, State Forests seems to have accomplished this
mission. "[The loggers] could have passed for a bunch of new age-men bonding in
the wilderness had it not been for the hard hats they were wearing."<p>
Invitations to attend these funded trips don't always succeed. ABC Radio's
environment reporter, Nonee Walsh, sees no value in accepting such an
invitation because she claims it is naturally going to be a display of only
their best logging operations.<p>
Conservation groups lack financial resources to attract the media in a similar
fashion. They attempt to gain free publicity by inundating journalists with
press releases updating them on the latest "logging horrors", protests and
hunger strikes.<p>
Walsh says that protests, the conservationists' trademark tactic, are
considered mundane by the media.<p>
"It's kind of like a joke we have around here about traffic accident police
reporting: Just change the name, place and how many injuries there are. It's a
format where you can just fill in the blanks."<p>
Corkill agrees that protests are alienating to the metropolitan media who see
them as semi-theatrical and predictable. <p>
Equally predictable is the forest industry's presentation of the logging issue
as "jobs versus forests". Walsh says a typical argument is that logging is
vital to the economy of a town, despite it only employing 40 people and all the
profits going to the industry companies. <p>
"Their major fall down is that they try `con jobs' too often," she says. Walsh
claims to have a better relationship with conservation groups because she
trusts them more. She is backed by Peter Jacklyn who claims that when
discussing the complex scientific arguments he considers conservationists'
views to be closer to his appreciation of the situation.<p>
According to Colin Dorber, "It's a cultural problem that by instinct,
journalists are not going to trust anyone in business."<p>
After Alan Tate's experience he's not inclined to trust either side. He avows
that there is no industry group tougher than the FPA in their response to
journalists seeking to cover the logging issue. Nor does he ever again want to
deal with the conservation group that expected him to "parrot" their story. On
this occasion, both sides lost the battle.<p>

<H1>Secretly speaking: <BR></H1>
<H2>The ASIS Inquiry transcripts</H2>
<HR>

<B>Reportage has recently had a peek at some documents from the Samuels Commission of Inquiry into ASIS. Not that they were secret documents, mind you, sanitised would be a better word for them.</B><p>
<p>
Although we were told originally that the transcripts of testimony by
representatives of the media were due for release in October, their release was
held up until February so that their contents could be "cleared". <p>

Secretary to the Inquiry, Barbara Belcher, said that consideration had been
given to noting on the transcripts where cuts had been made, the magnitude of
the cut, and by whose insistence the cuts were made, but it was decided not to
do so as it would have been too much work.
<p>
The transcripts represent the only material to be released by the Inquiry other
than the slim public report just issued.
<p>
Much of the Inquiry's questioning of the media representatives was on, as
Commissioner Samuels put it, "how one can achieve a balance, an optimum
balance, between the requirements of national security and the public interest
in the free passage and conveyance of information and opinion".
<p>
One aspect under examination was the government's D Notice system for getting
the voluntary agreement by the media not to publish certain information about
ASIS. The Inquiry requested the attendance of several of the country's top
journalists and media representatives.
<p>
The fat packet of "edited" transcripts of the media people who attended the
Inquiry makes for dedicated reading. So in the interests of public debate we
present the edited highlights for your reading pleasure.<p>
As we go to press, legal sanctions on the media's reporting of the activities
of ASIS seem to be only a matter of time if the recommendations of the Samuels
Commission of Inquiry into ASIS are followed. A recommendation was slipped past
the noses of most in the media when the public version of the Final Report was
handed down in early April. <p>
Samuels recommended that the recommendations of the 1991 Gibbs Report be
implemented. The Gibbs Committee which conducted a review of Commonwealth
Criminal Law had concluded that there is an offence where there is publication
by a third party recipient of information in certain specified circumstances.
This means that not only government officers who leak to the media, but also
the journalists who report the information, would be subject to prison terms of
up to seven years.<p>
In our next issue, we will carry a detailed report of this looming threat to
journalists and free expression in Australia.<p>

Editor of the Age.<p></B>

On the D Notice system:<p>
"We do recognise the need to protect the activities of ASIS and intelligence
services and to protect currently serving members of ASIS. We recognise the
point of the D Notices and the national interest that's involved in that. We
think that is the way to go. ... Just to put it into context of our philosophy
in general, we would regard all truthful publications in the public interest.
As a newspaper our job and our aim really is to publish everything that we can
that's truthful. However, we are bound by a set of limitations, one of which is
defamation, one of which is contempt, and another I'd say is bad taste, another
is statutory restrictions and another is D Notices."<p>
On whether he would seek advice from someone in the Minister's office or from
the D Notice committee to avoid revealing a current ASIS operation and so break
the D Notice:<p>
"I think we would. ... It would depend on who it was. It would depend on the
status of the person concerned."<p>
On Commissioner Samuels' suggestion of a criminal penalty to prevent
publication of a current ASIS agent's name:<p>
"We have voluntarily agreed, and continue to voluntarily agree, not to identify
ASIS agents. So we'd say the only reason then to put that into law would be
that the Government doesn't trust us to keep our word.<p>
"I would urge the commission to take into account the D Notice system and I
would urge the commission to take into account that [it] really has not been
given a fair go and if the media and the government co-operate and resurrect
the D Notice committee then the chances of publication contrary to the D Notice
would be reduced significantly. Therefore I think before we jump to the
conclusion that we should have any criminal type sanctions, as in the ASIO Act
or the Crimes Act, we really should give the D Notice system in Australia a
fair go."<p>
On what level of checking of a journalist's story is practicable:<p>
"I think there would be problems if we were ringing up people that the reporter
had rung to check on the reporter. I think that there'd be grave difficulties
in that. ...<p>
"I think that we employ journalists because they are trustworthy. Any
journalist that needs to have that kind of checking up on facts shouldn't be on
the paper. Before I instituted a system like that in respect of any particular
journalist, where we had to ring up and check their sources, I'd sack them."<p>

<B>Michelle Grattan<BR>
Then-editor of the Canberra Times<p></B>
<p>
On whether she considers the possible damage to foreign relations with a
country, which can follow from disclosure that an ASIS operation is going on in
that country:<p>
"It is a matter of argument in many cases whether foreign relations have been
damaged.<p>
"Also governments are, in the normal course of events, quite likely to say,
"All this will damage foreign relations", when really the government that is at
the other end is rather more robust. Or that is a convenient argument for a
government under fire about a particular matter that has come out that is
embarrassing to it to run.<p>
"The final point I would make about this is that the conduct of good foreign
relations is a matter for government. It is not necessarily a matter for the
media which is primarily about pursuing information and interpreting and
analysing information for the public....It may act as a bit of a curb on
Governments."<p>
On whether she sees a public interest in publishing information about ASIS
"paying a stipend" to a foreign politician for information:<p>
"One consideration is how an organisation operates and we, as Australian
citizens, obviously have a general set of values about how Governments and
Government instrumentalities operate. If we found that Telecom was paying a
local politician to get favours for it, we would say this is outlandish and
outrageous and this would be a huge story. ...<p>
"So therefore you have to say, do those same sort of politico-moral
considerations, if you like, apply to the country's foreign spying service? Now
probably most of us would say "No", but all I am saying is that that has to be
a question that has to be asked by people who are making judgement about a spy
service.<p>
"At some point between the paying of a bribe and the murdering of people we say
enough is enough and, no, the end does not justify the means. It is not
acceptable to us to have a spy service that will do anything anywhere."<p>
On whether she would be inhibited from publishing a story because Foreign
Minister Gareth Evans advised her that it  "will endanger people":<p>
"Well, it might or it might not. It would depend on how important the story
was, the extent to which it was running generally, whether I guess, too, the
person putting the argument had a convincing case. ...<p>
"I think you would want to be convinced in your own mind that this was a
genuine argument and that it was not an argument that was just based on the
politics of the situation or whatever. ...<p>
"One could equally from the point of logic say that the failure to print the
truth is continuing to endanger people that are already endangered."<p>
On agreeing she would seek the advice of an ASIS media liaison officer should
one be appointed, expressing a note of caution:<p>
"It seems to me that over many years the people dealing with the media from the
Foreign Affairs Department have had ... a lot of influence in how the media saw
certain aspects of foreign policy because they were very skilled and credible
people."<p>
On why she did not insist that one of her reporters attend the Inquiry after he
declined the Inquiry's request to attend [Several reporters had declined to
attend for fear the Inquiry was attempting to discover their sources for
stories]:<p>
"We have touched a number of times on sources. Obviously sources are a
sensitive matter. There have been some statements that the commission was not
interested in pursuing sources. [But] there had been some questions which
perhaps suggested that some of the discussion was interested in sources."<p>
On what she sees as the effective operation of the present D Notice system:<p>
"It is important for the process of government, the process of good government
and good administration, that there be some public light shed on matters when
they go wrong. Despite the temporary embarrassments to governments - and
governments come and go - despite that, it is better in the long run for good
public administration, for good government and for proper conduct of the
country that the media be able to report relatively freely, that the restraints
that they accept in this area are voluntary restraints."<p>
On the proposal to extend the D Notice system to prevent publishing stories on
the past operations of ASIS:<p>
"If you go to covering the disclosure of past operations ... you are finding a
way to cover up things that often will be in the national interest to
disclose."<p>
<p>
<HR>

<B>Jack Waterford<BR>
Then-deputy editor Canberra Times<p></B>
<p>
On the Inquiry's denial it was looking for journalists' sources, following its
request to see a Canberra Times journalist's original notes of an ASIS story:<p>
"The subpoena to produce documents clearly indicated a search for sources. It
asked for notebooks and other such materials. ...In fact it seemed to me that a
clear focus of the thing was designed to, by asking for original note material
and various things like that, to seek out sources. ... It is a largely
hypothetical question, sir, because there are in fact no notes of original
materials that any longer exist or have existed for any time."<p>
On ASIS briefing editors:<p>
"Normally when people do get appointed to senior positions, it is not at all
unusual for officials from government departments to ring up and offer to have
a chat about this, that, usually to lobby their agency's point of view or
something like that."<p>
<p>
<HR>
<B>Peter Harvey<BR>
News director for the Nine Network's Canberra bureau.<p></B>
<p>
On why his news organisation accepts the voluntary D Notice system:<p>
"Well, first and foremost, I suppose, of course, we are concerned about
national security. Secondly, I believe our philosophy is such that operating on
a voluntary basis is preferable to operating under a system of proscription."<p>
On how he would satisfy himself that disclosure of a past action of ASIS would
not lead to disclosure of current activity, as required by D-Notice 4:<p>
"I would go to Gareth Evans' office and I'd probably go to the
Attorney-General's office. If the issue was of an even graver nature I'd go and
see somebody like Geoff Walsh in Keating's office and say, `We have this
information. This is what we've been told. It's obviously extremely serious.
I'd like to know if it's true, if you can say anything about it'."<p>
On whether he sees any problems in consulting with government on such
stories:<p>
"I can't conceive of how I would have in any given set of circumstances the
knowledge of the issue that the government of the day would have. And of course
all of this assumes that the government is going to tell me the truth, or not
mislead and lie to me, and I accept that by and large that's the case, that I
would not be lied to or misled by ministers on issues of that sort of grave
import that I'm certainly imagining at the moment."<p>
<p>
<HR>

<B>David Hill<BR>
Then-managing director of the ABC<p></B>
<p>
On whether the ABC would consult with the government over programs on security
matters:<p>
"The formal position is, we don't want any further restrictions and we don't
want a mechanism of consultation before programs go to air."<p>
On D Notices versus the public's right to know:<p>
"I think a preference, certainly at the program production level is there are
no D Notices. We've lived with this one and we'd be very cautious and concerned
about any change, because I suspect any change would be wanting to strengthen
the D Notice. ...<p>
"I think the view is that if we had any information of public interest, or
information that the public is interested in, we should publish it unless there
is good reason why not. ...<p>
"I don't think there would be a gratuitous publication if ... we we're
satisfied there was no endangering of life and it was a flow of information I
don't think we'd be broadcasting it for the sake of it. I think that even in
the absence of a D Notice there is some responsibility and some sensitivity.
And it would come down to whether or not it was of news value."<p>
On the UK system of contact points in the security services for the media: <p>
"From my experience the relationship with the BBC and British intelligence
agencies is quite unhealthy, and I would hate to think the ABC ---"<p>
Commissioner Samuels: "You mean it is too close or ---"<p>
Hill: "Too close. Too close. In fact I was intrigued to read in Alastair
Milne's autobiography, called DG for Director General, he said that one of his
achievements was that no longer did as many BBC journalists require security
clearance before being recruited by the BBC."<p>
Samuels: "I do not think that can be said of certain print media?"<p>
Hill: "Or the ABC."<p>
<p>
<HR>

<B>Dennis Grant<BR>
Channel 7 news bureau chief<p></B>
<p>
On the media's relationship with ASIS:<p>
"I suppose the relationship is always going to be prickly between those of us
whose job it is to live in utterly transparent houses and cities, where
everything is open in the outside world, dealing with a culture where
everything is closed to the outside world. <p>
On the D Notice:<p>
"I think this is a very mature voluntary system. Of course there will be
arguments along the way, but to codify it, to draw a legislature, a mandatory
line along what governments believe their citizens should see and hear and
know, I think this is a regressive step."<p>
On checking a sensitive story with the Minister for Foreign Affairs:<p>
"Well I have to say to you that in my 12 years in the Press Gallery, a good way
to kill off a story is to ask the Minister's office for comment. It may be a
benign story, something that is actually in their interest to have out, some
worthy piece of information. But in my experience many of those who work in the
Minister's office are there solely for the preservation of that Minister and
the wider implications and interests of the public are given scant regard."<p>
On media scepticism of intelligence services:<p>
"To be an investigative journalist, by definition, there has got to be
something deep and dark to investigate. I think the culture of Australian
society, but particularly its journalism, in the 70s and 80s, was that of
distrust. I mean I don't think we had a very mature or sensible attitude
towards authority. ... I think we overstated our mistrust and as a consequence
we did a disservice to many of our officials and organisations. I'd like to
think that that is not the case any more. But at the same time, there will
always be a professional suspicion and scepticism that is part of a
journalist's armoury."<p>
<p>
<HR>

<B>Paul Kelly<BR>
Editor-in-chief of the Australian<p></B>
<p>
On the D Notice system possibly being reinvigorated:<p>
"I think it would be correct to say that the media and also the wider community
would think that the national security requirements are less than they used to
be, say, during the period of the Cold War for example, and therefore I think
the media would probably look with more scepticism and more scrutiny at any
reactivation of the D Notice system."<p>
On whether journalists are expected to disclose sources to their editor:<p>
"If I feel I need to know the name of a source from a journalist I will ask.
That's the rule, you know, on which I operate across the board. I mean, if a
story is sufficiently sensitive that I feel I need to know the source, then I
will ask, and I will expect to be told."<p>
On the usefulness of an ASIS Information Officer:<p>
"I guess the question is how credible it would be. I mean, ASIS is a secret
organisation which doesn't want to see anything about its affairs published,
presumably, so the question would be the credibility of such a party in ASIS.
How confident could the media be that such a party in ASIS would be making an
assessment only on the grounds of whether or not publication was going to
damage an ASIS operative or a current operation, as distinct from whether or
not ASIS was going to be embarrassed by such a story being published?<p>
On the possibility of a legislative basis for ASIS, an ASIS Act:<p>
"It seems to me that this is then an invitation to the parliament to meet its
responsibilities in relation to ASIS but the difficulty is that when you look
at the actual operational requirements of ASIS I think a lot of people would
argue that the nature of the organisation is to some extent fundamentally
incompatible with parliament having such a role. So we come back to the central
conundrum again of national security versus the public interest."<p>

<head><title>Manufacturing Dissent: Noam Chomsky on journalism</title></head>
<H1>Manufacturing Dissent:</H1>
 <H2>Noam Chomsky on journalism</H2>
<B>Noam Chomsky has described a world where an underlying consensus structures the news media to manage public opinion. However Chomsky says there is scope for individual journalists to resist these trends. Peter Cronau spoke with Chomsky during his recent visit to Australia.</B>
<hr>
He has been described as "the world's greatest dissident" and "arguably the
most important intellectual alive today". Professor Noam Chomsky, the softly
spoken Professor of Linguistics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Boston USA, delivers an analysis of the media that makes many
uncomfortable.<p>
From his young days selling newspapers on his uncle's news-stand in New York,
Chomsky has now become reportedly the world's most quoted intellectual.<p>
As well as giving his scathing critique of Western foreign policy and media
performance, Chomsky is of course also famous for his (then) revolutionary
theories on the origins of language, that language is wired-in at birth.<p>
Australia's Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, who has come in for
stinging criticism from Chomsky for his obsequious attitude to Indonesia, is on
the record as saying he thinks Chomsky "should confine himself to linguistics".
<p>
Chomsky's move to `dissident voice' occurred in 1964 during the Vietnam War,
and since then he has written and spoken out about injustice and repression
around the world. His many books include The Washington Connection and Third
World Fascism, American Power and the New Mandarins, For Reasons of State,
Fateful Triangle: The US, Israel and Palestine, Towards a New Cold War, The
Culture of Terrorism, Manufacturing Consent, Deterring Democracy, and Year 501:
The Conquest Continues.<p>
In January, Chomsky made his first visit to Australia. In eight days he
addressed ten sell-out audiences on topics as varied as human rights and East
Timor, democracy and the New World Order, the Middle East, the intellectual
responsibility of writers, through to linguistics.<p>
Chomsky views the media as an ideological system serving the powerful elites in
society. He explains how governments get away with lying, how academics and
intellectuals manufacture consent to the actions of government, and how the
media confine debate to the conservative middle ground.<p>
Chomsky argues the Western media have neglected their questioning role, instead
repeatedly giving primary access to intellectuals who defend the role of
Western governments. He sees the media's role as producing consensus amongst
the public towards the ruling elites in government and business.<p>
"The [media's] current mission is to ensure that any thought of controlling
their destiny must be driven from the minds of the rascal multitude," he has
written in, Year 501: The Conquest Continues. And, in Deterring Democracy, he
writes: "The goal is to eliminate public meddling in policy formation".<p>
Probably Chomsky's most known book in this country is Manufacturing Consent:
the political economy of the mass media, which he wrote in 1988 with Edward
Herman, a professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania.<p>
The Propaganda Model sketched out in this book describes the structures and
influences that Chomsky believes produce systematic propaganda in the media.<p>
"It traces the routes by which money and power are able to filter out the news
fit to print, marginalise dissent, and allow government and dominant private
interests to get their messages across to the public."<p>
The model puts forward five filters on our news:<p>
* The size, concentrated ownership, owner wealth and profit orientation of the
dominant media outlets;<p>
* Advertising as the primary source of income for most media;<p>
* The reliance of the media on information provided by government, business,
and `experts' funded and approved by these primary sources and agents of
power;<p>
* `Flak' - criticism by the powerful of negative media statements - used as a
means of disciplining the media;<p>
* Control mechanisms of `anticommunism', `muslim fundamentalism', and so on.<p>
Chomsky (and Herman) don't try to suggest some conspiracy theory at work in
setting the media agenda, but mainly a form of self-censorship at work. <p>
"Most biased choices in the media arise from the preselection of right-thinking
people, internalised preconceptions, and the adaptation of personnel to the
constraints of ownership, organisation, market, and political power," they
write in Manufacturing Consent.<p>
While the propaganda model describes a global system that results in the
ignoring or suppression of voices of dissent, Chomsky does not argue that it is
an all-encompassing theory. Reportage asked whether the model allows scope for
journalists wanting to remain independent and to avoid becoming a mouthpiece
for the ruling elites.<p>
"It's intended to pick out major factors that frame the way an institution
functions," says Chomsky. "Now as any scientist knows you start a rational
inquiry by trying to identify the major factors and then there's a whole set of
secondary and tertiary factors that interfere. If you really look down into the
details you'll find all sorts of other things going on. I'll mention one which
is known to any serious investigative journalist, and a lot of them use it. <p>
"There are periodic scandals - meaning some horrible thing that happened by
accident escapes, that's called a scandal - and the media feeders have to
pretend to be very irate: how can our democracy survive etcetera etcetera. <p>
"It is well known among serious journalists that after a major scandal, like
say Watergate or Iran-Contra or something, there is a period of a couple of
months when the media tend to be more open. And then you can sneak in the
stories that you've been storing up. <p>
"So if you take a close look at the media you'll discover that the really smart
reporters often are coming out with things in that window of opportunity that
opens up in reaction to the scandal. <p>
"On top of that there is just plenty of people with integrity and who are
really working hard to stretch the limits, and sometimes they get things
through."<p>
Chomsky describes a good friend of his who is a leading television reporter for
ABC News in the United States. The journalist, Charles Glass, is a specialist
on the Middle East. Chomsky heard about a story he was working on when they
shared a cross-Atlantic flight. <p>
"He'd been working hard to find out something on the Iraqi biological warfare
capacities. They were being denied in the United States, because Saddam Hussein
was a big friend so it was denied that this was going on. This was a couple of
months before the invasion of Kuwait."<p>
Glass had discovered the information through some high level Iraqi leaks, and
by examining material from French commercial satellites - something US spy
satellites would have also discovered.. "He had put together a solid story and
the American ABC was willing to allow him to run it.<p>
"He got to New York and went on television and had his two minutes," says
Chomsky.<p>
"Then ABC News immediately shifted to their correspondent in Washington, some
big shot who interviewed a Pentagon official, who said, no nothing of this sort
was happening. Of course it was true but it wasn't the right story at the time.
<p>
"If you happened to be watching televison from the outside it would look like
some reporter went off on a loose end, and dug up some nutty stuff, but serious
people deny it. <p>
"But if you were paying attention [you] would probably say that was true
otherwise they wouldn't be bothered denying it that promptly. And besides it
makes perfect sense anyway after the gassings and so on, and of course it was
true.<p>
"Well those are ways in which material leaks through thanks to the integrity of
particular people."<p>
So, Chomsky says, there are all sorts of complexities, but still the major
factors of the Propaganda Model are demonstrated to be correct. "In fact the
bulk of that book is documentation of the way it worked in particular and
dramatic cases. As far as I know it is the best established thesis of the
social sciences by a long shot, that factors like these determine the media
product."<p>
In Manufacturing Consent, Chomsky argues that the media establishes and defends
the agenda of the dominant privileged groups in society. "The media serve this
purpose in many ways: through selection of topics, distribution of concerns,
framing of issues, filtering of information, emphasis and tone, and by keeping
debate within the bounds of acceptable premises."<p>
But Chomsky believes journalists can try to do things differently.<p>
"There's plenty of opportunities to do very good work," says Chomsky. "Take say
Brian Toohey, he gets things through. There's plenty of other people. <p>
"There's going to be strains, and you'll be pressing against limits. If you go
too far they'll turn you off; if you keep at it too much you may be thrown out.
But within that framework there are plenty of things to do. <p>
"Actually academic scholarship isn't all that different. If people start
breaking out of the expected framework - if they are esoteric enough it may not
matter - but if they are anywhere near issues of policy of power, they may find
themselves in trouble. <p>
"I know plenty of journalists who've been told look you're getting too
emotional why don't you take off a bit of time and go to the metro desk and
work on that sort of thing. <p>
"The famous case in the United States, Ray Bonner, who was a freelance
journalist, was working for the Times. They didn't have any journalist in El
Salvador in the early 80s, and he's a good serious honest journalist - no
special training, but afterall what's it take?<p>
"He discovered a huge massacre, and the State Department denied it. Of course
it's completely true - we know by now exactly it was true - and the Times
pulled him out. They claimed that they pulled him out because he needed more
experience.<p>
"So they sent him off to the financial desk where he'd kind of really learn the
trade of being a journalist. He's no fool and he just quit after a while."<p>
Chomsky says there are many examples of journalists' efforts being stymied,
particularly in reporting matters from the US's immediate region. "The first
major massacre in El Salvador happened to be in May in 1980 under Carter. It
was a crucial moment when the land reform was starting and the government
wanted to make sure that everybody got the idea - there's going to be formal
land reform but don't lift your head. <p>
"So they carried out a huge massacre. It was actually a joint operation of the
Salvadorans and the Honduran Armies."<p>
Chomsky believes the action was co-ordinated by the United States. "It's called
the Rio Sumpul massacre," he says. "One big massacre, and maybe 600 people,
women and children, were slaughtered."<p>
There were plenty of witnesses to the events, says Chomsky, including local
people and priests. It received brief coverage in the international media. "A
very good British journalist David Blundy, who's since died, he reported it in
the Times," Chomsky says.<p>
"In the United States, it still has not been mentioned. I mean I've written
about it, but it has not been mentioned. That's the first big massacre
co-ordinated action of the two armies that were anything but friendly which
suggests something. And it is not mentioned. <p>
"The UN Truth Commission report just released a study of it and it included it,
and then it got like a line somewhere, but that's it. This happens all the
time. Wrong story, totally wrong story."<p>
There's some even more dramatic cases," says Chomsky. "In Cambodia, which
people pretend that they are concerned about, US bombing started around `69. By
1971 about a third of the population were already refugees, according to US
government sources, so who knows what happened. <p>
"Doubtless tens of thousands of people were killed. By 1973 there were over a
million refugees in Phnom Penh. Then the serious bombing started. The peak
bombing was early `73 through late `73. <p>
"There were plenty of reporters in Phnom Penh including the ones like Sydney
Schanberg who's considered the conscience of the press, you know a big hero. He
was the Times reporter there. <p>
"I went through all of his reporting - it's in Manufacturing Consent. ... Sort
of like [William] Shawcross and the Timorese."<p>
In Chomsky's 1993 book Year 501, he describes Shawcross explaining that East
Timor failed to get the extent of coverage as did Cambodia due to "a
comparative lack of sources".<p>
"What happened in the early half of the decade is virtually unknown. What
happened in the latter half of the decade is the main focus of inquiry because
you can blame it on someone else. The CIA which wouldn't be likely to
underestimate it, estimates in its demographic study, 600,000 killed in the
first half of the decade. So it's not small whatever it was. <p>
"Try to find out something about it and the reason nothing is known is because
the journalists refused to report it. They wouldn't talk to the refugees.<p>
"Actually it is even more nuanced if you look at it closely. There was one
atrocity which was reported. In fact if you saw the film, The Killing Fields,
it starts off with an American atrocity - they bombed a village. <p>
"And that one was reported for three solid days. Shocked Schanbergs went out
there, why? They hit the wrong village. It was a mistake. You know they were
aiming at some other village. So therefore you could report it within the
framework: `you were allowed to make mistakes'. <p>
"So yes, that was graphically reported, with the torn up bodies: `Isn't it
awful we made a mistake'. How about the times we didn't make a mistake? You
know that we don't report it. <p>
"If you internalise these values you can make it in the media. If you don't
like those values and you report one of the other ones, you'll get cut off
somewhere along the line."<p>
Some media theorists, such as Stuart Hall, refer more to the structures of news
production such as the professional demands on journalists for impartiality,
balance and objectivity as the cause of over-accessing to the media of those in
powerful and privileged institutional positions. Fact and opinion become
distinguished not by the journalist but by their `accredited sources'.<p>
But Chomsky believes that those professional qualities in journalists need not
necessarily lead to over-accessing of the social realities of the powerful. He
thinks that it is possible for journalists to remain independent while working
according to professional standards.<p>
"Yes I do. Here I disagree with a lot of my friends. I think objectivity and
impartiality are goals that one can try to achieve," says Chomsky."You're not
going to achieve them. You know you always have too many biases and
preconditions and so on. But you try to become aware of them. <p>
"It's just like science. You can't do scientific work without preconceptions of
what you expect to find and so on, but if you are rational at least you try to
be conscious of them and hold them up to inquiry, willingly to give them up. <p>
"But objectivity is a goal to which you can strive, knowing perfectly well that
there's many factors that are going to prevent you from succeeding.<p>
"Some of the best journalists I know of - I don't know them personally - are
people that think they are either apolitical or politically pretty reactionary,
but just very good at telling you what's there."<p>
The alternative press is also at times guilty of partisan reporting, of blindly
repeating statements. Chomsky says that such reporting can be "very distorted".
"Some of the best reporting around is in journals like the Wall Street Journal
and the Financial Times of London. They have professional reporting."<p>
The reason that governments manipulate the media and lie to their publics is
because of their fear of what the public may do with knowledge about what is
really going on around them, argues Chomsky. He says that with East Timor, the US and Australian governments have tried to keep secret the truth of events there.<p>
"They are afraid they can't keep their own public in check," he says.<p>
"Take the United States which has played the decisive role. It's not playing
the decisive role any more; it's backing off. It's not that they got to be nice
people. There's just enough pressure. And the pressure is interesting, it's not
from the left. <p>
"So a lot of the strongest opponents of the US involvement here happen to very
rightwing people who it's been brought to their attention. And they don't like
it, but they're human beings. <p>
"It's been brought to their attention not because they read it in the New York
Times. It was brought to their attention by activists and the church, and
public efforts, pressure groups etcetera."<p>
Chomsky says there is no shortage of examples of this.<p>
"The first major story, really good story in the US media on East Timor, the
first accurate story, and to this day one of the best anywhere, happened to be
in the Boston Globe [Chomsky's home-town paper].<p>
The way it came about was this: The Boston Globe ran one of these standard
State Department handouts, you know, full of lies and so on. And I wrote a
letter to the editor of the Sunday section, and I told him this is all lies,
you shouldn't publish that kind of stuff. <p>
"He wrote me back and he called me, he didn't believe a word I said. And he
said `well can you prove anything you said', and I said `sure I can do it, but
why believe me. Why don't you get one of your reporters to look into it?'. <p>
"So he did, and it was good that he picked a local reporter. He didn't pick an
international correspondent. He picked some local guy who worked out of the
police court - a guy whose instincts are those of a journalist, to tell the
truth. <p>
"The guy didn't have very much international experience, but he was just a very
honest local reporter - there are plenty of people like that. He called me and
asked me what I knew. I gave him what I knew and I told him contacts. But I
told him not to pay too much attention to them. You know, just write. Why
should he pay attention to me? <p>
"He followed it up. He dug all kinds of stuff. He got this guy in the State
Department who'd been kicked off the Indonesia Desk because he was protesting
internally and then started leaking stuff to him, all kind of things. And he
wrote a terrific story. It's the first real story that came out. <p>
"Well that kind of thing can happen," says Chomsky. All of these are little
pieces of something. Everytime that one of these things happens, it lays the
basis for the next thing.<p>
"The same is true with the New York Times I should say. I can trace out in
precise detail how they got to the point of starting to report East Timor. <p>
"These things add up. It gradually gets to the point where perceptions change,
and expectations change and it's gotten to the point where the US is backing
off. Now that's an indication of how little it can take."<p>
But as an informed public begins to want to act on what they are now beginning
to find out, won't the level of media manipulation merely increase?<p>
"Sure, but they don't have to win," Chomsky says. "They don't have to win. They
can lose, and in this one they are losing.<p>
"It's kind of dramatic now in Australia. The US Congress finally just stopped
the sale of small arms. Okay, Australia moves in. Well you know you can stop it
here just as easily as you can there. <p>
"In Britain there's the dramatic case. Britain realised that the US is backing
off supplying the big arms, not rifles but jet planes. So they're delighted to
move in and kill as many people as they can as long as you can make money from it. <p>
"People like John Pilger are giving them a hard time. One of the reasons the
government hates him - much to his credit - and tells all kind of lies about
him, is because he's really giving them a hard time. <p>
"He exposes what they are doing. People read it. When his documentary [Death of a Nation, a film on East Timor] came out, the BBC switchboards were just jammed for hours by people who were furious to know. They don't want their government to be doing this, and governments have to respond. Even totalitarian governments have to respond to that kind of thing, and certainly relatively democratic ones do. <p>
"That leads to changes, and it also opens room for good journalists, serious
journalists. Once you have a space you can push a little harder, and your
editors won't stop you, and the owners won't stop you. And things just
interact, so finally you get substantial changes, on domestic things too."<p>
Chomsky's message for journalists is that there is a way of bringing
information to the public that many would prefer to see kept secret. His
message, in the face of his own theories of media dominance by the powerful
elites, is given with a surprising optimism.	<p>

<H1>Chomsky and the fake Age photo</H1>
<p>
<p>
<B>The Age faked a photograph of Noam Chomsky to reinforce an article saying he
had been wrong on Cambodia. Peter Cronau reports.</B><p>
<hr>
When Professor Noam Chomsky visited Australia in January he was not surprised
to be criticised by opponents of his world view. But even he was amazed at the
extent to which the Age went in an article published on January 25.<p>
The article by right-wing columnist Robert Manne took a familiar line of attack
on Chomsky, criticising him as a defender of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in
1977. Chomsky has sent the Age a vigorous response to the article, which has
yet to be published.<p>
Accompanying the article is a photograph of Chomsky ostensibly pondering a
worrisome volume titled Cambodia `77. But the photo is a fake.<p>
The Age had doctored a photo taken more recently of Chomsky reading a totally
different book. That book may well have caused Chomsky some worry - its
original title, "American Public Opinion and US Foreign Policy 1987".<p>
Chomsky says of the Age photo, "It is a fake, constructed to insinuate Manne's
message: that I defended Pol Pot. The integrity of his charges matches that of
the photo."<p>
Comparing it with the original photo, the Age photo has clearly been "computer
enhanced", but it appears with no caption or credit, and to readers the
subterfuge is hidden.<p>
The Age's pictorial editor, Stewart Heddington, doesn't deny that the Age faked
the photo. "The caption was left off by mistake by a sub. There was a
hullaballoo by the photographers. They were up in arms. Because basically it's
lying to the public." <p>
The Age developed a policy on computer manipulation of images late last year to
always include a standard statement acknowledging an image has been altered, he
says. "No picture is being digitally enhanced without going through the editor
or myself. It must have `digitally enhanced'," Heddington says. <p>
Of the omission on the Chomsky photo, he says, "That was just a terrible
mistake. It's the last time it happened."<p>
The question still remains as to whether a caption can satisfy the ethical
questions posed by the alteration of photographs, because clearly, now, photos
can lie.<p>

<head><title>Reporting on business: A case of market failure</title></head>
<H1>Reporting on business:</H1>
<H2>A case of market failure</H2><p>
<p>
<B>Last year <A HREF="#Brian Toohey">Brian Toohey's</A> new book, Tumbling Dice, received widespread publicity
after its launch. But the one chapter the media ignored was the one on itself.
In this extract, Toohey examines some of the media's claims about our 80s'
entrepreneurs, and finds them wanting.</B>
<hr>
<p>
Cracks have appeared in the dominant approach to business journalism that
prevailed during the 1980s. As the 90s arrived, the media had little option but
to look at some of the wreckage. Although some of the business journalists who
did most to misinform the markets continue to thrive, there is the occasional
introspective piece about the media's role in building up the `aura of
infallibility' surrounding some of the entrepreneurs.<p>
It is by no means clear, however, that the problems of the previous decade
won't recur. In theory, journalists should never find it as highly rewarding as
they did during the 1980s to mislead the markets about the financial strength
of so many of the leading players. <p>
While this was more often the result of gullibility than of any deliberate
policy, profit maximising is supposed to go hand in hand with informing, not
misinforming, markets. But market forces during a boom seem to reward
journalism that only encourages the worst excesses while `underpricing' more
cautionary voices. Customers paying to be told the music will never stop do not
want to hear the voice of scepticism. Editors, with rare exceptions, do not
want to publish `downers' when the market wants `uppers'. <p>
Judged by the criteria of pleasing their proprietors (and attracting the
appropriate financial rewards), business journalists did a good job for much of
the 1980s. But their overall efforts did little by way of contributing to the
goal of fully informed markets which is supposed to lie at the heart of
economic efficiency. <p>
On the contrary, example after example exists of the market for business
journalism failing to perform in a manner even remotely approximating the
neoclassical ideal. As many business journalists were to demonstrate, making
money in media was not the same thing as providing an accurate flow of
information to the wider market place.<p>
It all looked so easy the way the business magazines told it in eighties. There
was none of the nineties' soul searching about the nature of the Australian
identity. The answer was simple. The desirable Australian was the entrepreneur.
Not in the older sense of the entrepreneur as a risk taker developing a new
enterprise  or product, but more as a corporate predator making money from
shuffling paper assets. <p>
There was no limit, it seemed, to what borrowing, brashness and a sycophantic
cover story could achieve. The rewards were something to be savoured in public.
Thorstein Velben's phrase about conspicuous consumption was given new relevance
as millions of dollars of shareholders money were siphoned off by a succession
of deal makers idolised in the media. Lists ranked the winners. They weren't
merely rich like the crusty members of the much derided (and largely illusory)
Melbourne or Adelaide establishments. They were super rich - the symbol of the
new Australia. <p>
The media were not alone in creating these new role models. They were urged on
by Labor leaders such as Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, and Brian Burke, with the
latter displaying a special knack for making friends among the
`four-on-the-floor entrepreneurs'. Auditors, accountants, brokers, and lawyers
broke the rules while the regulatory authorities, even allowing for severe
underfunding, performed poorly. <p>
Perhaps more crucially, the profligacy of the banking sector combined with the
wage restraint exercised by the ACTU to generate the funds needed to fuel the
mad asset boom that eventually triggered the 1990-91 recession.  <p>
But the journalism of the period really set the seal of approval on what was
happening. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the two glossy new magazines
to emerge during the 1980s, BRW (originally Business Review Weekly) and
Australian Business. Their message were reinforced by new personal investment
magazines, new business programmes on television, and the elevation of finance
news to pride of place on the front page of newspapers. <p>
BRW was launched by the Fairfax group in 1981 as a `consumer benefit business
magazine' with the slogan `news you can use'. The underlying marketing
philosophy was to put a favourable gloss on business. In August 1980, Fairfax's
then chief editorial executive, Max Suich, sent a memo to Robert Gottliebsen as
inaugural editor, giving an example of consumer benefit: <p>
When you are doing corporate strategies you should not be an outsider looking
in but an insider telling outsiders how to benefit. On the story on Bond, for
instance, I think it is important to make clear how Bond discovered Santos as a
gold mine and what the nature of his style of finding such corporations is.<p>
There were honourable exceptions, but the overall effect of the business
journalism of the time was to create heroes of some of the most recklessly
incompetent executives ever to control a public company. Often the reporting
style was celebratory, with speculators and paper shufflers being treated as
creators of genuine wealth. <p>
Swindlers and thieves were treated as pop stars in carefully airbrushed photos
on the front covers of the magazines. Nonsensical `corporate strategies' were
reported with reverence while ludicrous claims about long-term debt being the
same as equity were presented as new accounting truths. Corporate crooks were
legitimised, spivs given comfort and respectability, well-dressed drongos
transformed into financial giants. <p>
Time after time, a positive `spin' was put on the outlook for companies on the
verge of collapse. Tributes to the immense guile of various corporate raiders
helped built an decisive aura of invincibility for particular takeover
stratagems.<p>
In short, the media watchdogs did not bark. Shareholders and the public may
have been misled - `Bond: too big to stop now' was a typical headline - but the
magazines were following a marketing strategy that worked at the time in terms
of circulation and advertising revenue. No one, it seemed, wanted to hear about
the hard slog behind designing and manufacturing a better widget. <p>
Instead, the market for new readers lay with stirring tales about tycoons
juggling billions in takeover `plays' featuring greenmailers, white knights,
poison pills, war chests and golden parachutes. The former editorial director
of BRW , Robert Gottliebsen, has acknowledged that, "perhaps more than any
other country in the world, we have personalised business . . . It was the
drama of business, we found, that helped sell magazines" (Independent Monthly,
September, 1989, p 3). He was not unaware of the dangers:<p>
Many (business personalities) have copied the politicians and exploited the
system. The journalists who created the `monster' must be watchful that it
doesn't turn around and bite them. I guess this applies to me more than anyone
else.<p>
When they first appeared at the start of the 1980s, BRW and Australian Business
were more aggressively `pro-business' in their journalistic content than the
rather staid coverage available in the daily papers. While the traditional
business pages could hardly be said to be overly critical, they did not go out
of their way to inject the same aura of glamour, excitement and bullish
euphoria which characterised the new magazines. <p>
As the speculative boom took off, however, the dailies boosted their business
coverage, often shifting the more dramatic stories to the front page. They also
carried their share of reporting which amounted to little more than an
image-building exercise for some of the shakiest entrepreneurs. <p>
A notorious example is the Sydney Morning Herald's front page assurance that
Alan Bond would survive after two of its reporters were flown to Perth on a
Bond jet for a briefing organised by the paper's then editor-in-chief. Shortly
afterwards, Bond went sluicing down the gurgler (Mark Westfield and Peter
Smark, Sydney Morning Herald,  21/10/89). Nevertheless, the SMH , through
journalists such as Colleen Ryan, Anne Lampe and Glen Burge, was usually much
more willing than the new magazines to subject the dominant business figures of
the era to serious scrutiny.<p>
Apart from the new business magazines, a number of personal finance magazines
were launched in the mid-1980s, partly to cater for retirees puzzling over how
to allocate their lump sum superannuation pay-outs among the bewildering array
of new financial products spawned by deregulation. Their tone was also bullish
as editors strove to find some new angle which promised to tell readers how to
extract an extra dollar from their investment portfolio. <p>
Television was not exempt from the excitement generated by the boom. Specialist
new programs were introduced, generally adopting a similarly supportive stance
on their subject matter as the business magazines. Nor was such an approach
confined to the commercial media. Instead of developing its own specialists,
the ABC in 1981 approached Gottliebsen to appear each night on its national TV
news as a paid business commentator. Gottliebsen wrote to Suich urging approval
on the grounds that:<p>
It would be a unique promotion vehicle for the magazine around Australia. . . .
It would be a remarkable opportunity to have BRW known as the source of
business commentary among the very readers who (we) are most likely to find
attractive . . .  The proposed deal stipulates that all promotion carries the
BRW name, plus I would be introduced as the Managing Editor of BRW'.<p>
Not surprisingly, Suich approved the plan. The benefits to ABC viewers were no
so readily apparent. Instead of developing more dispassionate commentators from
among its own staff, the national broadcaster handed over the dominant business
spot in its nightly television news to someone renowned for his breathless
enthusiasm for the paper shuffling entrepreneurs who were to wreck such havoc
on the Australian economy. <p>
Readers of BRW and Australian Business were left with the overwhelming
impression that everything the entrepreneurs touched would turn to gold.
Something of the mood can be gained from the upbeat tone of `write-offs'
introducing many articles. The following examples come from Australian Business
(4/6/1981, 29/5/85, 11/11/87, and 14/3/84) , but similar examples are available
from BRW:<p>
* Bond has cleaned up his image. Gone is the brash aggressive businessman of
the 1970s who nearly lost his company. Instead, there is the cautious, more
thoughtful Bond, a man willing to admit his mistakes and show that he has
learned his financial lessons well.<p>
* He's tough talking, ambitious, ruthless and the eternal optimist. John
Elliott's personal style has moulded a corporate philosophy that has made
Elders IXL a model of success. <p>
* Chris Skase's penchant for baby blue is starting to show up in his groups
balance sheets. All his companies are earners. And he got out of the market
just before it collapsed. <p>
* They're coming rampaging in from the west, and they're scared of no one. A
new breed of hustling entrepreneurs, they grew up in the cut and thrust of WA
but became too big for one state to hold.<p>
One of the strongest themes running through both magazines was that takeovers
were unambiguously good for the nation. Indeed, it was the money made on the
share market from takeover coups (or from `green mail' in aborted raids) that
catapulted many of the raiders onto the Rich Lists. BRW's ebullient approach
was captured by its use of a dinkus proclaiming "The Sport of Takeovers" across
the top of several articles. <p>
Australian Business also ran an annual feature extolling the `Top  Deals of the
Year' in which it praised some of the most wasteful, and ill considered,
transactions of the decade. There was an enthusiastic piece, for example, about
Bond's `sale' of the Sydney Hilton, later exposed as a sham by the ABC's Four
Corners. In 1986 George Herscu received high praise for his disastrous takeover
of Hookers. <p>
Although space was occasionally given to dissenting views, the dominant
attitude was summed up Alan Jury, who managed to combine  stockbroking and
column writing for Australian Business. Jury said that the deployment of
productive resources such as capital and labour must be continually reviewed to
ensure that their efficiency is constantly maximised. "Takeovers do this in a
primal way, with the weak (less efficient) giving way to the strong (more
efficient)."<p>
Jury picked three examples of hot performers from the magazine's annual list of
Top 500 companies that could hardly have been less apposite - all three proving
a disaster for their shareholders as well as detracting from the efficiency
with which capital and capital and labour was employed in Australia (Alan Jury,
Australian Business , 13/5/87):<p>
Bell Resources' rocket ride from outside the top 200 to inside the top 25 in
two years is a graphic illustration . . . Similarly, Bond Corp's acquisition of
Castlemaine Tooheys has provided it with a stable cash flow base from which to
service debt and extract future earnings. Another example is Ariadne's takeover
of Repco Corp. Ariadne's swift dissection of the industrial conglomerate may
appear to have been a classic asset strip, but few would argue that the
combined efficiency of the new parts far exceeds that of the previous whole.<p>
The homage to the new breed of business dynamos reached its peak in the annual
Rich Lists published by both magazines. Genuinely wealthy people such as the
Kings Cross identity, Abe Saffron, never made it to the lists, apparently being
considered a little too lacking in tone to appear in the same company as such
future jail birds as Herscu. <p>
For readers who were interested in buying shares, or in taking advantage of
other opportunities associated with those who made it onto the annual Rich
Lists, the implicit message was that they would be dealing with people of
substance. <p>
Business journalists, of course, were not alone in falling into the trap of
focusing on assets displayed far more prominently than the debts behind them.
Banks made the same mistakes. Nevertheless, some of the errors were quite
spectacular.<p>
Rag merchant Abe Goldberg was said to be worth $600 million, justifying his
place as no. 4 in the Australian Business  Rich List for 1989. According to
bankruptcy proceedings commenced shortly afterwards, he was penniless.
Keating's friend, Warren Anderson, was listed in 1990 as being worth $250
million in Australian Business and $190 million in BRW even though his
creditors were being told at the time that he had no assets in his name and his
total income, as declared to the tax office, was only $30,395. <p>
Australian Business compounded its embarrassment by commenting, "He has been
cautious on gearing and should not hurt too much during a slump". At least BRW
redeemed itself somewhat with a piece a year later pointing to the importance
of political connections in his business style (Ali Cromie, BRW, 27/9/91).<p>
Writing about members of the Rich List who were media proprietors could also
present difficulties. Christopher Skase, as owner of the Channel Seven Network,
started a business program which retained several of the nation's leading
business columnists as well as giving valuable exposure to the publications
they represented. At the time, none commented unfavourably on Skase's business
practices or prospects. <p>
In 1988, Australian Business listed Skase as worth $25 million. The journalist
responsible for the listing, Tony Grant Taylor, says that he came under intense
editorial pressure to bump Skase up the list for the following year. Skase was
duly listed as being worth $70 million in 1989. Apparently, considerable
importance was placed upon the publicity Australian Business gained from its
association with the Skase television network. BRW performed just as poorly,
listing Skase as worth $65 million in 1989. <p>
The problems did not stop with the Rich Lists. Only ten days before Skase went
belly up, exposing his participation in a number of extremely dubious
practices, Australian Business (18/10/89) ran a favourable cover story which
assured readers:<p>
He (Skase) does not do fast rash deals of the kind that ensnared Channel 10 and
Alan Bond in Channel 9. In particular, Skase likes to ensure that he extracts
maximum advantage from the leads and lags in financing his deals.<p>
The Rich Lists did more than merely rank the winners. Accompanying essays
extolled the business strategies and personal qualities that had propelled the
high fliers to the top. BRW's August 1987 Rich List carried an introduction by
Les Carlyon which captured the pervasive ethos of the magazine's approach:<p>
We may have to revise our idea of how wealth is created. We should not always
be looking for `productive investment', for mines in the spinifex or new
factories because, mostly, they are not to be found. Much of the wealth on this
list has come from opportunities and daring, from financial alchemy, from asset
switching and trading, from the rationalisation of existing industry rather
than the creation of new industries. And much of it, it should be noted,  has
come from property development . . . <p>
Once the fortunes in Australia were made from rural acres. Glasshouses have
replaced Clancy's sunlit plains. Now, the fortunes are made from city hotels
and arcades, from suburban shopping centres, from towers which house the
energetic young men of the liberated financial sector . . . <p>
To generalise more than a little, the young entrepreneur is not interested in a
secure weekly salary (windfalls are better and harder to tax). He is not much
interested in manufacturing for its own sake; he would rather make money than
things.<p>
Skase and Bond were two of the newcomers to the list that Carlyon singled out
for praise as having `created their own accretions of substance'. For good
measure, he added that what he called the `fast money' made by the high fliers
showed that `the boast of Australia being an egalitarian society were
justified'. <p>
By the 1993 Rich List (BRW, 21/5/93), however, a note of reproval had crept in
as Carlyon wrote without any hint of self-awareness, "In the 1980s, many of the
hot house men were feted as `business leaders'. They weren't; they were merely

<h1>Thai press freedoms: <br>a challenge to the region</h1><p>
<p>
<b>While Australia's foreign owned news papers cut costs to maximise profits,
Thailand is experiencing a period of openness for its media. Thailand hopes to
secure a profitable future for itself itself as the centre of a quality
Asia-wide English language press. <A HREF="#Alan Knight">Alan Knight</A> reports.</b>
<hr>
<p>
Later this year, the Bangkok-based Manager group will launch Asia Times, an
international daily aimed squarely at ASEAN's rapidly growing educated and
affluent elite. Both Singapore and Hong Kong already have better paid and more
highly educated workforces than Australia, and living standards are rising
rapidly in Malaysia, Thailand and sections of Indonesia.<p>
There are even proposals to sell the Asia Times in Australia; to service a
market considered to be ill served by our local press's perceived ignorance of
and disinterest in Asia.<p>
The Thais hope to replace Hong Kong which with three daily English language
broadsheets, a plethora of glossy magazines, satellite television networks and
600 foreign corespondents, is still unquestionably Asia's international media
centre. <p>
Yet journalists in Hong Kong are becoming increasingly nervous about the 1997
convergence with China, which remains openly hostile to a critical press. China
still defines news as whatever the communist party says it is. <p>
The New China News Agency (the official mainland office in Hong Kong) tracks
the movements of pro-democracy activists, issues its own version of
Beijing-style "news" and protests about unfavourable stories. <p>
The Agency last year even sought to stop the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents'
Club from showing a BBC documentary on the life of Mao, after pressure had
blocked its open broadcast on Hong Kong television. The documentary offended
Beijing's cultural sensitivities by quoting Mao's former personal physician who
claimed the Great Helmsman had a leaning towards young girls. <p>
Such offences have been taken seriously in the Crown Colony since the Beijing
arrest and trial last year of a Hong Kong journalist who allegedly breached
state secrecy by seeking to report on interest rate movements. (See Reportage
Spring 1994). Hong Kong Journalist Union Executive members who unsuccessfully
campaigned for his release have themselves become targets for a mainland backed
campaign to replace them. <p>
Some Hong Kong publications have already begun seeking an accommodation with
the incoming government. An executive for the Hong Kong Daily Standard, the
flagship of Sally Aw's international media group, told a conference on Asian
news values in December that Hong Kong journalists would have to be much more
careful in the future. Amends would have to be made for past mistakes, he said.
<p>
His group had already struck a deal to distribute papers across the border and
did not want potential advertising revenue disrupted by irresponsible
reporting. <p>
Other publications, such as the prestigious Far Eastern Economic Review, have
pledged in public that they will remain in Hong Kong after 1997. In private,
they have been laying plans to move their operations, if the mainlanders find
themselves unable to shake the habit of censorship.<p>
Meanwhile, Thai journalists are enjoying unprecedented freedoms which they hope
to export to the surrounding region. Thailand translated means "land of the
free".  However, media freedoms have been qualified during swings between
democracy and what have been in effect military dictatorships. The Australian
news camera-man, Neil Davis, died there while recording once such exchange of
government.<p>
Christian missionaries introduced the first printing press in Thailand in 1835.
Throughout the 19th century, publishing was mainly confined to the royal court
and missionaries, advocating either Buddhism or Christianity respectively.
However, the tradition of using the press to allow public debate of contending
ideas was established during this period, with members of the Thai royal family
submitting articles for publication under pseudonyms. <p>
The Royal Gazette, founded in 1858, is still used for official announcements.
Daily newspapers came into their own in the early 20th century under the reign
of King Vajiravudh. During his reign, some 20 dailies (among them one in
Chinese and two in English) were printed.<p>
The first point of the Thai journalists' code of ethics affirmed that the main
task of all journalists was "to promote, preserve and uphold the freedom of the
press". The Thai press was seen to be obliged not only to report news, facts
and opinions as well as help people understand the events of the day but was
also expected to (1) look after social well being, (2) act as a medium for
social organisations and (3) promote and clarify social beliefs values and
views. <p>
However, to perform such duties, the press demanded more freedom. Thai
journalists might say, "The more freedom a newspaper has, the more freedom the
society will get".<p>
Such beliefs have helped create a press which ranged from Thai language "blood,
bodies and scandal" tabloid newspapers to quality English language broadsheets.
Thai journalists were perceived to be more tenacious and less willing to buckle
under to authorities than most other of their Asian counterparts. <p>
Their freewheeling, daredevil approach  made it more difficult for authorities
to bring them to heel. During the 1992 demonstrations which brought down the
military backed government in Bangkok, many news paper journalists simply
ignored threats of a crackdown.<p>
Freedom of expression is no longer a question for Thai journalists, according
to Thepchai Yong, the Editor-in-Chief of the Bangkok-based Nation newspaper.
The right to report the "truth" has already been won in bloody battles on the
streets of the Thai capital, he says. <p>
The Nation, a quality broadsheet with a reputation for covering regional
affairs, is strongly opposed to notions of "Eastern-style journalism", which
Thai reporters and editors saw as a paternalistic rationale for censorship and
oppression.<p>
Yong was the keynote speaker at the Asian Pacific regional conference of the
International Federation of Journalists held in Sydney in February. He says
that while it has always been recognised that Thailand had among the freest
presses in south east Asia, the pace of progress, particularly in the last two
years, had been extraordinary.<p>
"For decades the Thai press was content, probably more by circumstances, with
its role as a watch dog. It exposed corruption, crucified wayward politicians
and bureaucrats, and raised the red flag when certain political or military
(leaders) began showing signs of threat to the democratic system," he says.<p>
"Of course, it was not a perfect role. But in the absence of a more credible
institution, the press was left as one of the few safeguards against abuses and
excesses by the powers that were."<p>
However, the Thai newspapers were to play a leading role in reporting
Thailand's "political uprising" in 1992; toppling a military backed government,
by prompting the intervention of the Thai King. <p>
The incident, one of many in Thailand's long history of coup and counter coup,
was best remembered by many Westerners by the memorable news footage it
generated; the unaccustomed sight of powerful politicians crawling across a
palace floor so that they might be summarily dismissed by a wave of the royal
hand. In apparent irony, it became clear that in Thailand, moves towards modern
democracy were reliant on a benevolent monarchy, itself only recently removed
from a divine autocracy.<p>
Most Thai radio and television stations had in contrast to the press, backed
the discredited politicians, and, by down-playing and misreporting the popular
opposition, had themselves lost credibility with the population. <p>
Yong says that although Thailand boasted more than 400 national and local radio
stations, as well as five television stations, most were owned directly by the
government, the armed forces or state enterprises.<p>
"More often than not, they served as propaganda machinery for those in power,"
he says. "Their whitewash account of the event backfired. And for the first
time, the public resentments of the public broadcasting monopoly have forced
both the government and the military to loosen their grips on the broadcast
media. The result was a sudden emergence of privately operated radio news
stations."<p>
Suddenly, Thais discovered the decidedly mixed blessings of talk-back radio.
Ordinary members of the public were the first time able to openly debate
political issues which had until then, been largely the preserve of the
literate elite. <p>
The overwhelming response shattered the familiar arguments heard from
authoritarians everywhere; that the so called uneducated and underprivileged of
Asia had no interests beyond their own daily survival. <p>
The Nation group, which began its own radio news service was deluged with
listeners' letters. A farmer wrote from a remote province, "For the first  time
in my life, I am listening to a news program which is propaganda free and
uncensored. And for the first time, I can make my voice heard."<p>
Yong says that it was too early to predict that moves towards a full democracy
were irreversible in Thailand.<p>
"But the more active political participation by the more outspoken media, is a
reminder that no unconstitutional change will be accepted without resistance.
<p>
"An informed and politically conscious public, is without question the best
assurance against a slide back into the vicious political cycle. And this is
exactly, the greatest challenge facing the Thai media today".	<p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Asia's new English voice</H1>
<B>Peter Limqueco, a Filipino journalist and academic, has been appointed Editor at Large at the Asia Times  a new English language newspaper based in Thailand. He says that his potential audience would be "businessmen, policy makers, opinion makers, graduate students, government bureaucrats, and diplomatic corps members". Alan Knight caught up with him recently on his visit to Australia
recruiting contributors.</B><p>
<i><p>
Is the English language market in Asia big enough to bear another
publication?</i><p>
I think so. The International Herald Tribune is fairly American oriented. There's hardly any Asian news in it. The Asian Wall Street Journal, while it has more stories about Asia in it, it is written from an American point of view. The way they look at events is quite different from the way an Asianwould look at them.<i><p>
Americans and the British have previously dominated international English language media in the region, is this new paper a sign that attitudes are changing?</i><p>
Yes. You can see so many countries now where the domination is not there any more. The best example is the Philippines which was an American colony for so long but where not a single newspaper is owned by the Americans. The area where they still dominate is international broadcasting by television like CNN. But with the economic development of Asia and given the growth in economic wealth, it is about time that Asians take the decision to compete with the American and British monopolies.<i><p>
Yet the region is so diverse. What sort of stories will you be looking for
which might he region wide appeal?</i><p>
Essentially we will be looking at the business of politics and the politics of
business. It is not just reporting news as it evolves. It is also analysing
news after the event has taken place. A lot of the international press is only
interested in getting the scoop and putting out the news as fast as it happens.
<i>There is much more to cover and much needs to be put in perspective.<p>
Are there such things as Asian news values?</i><p>
All news should be judged by international standards; which means objectivity
and accuracy. But it has to go deeper than that and that is where some
governments are sensitive. But in the long run, if you start by telling the
truth you should end up by telling the truth. But if you start with falsehoods,
you will always end up with falsehoods. When you say you can't report things
because of cultural differences, that is essentially concealing the truth.
These are international values whether you are in Asia, Timbuktu or anywhere
else.<i><p>
So you are not a subscriber to what the Indonesians, Malaysians and
Singaporeans call development journalism?</i><p>
No. This type of approach concealing information could mean that governments
have something to hide. If governments have nothing to hide, why should they be
afraid of discussion. It (censorship) is only done by totalitarian regimes and
closed societies. Democratically elected regimes should not be afraid of
transparency. After all the people brought them into power. They should be open
to the people.<i><p>
So why base your newspaper in Thailand?</i><p>
Thailand has the most advanced economy in mainland south-east Asia. The
economic development has reached such a point there now that the capitalisation
has reached that of industrialised countries. The economic growth rate will be
maintained at between nine and 12 percent a year for the next five years.
Because of its economic development, Thailand is able to influence neighbouring
countries in Indochina, southern China and Burma. It is in a strategic
position. We also have a substantial tourism industry in Thailand, about five
million people visit each year. All the airlines going to Europe and the Middle
East, stop in Bangkok. Meanwhile costs are low compared to Hong Kong, Singapore
and Malaysia, in terms of wages and cost of living. Lastly and not the least,
the level of democracy in Thailand is second only to the Philippines in
south-east Asia. We have a much wider latitude for democratic practices than
elsewhere. There is, however, still room for improvement.<i><p>
English is not as widely spoken in Thailand as some other ASEAN countries, why
choose it for Asia Times?</i><p>
English is the common language in Asia; among businesses, at international
conferences, even among tourists. It is much more common than other
languages.<i><p>
Will the pool of English language speakers increase?</i><p>
Yes that is the common trend. Even in countries like Malaysia which wanted to
concentrate on Bahasa Malaysia are trying to correct that situation because
they realise that to be able to compete with the world, they must be able to do
it in English. Nearly all the reading materials, instruction manuals in
advanced technologies are in English. Instructions for machinery imported from abroad are in English, so they will lose that ability to compete if they stick
to that national language.<i><p>
How will Asia Times place itself in the market?</i><p>
The Asian Wall Street Journal is better than many. Yet when I read it, I often
ask myself, "Why was this question not asked?" I will give you an example. At
the last APEC conference in Jakarta, all the newspapers appeared to be the
same: whether you read the Melbourne Age or the Philippine Daily Inquirer. They talked about how everyone was wearing batik, as well as the colours worn by Keating, Soeharto or Mahathir. They reported on what was agreed upon; that
ASEAN would phase out trade restrictions over 20 years. Whereas before the
conference, Mahathir, Philippines, Thailand; they were all saying, "We don't
want a schedule". But when the communique came out, it was reported as a
victory for Clinton and the United States. The interesting questions were: How
did Soeharto, the chairman, persuade the other ASEAN members to support the American position? What did he get from Clinton in exchange? That was never discussed by any of the journalists. Those to me are the interesting questions. Maybe they told him he could do what he liked in East Timor?

<H1>Asia-Pacific Challenge: Journalists and Human Rights</H1><p>
<p>
<H3><!-- Anchor Link Tag -->
<A HREF="#Aidan White">By Aidan White</A></H3>
<hr>
<p>
At a time when media exercise more influence than at any time in human history,
when violence against journalists is increasing and when governments, many of
them in the dynamic economies of Asia, resist pressure to recognise universal
principles of freedom in society, the role of media and the rights of
journalists have become issues which define the quality of democracy.<p>
In Singapore foreign media, such as the International Herald Tribune in January
1995, have been routinely prosecuted for activities which, in the settled
democracies of the world, are part of the normal democratic process.<p>
In China, journalists who write honestly, professionally and competently are
imprisoned accused of spying or other anti-social behaviour.<p>
In South Asia, a legacy of colonialism remains in a complex legislative
framework which often binds media professionally and economically to the
institutions of state.<p>
In Indonesia, journalists who wish to represent themselves through an
independent, non-governmental and professional association are victimised and
vilified while independent news media are closed down with the approval of a
government sponsored journalists association.<p>
In many countries of the region a tone of compliance over the emergence of what
is ruefully known as "soft-authoritarianism", should sound an alarm bell
throughout the newsrooms of Asia.<p>
The IFJ, which represents almost 400,000 journalists in 90 countries, believes
strongly in the need for professional solidarity in defence of journalists'
rights. <p>
We reaffirm our commitment after a year in which the scale of violence against
journalists worldwide has reached an unprecedented level.<p>
In 1994 some 115 journalists were killed around the world according to the IFJ
Report published in December. Of these a number were killed in Asia. <p>
In taking up the battle for journalists' rights, the IFJ works closely with the
agencies of the United Nations, particularly UNESCO; the United Nations Human
Rights Commission, World Intellectual Properties Organisation (WIPO) and the
International Labour Organisation (ILO), with the International Committee of
the Red Cross, and with a range of other international trade union and freedom
of expression organisatiens.<p>
The IFJ's mandate covers both professional and industrial interests of
journalists. Our current policy program has been defined by the Manifesto For a
Democratic Media Culture, adopted at the Federation's Congress held in
Montreal, Canada, in June 1992.<p>
That Manifesto is an elaboration of the Sydney Declaration, a statement issued
here five years ago following the first international conference organised by
journalists on the issue of media concentration.<p>
The need for a program of practical work to protect freedom of expression and
opinion and to counter the killing of journalists gets more urgent by the day.
<p>
It is not just the toll of journalists killed which worries us, though that is
tragic enough. <p>
But living and working in conditions of fear, poverty, or employment insecurity
journalists often submit to "self-censorship" the most corrosive and insidious
form of censorship of all.<p>
Thc IFJ believes, therefore, that there must be a national legal framework to
create and enhance the conditions for professional journalism. <p>
Any legal framework must identify the full range of obstacles, formal and
informal, which are an impediment to good reporting. The law must protect
journalists against all forms of censorship.<p>
A set of issues upon which the IFJ believes action should be taken has been set
out in a document available from the IFJ titled, "Legislating for a Democratic
Media Culture", which identifies key areas in which the law can be used in the
service of press freedom.<p>
The IFJ considers that the notion of journalism and human rights must also
embrace the need to examine the conditions in which journalists work and, in
particular, the issue of their physical safety.<p>
While a legal framework can put in place the rules by which the game must be
played, the practice of journalism is increasingly fraught with danger and
requires concrete activity to:<p>
a) monitor violations of human rights and attacks on journalists and media
organisations;<p>
b) establish networks of communication between journalists and media
organisations;<p>
c) provide support, including humanitarian aid and legal defence assistance, to
journalists and media organisations where violations of human rights take
place.<p>
In support of these aims the IFJ has implemented a program of action and set up
a new organisation, the Journalists' Safety Service, which is being developed
in all parts of the world and particularly here in the Asia-Pacific region
through the IFJ's Regional Office.<p>
This regional office was established during 1994 and it offers the basis for
the creation of a network of sub-regional organisations bringing together
journalists' organisation from throughout the region. <p>
In all of its work, the IFJ works closely with other organisations which share
our aims and objectives, from the world of trades unionism to a range of human
rights organisations concerned with freedom of expression and opinion.<p>
However, there is no substitute in the end for professional solidarity. Much
more needs to be done to confront the crises we face in the years ahead. In all
the chatter about "new world orders" precious little is heard about protecting
the fundamental democratic values set out in international treaties governing
civil and political rights.<p>
 What is needed from democratic governments throughout the region is a
practical program:<p>
l To intervene on behalf of freedom of expression organisations and journalists
organisations whenever there are alleged violations of human rights;<p>
l To sponsor activities involving regional governments, collective and
individually, to promote public awareness on the issue of freedom of
expression, human rights, social conditions and the safety of journalists;<p>
l To promote dialogue and joint action among media organisations, journalists
and others working in the field of journalists' safety;<p>
l To assist in the publication and circulation of material and information on
violations of journalists' and media rights.<p>
Such a commitment to change would be a modest start in creating a broad
political and social coalition recognising that good journalism counts in a
democracy, that a confident and inquiring media is nothing to be afraid of and,
above all, that human rights take precedence over the ideological imperatives
of economic or social control.	<p>

<H1>Under pressure: Media freedom in the Asia-Pacific region</H1><p>

<B>Despite rapid industrialisation and a rise in wealth, the Asia-Pacific region
hasn't experienced a similar growth in media freedom or individual rights.
These <A HREF="#compiled">country reports</A> are from the 
<A HREF="R5IFJ_Safety.html">International Federation of Journalists</A>.</B><p>
<HR WIDTH=100%>
The Asia-Pacific region is shaping up to become the workshop of the world in
the 21st Century. With this economic expansion comes the hope of greater
freedoms for the people who live there. But does economic development
necessarily mean that the people of the Asia-Pacific will enjoy such
fundamental freedoms as those of expression and opinion?<p>
It is the achievement of these freedoms which will define the role the media
plays in the region and determine the future prospects for journalists and
media organisations.<p>
It is important not to make sweeping generalisations, or to set the principle
of universality of human rights in the context of an "outside or foreign"
intervention.<p>
The debate ranges from those countries that favour an "Asian concept of human
rights" to those which favour an interpretation of human rights which is in
line with universal principles which transcend national boundaries.As this
report reveals, there is no evidence to suggest that economic growth by itself
is a guarantee of human rights protection, either for journalists or for other
people in a society. And yet it could be argued that repressive measures
against citizens' rights to free information, for example, actually, damages
the process of economic development and growth.<p>
Indeed, the strongest evidence points towards the need for continued outside
pressure on governments which abuse the rights of media and of citizens to
free, uncensored and professional sources of information. The major question
facing journalists' unions is how such pressure can be applied.<p>
Across the Asia and Pacific region journalists are under pressure. What follows
is a current rundown of the situation in countries in the region.<p>
<p>
<B>BURMA</B><p>
In Burma Aung San Su Kyi, the leader of the democratic opposition, is still
under house arrest on the orders of the State Law and Order Restoration Society
(SLORC), a military body established as a temporary government in 1988.<p>
The authorities continue to deny freedom of expression, freedom of association
and freedom of assembly. There have been a number of specific incidents in the
past year highlighting the control on expression in particular. In July seven
people were arrested for distributing pamphlets calling for the release of Aung
San Su Kyi.<p>
In September Khin Zaw Win and four members of the National League for Democracy
were arrested for passing "fabricated news" to foreign media. In October Khin
was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment and San San Nwe, a writer and member of
the National League for Democracy, was sentenced to 10 years. All the other
defendants were sent to prison for eight years. <p>
These incidents were just part of a range of violations of human rights which
have concerned the international community. Meanwhile, the United States and
Thailand maintain the strongest trading links with Burma.<p>
<p>
<B>CAMBODIA</B><p>
Cambodian journalists have been in the frontline of efforts to maintain a
democracy movement following the first year of a democratically-elected
government in the country. The independent press has been the target of
official attacks following the public exposure in Cambodia and abroad of
military atrocities. <p>
The power of the media to influence public opinion has led to government
retaliation and the deaths of three journalists. In addition Noun Nonn, editor
of Morning News was arrested in July following a coup attempt for publishing an
article which suggested high officials in the ministry of the interior were
responsible for the coup.<p>
The Khmer Journalists Association, an IFJ member, has been in the forefront of
efforts to restrain the authorities from attacks on the press and the
Association led a concerted international campaign against a new press law
which would have further restricted the media. <p>
In September foreign journalists were threatened with expulsion by the prime
minister if they "exaggerated" reports about Cambodia. The IFJ Regional Office
in Kuala Lumpur has been monitoring the situation in Cambodia where the
presence of a number of non-government organisations, including the Australian
Journalists Association, provide civic education and training.<p>
<p>
<B>CHINA</B><p>
The human rights crisis is most apparent in China where the government
expresses continual disregard for the rights of journalists and media
organisations. Curbs on freedom of the press have tightened in the past year.
In a case designed to be a clear warning to dissident journalists, particularly
in Hong Kong, the Chinese authorities arrested and sentenced Xi Yang, a
reporter for the Hong Kong newspaper Ming Bao, to 12 years' jail.<p>
The offence was writing an article on central bank gold strategies and
interests rates when official information on the matter had not yet been
released. The reporters' source, Tian Ye, a clerk at the People's Bank was
jailed for 15 years.<p>
In another case Gao Yu, formerly deputy chief editor of the banned newspaper
Economics Weekly was tried in secret in April and sentenced later in the year.
This case was particularly worrying for it violated China's own legal
procedures.<p>
China takes strong action against dissidents who try to talk to the foreign
press. In April five journalists were held for questioning over contacts with
the wife of veteran dissident Xu Wenli. The action against media was
particularly harsh up to the fifth anniversary of the June 4 crackdown in
Beijing.<p>
Information flows in Tibet are routinely restricted. Satellite television is
strictly controlled. Travel agencies have been forbidden to permit journalists
to take journeys into the region. Of particular concern was the decision by
Star Television, a part of News Corporation based in Hong Kong, to dismiss the
BBC Television World Service from its broadcasts to China. It was an action
specifically taken to ensure that no news service unacceptable to the Chinese
authorities would be broadcast through the company's cable network.<p>
The United States Government renewed China's "Most Favoured Nation" trading
status during the year despite considerable concern expressed by all major
human rights agencies that little or no progress had been made in obtaining the
regime's commitment to respect human rights. During 1994 governments in Asia
and Europe took steps to reinforce and expand commercial relations with China.
The effect of this has been to downgrade the importance of human rights.<p>
<p>
<B>HONG KONG</B><p>
The intransigence of the Chinese government on questions of human rights and
the expansion of trading links with China by the major industrialised countries
of the world are bad omens for the defence of civil and political rights in
Hong Kong. The journalists of Hong Kong, led by the Hong Kong Journalists'
Association, have resolutely campaigned for laws to protect freedom of
information and freedom of expression for the post-1997 era.<p>
During the year journalists held demonstrations over the imprisonment of Xi
Yang (See China, above), but some news media have encouraged self-censorship
and, according to Human Rights Watch, some publications warned journalists not
to sign petitions on Xi Yang's behalf. On May 10 journalists from Hong Kong who
had signed the petition of protest were banned from entering China.<p>
<p>
<B>INDONESIA</B><p>
Attacks on Indonesian journalism in the past year are clear evidence of
Indonesia's abandonment of "openness" and any policy encouraging freedom of the
press. Three well-known publications - Tempo, Editor and Detik - were closed as
the country returned to a familiar pattern of abuse of human rights.<p>
In the frontline of resistance to this crackdown were members of the
Association of Independent Journalists (AJI). In October 1994 AJI became a
member organisation of the IFJ. In setting up their independent organisation,
the independent journalists protested strongly at the government crackdown on
media and rejected "all kinds of interference, intimidation, censorship and
media bans which deny freedom of speech and open access to information".<p>
In retribution the Ministry of Information encouraged victimisation by
newspaper editors. On October 31, Andreas Harsono, a prominent member of the
AJI working on the English-language Jakarta Post, was sacked on vague charges
of misconduct.<p>
The official PWI (Indonesian Journalists Association) has assisted the
authorities in their opposition to the independent journalists' movement and an
attempt to re-open DeTik under a new title was stopped after one day of
publication, in part on the grounds that journalists who were not members of
the PWI were involved its publication.<p>
Indonesia remains deeply sensitive to discussion over East Timor and has
pressured its neighbours Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand to undermine
activities which highlight the problem. In one case reported by Human Rights
Watch the Indonesian Government succeeded in having foreigners banned from a
conference being held in Manila on East Timor by cancelling joint venture
contracts between the two countries.<p>
The AJI issued a statement of protest on December 7, 1994 over the invasion of
the offices of the newspaper Suara Timor Timur by a gang of youths who
destroyed electronic equipment. They were looking for journalist Jacob Herin
because of a report he had written. They traced him to a hotel where he was
working and beat him up. [See article in this issue of Reportage on IFJ mission
to  Indonesia.]<p>
<p>
<B>MALAYSIA</B><p>
The Malaysian government's sensitivity to the publication of information which
it doesn't like was starkly revealed in a remarkable confrontation with British
media over reportage of the so-called Pergau Dam scandal. The Malaysian
Government cancelled contracts with British companies over the affair in which
allegations of corruption were made against the Government. Various threats
were made to foreign journalists as the affair developed, but eventually the
trade ban was lifted in September.<p>
In April a Filipino journalist Leah Makabenta was expelled for writing a "very
negative" article on migrant labour. In the same month a report by the BBC on
labour unrest in Indonesia was censored by the state broadcasting system. The
BBC said the item must be broadcast without cuts. The program was dropped
completely from Malaysian television on May 1.<p>
<B>SINGAPORE</B><p>
Political repression and strict curbs on media freedom remain in Singapore,
despite the country's exceptional economic growth. The editor of Business Times
was convicted and fined for "communicating and receiving government data". He
was charged under the country's Official Secrets Act for printing preliminary
estimates on quarterly economic growth in 1992.<p>
The International Herald Tribune, despite the appearance of its editor in court
to explain himself, was fined over an article it carried which was allegedly in
contempt of court. The opinion piece had criticised intolerant regimes in the
region.<p>
<p>
<B>VIETNAM</B><p>
In contrast with the situation in China press coverage of sensitive issues,
such as official corruption has been possible although criticism of the party
or the leadership remained impossible in a media which remains
state-controlled. Human Rights Watch reported that a week-long seminar
organised in March for foreign journalists to provide training for Vietnamese
journalists was cancelled, apparently by security officials who had launched a
campaign against peaceful evolution in the press at that time.	<p>

<H1>Mission to free Indonesia's media</H1>
<p>
<p>
<B>An <A HREF="R5IFJ_Safety.html">International Federation of Journalists</A> mission to Indonesia in April has
found that official interference in the press has created a climate of
insecurity and fear.</B>
<hr>
<p>
The recent International Federation of Journalists' (IFJ) mission to Indonesia
found individual journalists are being victimised and threatened with the loss
of their livelihood, and that journalists and other media professionals are
inhibited from speaking openly about press freedom and democ-racy.<p>
Improper self-censorship has become the norm throughout Indonesian media, and the role of media in serving society is profoundly compromised particularly in a period of political uncertainty.<p>
The mission, which included Christopher Warren, Federal Secretary of the
Australian Journalists Association section of the Media Entertainment and Arts
Alliance, found that constant threats that publishing licences will be revoked
undermine professional solidarity and imperil freedom of expression.<p>
The mission met with editors, journalists, human rights groups, trade unionists
and media experts to consider the current difficulties for press freedom and
recent actions against members of the Alliance of Independent Journalists
(AJI). <p>
The mission found universal recognition within media that the conditions for
press freedom have deteriorated rapidly since the closure in June 1994 of
Editor, DeTik and Tempo. [Note: The Tempo closure was overturned in May by an
Indonesian court.] The IFJ mission recommended:<p>
* The abolition of the SIUPP system of issuing and revoking licences to
publications.<p>
* An end to the banning of independent publications and to the harassment of
individual journalists.<p>
* An end to the ministerial decree by which media policy is held hostage to the
political process.<p>
* That journalists Ahmad Taufik and Eko Maryadi and mediaworker Danang,
arrested on March 17 1995, should be released from custody immediately.<p>
* The introduction of a new legal framework for freedom of the press which
honours the practice of freedom of expression set out in the Indonesian
constitution.<p>
* The development and implementation of professional and trade union
co-operation and assistance programmes to enhance the quality of ethical and
independent journalism in Indonesia.<p>
* That further international missions and visits should be carried out.<p>
* That the IFJ and the Journalists Safety Service should continue to monitor
developments in Indonesia through the IFJ Asia-Pacific Regional Office in Kuala
Lumpur, and<p>
* That the IFJ and the international trade union movement should promote
regional and international solidarity with AJI and all independent
journalists.<p>
The mission was carried out by Aidan White, General Secretary of the IFJ, Ching
Chabo of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, Judit Neurink of
the Netherlands Association of Journalists, and Christopher Warren, of the
MEAA.

<h1>Sex, drugs and journalism</h1><p>
<p>
The competition between magazines in Australia is hot, and a good cover can
make the difference between pretty ordinary sales and a best-seller. The
difference that a cover can make has been illustrated by the Sydney Morning
Herald's Stay in Touch column's look at what sells and what flops. Comparison
of recent covers of New Scientist magazine found that bare bodies sell and
worthy stories don't - at least that's one conclusion that can be made.<p>
Talking this over with colleagues in the magazine industry brings varying
responses. Known personalities sell, upcoming ones don't; sex sells, starving
children don't; trim bodies sell, aging flab doesn't; illicit drugs sell,
Aborigines don't.<p>
It is grim to consider that two magazine editors told me that their lowest
selling covers featured Aborigines; but even grimmer to hear that they won't
ever use Aborigines on their front covers again. But shouldn't they be
reflecting society, which includes Aborigines? "We're in business, and we'll
run what sells," sums up the responses.<p>
So where does this leave Reportage, trying to sell magazines through
newsagents? Does this mean we should do puff pieces on the life styles of
`hairdo' journalists, and carry less of the negative side of our media's
propaganda?<p>
Course not! We'll continue to examine journalism and the media as has become
our fashion. We'll look at the good, the bad, and the ugly and try to point to
a path to better things. <p>
And we want to do a deal with our readers. The deal is this: we'll continue
putting out Reportage four times a year, and in return you can help us to
increase our readership. So, tell your friends about us; get your workplace to
subscribe; get your local bookshop to stock it; get your local library to
subscribe; ask for it in every newsagent you see; give gift subscriptions to
your friends; take out an ad in the magazine; and subscribe yourself. If you
are a journalist, ring and interview us about stories in each issue; use our
articles as free research material but give us appropriate credit in your
program or article. That's all we ask.<p>
As we go to press, legal sanctions on the media's reporting of the activities
of ASIS seem to be only a matter of time if the recommendations of the Samuels
Commission of Inquiry into ASIS are followed. <p>
The Inquiry final report recommended that the recommendations of the 1991 Gibbs
Report be implemented. The Gibbs Committee which conducted a review of
Commonwealth Criminal Law had concluded that there is an offence "where there
is publication by a third party recipient of information in certain specified
circumstances". So not only government officers who leak to the media, but also
journalists who report the information, could be subject to prison terms of up
to seven years.<p>
In the meantime we have reviewed in this issue the transcripts of the media
representatives who appeared before the ASIS Inquiry, and find that attitudes
to `the public's right to know' are varied.<p>
Our Special Report this issue is on the lack of analytical reporting on
Aboriginal deaths in custody. A Royal Commission was indeed held, but the
recommendatiions were made in 1991, and few of them have so far been
implemented. Wendy Bacon and Bonita Mason ask why this is a dead issue.<p>
The debate over the future of Australia's old growth forests reached new levels
when Canberra was blockaded by loggers earlier this year. Such highly
structured media events are sure to continue, writes Sarah Ford.<p>
Sharon Davis spoke at the Centre for Investigative Journalism's Hidden Stories
seminar about how journalists' enthusiasm for the South African elections waned
quickly when bloodshed didn't break out.<p>
Recently in Australia, Noam Chomsky spoke to Reportage and gave his thoughts on
how journalists can still manage to break the hidden stories when the
structures of journalism and the media mitigate such efforts.<p>
Alan Knight sees that Thailand's media is becoming the leader of the region,
and finds that `Asian sensibilities' are a cover for repression. Aidan White of
the International Federation of Journalists says that journalists must face the
issue of human rights head on. We also bring you the IFJ's latest country
profiles on media freedom in countries in our region.<p>
 Well-known journalist, Brian Toohey, shows us some of the rubbish written by
some business and economics journalists during the height of the
entrepreneurial 80s. Amazing reading this makes. We review two books this
issue. Linda Kaucher reviews Alex Carey's Taking the Risk out of Democracy, and
we also review a media guide for Aboriginal organisations. And there's lots
more - just take a look. In the next issue we'll bring that examination of the
High Court's implied free speech decision we mentioned last issue.<p>
Just a quick note on getting your copy of Reportage. Obviously subscribing is
the best way to guarantee you don't miss a copy. Many newsagents get just a few
copies which may sell really fast. If you want to know which newsagents in your
area sell Reportage, phone us and we'll let you know. Sales have been
spectacularly good; so good in fact we are increasing the number of copies
going to newsagents.<p>
Also some newsagents, it seems, return the copies of Reportage they get to the
distributor without having put them on the news-stand. One in inner-suburban
Leichhardt in Sydney, to whom Reportage spoke said he'd only display
established titles. "Like those Soldier of Fortunes over there?" "Yes," he
said.<p>
Media theorists examining why small publications face an uphill battle in
Australia can now add another restriction on freedom of speech to their list.<p>

<H1>Guest Opinion: When good news is bad news</H1><p>
<p>
In the cut-and-thrust of news and current affairs production, some stories
remain hidden because of a misery overload in the public, and some are hidden
because journalists think the story lies elsewhere. In an address to the ACIJ's
Hidden Stories seminar, Sharon Davis takes a tough look at how journalists
themselves can leave important stories untold.<p>
<p>
Early last year I was sent by the ABC to cover the elections in South Africa
for Background Briefing. It was an historic event that would end over 300 years
of white domination in that country and literally the eyes of the world were
watching. <p>
And when I say literally, I mean that there were over 2,000 journalists
covering that event in South Africa. Media conferences were like a football
scrum.<p>
I should have been able to guess the kind of news reporting that would follow.
Many news organisations unfortunately instead of sending their Africa
specialists, had sent their seasoned war correspondents. Talk in the bar at
night was of dodging bullets and which brand of flak jacket you were wearing.<p>
Not surprisingly because of this, when the great moment arrived - the election
- it was so peaceful, that these seasoned war correspondents very quickly
became bored. They came for a war, a blood bath between black and white, and
they didn't get it.  <p>
So by day two of the election, journalists in South Africa were around the bar
again talking about how boring this was. Just how many pictures could they send
back home of people standing in long queues voting? <p>
They were talking about where they were going to pack off and head to next.
Fortunately there was a war that had become rather bloody just up the road in
Rwanda. So they were all talking about heading off to Rwanda. <p>
That in itself was ironic because only three weeks before that, a journalist in
Australia, Tony Wright, had written a terrific column in the Sydney Morning
Herald about how difficult it was to get coverage of Rwanda in Australian
newspapers.<p>
A colleague of mine who had some interest in African affairs, when the fighting
actually started in Rwanda walked into his organisation and they said, "I
suppose you want to do a story on Rwanda.". Three weeks later with 500 bodies
floating down the river, suddenly Rwanda was in the news and all of these
people were packing off their stuff and heading off for it.<p>
The unfortunate thing was that while the voting in South Africa was the end of
one story, it was the beginning of another one, and a very important story as I
saw it. The majority party in the new parliament, the African National
Congress, had promised a number of things to the electorate that they would try
and redress the legacy of the past. <p>
That meant a new constitution. It meant compensation and restitution of land.
It meant housing, hospitals, education, roads, electricity, development. These
were all promised and, if successful, this program would literally turn South
Africa on its head and would have repercussions in the rest of the region as
well. <p>
The world's poorest country Mozambique sat only next door and South Africa's
social and economic transformation could have lessons for it, as well as
providing jobs in industry for the rest of the region - a region I might say
that we're used to seeing reported as an economic basket case.<p>
We're most familiar with the images of starving children, but what we're not
familiar with is the endeavours that people take in that region to actually get
the region operating economically.<p>
Now since the election as well, the government has been having a major problem
with the banks getting behind their reconstruction program. So, not only is
this reconstruction program being developed in this period but it's also had
all of these problems. But there's been almost no coverage of these events
since the election.<p>
Why not? Almost every news organisation around the world has either full-time
correspondents or journalists or stringers in South Africa, so it's not a
question of money. <p>
Many of these people file stories almost daily, so what it becomes is a
question of priorities and competing for world news space, and at the moment it
doesn't compete very well with things like the O J Simpson trial,
unfortunately.<p>
The competition particularly in world news terms, the competition for space, is
very driven by television. If there are good pictures coming from a region
around the world - and by that I mean pictures involving some form of conflict
- then television crews rush there. The radio and the newspapers don't want to
be left behind, so this kind of herd mentality goes on and that, I think,
drives the whole reporting.<p>
On the domestic front, in late 1993 I was approached by the Council for
Intellectual Disabilities to do a story on boarding houses. Even though the
Human Rights Commission had just delivered its report into human rights and
mental illness, the Council for Intellectual Disabilities were having trouble
getting politicians to face up to the problems that people with psychiatric
illnesses faced, and also people with intellectual disabilities, and they were
also having trouble getting any media reporting.<p>
Now as a result of that in early 1994, I spent a great deal of time with people
who live in a boarding house in Stanmore. I was shocked by their level of
disadvantage and powerlessness. They literally have no rights. They live in
appalling conditions. Their pension is taken from them. The management of the
boarding house controls their visitors and they don't even have a say as to who
shares their room.<p>
In this particular boarding house the management also had a series of
punishments. Any infringements of the rules could result in a loss of your
tobacco ration or your holiday, which is supplied by St Vincent de Paul. And
these rules seemed pretty arbitrary. <p>
The people in the boarding house lost their tobacco ration if they gave any of
their cigarettes away. Now we've all seen the occasional horror hostel story,
but what disturbed me about this and other boarding houses, is it's symptomatic
of the situation all over Australia. It's the system that allows these places
to continue and flourish that should be being reported on and isn't.<p>
At the same time, since the Human Rights Commission report, the government both
Federal and State have said they have taken a range of measures to address some
of these conditions, task forces and the like. But these are also lacking. <p>
In New South Wales for instance, the governments rely on people who have no
rights to report on their abusers and then risk homelessness. These things are
also not being reported. <p>
Perhaps it's because it's a down story. Perhaps it's because it a story where
you have to think creatively about how to report it again. In some ways stories
like this and unemployment, need journalists to think a bit more creatively
about how to report it. <p>
<p>
<p>
Sharon Davis has been responsible for revealing many previously hidden stories
on subjects as diverse as the Hilton Bombing case, police informers, boarding
house squalor, and democracy in South Africa. <p>
She has won the Walkley Award in 1993 and 1991 for Best Investigative Report on
radio. <p>
She has also won the United Nations Media Peace Prize in 1994 and 1991, the
1988 Human Rights Award for Best Radio Documentary, and was highly commended in
the 1991 Golden Quill Awards for Legal Reporting on radio. <p>
Sharon has been working on ABC's Radio Eye documentary program, and has worked
on Radio National's Background Briefing, Triple J's The Drum, and on 2SER's
Razor's Edge.<p>
She is presently in South Africa working on a training program for South
African journalists.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Hidden Stories `94</H1>
<p>
<B>In late 1994 some of Australia's most hidden news stories were exposed to a
wider public view. Peter Cronau introduces a new project of the ACIJ.</B><p>
<p>
Despite the deluge of news and information accessible through newspapers,
radio, TV, books, CD-ROMs, cable TV, and the Internet, some significant stories
are not getting wide coverage. In fact, they are effectively hidden from public
view. <p>
This theme was the subject of the Hidden Stories seminar held by the Australian
Centre for Independent Journalism in November at which numerous journalists and
others spoke of their experiences with stories that have been hidden.<p>
Most journalists know of stories that for a variety of reasons just fail to
break through. Sometimes reporters, editors and producers overlook good stories
in the rush to deadlines; sometimes the biases and preferences of reporters,
editors and producers see some stories ignored; sometimes a story stays
submerged until a "credible" source takes it up; sometimes a bigger event
displaces it from the news agenda.<p>
There is usually no conspiratorial cabal at work to keep a certain story out;
often it is a more subtle self-censoring and second-guessing how a story may be
received, that sees a story passed over. The commercial imperative that demands
the delivery of a certain audience profile to potential advertisers also plays
a part in eliminating some stories.<p>
No-one can say that stories about Aborigines, the unemployed, the environment,
the homeless, the disadvantaged, foreign aid abuses, failed diplomacy, human
rights violations, self-determination, political moral corruption,
scorched-earth economic policies and the like never get a run. But it's more a
matter of how those stories are portrayed, and how often.<p>
It was the lack of adequate coverage of these and other stories - but in
particular the scarcity of analytical coverage of Australia's role in events on
Bougainville - that in late 1993 suggested a role for the ACIJ in publicly
raising this "censorship", and in examining the reasons behind it. As
journalists ourselves, the idea of a Hidden Stories seminar seemed to offer the
chance to dig out the hidden stories and try to get them into the mainstream.
<p>
In the meantime the Centre received a visitor from Simon Fraser University in
Canada, Robert Hackett, who described a new project in Canada modelled on one
in the US, about stories that fail to get into the mainstream media. Project
Censored: Canada was launched in 1994.<p>
The original Project Censored in the US had been established in 1976 by Dr Carl
Jenson who is a professor of communication studies at Sonoma State University
in California.<p>
The US Project Censored has a team of qualified judges who sift through the 700
or so nominated censored stories each year to decide on the 25 top censored
stories.<p>
The visit to the ACIJ late last year of one of the judges of the US Project
Censored, Professor Jack Nelson, has given further impetus to the Hidden
Stories project idea.<p>
The first Hidden Stories seminar was held by the Centre in November in Sydney.
Over the next year the ACIJ will be developing the project and how it might
link in with both the US and Canada Projects Censored.<p>
In the meantime the Hidden Stories seminar verged on bursting at the seams as
the number of hidden stories nominated to the Centre expanded. Suggestions of
stories from journalists and others continued right up to the night and many
more were made during the course of the evening. <p>
One story raised by David Bowman was the lack of reporting on the poor and the
growing gap between rich and poor in this country. Very recently this has
attracted some media coverage.<p>
Contributions to the seminar came from a wide group including journalists,
environmentalist, researchers, academics, lobbyists, as well as the general
public. [See stories covered in Hidden Stories `94 in the box]<p>
The Hidden Stories project doesn't pretend to be able to take a comprehensive
look at the stories that are hidden from the public. We are working on a way of
doing that though.<p>
In the meantime the seminar provides a glimpse of some of the stories that are
being lived out largely under the noses of the Australian public and largely
without their knowledge. The publication here of some of those stories from the
seminar is a second step in the Centre's Hidden Stories project.<p>
Sharon Davis in the Guest Opinion piece for this issue describes how some
journalists treated the South African election and in our special report this
issue, Wendy Bacon and Bonita Mason look behind the lack of analytical
reporting on the rising rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody.	<p>

What do you mean by "censorship"?<p>
"a suppression of information, whether purposeful or not, by any method
including bias, omission, under reporting or self censorship, which prevents
the public from knowing what's happening in its society."<p>

<h3>ABC introduces self-censorship guidelines</h3><p>
<p>
British offence at Australian reporting of the "Liz and Phil down by the lake"
sculpture has forced the ABC to introduce editorial guidelines for
self-censorship for its international services. Reportage presents here a
leaked ABC policy document on the new guidelines.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>International Broadcasting</h3><p>
<p>
Broadcasting to Britain by the ABC, through Radio Australia and Australia
Television, is often perceived to be a cultural intrusion and - as practised by
some existing services - may not mean a neutral exercise in information
delivery. This does not mean, however, that Australia Television and Radio
Australia should not be mindful of the concept of `cultural intrusion'. <p>
Values expressed by Australian programs may conflict with the beliefs, mores
and self-identities of the recipient society of Britain, and television may
represent a more potent cultural challenge than radio.<p>
The new Australia Television service to Britain aims to be a distinctive
Australian service directed to a country of cultural diversity. It will reflect
Australian values in information, entertainment, sport and the arts while
striving for relevance and accessibility to the British audience.<p>
It is not possible to prescribe guidelines to reflect in full the different
values of all people in Britain. The guidelines below are designed to assist
editors and producers in meeting the general needs and expectations of a new
and different overall audience for the ABC.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Cultural Perspectives</h3><p>
<p>
Cultural sensitivities vary across Britain, both in nature and intensity, but
there are areas of common concern. In program selection and scheduling,
Australia Television and Radio Australia will be mindful of these concerns,
particularly in the area of entertainment programs such as drama and comedy.<p>
Examples of cultural sensitivity include:<p>
* Most Anglo societies, especially Britain, do not easily accept direct comment
or innuendo disparaging the authority, pride and self-respect of leaders and
their countries.<p>
* There may be a reluctance to reflect or have portrayed racial, ethnic or
religious differences or conflicts which may impinge on or threaten Britain's
national identity or sense of community.<p>
* Media in Britain may be reluctant to have depicted or reported events, even
in other and distant countries or societies, which may be seen as likely to
provoke agitation or communal tension - for example, demonstrations or conflict
for political, economic or religious motives.<p>
* Religious beliefs and practices vary widely and no absolute standards are
possible. However an awareness of, and respect for, the values of the region
will help to avoid unnecessary offence. For example, a cooking program which
showed the best way to prepare a rabbit dish, and which was broadcast during
the weekend of Easter, would clearly cause offence.<p>
* The deep respect in which Britain holds their Royal Family requires attention
to appropriate deference.<p>
* Media in the Britain tend not to report events as sensational.<p>
* Most societies, especially Britain, are sensitive in various degrees to the
nakedness of either gender in a sexual context. There is also particular
sensitivity to the public exposure of the female body, again in varying
degrees.<p>
* Satire and other forms of comedy casting disrespect may cause offence in
Britain.<p>
However the ABC recognises that the context of the material will determine its
usage and services will not distort or censor program material, particularly
information programs, in order to avoid the possibility of offence to one or
other part of the totality of its audience in Britain.<p>
It should be clearly stated that awareness of areas of sensitivity such as
those above will not mean that Australia Television or Radio Australia will be
restrained in any way from the full and accurate reporting and reflection of
events in the region, in the tradition of independence, authority and integrity
developed over 40 years by Radio Australia's news and information services.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Guidelines for International Reportage</h3><p>
<p>
Fundamental to Radio Australia and Australia Television must be identification
with their target audience, projecting Australian values honestly but with
sensitivity to other values that exist throughout Britain.<p>
Important editorial and programming assumptions shall include:<p>
* Australia is an integral part of the British region; Radio Australia and
Australia Television will operate as British regional broadcasters rather than
as `foreigners'.<p>
* The world view of Australia Television and Radio Australia will be centred on
Britain, with global and Australian domestic affairs being seen in that
context. Australian domestic issues and interests have a natural and important
place on the information and entertainment agendas of Britain.<p>
* While recognising that news content will vary on a day-to-day basis according
to the relative importance of news events, news bulletins will be based on a
mix reflecting its regional priorities, ie. England region, important world
news, then other Australian news.<p>
* Some expressions of Australian culture may be inappropriate for distribution
within other cultures.<p>
The citizens of Britain within Australia Television's target area will have
some knowledge of Australian culture. However it would be unwise to think there
is uniformity of cultural familiarity among those audiences or to assume that
familiarity equates with acceptance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Editorial Perspectives</h3><p>
<p>
The political cultures of Britain periodically are offended or angered by the
portrayal and reportage of them by the Australian media. The ABC accepts that
to some extent this is inevitable and will stand by the authority, integrity
and independence of the news, current affairs and information services provided
by Australia Television and Radio Australia based on the accuracy and balance
of their reportage.<p>
As stated above, Australia Television and Radio Australia will not censor or
distort their news and information output to avoid the possibility of offence.
However editors and producers will be conscious of the need for care in style
and presentation--much may depend on how a message is expressed. Media in many
British societies do publish and broadcast critical material, although their
language may be more circumspect than that used in Australia.<p>
<p>
<p>
Note: These guidelines are in fact the ABC's "International Services Editorial
Guidelines" used for broadcasting to Asia and are taken from the ABC Editorial
Policies of June 1993 - the only changes Reportage has made are geographical
alterations and the Easter rabbit details.<p>

<H1>Quick Grabs</H1><p>
<CITE>By Peter Cronau</CITE>
<hr>
<p>
<H3>Oklahoma: rednecks rush in</H3><p>
<p>
In the immediate aftermath of the ghastly Oklahoma bombing many fools rushed in
to lay the blame at the feet of certain Muslims. One threatening phone call
reportedly received by an American muslim organisation was: "Killing children,
you filthy animals. God is going to punish you. You're nothing but a bunch of
stinking animals. Your religion is shit. Die." Such intolerance and readiness
to condemn sprang forth from many rednecks until a redneck was arrested over
the blast.<p>
While the words of a few individuals may not have much authority, the words of
the media have much more influence. Restraint was required from the media at a
time of uncertainty over the perpetrator and without the legal process having
been even commenced. <p>
As stories about the Muslim threat started to tumble from journalists' tongues,
the Fairfax chief executive, Stephen Mulholland, in Dallas USA at the time,
chose to write an agenda setting piece for one of his own papers. It was
published on April 22 in the Sydney Morning Herald, under the heading, "A
nation is shocked into resolve".<p>
In trying to say that the US would seek severe "vengeance" on the "intruder"
even involving "foreign strikes", something "the Germans and the Japanese
learnt ... in the last war", Mulholland had got it wrong, very wrong. With
unintended accuracy, he backed up his revenge scenario with a short quote from
D H Lawrence. The quote: "The essential American soul is stoic, hard, isolate,
a killer".<p>
How true those words may be if the clean-cut all-American boys arrested for the
bombing are tried and found guilty.<p>
<hr>
<H3>Info highway deadend</H3><p>
<p>
Another in our series "Why the information superhighway will not set you
free".<p>
The demonstration of Microsoft's Encarta '95 - the world's biggest selling
encyclopedia - began with the full bells and whistles approach. After opening
the program, the operator offered to look up the entry for "leopard" and with
no further prompting needed from the rapt audience of journalists at the
special demonstration, clicked on the button for video. The leopard bounding
along through the savanna grassland looked very impressive.<p>
The Encarta '95 CD ROM offers a multimedia pathway to over 26,000 articles
"compiled by a full-time dedicated editorial staff". These articles are linked
with 7,000 photos and illustrations, 800 maps, eight hours of sound recordings,
and more than 100 animations and video clips. But just where is this info
super-pathway taking us? Read on.<p>
Leaving leaping leopards aside for the moment, Reportage entered the search
facility and keyed in the word "genocide" just to see how a more serious side
of human existence was covered by Encarta.<p>
No genocidal generals bounding along through the corpses here. The unadorned
text stated:<p>
Although the UN adopted international laws against genocide in 1948 genocide is
not prevented. In 1975 the Khmer Rouge despotic regime took over Cambodia and
brutalised its people. Cambodia's urban populations were evicted from their
city homes, driven to rural areas, forced into hard labour, and treated so
inhumanely many did not survive. Educated middle classes were automatically
executed. In 1979 the Vietnamese overthrew the Khmer Rouge but as many as three
million people had already been killed.<p>
Despite many examples to choose from, Cambodia has seeped into the collective
conscious as the archetypal case of genocide post-1945. But while it was as
massive as it was monstrous, it is not the greatest genocide in terms of the
proportion of a country's population obliterated. That honour goes of course to
East Timor.<p>
Various estimates including from no less than a recent Governor of the
territory, state a figure of at least 200,000 or about one third of the
population at the time of the UN-condemned but Western-supported invasion by
Indonesia. <p>
So Reportage opened up the search facility of this, the world's top selling
encylopedia, and keyed in the words "East Timor". Result? - no listing.<p>
We did some more searches and finally found a mention of East Timor buried in a
listing titled "Timor" inside the entry for "Indonesia". It seems Microsoft has
accepted what the United Nations has refused to accept and has repeatedly
condemned, that is that East Timor is a part of the Republic of Indonesia. <p>
What it did say of the illegal invasion and one of the greatest massacres this
century though was instructive - not of East Timor, but of the biases of the
Encarta database:<p>
Portuguese Timor including the region of Dili in the east and a small area of
Oecusse in the north-west, were forceably annexed by Indonesia in late 1975.<p>
We looked further but that one sentence was it, and genocide was not mentioned:
"Is there any more on East Timor?" Reportage ventured. "That is the article on
Timor, um," said the operator, referring to the one sentence. <p>
Just like all media before, the new medium of the info superhighway gives
access to only what is put in, what is made most accessible, and what is
marketed the best.<p>
<hr>
<H3>Just doing our job</H3><p>
<p>
As you'll remember, in January, Queensland police impersonated an SBS
television crew to arrest a forest protester. The deception involved the use of
forged SBS TV labels on a TV camera borrowed from the land developer the
protestor had opposed.<p>
This won the praises of the Acting Police Commissioner, Bill Aldrich who came
clean saying: "Police every day and in every state assume other identifications
ranging from plumbers, to clergy, to school-teachers, to doctors and
journalists in undercover operations".<p>
Now imagine that. A police officer lying to you saying they are a doctor,
presumably to get information you only wished to tell a doctor. Or the plumber
allowed into your house actually being a police officer entering your house
without producing a search warrant. Or the temporary teacher in your child's
class actually being a police officer looking to bust kids. Or a police officer
posing as a member of the clergy hearing your confessions.<p>
Imagine a police officer posing as a journalist to get information on
government whistle-blowers. In a siege will journalists now attract gunfire
just in case they are really police in disguise?<p>
One could ask too, why police did not pose as a clerical worker to get access
to the internal decision-making of the company intending to clear the trees to
allow the controversial Skyrail project to go ahead, to ensure no illegalities
there. Instead the police were assisted by the developer, and with the use of
some SBS TV labels and by lying, an arrest was effected. The protester was not
even charged with trespass, the stated reason the arrest was initiated.<p>
<hr>
<H3>Union unhappy with police deception</H3><p>
Queensland State secretary of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA),
Chris Perkins, wrote complaining of the impersonation to the Minister for
Police.  Perkins also met with the Police Media Liaison unit headed by Brian
Swift. <p>
Brian Swift says that following the meeting with Perkins, recommendations on
police posing as journalists would be furnished to the Police Commissioner. "We
are formulating a policy on potentially controversial trades," he says. <p>
According to Perkins and contrary to some published reports, the sometimes
heated meeting produced a result wholly unsatisfactory to the MEAA.<p>
Perkins says he did not agree to the content of the recommendations the Media
Liaison unit developed from the meeting, despite it being reported that he had.
In fact he unconditionally condemns the practice of police impersonating
journalists. "It should not happen," he says.<p>
Reportage gave Brian Swift the hypothetical example of a police officer posing
as a journalist to visit a school to get information from school kids on drug
use.<p>
"Yes, there may be occasions where police go under cover in schools," Swift
says.<p>
But as journalists? "That would be highly unlikely. We have to operate within
the law."<p>
Swift declined to let Reportage see a copy of the recommendations put to the
minister. However we understand those recommendations suggest that the tactic
of police posing as members of the media be used only in "exceptional
circumstances", but Swift refuses to define the word "exceptional". "We will
work that out as we go," he says. "There will be no pig headed approach by
us."<p>
<hr>
<H3>Excluding bystanders</H3><p>
<p>
The writer of a newsletter on the deaths of people in prison and police custody
[See article in this issue on the reporting of Aboriginal deaths in custody]
has received a commendation in the 1994 Media Awards of the WA Equal
Opportunity Commission.<p>
Jennifer Searcy won the award for her Death in Custody Newsletter which the
award citation describes as focusing "on raising awareness and working towards
equality of treatment for prisoners and detainees".<p>
In the newsletter, Searcy gives information about the circumstances of the
deaths of people in custody and jail. She also keeps statistics on the numbers
who die and details of their deaths. <p>
Searcy, by her extensive research work has become an acknowledged authority on
the subject. She is so up to date with the issue, she was able to publish in
July last year the 93/94 figures of deaths in custody, a full eight months
before their release in March this year by the Australian Institute of
Criminology.<p>
She found that in the 12 months to 30 June 1994 there were 85 deaths in prison
or police custody in Australia. Of these, 55 deaths were in prisons, 23 during
police operations (excluding bystanders), four in police lockups, and three in
juvenile institutions.<p>
Searcy can also give the longer term picture. From January 1990 to June 1995,
there were at least 231 deaths in custody, 37 of these being Aborigines.<p>
Searcy started researching the situation of deaths in custody and producing the
newsletter, following the death of her own son jailed over a minor traffic
accident. Her newsletter has a print run of 15,000 and is sent to journalists,
lawyers, judges, bureaucrats, politicians, and others.<p>
The bi-monthly newsletter is available from Jennifer Searcy, Campaign for
Prevention of Custodial Death, PO Box 847 Nedlands, WA 6009 (phone 09 386
4783). Donations are urgently needed to help keep the newsletter afloat. While
the newsletter is free to anyone who asks, Searcy would appreciate $10 pa to
help cover production costs.<p>

<H3>Update on British broadcasting ban</H3><p>
<p>
Loyal readers may remember an item from the second issue of Reportage in
January 1994. It is now one year since the lifting of broadcasting restrictions
that meant Sinn Fein leaders appearing on Australian TV with dubbed in actors'
voices. A spokesperson for Sinn Fein, Rita O'Hare, says, "For Section 31 [of
the Irish Broadcasting Act] and the British broadcasting ban to go in the past
year has had huge significance for Sinn Fein, presenting us with terrific
opportunities after all these years to get to people through the main media of
communication. ... I think there is no place in a modern democracy for the
powers of censorship against a particular viewpoint."<p>
<hr>
<H3>Lost opportunities</H3><p>
<p>
"The media are powerful sources of information and our group is concerned that
the Philippines and Australia are missing out on a lot of business
opportunities because of unfair and unbalanced reporting." So was launched a
new group aimed at improving news coverage of the Philippines and Australia.<p>
The Filipino Journalists Alliance of Australia (FJAA) aims to be a
non-government resource for Australian media on things Philippines, and is
composed of Filipino journalists now living in Australia.<p>
"All we read, see or hear about the Philippines in Australian media are
scandals, natural disasters or the Marcoses as if these are the only things
readers are interested in, and as if these are the only things of importance
happening in the Philippines," says FJAA spokesperson Evelyn Opilas.<p>
"On the other hand, Australians victimising Filipinos get attention in
Philippine media as if Australian pedophiles, wife bashers and drunkards make
up the majority of Australia's population.<p>
"While we cannot deny the accuracy of most of those negative stories,
Australian readers will not get a fair picture of life in the Philippines if
this is all they read about."<p>
People wanting information about the Philippines or with enquiries about the
FJAA should be contact them at PO Box A846, Sydney South 2000; or by phone on
(02) 633 3494, (02) 787 3887, (02) 372 5234, or 015 70 6929.<p>

<H3>New Pacific Journalism Review</H3><p>
<p>
Another advance for the South Pacific Centre for Communication and Information
in Development (SPCenCIID) at the University of Papua New Guinea is the launch
of a journal, the Pacific Journalism Review.  The journal examines Papua New
Guinea and Pacific regional journalism, news media, information and
communication issues. Contributors to the first issue just published include
news media practitioners, broadcasters, journalists, and researchers.<p>
Edited by UPNG journalism lecturer, David Robie, and senior UPNG journalism
student, Tande Temane, PJR contains a range of issues including censorship,
propaganda, women in the media, and ethical issues for journalism. The first
issue also examines Fiji PM Rabuka's relationship with the media, the role of
Christian media, and attacks on journalists.<p>
Pacific Journalism Review is distributed and sold on subscription throughout
the Pacific and other regions. It is a valuable resource for people in the
media, researchers and media students. The first Review is 98 pages and is
published in book form.<p>
Further information from: The Director, South Pacific Centre for Communication
and Information in Development (SPCenCIID), UPNG, Box 320, University PO,

<H3>News media in the Pacific Island nations</H3><p>
<p>
The news media in the South Pacific may be small, but the region has a diverse
and vibrant mass communications industry. Ranging from the PNG Post-Courier
(circulation 41,000) and Fiji Times, to the fortnightly Tuvalu Echoes and
monthly Madang Watcher, from EMTV's national broadcasts via the Indonesian
Palapa satellite to Niue's tiny television unit, from PNG's National
Broadcasting Commission's Kalang and Karai services to Tokelau's traffic and
weather broadcasts: the media caters for an audience and readership scattered
over many islands and atolls. In French Polynesia, for example, the radio and
television stations broadcast to 160,000 people spread over an ocean territory
as large as Europe. Niue has a population of 2000; Papua New Guinea has more
than four million.<p>
The first comprehensive resource book on the South Pacific news media, Nius
Bilong Pasifik, was launched in January by the University of Papua New Guinea
Press, in association with SPCenCIID and the ACIJ. In the book, 18 prominent
Pacific journalists and media educators explore the nature and problems of the
region's mass communications industry. <p>
The book includes chapters on ownership and control in the Pacific, democracy
and the media in Tonga, the PNG Internal Security Act and crime, the greening
of the media, TV's clash of culture and content, New Caledonia's Radio Djiido,
bias and race tagging dilemmas, the lost plot in Fiji, regional organisations
and the media, and Australian media coverage of the Bougainville crisis.<p>
Edited by University of PNG journalism lecturer and author David Robie, this is
a unique book of value to all interested in the Pacific, as well as journalism
students, sociology and political science researchers and professional
journalists. The 280-page book has an extensive country profile section on each
Pacific nation with a map, social and political information and details of the
news media.<p>
The book is distributed in Australia by the ACIJ. For orders and inquiries
telephone (02) 330 2488. Price $19.95, plus $3 postage and packaging. See order
form at back of Reportage.<p>

<H3>El Salvador media update</H3><p>
<p>
Apparently El Salvador's new independent weekly, Primera Plana (PP), has struck
a few problems. Angered by the competition media barons from the big dailies El
Diario de Hoy and La Prensa Grafica are making the newspaper's life difficult,
reports Vivien Altman, who wrote the article on El Salvador's post-war media
that appeared in Reportage Summer 1994/95.<p>
There are reports that PP is finding it hard to sell advertising copy and it
seems even some of their distributors are being harassed. "Boycotted," PP's
director Horacio Moya told Altman. "It's implicit, rather than explicit."<p>
PP is a new 24 page weekly describing itself as an "adventure, a responsibility
and a challenge in this new historical moment". "The paper wants to contribute
to the development of a democratic culture," stated an editorial. The paper has
taken a stand against the predominant machismo of Salvadoran society and
carries a regular column written by a feminist group.<p>
Launched last September, the paper is now selling more than 8,000 copies a
week, although circulation is considerably lower than hoped for. Moya told
Altman he is optimistic: "We've broken the back on advertising, pulling in more
money than we were."<p>
With El Salvador being an largely oral culture, finding a market for the paper
is not easy, says Altman. One medium term plan is to sell copy in the US where
a fifth of the Salvadoran population lives. But right now the biggest obstacle
is to capture a slice of the local Salvadoran market.<p>
<hr>
<H3>Psst, Bougainville</H3><p>
<p>
A dossier of reports of human rights abuses occurring on the island of
Bougainville was launched at the NSW Parliament House Theatrette on May 1.  The
document lists possibly hundreds of deaths and attacks on civilians on the
island since the conflict broke out into guerilla warfare in 1989. Titled,
Marilyn's List, the report was compiled by Marilyn Havini who lived on
Bougainville for 20 years and is married to a pro-independence Bougainville
Interim Government member.<p>
The reports are drawn from the now-shut Bougainville newspaper, Arawa Bulletin,
from PNG's Post Courier, the PNG Times, interviews with refugees, Amnesty
International, reports from relief agencies, as well as press releases from the
Bougainville Interim Government.<p>
The dossier, by putting on the record details of abuses, must be seen as a
challenge to those in the media and governments of PNG and Australia who deny
and downplay the reports. It would make sense if there was some way an
independent organisation could investigate and report on the claims, now that
fighting on the island has declined. At present in many of the instances
recorded, the media is faced with opposing truth claims by opposing sides of
the conflict. <p>
Now in terms of news events such a launch would normally expect to attract a
small group of reporters, prepared to ask hard questions of the author and to
perhaps later seek government responses to the document.<p>
But no, we are talking about Bougainville. The credibility of groups
campaigning for Bougainville in Australia seems at an all time low, partly due
to unfair attacks on them, partly due to their own actions. <p>
So how did the media treat the launch? With almost complete silence - the media
scrum at the launch consisted of one journalist. An organiser of the launch
said dozens of media outlets were invited, but that just a single journalist,
from community radio station Radio Skid Row, attended the launch.<p>
Reports did run on Radio 2SER and the ABC's Indian Pacific program, as well as
Radio Skid Row.<p>

<H3>Revising anniversaries</H3><p>
<p>
At a time of anniversaries as there have been lately, a great struggle often
takes place by historians and revisionists trying to establish their
interpretation of events as the true story, often spilling over into the media.
On April 29 celebrations greeted the 225th anniversary of the landing of
Captain James Cook at Kurnell in Sydney, and interestingly the local mayor used
the occasion to apologise to Aboriginal people for the effects of the British
invasion. <p>
A re-enactment with the new Endeavour showed the kids what a jolly chap was old
Cook. But the news reports and articles left out one uncomfortable fact:
Lieutenant Cook shot an Aborigine on the shore before he had even placed a foot
on the soil of the Great South Land. <p>
After a stone was thrown at his longboat, Cook shot at several gathered people,
with one man who was shot several times seen running away bleeding profusely.
Maybe this could be added to reports of the next anniversary.<p>
On April 28, as a part of its extensive Vietnam War End coverage, the Sydney
Morning Herald stated: "1964 - North Vietnam attacks US destroyer Maddox in
Gulf of Tonkin. US bombing of North Vietnam begins". This event had been the
pretext for the massive escalation of the US war effort, with the first US
combat troops being landed early the next year. Great, only thing is it never
happened quite that way. It is now generally accepted that the destroyer was in
fact within North Vietnamese territorial limits and had been shelling supply
bases within North Vietnam; there's even doubt as to whether the Maddox was
attacked at all. You'd think at a time of commemoration and admissions that
fighting the war was wrong, we could at least be told who started the war.<p>
But the biggest blooper was the effort of Army Magazine, the official magazine
of the Australian Army. They wrote that the Vietnam War ended on 27 January,
1972. Tell that to the Vietnamese, you may say. The war continued for three
years and three months after this date, with Saigon being captured by North
Vietnamese forces on April 30, 1975. The executive editor of Army Magazine,
Captain Eric Combe, says it was an error, though the date is uncannily close to
when the main part of the Australian force, the Australian Army Task Force,
departed Vietnam. So when did the war end for Australian troops?<p>
The SMH ran a piece revising several myths of the Vietnam War: "In fact all
Australian troops had been withdrawn from Vietnam by the end of 1971". But that
was wrong too. It was not until December 11, 1972, that the newly elected
Whitlam government announced that the Australian Army Assistance Group was to
be withdrawn within three weeks. Capt Combe says that the last Australian
troops to leave Vietnam were the Australian Logistics Support Group in January
1973. He also tells of the very last two Australian soldiers, members of the
Army PR unit, fighting on the gangway to be the last to leave.<p>

<hr>
<p>
The best thing about The Indigenous Media Manual is that this is no dry
textbook giving a mere academic view of how the media should cover Aboriginal
affairs. Its hands-on advice to Aboriginal people in their dealings with the
media is to take control, to ensure that they get their message across.<p>
Try this example of taking control from one of the people interviewed for the
book, Michael Mansell of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service: "If it is not
a live studio interview and you feel you did not go well, ask the interviewer
to repeat the question".<p>
Such simple but powerful advice comes from Mansell's years of experience in
dealing with a sometimes hostile media, and reflects his knowledge of how the
media works. He knows that at best just a short grab will appear, so an answer
repeated without bloopers will more likely be used.<p>
The Indigenous Media Manual aims to improve the ability of Aboriginal people to
provide the media with positive images of Aboriginal business. Rhoda Roberts,
an Aboriginal journalist on SBS's Vox Populi, writes in the Introduction to the
book that the positive image of sportsperson, Cathy Freeman, has shown that to
be Aboriginal is to be "original, talented and proud".<p>
"Her brilliantly conceived act changed the debate about Aboriginal affairs in
this nation. No longer are we, indigenous people, prepared to be seen as
victims, a threat or criminals. And we believe that positive images in the
media are the way to make people change their views," says Roberts.<p>
Put together by the Jumbunna Centre for Australian Indigenous Studies,
Education and Research, based at the University of Technology, Sydney, this
book will help empower Aborigines in their dealings with the media.<p>
To my knowledge it is the first generally available book of its type to address
Aboriginal people as its primary audience. A guide put together several years
ago by ATSIC in Perth titled Yarning With The Media, is no longer available.
Most previous books and guides have spoken to the general audience of mainly
non-Aboriginal journalists who are interested in writing on Aboriginal
issues.<p>
Among those titles, Signposts: A Guide For Journalists, published by the ACIJ
and co-edited by the editor of the present work, and Lester Bostock's, The
Greater Perspective: A Guideline For The Production Of Film And Television On
Aborigines And Torres Strait Islanders, a guide prepared for SBS TV, are the
most useful.<p>
Several Aboriginal communities have also developed their own media guides, such
as the Yuendumu-based Warlpiri Media Association's guidelines for media
covering Aboriginal issues in Central Australia.<p>
The team assembled by the Jumbunna Centre to put the manual together was led by
the editor, Dianna Plater, with co-editor Rhoda Roberts. The researchers on the
manual, Marnie Aquilina and Fiona Smith, are both Aboriginal students in BA
Communications at the UTS.<p>
The manual leads people through the process of presenting themselves to the
media, by first asking what it is people want from using the media. <p>
Once that is clear the manual describes who owns the media and how it works. It
tells what sort of stories get a run, and reveals the ethical obligations of
journalists. And it describes step-by-step hints on how to get on good terms
with journalists.<p>
There is a chapter on writing a press release and handling an interview. The
book even has a chapter on what to do when the news is bad, and how to make
conflict work for you.<p>
At the end is a guide to complaining about the media, just in case. There is
also a guide to the essential media outlets in the country together with fax
numbers, the ideal thing for an organisation wanting to get its message out.<p>
A criticism of the book could be its length, at just 74 pages. But in the real
world people working in Aboriginal organisations and in community organisations
don't often have the time to wade through anything much bigger.<p>
The advice provided in the present manual will prove useful to many normally
powerless groups and not just Aboriginal organisations. Every progressive
community-based organisation would benefit from using this book.<p>
George Negus, veteran journalist<p>
now with the ABC's Foreign Correspondent, says in the book the best advice on
dealing with a hostile media is to "either ignore them or answer in a
non-hostile way". He suggests Aboriginal groups trying to get balanced coverage
not be dissuaded by the negative reporting of some media outlets.<p>
"You will encounter some journalists and media that are biased, if not racist.
So it is good advice to not trust any journalist's judgement. Be aware - they
cannot always be trusted to have balanced reporting."<p>
Negus suggests to try to spread across many media outlets. "When you do find
journalists that support Aboriginal issues and are striking for balanced
reporting, exploit them. The media exploits you for their benefit, do the
same."<p>
And there are some tactics that Negus suggests can give an Aborigine being
interviewed the upper hand in an interview. "You will most likely know more
about the issue than the interviewer - this is especially true in Aboriginal
affairs. This is also a good psychological ploy. For example, if a journalist
asks you a question or makes a statement that you know is incorrect, say so."<p>
Sometimes though the media gets itself into a hunting frenzy in trying to cover
a bad news story about Aborigines. Cameron Forbes of The Australian believes,
however, it is possible to salvage an interview that is concentrating on a
negative side of a story. "If you have investigated the issue to be reported
and are honest in your interview - that is, honest about the good and bad
points - you can at least turn a negative story into a balanced one."<p>
That is what this book is mainly about - turning what has largely been a
negative story into a balanced one. Here's a selection of the sometimes
surprising advice that the book provides.<p>
Ray Martin of Channel Nine's Current Affair: "Make general comparisons with
whites. With any public money, there is always a risk of somebody ripping off
the system. If you are being accused of an alleged misuse of funds, remind the
interviewers of the Skases and the Bonds. Remember reporters are always looking
for scapegoats, so if the story is about single parents ripping off funds, say
it is only a handful, not all and there is a need to tighten the system."<p>
Marcia Langton of the Cape York Land Council: "Always work out first of all
whether what you are saying is `on the record' or `off the record'. Make it
very clear if you want what you are saying to be reported or not."<p>
Lester Bostock, media consultant: "Personal opinions are not wise. Always have
prepared statements. Be aware of not being pushed into making personal
comments. Say what you have to and leave. This applies to print, radio and
television media."<p>
Robert Tickner, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: "Journalists' questions are
often based on wrong assumptions. If I am caught with those sorts of questions
I always return to basics in answering."<p>
Jack Waterford, deputy-editor at the Canberra Times: "Aboriginal people should
invite more people into their community. Be more proactive ... Let reporters
know what you believe is the future for Aboriginal affairs and what particular
concerns need to be addressed."<p>
Others whose advice is included in the manual are Paul Murphy (SBS TV), Paul
Lyneham (ABC TV), James Button (Time Australia), Barbara McCarthy (ABC TV),
Alan Knight (UTS), Debra Jopson (Sydney Morning Herald), Michael Shoreston
(Centralian Advocate), and Diana Simmonds (Bulletin).<p>
The advice they provide will help Aboriginal people get a more positive and
realistic picture across to the public through the media.<p>
But sometimes no amount of preparation can save the day, as Michael Mansell has
found out: "When doing an interview on Real Life, Stan Grant welcomed me in the
studio saying `G'day brother'. When we went to air the first question he threw
at me was an attack and I was not prepared for it as he had been quite friendly
and I thought he was on-side. But I guess Stan was just doing his job."<p>

<H1>Taking the Risk Out of Democracy:</H1>
<H2> Propaganda in the US and Australia</H2>
<p>
<p>
<B>By Alex Carey<br>
Edited by Andrew Lohrey<br>
UNSW Press, 1995, $19.95<br>
ISBN 0 8640 358 X</B><p>
<CITE>Reviewed by Linda Kaucher</CITE>
<hr>
<p>
Do you remember a time when our culture had other values besides economic
rationalism ? <p>
Do you remember when workers generally believed that unions were on their side,
defending them against exploitation?<p>
Things changed. Unions came to be seen often as coercive forces, operating
against workers' interests. Any social values not based on corporatism and
economic rationalism became marginalised, and difficult to support. The
"collapse" of communism in the Eastern Bloc was, in the eyes of the economic
rationalists in the West, proof that there was no alternative to unrestrained
capitalism.<p>
So how did this cultural change happen? <p>
Taking The Risk Out Of Democracy attempts to show how Australian corporate
propaganda has deliberately created this cultural change over the past 20 years
in Australia, and how this is a flow-on from the free-enterprise propaganda
that has shaped US society this century.<p>
Noam Chomsky wrote the foreword to this collection of essays, published after
the death of the author, Alex Carey. When Chomsky launched the book on his
recent visit to Australia, he acknowledged both the groundbreaking nature of
Carey's work and how much it had influenced his own work.<p>
In these essays, Carey traces the history of corporate propaganda from the
early years of this century, when it was formulated in the USA as a reaction to
the growing strength of the International Workers of the World organisation
(IWW). He describes the part that McCarthyism played in creating a
free-enterprise culture, and how propaganda techniques used in the USA have
been taken up so strongly and effectively in Australia over the past two
decades.<p>
Using the terms "grassroots and treetops propaganda" he defines the different
levels on which public opinion manipulation operates.<p>
The purpose of what he has called "grassroots propaganda" is to reach "as vast
a number of people as possible in order to change public opinion so that it is
sympathetic to business interests". This includes: discrediting unions,
diverting worker's attention from pay and working conditions by introducing
worker participation in low level decision making, and creating a perception of
a connection between free enterprise and patriotism.<p>
"Treetops propaganda" is aimed at "the leaders of society". "Its immediate
purpose is to set the terms of debate, to determine the kinds of questions that
will dominate public discussion - in a word to set the political agenda in ways
that are favourable to corporate interests." It includes the activities of
think tanks, which produce, promote and disseminate market oriented "policy
research", the pressures placed on government to introduce legislation and on
academics to produce research that suits the corporate purpose.<p>
In the Australian context, Carey quotes Hugh Morgan, the head of Western Mining
Corporation whom he calls "the noisiest of apostles for the vision of a
democracy where minds are safely guided by the dominance of
corporation-sponsored think tanks". Morgan has said that politicians "can only
accept what is accepted in the opinion polls. So you have to change public
opinion". Note Morgan's recent statements on how the Mabo decision has caused
insecurity in the mining industry.<p>
Spelling out the tactics, organisations and key people in the manipulation of
public opinion, Carey reveals the patterns in a coherent form, allowing readers
to recognise the forces that affect the direction of our society. Recognising
and naming propaganda is a vital step in defending against it.<p>
"The twentieth century," Carey wrote, "has been characterised by three
developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth
of corporate power, and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of
protecting corporate power against democracy." Since his death in 1988, these
have developed further, and some of his hopes for resistance have proved
inadequate. This important book provides fundamental information for people who
want to resist the tide of corporatism.<p>

The IFJ Safety Fund has been established to aid journalists attacked for
telling the truth.<p>
<p>
The 1990s have been years of hope for democracy in Europe, of racial equality
in South Africa, and of renewed hope for peace in the Middle East. But they
have also been years of unprecedented violence against journalists.<p>
In response to the growing number of attacks the International Federation of
Journalists launched the "The IFJ Safety Fund" in 1992.<p>
This Fund provides humanitarian aid for journalists and their families. It
helps pay legal costs when journalists have to defend themselves. It gives
support and encouragement to journalists in all corners of the world, many of
whom feel isolated and defenceless.<p>
All member unions were asked to campaign for the fund, to prepare their own
material in the local languages and to collect donations, not only in the
framework of the union but, beyond that, by asking media organisations to give
their support.<p>
Journalists in need from all countries in Asia-Pacific, whether they are
members of the IFJ or not, can apply for assistance from the IFJ Safety Fund.

Viewpoint by Morris Roy Toragaia (Lae, Morobe Province)</B><BR>
Anyone who suppresses democracy has an evil motive - CRC's obsession to control to media is no exception.
<P>
Their motive is to prevent the media from exposing the wrongs and evil doings
of the government, which means the population will be fed with false and
misleading information.
<P>
As educated Papua New Guineans, we must ask ourselves, are we heading for a
dictatorship or what ? We are now witnessing the truths and realities unfolding before our eyes. CRC is headed and controlled by politicians. Ben Micah and his cohorts won't feel the negative impact of their decisions as they are very, very comfortable and living in paradise. 
<P>
What about us the three-and-a-half million people, especially our brothers and sisters that live in villages and remote inlands, making up about 80 per cent of the population?
<P>
My parents used to say to me: "Why worry if you have nothing to hide ?" Here we see CRC worrying. Their mission statement seems to be: "Cling on to power at any cost." 
<P>
Sadly, we the people will suffer the consequences. They no longer care about the suffering, pain and misery they have bestowed upon us. We must not let this group continue insulting the intelligence of the majority.
<P>
For our future generations, I urge all educated citizens to be critical and
question the CRC ploy. I urge all politicians to vote from their hearts and
with conscience. Papua New Guinea is our motherland .... let us prevent any
ill-concieved fantasies that will erode or is now eroding the fabric of our
society. 
<P>
Let demcracy prevail! Let media freedom prevail! God save Papua New Guinea.<BR>

PORT MORESBY: A meeting of journalists held at the Granville Motel here on Saturday decided to revive the Papua New Guinea Journalists Association (PNGJA).
<P>
An interim executive committee chosen on the occasion vowed to make the association a body that journalists can count on.
<P>
Post-Courier's chief political reporter Neville Togarewa was voted unanimously as interim president by the meeting.
<P>
He said the meeting was long overdue and journalists now, more than ever, needed to stand together to protect their profession.
<P>
Mr Togarewa and journalists from various news media organisations stressed the need to stand together against the challenges facing the profession.
<P>
The Independent's editor, Dominic Kakas, appealed to all working journalists to support the revived PNGJA as it was lack of support and interest that had it deregistered earlier.
<P>
Interim treasurer Ambie Bulum said lack of commitment by members was the reason that killed the former association.
<P>
The interim executive will look at various issues concerning journalists, including the Constitutional Review Commission-sponsored Media Accountability Bill that will be brought before Parliament which resumes session tomorrow.
<P>
Chief Ombudsman Simon Pentanu, who delivered the keynote address at the meeting, said: "You must revive the association and I wish you all the best.
<P>
"Let us be frank. There will always be opposition to press freedom all over the world. This opposition invariably comes from people and institutions who do not like truth being disclosed," he said.
<P>
"Truth will always hurt some people. But the truth is the lifeblood of any decent and honest society, which is the sort of place we should be trying to make Papua New Guinea," Mr Pentanu said.
<P>
"The truth is certainly something worth fighting for and maybe its even something to get 'savage' about. I wish the revived PNGJA all the best in its endeavours. You do have a fight on your hands. But I know that in the end truth will always prevail," Mr Pentanu said.
<P>
PNG Trade Union Congress General Secretary John Paska offered his support to the association and said unionism is about fairness and justice in bread and butter issues of an employee and professional issues.
<P>
He said the PNGJA will be an avenue for journalists to speak on these two areas.
<P>
Mr Paska gave suggestions on how to run the PNGJA and what can be done to make it strong.
<P>
The executive includes senior reporter of The Independent Abby Yadi (vice-president) and The National's business editor Cletus Ngaffkin (secretary).<BR>

<h1>Baing admits trying to stop EM TV program</h1>
<Font size=3><B>PMW05 The National (PNG): 2 October 1996
<P>
<HR>
<P>
In Parliament by Philip Kepson and Kevin Rale Pamba</B><BR>
PORT MORESBY: Forest Minister Andrew Baing yesterday admitted in Parliament that he had made four attempts to stop EM TV from broadcasting a program on Bougainville.
<P>
EM TV had broadcast an exclusive program involving an EM TV news crew interviewing rebel leader Sam Kauona last Sunday.
<P>
Mr Baing said he telephoned EM TV four times to try to stop the station from going ahead with the program because "it appeared to be promoting the rebel activities and was not suitable for public viewing".
<P>
Mr Baing made the admission when replying to a poser from Lae MP Bart Philemon during question time, to admit or deny that he had telephoned EM TV and interfered with its programming last Sunday.
<P>
"I rang up EM TV to stop the program because it appeared not to be in the interest of the people. Everything that appeared on the screen was all promotion of rebels' activities," said Mr Baing.
<P>
EM TV's news editor, Titi Gabi, said yesterday that Mr Baing had called four times whhile the program was on air, adding that the station had performed its normal duty as a media organisation.
<P>
"We played our duty and that was to try to inform the truyth about what was happening on Bougainville. However, it was not our role to promote any one party's interest on any subject or issue. And if anyone has taken us wrong about our Sunday's program, we owe no apology to anyone," said Ms Gabi.
<P>
She said a copy of the program had been given to Prime Minister's Department Secretary Noel Levi and his staff for viewing the previous Monday with the hope of getting their view on it before the broadcast on Sunday, but they had failed to turn up.
<P>
The program, entitled <B>The Ultimatium</B>, contained an interview with Kauona in which he threatened to execute five security force hostages unless troops are withdrawn from Bougainville and the island's independence is recognised.
<P>
Said Mr Baing: "As far as the government is concerned, the program must be in the interests of Papua New Guinea as a nation.
<P>
"And we do not allow press in this country to advocate and promote issues that are detrimental to the nation.
<P>
"The press of this country must have a responsibility to report and encourage unity in this country.
<P>
"It cannot go and put in the title of the program Sam Kauona gives an ultimatum to this government, it (program) encouraged that we should talk about disunity," Mr Baing said.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Media Council of PNG said it hoped that this was a one-off incident.
<P>
"This is frightening if politicians think they can pick up the phone and stop a television station or newspaper running a story," said Anna Solomon, council chairperson and editor-in-chief of The Independent newspaper.
<P>
Ms Solomon said the council would wait to hear from EM TV before considering lodging a formal complaint against Mr Baing.

PORT MORESBY: Constitutional Review Commission chairman Ben Micah yesterday
branded Chief Ombudsman Simon Pentanu as "unprofessional" for his remarks
on the issue of media accountability.
<P>
"If journalists or the Chief Ombudsman are playing funny games to derail
this (the media accountability recommendations), they are wasting their time.
It will be passed in Parliament," Mr Micah told a press conference at
Parliament House.
<P>
Parliament resumes at 2pm today and the Media Bill is among the priority
bills to be debated and passed.
<P>
Mr Pentanu, in a keynote address at a workshop jointly organised by
journalists and the Friedrich Erbert Foundation on Saturday, said: "I cannot
hide my disappointment at the way in which the CRC has been allowed to
manipulate such crucial human rights issues such as press freedom.
<P>
"What they are basically trying to do is to legislate to further suppress
and undermine the weak and the vulnerable; that is the people out there who
make their views known through the media."
<P>
Mr Micah said: "He (Mr Pentanu) has acted in a very irresponsible and
unprofessional manner by going public."
<P>
He said: "There is no recommendation to suppress press freedom in the
country as claimed by the Chief Ombudsman and other critics of the task
placed upon the CRC by the National Government and endorsed by Parliament."
<P>
Mr Micah said there is no manipulation of any rights and challenged Mr
Pentanu and other critics to show specific proof of their allegations.
<P>
"Mr Pentanu's assertion that the CRC is manipulating certain rights is
totally wrong.
<P>
"I condemn his statement and have come to the conclusion that either he has
not read the report or not understood it. It would appear that he has jumped
on the bandwagon which may have a vested interest in distorting the true
recommendations of the report."
<P>
He said the CRC recommendations for Media Accountability Bill will seek to
keep the media accountable for its actions.
<P>
Mr Micah said leaders who take public office do so with the knowledge that
if they breach the Leadership Code they will pay the ultimate price from
being dismissed from office.
<P>
"Why shouldn't journalists or the media be penalised for their wrongs? They
are not rights unto themselves."
<P>
Mr Micah said the predominantly foreign-owned media, like any corporate
business, should adhere to the laws of this country. And the government as
the supreme authority has the right to make laws for the country, he said.
<P>
The CRC has also recommended the formation of the Communication and Information
Authority.
<P>
The authority, Mr Micah said, will be responsible for issuing licences to
media companies and other related issues.<BR>

<h1>Press freedom and responsibility</h1>
<Font size=3><B>PMW06 The Independent (PNG): 11 October 1996
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Letter to the Editor, The Independent</B><BR>
I LIVED for ten years under President Banda's dictatorship in Malawi, southern Africa. Press freedom was virtually non-existent. So it was like a breath of fresh air coming to Papua New Guinea and seeing how much freedom the press enjoys here. But sometimes I feel it goes over the top.
<P>
To illustrate my point, I refer to two recent letters in the Post-Courier. The first, attempting to what I would call character assassination of Mr Peter Barter, the Provincial Affairs Minister.
<P>
While the writer (who hasn't the courage to reveal his true identity) is fully entitled to express his views about Mr Barter's figures on poker machines, he ends his letter: "It is no wonder that all provincial government claims of a lack of funds are prevalent and remain unresolved by Mr Barter as minister".
<P>
Apart from being both an illogical and unreasonable conclusion, such a wild generalisation comes extremely close to defamation. By adding: "God help our provinces and God help our people," Mr Trump boarders(sic) on the blasphemous. In certain countries, Mr Barter would be within his rights to sue for defamation.
<P>
As a journalist, I"m not in the business of promoting any particular politician. I let their record speak for itself.
<P>
As a politician, Mr Barter's, I think, is quite impressive. Look at the many social, health and educational care projects he promoted and sponsored in Madang. They would be the envy of many politicians and constituencies. It came as no surprise when he was asked to join the cabinet to bolster its image and calibre.
<P>
This brings me to the second letter (dated October 2), where Mr Public Servant blames Mr Barter for attempting to trim the public service. Again, everyone is entitled to share their opinion and feelings but when such views turn into a bare-faced personal vendetta, then press freedom is being used irresponsibly.
<P>
Mr Public Servant presumes Mr Barter created the present crisis. But look at the facts. He's only been in the caninet a few months. Sinvce then he's been on the road for a great deal of that time, travelling to most of the 19 provinces trying to sort out the mess.
<P>
Ending the letter with the comment, "but why when we pay you politicians many peanuts, do we get so much monkey business" is not only derogatory but tarnishes all politicians with the same degree or (sic) ineptitude. In my opinion, such remarks tilt dangerously towards possible libel.
<P>
Press freedom is an invaluable asset for any developing country. It should be fiercely protected. Debate and disagreements must be aired.
<P>
But a press that allows defamatory and spiteful attacks to go unchecked, whether they are against Mr Barter  or any other politician or public figure, does not help provide constructive and informed debate.

By Neville Togarewa<BR>
The Constitutional Review Commission made an eleventh-hour decision to hold "intensive two-week consultative meetings" to discuss Bills relating to media accountability.
<P>
It took the decision after meeting at Parliament House on Monday and yesterday morning to consider and approve the Information and Communication Media Commission Bill.
<P>
Although the commission said in a statement that its decision was prompted by "goodwill", the Post-Courier was told last night that commission members had been told to expect a political backlash if the Bills were tabled in their present form.
<P>
The Information and Communication Authority Bill seeks to establish an
authority to "regulate" and "control" licensing of TV, radio, and newspaper
companies. The Media Commission Bill, if passed, would give the Government power to "register" journalists.
<P>
The implication is that only "registered" journalists would be allowed to work as reporters.
<P>
Commission members at yesterday's meeting  were warned about a political backlash from a public concerned about government tampering with freedom of expression and freedom of the press.
<P>
There was a strong possibility that media accountability would become an
election issue, they were told.
<P>
The commission released a statement saying chairman Ben Micah had received unanimous support from his commissioners for further consultations on the two Bills, and on proposed laws relating to freedom of information, copyright and defamation. 
<P>
A spokesman said that although the Bills had been prepared from
recommendations of the Commission's report on media accountability, "it
would be proper that interests groups from media and from telecommunication industry look at the draft laws and discuss with the CRC any areas of concern."
<P>
"What we may not see as restrictive could be viewed by others as restrictive," the spokesman said. "What we may see as an initiative to bring in more accountability could be viewed by others as control measures. That is why we must come to some understanding and compromise for the good of all concerned."
<P>
The commission appointed one of its members, PNG Trade Union Congress general secretary John Paska, to head a three-man committee to conduct the consultations.
<P>
The two members are Alotau MP Iairo Lasaro and Kiriwina-Goodenough MP Gerald Beona.
<P>
The Bills would be deferred and then submitted to Cabinet for approval before being presented in Parliament.<BR>

Editor of the Post-Courier<BR>
The Post Courier Limited, publishers of the Post-Courier, yesterday declared its commitment in the future of Papua New Guinea.
<P>
Chairman Peter Chegwyn told the company's annual general meeting the board had a "very positive" view of PNG's future.
<P>
"Turning to politics briefly - and I must say reluctantly - we are often accused by politicians and others of being negative about PNG by highlighting issues such as law and order problems and political corruption.
<P>
"On the contrary, South Pacific Post has a very positive view of Papua New Guinea's future.
<P>
"We have demonstrated our confidence iin PNG over many years through our continuing investment in new technology and training - amounting to many millions of kina," Mr Chegwyn said.
<P>
Mr Chegwyn said: "The media plays a pivotal role in a democracy.
<P>
"Our challenge is three-fold: Firstly, to properly inform the people of Papua New Guinea; secondly, to accurately record the unfolding history of the nation; and thirdly , to stand up firmly when we believe the national interest is not being served.
<P>
"In meeting this challenge, we sometimes come into conflict with people in powerful positions.
<P>
"We are happy to accept constructive criticism of our role in PNG affairs, but we will not resile from our commitment to the People of Papua New Guinea.
<P>
"Turning to so-called foreign ownership, News Limited, the major shareholder in South Pacific Post, does not regard itself as a "foreigner" in PNG.
<P>
Mr Chegwyn said he was proud to say that of the 225 staff employed by South Pacific Post, 213 were Papua New Guinean men and women drawn from every province in the country.
<P>
Some were shareholders of the company, he said.
<P>
"We are very proud of our Papua New Guinean staff and we are committed to providing on-going training to ensure our people reach their full potential.
<P>
"News Limited - the world's leading communications company - has a strong, long-term commitment to its shareholders, staff, readers, advertisers and commercial printing clients in this country," he said.
<P>
As an example, Mr Chegwyn said the company had just spent K300,000 on upgrading its cybergraphic computer system, giving staff a state-of-the-art platform from which to move to full pagination of editorial and classified pages.
<P>
This investment put the company at the forefront of newspaper technology and
would result in lower overheads, fewer mistakes and better-looking newspapers
for our readers and advertisers, he said.
<P>
"We have budgeted to spend K250,000 this financial year on a major upgrade of the Goss newspaper press," Mr Chegwyn said.
<P>
"This will significantly improve our press's color printing capability, giving our advertisers the quality they demand in this increasingly color-conscious market.
<P>
"The company's recent investment of over K1 million in an advance color scanner
and a four-color computer-controller Komori press has been vindicated. Post Printing is now recognised as the number one quality color printing house in the South Pacific."
<P>
Mr Chegwyn said to maintain that commitment, large amounts of capital investment would be required in the coming years to enable the company to continue to bring the benefits of communications technology to the people of PNG.
<P>
"Sound investment decisions can only be made when the investor has a reasonable belief that the ground rules are not going to be changed midstream," Mr Chegwyn said.<BR>

<H2>Sixth Channel Inquiry</H2>
<BR>
This inquiry was set up to decide what permanent use should be allowed for the final free-to-air terrestrial television channel available across Australia.
<BR><BR>
Since 1992 Community Television groups have been licensed to conduct test transmissions on the sixth channel in all state capitals and some regional areas.  This will end before mid 1997.  Apart from continued use by community television other potential uses being considered include an arts channel, a childrens channel, a womens channel and a variety of non-broadcast uses.  The inquiry is being conducted by the Australian broadcasting Authority who are required to report to the Minister for Communications and the Arts by February 1997.

Lawyers back death penalty against critics.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Lawrence Fong</strong><p>

A University of Papua New Guinea academic has defended the country's reintroduction of the death penalty despite Amnesty International's latest strong condemnation.<P>

Yoli Tom'tavala, international law lecturer in the university+s law faculty, said yesterday that Amnesty International advocated what it was set up to support - protection and promotion of human rights.<P> 

But the organisation's condemnation could not stop PNG retaining the death penalty.<P>

"From PNG's point of view, there is no rule or law disallowing the practice of death penalty. It is perfectly okay and legal and conforms with our law," he said.<P>

Mr Tom'tavala was commenting on the London-based human rights organisation's new report, "Papua New Guinea: The death penalty - not the solution". The report condemns the Government over reintroduction of the death penalty. <P>

The report said an appeal against a death sentence was imminent, but this could not be confirmed with the Supreme Court registry. <P>

Charles Ombusu, a young man convicted of rape and wilful murder, was sentenced to death last year. His appeal is pending. <P>

The Amnesty report said PNG's decision to reintroduce the death penalty in 1991 was an "impulsive reaction" to public anger over violent crime. It added that the Government had not taken sufficient account of "strong and prominent opposition" within PNG to the death sentence. <P>

Mr Tom'tavala said: "PNG is not one of the countries which have adopted the international convention or agreement that outlaws the death penalty, therefore it is not bound by any international law to stop it." <P>

Mr Tom'tavala said even though people might have different moral views, PNG's position was clear on legal grounds. Section two of the Criminal Code Amendment Act "allows for a person who commits wilful murder to be liable to be sentenced to death".<P>

Tony Regan, another law lecturer, echoed Mr Tom'tavala's legal views, saying the death penalty was constitutional but it was up to the courts to decide whether it was appropriate.<P>

But he also said there was no link between the death penalty and reduced crime anywhere in the world. There had also been cases where innocent people had been executed.<P>

Environment campaigner blasts media as 'too soft'.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Aiva Tamate and  Raphael Semel </strong><p>


<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>


A grassroots speaker at last week's media freedom seminar has accused the news media of being "controlled" by Government and big business.

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475>
<td width =295 align left>

<br>Joseph Ka'au, a former Wantok editor and now campaigner for Greenpeace Pacific, said news media were too lenient on political leaders. <P>

He urged reporters to "hear the cries of your people" and cover resource development issues more rigorously.<P>

"I think the media have got more lenient today - they have got softer," he said.<P>

"I think they've got deeper into bed with Government and big business. They've forgotten the small people."<P>

He cited Porgera, Kutubu and Ok Tedi as examples of how the public should be asking questions about how the news media was performing.<P> 

"The media should be accountable to this country ... to the people of this country," he said.<P>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>

Last year, BHP had allegedly helped the Government of Papua New Guinea draw up legislation to "effectively stop our people from exercising their basic democratic right" to claim fair compensation for environmental damage, Mr Ka+au said.<P>

"In my view that legislation also effectively indicated that Papua New Guinean judges cannot be relied on to make fair and sound judgments on such claims. Now, it is a non issue."<P>

Last December, a national doctor had alleged on a television program that a person living along the Lagaip/Strickland River had died from possible chemical poisoning.<P>

"The program showed also that Porgera Joint Venture was probably discharging more heavy metals into the river system than allowed and that it had no compliance criteria for mercury -- a highly toxic chemical once in the food chain," he said.<P>

"What are we waiting for? Ten more people to die? One hundred more people to die? You tell me.<P>

"Two months later, zero media interest." <P>

Mr Ka'au recounted his experience as a journalist covering the temporary halt of the Kutubu oil pipeline construction by angry landowners in 1992. He claimed 
several stories of his were not published in the face of hostile industry pressure.<P>

"More problems are emerging now at Kutubu. Sosoro Hewago is rightfully asking for his share now," Mr Ka'au said.<P>

"I would suggest that he ask his cut -- maybe 10 per cent from Chevron and another 10 per cent from British Petroleum. The initial dissatisfaction was expressed back in 1992."<P>

Mr Ka'au claimed reporters needed to be from the streets or jungles of PNG to adequately report about the effect of policies on grassroots life. <P>

"How many of us from the media world can raise our hands and say, 'Yes, I used to collect bottles in Port Moresby to feed, cloth and educate myself?'" he asked.<P>

He also attacked the reliance by many PNG journalists on "fax and telephone journalism."<P>

Jessie Waibauru, president of the Journalism Students Society, criticised some media organisations for hiring unqualified staff in place of graduates or professional journalists.<P>

"This undermines our qualifications and the commitment by students to become ethical and professional journalists," she said. No organisations were identified, but it is understood some students are particularly concerned about a radio station.<P>

Menei defies court in  leadership feud.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Staff Reporters </strong><p>


<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>

A national student leader at the centre of a bitter student politics feud
yesterday defied a summons to appear in court for alleged defamation.<P>

Leslie Menei, president of the Student Representive Council at the University
of Papua New Guinea, and also elected leader of one faction of the
controversial National Union of Students, was assaulted by students opposed to
his leadership on Monday.
</td><TR>
</TABLE>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475>
<td width =270 align left>

<br>The next day he was served with the summons demanding that he appear in the
Boroko District Court.<P>

Mr Menei did not go. But he told Uni Tavur yesterday the differences over
leadership were 'on the verge of reconciliation'.<p>
  
His lawyer, Aloxy Donigi, appeared in court on his behalf.<P>

"Normally 14 days' notice is given to allow a defendant to prepare for the
case. I was only given two days - that isn't on," Mr Menei said.<P>

NUS president Mathew Parep, who served the summons, alleged that during a
debate at the campus forum on May 18 Mr Menei had branded him a "conman" and
his officials "conmen".<P>

He has also sought an injunction preventing Mr Menei using the NUS name. Mr
Menei denied any defamation. Mr Menei said, "I never implicated anyone, it was
a general statement."<P>

He appealed to student leaders not to stir up trouble as students prepare for
next month's examinations.<P>

On Monday, Vice-Chancellor Dr Rodney Hills intervened to break up a fight
between Chimbu and Engan students. <P>

He said it was only a small group of students who were unable to behave
themselves.  <P>

"They should be ashamed of themselves," Dr Hills said.<P>

"This is not the behavior of a university.  Students should not resort to
physical intimidation to solve problems."<P>

Mr Menei was attacked during the fight and his glasses were smashed.<P>

The fight broke out over a notice demanding Mr Menei's resignation on Monday.<P>

Earlier, on Saturday night, students broke into Mr Menei's room and ransacked
it. The SRC office was also broken into.<P>

The notice said: "Too may secret meetings with corrupted officials and
accepting bribery (sic). Moreover, students are losing confidence in his
leadership.<P>

"Leslie Menei should resign ... [he] must go."<P>

An Engan student ripped down the notice and Chimbu Students Society president
Aula Kobale demanded that it be put back. <P>

Another notice, signed by a Chimbu official, accused Mr Menei of victimising
Chimbu students in stories which had appeared in The National, Post-Courier and
Uni Tavur.<P>

said  :  "You must try to work together so that you develop a happy environment." <p>

Speaking to student journalists in the new Uni Tavur  newsroom this week, Dr
Hills said he had been to many  universities throughout the world - including
Princeton and Harvard in the United States - before coming to PNG. <P>

Comparing  UPNG with other universities, Dr Hills said one of the ingredients
lacking at Waigani campus was a friendly working relationship between students
and staff.<P>

"In many other universities, students feel comfortable discussing anything with
their lecturers - be it a problem or an exchange of ideas on any issue," he
said.<P></TD>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align =left>
Dr Hills called for a series of evening seminars and lectures where students
could come together and participate in lively discussions.<P>

He gave an example where staff and students could produce drama and draw crowds
back to campus.<P>

Dr Hills also stressed support for freedom of the press.<P>
"I believe in freedom of the press. However, the press should be accurate," he
said.<P>

Training of journalists was important and reporters should be aiming for
responsibility and accuracy in their careers.<P>

"Crime and violence on campus are often associated with alcohol and drugs and I
want these out of the way to achieve a good university lifestyle," Dr Hills
said.<P>

Since taking office six weeks ago, he has made several bold moves to tackle
violence problems, including introducing better campus lighting. <P>

<Font size= 5>Greater autonomy 'the key' to Bougainville <font size= 3><p>

<strong>By JOSEPH MOROKANA</strong><p>
		Bougainvillean leaders have reaffirmed their stand in support of greater autonomy for the province to end the eight-year-old civil war. And a politics academic at the University of PNG has called for a federal system of government.<P>
		The Regional Member for Bougainville in the National Parliament, John Momis, and South Bougainville MP, Michael Laimo told Uni Tavur greater autonomy for Bougainville was the best solution to end the fighting. <p>
		They said that it was up to the National Government to negotiate with the people of Bougainville for a lasting solution to the fighting. <p>
		Their comments come in the wake of reports that Security Forces have been harassing villagers in "pacified" areas. <P>
		Mr Momis said: "There must be a constitutional guarantee to involve the people of Bougainville in the affairs of their province."<P>
		 He said there must be some form of decentralisation of power to the citizens of the country. He also condemned the provincial government reforms. <P>
		"The next round of peace talks can come after peace and reconciliation," Mr Momis said. <p>
		Mr Laimo called on Bougainville leaders in Government-controlled areas to continue peace dialogue for more autonomy. <P>
		He urged the leaders not to wait for the Bougainville Revolutionary Army to decide for them because "they"ll never do that while hiding in the bush". <P>
	Mr Laimo said he hoped the situation would be controlled without inflicting more deaths on civilians.<p>
	Dr Ray Anere, head of UPNG's politics department, told a seminar on Bougainville that the nation must change to a federal system. He said the present system had limited flexibility, had lost its "legitimacy" - because of military and restoration expenses - and was unable to maintain peace.<P>
	Dr Anere said that unless the Government considered changing to a federal system, it would face prolonged security operations and restricted basic citizens' rights.<P>

Campus repairs crisis hits uni.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Micheal Miise </strong><p>

	The University of Papua New Guinea is facing a crisis over maintenance of its facilities, including staff housing, student halls of residence, the library, lecture theatres, fire-fighting equipment and toilets on the Waigani campus. <P>
	Staff association spokespeople and other lecturers are critical and concerned about funding cuts for the university.<P>
	But a K16 million European Union aid program planned soon for UPNG is expected to improve facilities.<P>
	The university is currently operating on a K27 million budget this year - K12 million less than the budget asked for from the Government. Among maintenance problems on campus :
<UL><LI> Air conditioning in the Michael Somare Library has been crippled for more than six weeks, causing damage to books and microfilm records. 
<LI> Air conditioning problems have also hit the main lecture theatre and the arts lecture theatre has had power problems.
<LI>Housing repairs and maintenance are said to be a standstill. 
<LI> Routine repairs in classrooms have faced long delays. 
<LI> The journalism broadcast studio has been crippled by lack of repairs. 
<LI> Toilets are described as in a "shocking" state with little maintenance or cleaning.
<LI> The number of cleaning staff has been slashed from 41 cleaners to 20. 
<LI> Fire-fighting equipment around campus is missing or in a poor state of repair.
<LI> Maintenance in student dormitories is left undone - in one case no repairs or clean-up has been done two weeks after a fire damaged a room in the Dame Mary Kekedo hall.</UL><P>
	The European Union will soon sign a K16 million project to build and rehabilitate facilities at UPNG.<P>
	Head of delegation David MacRae said the project funds would be divided between the Goroka campus, medical faculty, creative arts faculty and the main Waigani campus.<P>
	Bursar Weusi Tafawa confirmed Fletcher Morobe would construct five buildings at the Waigani and Taurama campuses. Work would begin in June or July.<P>
	 Kametan Parkop, president of the National Non-Academic Staff Association, told Uni Tavur: "A lot of major maintenance needs to be done in the university and some houses need to be demolished, but the university has no money." <P>
	A law lecturer and past president of the University Overseas Staff Association, Ted Hill, said: "Some houses require maintenance, but resources must be allocated where they are most needed.<P>
	"Money should be spent on security rather than on housing." <P>
	Another academic, a resident of Tenth St, said: "I+m very disappointed - the key of my door was broken inside the lock in 1991 and I have made requests to maintenance but nothing has being done.<P>
	"We only lock the security door, we cannot lock the inside door because the broken key is still inside."<P>
	Buildings and estates head Whitney Kawage said repairs had already been started on staff houses.<P>
	"We have had maintenance requests for sbout 55 houses and we are trying our best to do repairs for all of them," he said. <P>
	"However, my boys cannot attend to all of the requests at the same time. I only have four groups of four men who are working."<P> 	He added that he had only taken up his position last October and funds had already been exhausted.<P>
	"This year our budget has been reduced so we cannot renovate all the houses to what they were like before - we'll only do small repairs." <P>
	The main lecture theatre has been without lights for about three weeks and its air conditioning has been out of order for six weeks. <P>
	The Michael Somare Library's air conditioning has also been out for six weeks. But small units have been installed.<P>

EDITORIAL : A free student  press and it's responsibility.<font size= 3><p>



Uni Tavur was founded in 1974 as a journalism training newspaper. Originally it was published by students under an autonomous journalism diploma program based at the University of PNG but funded by the New Zealand Government. <P>
	During the past 21 years, Uni Tavur has enjoyed a tradition of editorial independence which is appropriate for a journalism education newspaper. Its objective is to provide a training ground for our journalism students to apply their theoretical knowledge to "real life" news coverage, commentary and ethical dilemmas.<P>
	In the past there has been no attempt by any university administration to compromise this basic editorial independence, even at rare times when the administration hasn+t been happy. This is a newspaper, not a university administration PR publication.<P>
	Uni Tavur is also largely self-funded. No desktop publishing facilities have been provided by the university -- all have been given by outside donors. The printing bill at the Post-Courier is met by trust funds raised by the sale of advertising. Last year's petition to the administration by journalism students for help, particularly for broadcast equipment, went largely unheeded. <P>
	Four years ago, Uni Tavur was a simple A4 format newsletter produced with rusty typewriters. Today it is a professional tabloid with an electronic edition on the Internet. It has also won awards.<P>
	The International Federation of Journalists code of conduct supported by the PNG Journalists Association includes: The first duty of the journalist is respect for truth and for the right of the public to truth ... In pursuing this duty, the journalist shall at all times defend the principles of freedom of honest collection and publication of news, and of the right of fair comment and criticism ... The journalist shall observe professional secrecy regarding the source of information obtained in confidence.<P>
	 In recent weeks we have faced some pressure from the administration over our reporting of the Dr Topul Rali affair. Former chemistry head Dr Rali was a high-profile academic paid by the state; his alleged actions last December were a very public affair involving UPNG staff and property. Such a major incident should not be masked by secrecy. It is not a "private disciplinary matter". We reported the truth about the inquiry - and the subsequent University Council decision to dismiss Dr Rali - in accordance with journalistic ethics. The public has a right to know.<P>


And we wish to assure our readers that we will continue reporting news in the public interest without fear or favour.<P>

UNI TAVUR ON LEAVE.<font size=3><p>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=475> <TD width= 475  align=left>
<P>
Uni Tavur is taking a well-earned break from publishing during the second semester 1996. Our print lecturer, <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/PJR/david.html">David Robie</A>, is on research leave and budget cuts for the university have had an impact. Regular advertisers and subscribers will be given a credit for the semester. We'll be back as usual next year.
<P>
But we haven't shut down completely for the semester. A leaner A4 newsletter version of the paper, <A HREF="UniT_toktok.html">Uni Tavur Toktok</A>, is being produced by the students and <I>Post-Courier</I> subeditor Francis Uliau instead. With help from the <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/">Australian Centre for Independent Journalism</A> on this website, this electronic newspaper will be updated. Watch also for Ita Diba and <A HREF="http://acij.uts.edu.au/PJR/index.html">Pacific Journalism Review</A> on the Web -- or try our <A HREF="http://www.pactok.net/docs/nius">Papua Niugini Nius</A> site.

Maori expert slams Hagahai 'outrage'.<font size= 3><p>

<strong> Staff Reporters </strong><p>

A Maori expert on indigenous intellectual, social and cultural property rights has challenged Papua New Guinea to press a case with the World Court over the "immoral and unethical" Hagahai cell line patent issue.<P>
	 Aroha Mead, deputy convenor of the Maori Congress in New Zealand, told Uni Tavur this week indigenous people in the Pacific were "outraged" over the Hagahai patent.<P>
	"We challenge the morality of Westerners extracting DNA samples from indigenous peoples without their full and informed consent," she said.<P>
	 PNG's High Commissioner to NZ, Damien Gamiandu, has been quoted saying PNG plans a protest against a US bid to enforce the worldwide patent. However, this has not been confirmed by the PNG Government. <p>
	The director of the PNG Institute of Medical Research, Dr Michael Alpers, defended the patent, saying it would safeguard Melanesian rights, not exploit them.<P>
	He said the institute would host a seminar on the issue at the University of PNG in August to raise public awareness and establish guidelines. 
	"The discovery came from the blood of the Hagahai individuals," he said. "The scientists involved did not exploit the people." <P>
	The Hagahai people had agreed to the research project before it began.<P>
	 Dr Alpers said the Hagahai patent had been turned into a global issue by Canadian non-government organisations which were concerned over life patenting.<P> 

	He said there was just a slight chance of commercial benefit from the patent. This would be shared between the Hagahai and the developer.<P>
	 Last month, Dr Alpers said in a Uni Tavur column it was better to have the Hagahai as part of the patent than to "have taken the ethical stance not to be involved and to have allowed all the rights to reside in the US." <P>
	The patent is for the PNG "human t-lymphotropic virus", or HTLV-I. In many countries, the metropolitan strain causes forms of cancer and paralysis and is spread through blood transfusions, but the Melanesian variant is disease-free.<P> 

	Ms Mead said this week: "Although many traditional cultures may not have the words for 'genetics' or 'DNA', most have strong customs protecting the sanctity of hair, blood, and saliva and mucus - the three sources of DNA most commonly tapped by Western researchers.<P>
	"The Hagahai patent is immoral and unethical but it is not unique - this is occuring all over the world."<P>
	Ms Mead said this was why the Hagahai patent was a global issue. <P>
	"Yesterday it was a Guaymi woman (from Panama). Today it is a Hagahai man from PNG. Tomorrow it will be a Solomon Islands man and other indigenous individuals," she said.<P>
	Ms Mead said the patent was not an issue of improved Hagahai health, or even PNG health - "it is about money, prestige for the 'inventors', racism, colonisation and greed."<P>
	She said the Canadian-based RAFI (Rural Advancement Foundation International) was preparing a case for the World Court to rule on the legality of human genetic patents.<P>
But a case needed to be brought by a Government and PNG was best placed to lodge a claim.<P>

<B>Item One - Coalition Media and Communications Policy</B>
<BR><BR>
Even before the Prime Minister announced March 2 as the Federal Election date, the Coalition was hitting the streets with its media and communications policies.  As a rapidly evolving sector in which reviews of cross-media ownership, telecommunications regualtions and the final free to air television channel are imminent, the election will have a lasting effect on media and communications in this country.  The coalition policy ha raised some hot issues - the hottest being its proposed sell-off of one third of Telstra.  In the case of Telstra, the coalition policy states that consumers will only receive maximum benefit with a signifiacnt private shareholding.  However the Consumers Telecommunications Network disagrees- saying that any sell-off will weaken Telstra's sense of social responsibility.  Michael Dwyer asked Shadow Minister for Communications and the Arts Senator Richard Alston, if the Consumers Telecommunications Network had it wrong...

<B>Item Two -	The Year Ahead With ...the Communications Law Centre</B>
<BR><BR>
Even without the  Federal Election, 1996 was going to be busy year in the media and communications sector.  Michael Dwyer spoke to Sue Ferguson, the Research and Policy Advisor at the Communications Law Centre ans asked her to provide an overview of 1996.  While much has been said about the Coalitions proposed sale of Telstra, this is just one part of a large policy package .  In her guide to 1996, Sue Ferguson begins by discussing some other important elements of the Coalition media and communications policy...

<B>Item Three -	Community Television and the final free-to-air TV channel
</B>
<BR><BR>
Of great interest to the community broadcasting sector will be the review of the final free to air television channel.  Known as the sixth channel or channel 31, it has been used in recent years by community television.  A review of the use of this channel is now required by the Broadcasting Services Act - and community television is competing with several other potential uses for the channel.  To gain a quick picture of the year ahead for community television, Michael Dwyer  spoke to Television Vice-President at the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, Mandy Grubb, and asked whether the priorities of the inquiry disadvantaged community television...

<B>Item Two - LocalVision: Optus joins the Community Television Sector</B>
<BR><BR>
1996 is set to be a big year for community television with its future depending on a review into the permanent use of the sixth channel.  It's a sensitive period - so the appearance of a new community television model is causing some concern.  This is particularly the case as the model is being put forward by the communications giant - Optus.  Last week OptusVision lauched the first in a series of LocalVision cable community television stations.  Exusting community broadcasters have complained that the community access model used by Optus is flawed.  So what is LocalVision and is it really community television?  Michael Dwyer asked LocalVision Co-ordinator in Western Sydney, Judith Franz, what LocalVision could offer that existing community television models could not ...

<B>Item One		Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance on the Federal Election</B><BR>
<BR>
In 1993 the Federal government received strong support from the arts - including the film and television production industry.  Come 1996, the Coalition has been careful to court the arts industry- with some major policy turnarounds since the last election.  In film and television this has meant a commitment to retain current funding levels for major bodies such as the Australian Film Commission.  The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) represents many workers in film and television - Michael Dwyer asked Joint Federal Secretary Anne Britton, for her opinion of the Coalition policies . . .

<B>Item Three		Australian Television and International Mediascapes</B>
<BR><BR>
Over the past twenty years we've heard much about globalisation of the media.  Some critics have seen this globalisation as an exercise in cultural imperialism - with Western media products swamping local cultures.   Others see more subtle, differentiated or reflexive  movements between and within cultures.  "Australian Television and International Mediascapes" is the name of a new book on Australia's place within the global flow of television programs.  The book is co-authored by Professor of Communications at the University of Technology Sydney, Liz Jacka, and Associate Professor and Director of the Centre for Media Policy and Practice, at the Queensland University of Technology, Stuart Cunningham.  Michael Dwyer asked Professor Jacka where the book fits into globalisation debates…

<B>Item One - Consumers Telecommunications Network on the Election and the Year Ahead</B><BR><BR>

Telecommunications has continued to make news in week two of the Federal Election campaign.  Despite the ALP and Democrats agreeing to block the part sale of Telstra in the Senate,  the Coalition was still claiming that the sale would go ahead and would pay for their environmental policy.  The Comsumers Telecommunications Network is a national policy and lobby group for telecommunications consumers.  Michael Dwyer asked Acting Director Gerard Goggin for his comments on the year ahead, on the election and on the sale of Telstra ...

<B>Item Two	-	AUSTEL report on telecommunications national code released</B>
<BR><BR>
Many residents and councils are up in arms over optical fibre networks and mobile phone towers in their streets.  Under pressure to build-up their customer bases, companies like Optus, Vodafone and Telstra are rapidly expanding their communications infrastructure.  The Federal Government has made this building program easier by exempting the companies from the usual local planning procedures.  Angry at the powers given to telecommunications companies, residents and councils have conducted many protests and have taken their claims to the courts.  This backlash led to a review of the planning exemptions set out in the Telecommunications National Code.  Michael Dwyer asked General Manager of  at AUSTEL John Haydon what were the main recommendations of the review...<BR><BR>

<B>Item Three	-	Media Reporting of Indigenous Issue</B>s <BR><BR>

The standard of media reporting of indigenous issues has long been of concern.  Having just passed through the International Year for Tolerance you might be excused for imagining things would change.  Not according to 
Dr Michael Meadows, Senior Lecturer in Print and Broadcast Journalism at Griffith University.  He argues that good journalism requires a dialogue between the reporter and the subject - something he doesn't see happening in the reporting of indigenous issues. So what is the importance of this dialogue...

<B>Item One -		CBAA Speaks on the Federal Election</B><BR>
<BR>
There are a  lot of issues and policies you could take into the voting booth on March 2. Maybe it's the economy, or health, or the environment that will sway you.  But since you're listening to community radio, you might be interested in the position of major community radio organisations. This week you'll hear from General Manager of the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, Mike Thompson, and President of the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasting Council, George Zangalis. While the Coalition has released a detailed media and communications policy including $4.5 million for community broadcasting, the Australian Labor Party is yet to put their position. Smaller parties especially the Democrats and the Greens have also been supportive of the sector and increased funding for community broadcasting. I asked Mike Thompson what he thought of the Coalition package ...

<B>Item Two -		NEMBC Speaks on the Federal Election</B><BR><BR>

Within the broader community broadcasting sector there are a number of smaller organisations who represent stations with more specific interests. Two influential organisations of this type are the National Indigenous Media Association of Australia - or NIMAA, and the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasting Council. Next week we'll speak to Brett Leavy, Acting Executive Officer for NIMAA. They're still trying to get answers from the major parties - particularly the Coalition, who left the indigenous sector out of what was otherwise a comprehensive policy. The President of the NEMBC is George Zangalis. I asked him how he felt about the Coalition policies ...

<B>Item Four -		Report Released on Caller Number Display: Privacy Issues</B>
<BR><BR>
BEGINS WITH GRAB ( do not use)<BR>
<BR>
Our attention has been to privacy this week because of the release of a report on calling number display. The report was produced by the Privacy Advisory Committee at AUSTEL. Most simply, calling number display refers to technology which allows the phone number of someone calling your phone to be displayed as it rings. There are many benefits of this technology - for both callers, and those receiving calls. For example, for people receiving calls, it allows screening for nuisance and harassment callers. However, the technology also raises substantial privacy issues and these are recognised in the report. Before raising these issues I asked Sue Harlow - a member of AUSTEL, to explain the benefits of call number display in more detail ...

<B>Item One		Community Radio joins the Community Information Network</B>
<BR><BR>
The Community Information Network is a pilot project co-ordinated by the Department of Social Security.  Its aim is to provide access to the internet and computer information services for people who would otherwise muss out.  The information on the network is especially tailored to the concerns of people  on low incomes or with special needs.  Computers have been placed in many community centres - such as libraries - from where people can log into the information network.  Community Radio stations are about to join the list of community centres that provide computer access and information for the network.  It's a recognition of the role that community broadcasters play in the community.  Co-ordinating the project for the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, is Matthew Arnison.  Michael Dwyer spoke to him about the information currently available on the Community Information Network...

'From Sand to Celluloid' is a travelling collection of new indigenous films.  They were produced by first time directors as part of the Indigenous Drama Initiative.  This project was announced in the  1994 Creative Nation policy and has been supported by the Australian Film Commission, the SBS, the Australian Film Institute and several national and state film bodies.  Michael Dwyer spoke to some of the film-makers, and to the Manager of the Indigenous Branch of the Australian Film Commission, Wal Saunders.  He explained the ideas behind 'From Sand to Celluloid'...

<B>Item One - CyberFringe at the Adelaide Fringe Festival</B>
<BR><BR>
The CyberFringe tried to create an electronic community of fringe-goers and internet surfers from around the world.  With information about fringe events, reviews of shows, and other fringey information, the CyberFringe allowed people to log in and share the fringe experience.  But is this use of the internet really pushing the boundaries?  Is the internet opening up new realms of human experience or is it mainly translating old media forms on to computers?  The CyberFringe was created by Virtual Artists - an Adelaide based internet arts company and was lauched by South Australian Premier dean Brown.  The launch called for Mr Brown to perform a virtual handshale with an internet surfer in California - but unfortunately the technology was not co-operating ...

<B>Item Two - Sound and Image in Cinema</B>
<table>
<BR><BR>
In mainstream cinema we are used to sound and image working seamlessly together to give a sense of being there.  But things haven't always been like this.  Early films were carried no sound of their own  - and over the years sound, music and voice were incorporated into cinema in a variety of ways.  The role of sound in cinema is not always obvious - and prior to the boom in selling movie soundtracks - the sound of a film wasn't always given much thought by audiences.  At this years Adelaide Festival, sound artist Pierre Henry explored the relationship between sound and image.  He showed silent films from the 1920's - for which he had composed soundscapes.  Pierre Henry was interviewed by Director of the Adelaide Festival, Barrie Kosky ...

<H3>A Program on Film Censorship...</H3>

<BR><BR>
<B>Item One		Censorship and Film Festivals</B>
<BR><BR>
To this point the debate on censorship has been pushed by those who argue for more control on the portrayal of violence.  But at this years' Sydney Film Festival  calls were made for an organised anti-censorship movement.  Most vocal was David Stratton, Director of the Sydney Film Festival between 1966 and 1983.  In the Ian McPherson Lecture, Stratton gave a potted history of film censorship in Australia and the battles led by the Sydney Film Festival for more liberal censorship rules.  He ended the lecture by warning that vigilance against censorship was still needed in 1996.  Michael Dwyer talked to current Festival Director Paul Byrnes about film censorship and signs of a return to the bad old days ...

<td>out</td><td>... into our personal lounge rooms."</td><tr>

<BR><BR>

<B>Item Two		Violence in Films - more than meets the eye?</B>
<BR><BR>

In recent debates about censorship the major concern has been the representation of violence.  But what is meant by the term ‘violence’ and has the current debate adequately considered the many reasons for representing violence in films?  A forum was held at the Sydney Film Festival with the aim of thinking more critically about the different ways that film-makers use violence.  One of the forum participants was Jane Mills - Head of Screen Studies at the Australian Film Television and Radio School.  She argued that current debate on violence is flawed ...
<BR><BR>

<td>out</td><td>... can help us make sense of society."</td><tr>

 </table>

<BR><BR>

<B>Item Three		Censorship and Creativity - rules are made to be broken</B>
<BR><BR>

The debate about censorship and the relationship between the world portrayed on the screen and the world on the streets is often repetitive.  The same arguments seems to be put and the same inconclusive results reached.  But in a seminar organised earlier this year by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, an interesting perspective was provided by John Morris - Chief Executive of the Australian Film Finance Corporation.  He spoke about the history of censorship and the creative solutions which film-makers have used to get around the restrictions.  He shared some of these stories with Michael Dwyer, but such are the times, John Morris was anxious not to be misunderstood as defending censorship ...

<B>Item One		International Institute of Communications</B>
<BR><BR>

The  International Institute of Communications is a London-based  independent organisation in the media and communications sector.  The role of the IIC is to stimulate  discussion on the future of the sector - and its does this through a  variety of publications and conferences.  Membership is drawn from seventy countries - members primarily coming from industry and government agencies.  The IIC executive recently met in Australia - this meeting coincided with a forum on telecommunications.  Michael Dwyer spoke to Executive Director Vicki McCleod - herself an Australian seconded from Telstra - about the IIC and its activities...

<B>Item Two		Australian Broadcasting Authority criticises Internet Service Providers	</B>
<BR><BR>
The Australian Broadcasting Authority has told Internet Service Providers that they need better representation and that they need it now.  These comments were made by Chair of the ABA  Peter Webb  while speaking at the Online Services Regulation Forum.  Pressure is mounting on the Federal Government to regulate on-line services.  Some states have already decided to go it alone  and there is substantial community concern about internet -pornography.  The message to Internet Service Providers is that they risk being left out of the process - including the ABA 's current  inquiry into on-line services. Pete Manson spoke to ABA Chair Peter Webb, and asked about the pressures mounting on the federal government...

<BR><BR>
Stuffed animals and boxes of rocks were once part of the stereotype of museums as cold, slightly dull places. And while traditional exhibits still dominate cultural institutions, increasing use is being made of new media technologies.  Gary Warner is Creative Producer at the Museum of Sydney and he spoke at the Australian Film Commission Language of Interactivity Conference.  He has a distinguished career in the Australian film industry - being recognised with the 1993 Byron Kennedy Award.  Michael Dwyer spoke to Gary Warner about the use of mew media to inform and entertain....

<B>Item One		Committee of Ministers on the Portrayal of Violence</B>
<BR><BR>
Following the Port Arthur Massacre The Prime Minister, John Howard, announced that a committee of Government Ministers would examine the portrayal of violence in Australia.  In particular, they are to examine violence on television and videos and in video and computer games.  The Committee’s terms of reference have been released and public submissions have also been invited.  The terms of reference are quite broad and include a requirement to investigate  recent research on the relationship between representations of violence and violent behaviour.  Given the volume of research on this topic, Michael Dwyer asked Lecturer in Media Studies at the Queensland University of Technology, Terry Flew, whether we can expect the committee to make much progress...

<BR><BR>
One of the terms of reference for the Ministerial Committee on the Portrayal of Violence (see previous story)
refers to the review of codes of practice governing the national and commercial television broadcasters.  In September this year the Commercial Television Code of Practice is due to be reviewed following the first three years of its operation.  However in a letter to the Minister for communications, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations has suggested that the review be brought forward.  The Code of Practice is a requirement of the 1992 Broadcasting Services Act and covers issues including program classifications, material unsuitable for television and community complaints procedures.  Michael Dwyer spoke to General Managers of FACTS, Tony Branigan and asked him what the Federation was offering...

<B>Item Three		Telecommunications Policy Forum - Part 2</B>
<BR><BR>

Last week on Media Magazine we broadcast part one of our forum on telecommunications policy.  Last week the program focused on competition policy and the changes to occur in 1997.  This week in part two, the focus is on the proposed privatisation of Telstra in the context of those changes.  The speakers are Gerard Goggin, Researcher at the Consumers Telecommunications Network, Helen Meredith a communications journalist with the Australian Financial Review, and John Quiggin Professor of Economics at James Cook University.  Helen Meredith begins the discussion, commenting on where the privatisation plans fit into the broader changes proposed for the telecommunications sector...

<B>Item Two		Community Television - is Sydney letting the side down?</B>
<BR><BR>

During 1996 the government will decide who will have permanent access to the final free to air television frequency around Australia.  Currently community television has been given the frequency on a trial basis that will end in mid 1997.  While community television is a frontrunner to get permanent access there are other strong candidates.  So in the meantime its important for community television to make the most of its trial period - something the other contenders have not received.  In this context the ongoing saga that is Community Television Sydney is not really what the sector needs.  After years of infighting and dubious commercial deals, CTS is now in the hands of administrators.  The Australian Broadcasting Authority has also been dragged into this tangled web - they are now reluctant to renew the CTS transmitter license.  Michael Dwyer spoke to Manager of Allocations and Renewals at the ABA, Nigel Ryan, about the licensing of Community Television Sydney and its implications for community television around Australia...

<B>Item Three		Interactive Film Art</B>
<BR><BR>

Over the last few years we've heard plenty about interactive multimedia.  The darling of the former Labor governments 1994 Creative Nation statement, interactive multimedia was the brave new frontier.  Since then interactive multimedia has largely failed to deliver on the hype.  Chris Hales - a  film artist and lecturer at the University of the West of England is highly critical of much recent commercial multimedia development.  He sees his won work as interactive film art - a concept he explained to Michael Dwyer....

<B>Item Three		Jargon Jungle - the LAP (License Area Planning) Process</B>
<BR><BR>

The Australian Broadcasting Authority - the ABA - is more than two years behind its License Area Planning (or LAP) Schedule.  The delays are causing major problems for aspirant broadcasters around the country - particularly aspirant community broadcasters.  So what is a LAP and why is the process taking so long?

<B>Item One		Independent Journalism on the Internet</B>
<BR><BR>

The Australian Centre for Independent Journalism has just launched a new website.  It's full of information for journalists and contains electronic versions of some of the centres own work in independent journalism.  Australian Centre for Independent Journalism Director Peter Cronau (PRON Crow-now) spoke to Michael Dwyer about the web-site...

<B>Item Two		Video-activism</B>
<BR><BR>

Media technology sometimes seems to be out of the reach of ordinary people - it costs lots of money and requires specialist training.  But this is not always the case, as people in community radio and television can tell you.  Another are in which technology is being used by ordinary people is video-activism.  While it's only just taking off in Australia, political activists have used video-activism to great effect in Britain and the United States.  Thomas Harding is a prominent British video-activist - he was recently in Australia and spoke to Jason Torrens...

<B>Item Three		New commercial radio stations - more trouble for community aspirants</B>
<BR><BR>

Some aspirant community radio stations have been trying to get a license for almost twenty four years.  The Australian Broadcasting Authority - the government body which gives out new radio licenses - is currently running several years behind schedule in its license allocation process.  Many community aspirant stations are getting very frustrated - and this hasn't been helped by a new government decision which gives priority to new commercial radio services in some regional areas.  The government has tried to fast track the provision of more services to some regional areas by giving existing commercial radio stations an extra FM license if there is only one existing commercial service in the area.  The effect has been that community radio services have again been overlooked.  In this report Michael Dwyer speaks to Cathleen Bruce - President of an aspirant radio group in Orange NSW - but first, Michele Dyne from the Australian Broadcasting Authority explains why the commercial stations are getting special treatment...

<B>Item One		New Staff Elected Director at the ABC</B>
<BR>
Kirsten Garrett is the newly elected Staff Elected Director at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The ABC has a been a hotbed of controversy for many months with prospective funding cuts and job losses looming.

The Act attempted to ban so-called indecent material from the Internet.  Many internet users in the United States and around the world have been fighting a campaign to have the Act repealed.  Shortly after the decision was announced I spoke to from the Electronic Freedom Foundation in the United States ...

<B>Item One Senator Alston on Budget Outcomes for Community Broadcasting</B>
<BR><BR>
The Federal Coalition's 1996 Budget has delivered on most of the election promises made to the community broadcasting sector.  Overall, an additonal four point five  million dollars of funding will flow into the sector over the next three years.  Three million dollars has been allocated for support of ethnic radio programming.   A further one point five million will support three general community radio projects - the ComRadSat network, the Community Broadcasting Database and the Community Access Network (CAN).  While the sector has welcomed this additional funding, there have been some concerns expressed that the money allocated  - particularly for the CAN may not be enough to see it through.  Michael Dwyer spoke to Senator Alston about the budget outcomes for community broadcasting and whether there is room for further negotiation ...

<B>Item Three		The Manning-Clark Controversy</B>
<BR><BR>
The sometimes sedate state of Australian history was jolted last week by claims that eminent historian Manning-Clark had been awarded the Order of Lenin and was agent of influence for the Soviet Union.  The claims were made in the Brisbane Courier-Mail, the paper that earlier in 1996 blew the lid off the Darville/Demidenko hoax.  So is the Manning-Clark story a second major coup for the Courier-Mail or have they jumped the gun?  David McKnight, a Lecturer in Journalism at the University of Technology Sydney and author of a book on spies in Australia, took a torch behind the scenes for Media Magazine ...

<B>Item One		Internet Public Access Terminals</B>
<BR><BR>
The opening of cybercafes in Australia has received much publicity.  However despite having some success overseas, this has not been the case in Australia.  Some have closed and many others are on the borderline.  In this climate it may be surprising then that a company is proposing to places 3,500 internet access terminals in hotels, clubs and public spaces around Australia.  Managing Director of Internet Public Access Terminals, Daniel Albert believes that existing cybercafes have taken the wrong approach and that there is demand for public internet access...

<BR><BR>
<B>Item Two		Press Photography and Propaganda</B>
<BR><BR>

Many concerns were raised about the media coverage of the Pt Arthur massacre.  One of the more blatant breaches occurred in <I>The Australian</I>, when an altered photo of the alleged murderer was published on their front page.  But while digital technology makes image manipulation so much easier, a new book by Macquarie University academic Dr John Williams claims that this practice has a long history.  He spoke to Monica Clare...
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>

<B>Item Three		Narrowcasting and the One Person Radio Station</B>
<BR><BR>

When people think of media they often imagine big buildings, hordes of people and megabucks.  But new digital technology has made it possible for one person to set up and run a arid station for around $10 000.  And if you can get your hands on a narrowcasting radio license then your all set to go.  One person who has done this is Geoff Harrison, General Manager of the Victorian Narrowcasting Network.  He spoke to Michael Dwyer about new technology, narrowcasting and new services ...

<P>As a result of CAET's services, an Ohio company is saving $10,000 a
month; another firm has eliminated hazardous wastes entirely; a third has
eliminated the need for air permits; and a Cincinnati company can use non-recyclable
waste paper as boiler fuel to eliminate the 200 tons of annual solid waste
going into the landfill.</P>

<P>Several years ago, IAMS was able to assist a local company, <A HREF="http://pages.prodigy.com/L/P/O/lpco/index.htm">Leonhardt
Plating</A> reduce their waste. Leonhardt Plating is a Cincinnati, family-owned
and operated job-shop electroplating business. The 20 company employees
provide a variety of metal finishing services including polishing, buffing,
electroless nickel plating, nickel and chrom electroplating and electropolishing.</P>

<P>IAMS performed a waste minimization assessment for Leonhardt Plating
and by implementing IAMS recommendations, Leonhardt's process water consumption
dropped from 500 thousand gallons per month to around 160 thousand gallons
per month saving them $5,000 annually!</P>

<P>CAET offers a variety of environmental training opportunities. Training
is available both on-site at the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Sciences
or at convenient locations throughout the State of Ohio. Training is often
available at no charge to participants through the generous support of
various sponsoring organizations. </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>&quot;Pollution Prevention Basics&quot;</B> is generally a one to
two hour presentation which provides an introduction to the pollution prevention
(P2) concept, an awareness of P2 benefits, the regulatory framework for
waste minimization, identification of the various opportunities for implementation,
and a discussion of state and federal pollution prevention resources. The
training can be expanded to a half day seminar through the incorporation
of pollution prevention case studies.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>&quot;Lowering Costs Through Waste Reduction&quot;</B> is a half
or full day workshop focussing on the means of minimizing business costs
through waste reduction. Participants learn how to organize a Waste Minimization
Team, understand the brainstorming process, develop process flow diagrams,
conduct facility waste assessments, and develop and implement a Pollution
Prevention Plan. Case studies are also featured at the workshop through
industrial panel presentations and participants receive information on
industry-specific technical and financial resources. </LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B>&quot;Environmental Awareness Training&quot;</B> is a full day seminar
that provides a general introduction to environmental issues and then a
more comprehensive overview of specific environmental regulations. The
company or organization requesting the seminar selects the regulations
to be addressed during the day-long course. The intent of the effort is
to familiarize employees with the policies that are related to their work
place and to help them gain an understanding of the role they play in ensuring
policy compliance and waste reduction.</LI>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="blue2.gif" HEIGHT=8 WIDTH=581></P></CENTER>

<P><B>What is the Center for Applied Environmental Technologies (CAET)?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>CAET is part of the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Sciences, Inc.
(IAMS), a not-for-profit organization funded in part by the Ohio Department
of Development and in part by private industry </LI>

<LI>Our mission is to make regional manufacturers more competitive </LI>

<LI>CAET contributes to this mission by offering industry technical assistance
in waste and energy reduction</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Why Should I Be Interested in IAMSí Waste and/or Energy Reduction
Assessments?</B> <BR>
(Waste and energy assessments are done separately)</P>

<UL>
<LI>To reduce your companyís wastes and energy usage </LI>

<LI>To save your company money </LI>

<LI>To help with your environmental compliance </LI>

<LI>To prevent raw materials from becoming wastes </LI>

<LI>To free up labor hours</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>How Can IAMSí Staff Help My Company?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Our staff of five full-time and five part-time engineers and scientists
with expertise in manufacturing processes, chemical processing, recycling,
environmental regulations and treatment technologies is available as a
resource for your company </LI>

<LI>Our staff has helped 95 companies develop waste and energy reduction
options over the past four years </LI>

<LI>CAETís assessments have averaged annual projected savings of $90,000
per company</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>How Do the Waste and Energy Reduction Assessments Fit into the Waste
and Energy Reduction Process?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>They are the first step in development of a waste and energy reduction
program for your plant T</LI>

<LI>The assessment will provide a prioritized list of opportunities for
reducing wastes and energy usage </LI>

<LI>After the assessment, your company assumes responsibility for continuing
the waste or energy reduction program </LI>

<LI>Your company may chose to implement specific waste or energy reduction
options after investigating the technical feasibility </LI>

<LI>After the assessment, our staff can be called on for project management
support </LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What Happens During a Waste or Energy Reduction Assessment?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Our staff visits your facility to look at your information on types
and quantities of your wastes or energy costs and tour your manufacturing
process </LI>

<LI>We develop suggestions for waste or energy reductions with estimates
of potential savings and resources for implementation </LI>

<LI>CAET makes a second visit to present the results of brainstorming waste
or energy reduction options to decide which options to pursue in more detail
</LI>

<LI>CAET will also provide your company with additional information on
selected options, and supply names of vendors or engineers who can assist
in design and implementation </LI>

<LI>CAET can provide project management services</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>How Much Time Will the Assessment Require?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Prior to our visit, we ask your company to fill out a pre-assessment
questionnaire that helps us make better use of our time during our visit.
We expect that this will take about one half hour of your time </LI>

<LI>Our initial visit normally take from two to four hours, depending on
the size of the company </LI>

<LI>Our second visit normally takes between one and two hours </LI>

<LI>Implementing suggestions from the waste or energy reduction assessment
may require a significant investment of your companyís time and money,
which should be offset by future cost savings</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Who Pays for Assessments?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>IAMS is a not-for-profit organization</LI>

<LI>Fees are charged to cover costs, but grant funding may be available
to smaller companies or within certain geographic areas to subsidize fees
</LI>

<LI>There is no charge for a consultation visit</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>How Many Assessments Has CAET Done and What Have the Results Been?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Over the past four years, we have worked with over 95 Ohio companies
to offer suggestions for waste and energy reduction with an average annual
projected savings of $90K each </LI>

<LI>All of these companies have implemented some of our suggestions for
waste or energy reduction</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>What Do We Need to Do to Schedule an Assessment?</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>Call Trent Wall at (513) 948-2071 to discuss and schedule an assessment</LI>

<H1>Machining Xcellence to Develop Green Cutting Fluid</H1><IMG SRC="/graphics/blue2.gif"></CENTER>

<P>An EPA funded project whose goal is to develop an environmentally friendly coolant, "green" coolant, has begun with initial contacts to companies of all sizes who use and manufacture metal working fluids.  The ultimate goal is to promote and/or modify a coolant which has the best working properites of existing process fluids but lasts longer and requires less disposal by frequency and amount.</P>

<P>Listed below are the companies of the environmentally friendly people who have accepted the challenge to become a part of the Industry Advisory Group  (IAG) who will help guide these efforts to a successful conclusion:</P>

<title>About P2IRIS</title>

<h3><img src="giffiles/golden.gif" border=0  height=15 width =20 ><b><i>Description
</i></b></h3>

<p>The Pollution Prevention Information Resource for Industry Sectors (P2IRIS) is a 
tool that meets the need of manufacturing extension
organizations for access to a national information system of qualified,
cost-effective, industry and process specific technologies and business
practices for pollution prevention. The system includes a user-friendly relational
database which allows rapid access by manufacturing extension centers to
appropriate pollution prevention information. The initial version of P2IRIS contains information
on three industry sectors: electroplating, printing, and metal painting
and organic coatings. 
<br></p>

<h3><img src="giffiles/golden.gif" border=0  height=15 width =20 ><b><i>Funding
</i></b></h3>

<p><b>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</b> is providing
the majority of project funding under a cooperative agreement with the system 
developers.   NIST was established by Congress to promote
U.S. economic growth by working with industry to develop and apply technology,
measurements, and standards.  NIST recognizes the need of manufacturing
extension organizations for a national information system of cost-effective
technologies and business practices for pollution prevention.  Industry sector information
for P2IRIS will be collected by two NIST centers with the assistance
of a consortia of pollution prevention experts, technology users and developers.
These two NIST centers are national leaders in pollution prevention and
have extensive experience with the industry sectors.

<center><h3>SARA J. CLEMENT</h3></center>


Sally Clement is the Director  of  Manufacturing Efficiency and  acts as  Manager of the Center for Applied Environmental Technologies at the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Sciences, Inc.  Since joining IAMS some four years ago, she has participated in developing a pollution prevention technical assistance program serving the southern Ohio area.  </p>

<p>Ms. Clement has earned two Master of Science degrees:  one from the University of Cincinnati in environmental science, and another from Syracuse University in geology.  Before joining IAMS, Ms. Clement spent three years in the environmental consulting industry, working primarily on soil and groundwater remediation projects.  Prior to that, she worked in an environmental compliance position for industry, primarily working on water and hazardous waste issues.  She has also worked in academic environmental research and as a geologist, and has taught geology, earth science, and physical science.</p>

<p>Ms. Clement is focusing her efforts at IAMS on pollution prevention technical assess-ments, working on coordinating and scheduling the activities of several retired engineers and full-time employees working on waste and energy assessments.  The purpose of the assessments is to develop cost-effective methods of waste reduction for industry.

(the Institute) is a not-for-profit organization whose mission
is to improve the competitiveness of industry through technology
transfer, training and applied research.  It receives funding
from the Ohio Department of Development as an Edison Technology
Center, and grants from public and private institutions, and revenue
from membership fees, industrial projects, software product sales,

<P>
Several years ago the Institute created The Center for Applied
Environmental Technologies (CAET) to help companies with potential
environmental problems.  The Center specializes in waste reduction
and pollution prevention, both cost effective methods to reduce
environmental problems and increase competitiveness.  The Center
conducts pollution prevention assessments and has co-sponsored
successful pollution prevention seminars.
<P>
This project was made possible through a grant from the Ohio Environmental
Education Fund (OEEF).  The OEEF, administered by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (OEPA), sponsors environmental education projects
throughout the state of Ohio through grants.  The Center for Applied
Environmental Technologies (CAET) received a one year grant (7/93
- 7/94) from OEEF to provide technical assistance in Industrial
Pollution Prevention for the metal finishing industry in Southwest
Ohio.  
<P>
<B>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate environmental
and economic benefits of pollution prevention (P2) to metal finishers
in the Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan Area by introducing cost
effective changes in materials, processes, or management practices.</B>
 
<P>
The project has several objectives:
<ul><P>
<li>To conduct a minimum of four pollution prevention assessments
in metal finishing facilities
<li>To assess pollution prevention and control technologies
available to the industry through literature review, vendor
inventories, and surveys of local plating industry
li>To provide information to all concerned constituents by
writing and producing this pollution prevention manual for
the metal finishing industry
<li>To organize and conduct a practical workshop on pollution
prevention for the industry (held May 4, 1994 at the Institute)
<li>To report findings to OEEF.</ul>

<P>This project has been conducted in cooperation with the Greater
Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, the City of Cincinnati, the National
Association of Metal Finishers, and the American Society of Electroplaters
and Surface Finishers.  Extensive progress has been made in recent
years in improving metal finishing processes as regulations regarding
discharges into the environment have become more stringent.  This
industry needs to continue to meet new standards which further
decrease the amount and type of wastes it may discharge.  Increased
costs of inputs and discharges have cut profit margins and have
forced businesses to search for new ways to reduce raw materials
and discharges.  
<P>
In future years there will be continuing pressure to meet more
stringent effluent guidelines on top of increased waste disposal
costs, while the pressure to minimize manufacturing costs will
be relentless.  Pollution prevention has emerged as an effective
method of attaining compliance and reducing operating costs. Widespread
success has been achieved using simple methods and techniques.
 
<P>
 
<P>
Many of the guidelines regarding current pollution prevention
technological advances will be described in this manual. Some
of the technologies have involved simple installations, such as
retrofitted pipes or drainboards, that are cost effective and
can be implemented in house.  Other innovations require capital
expenditures with significant pay back periods.  These include
metal removal from liquids and total recycling in a closed system.
Although neither total recycling nor zero discharge has been mandated
and may not be financially viable, planning new equipment choices
with these goals in mind should prove to be cost effective in
the long run.
<P>
 
<P>
The loss of raw materials in the wastewater can result in five
distinct cost items that need to be considered in an economic
evaluation:
<ul>
<li>Replacement of the raw material
<li>Removal of the materials from the wastewater before discharge
   (pre-treatment costs)
<li>Disposal of the removed materials
<li>Replacement of the water
<li>Processing of the wastewater by local sewer authorities. </ul>
<P>
It is difficult to make blanket judgements as to economic feasibility
of the solutions presented since the conditions in each facility
vary and the characteristics and quantities of the platables are
so diverse.  Taking advantage of their own expertise and knowledge
of local conditions, operators of each facility must determine
whether a particular technology can be implemented economically.

<hr><h1>Regulatory Environment</h1>
<P>
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, which established
the legal framework for dealing with water pollution on a national
scale, called for the establishment of pretreatment programs with
standards and effluent guidelines.  Standards for the metal finishing
industry, first promulgated in the 1970&#146;s, were subject to
litigation and revision.  Final promulgation took place in the
early 1980&#146;s.  The pretreatment regulations establish a complex
program of standards, monitoring, and enforcement.  To achieve
compliance metal finishers may incur significant capital costs,
ongoing operating costs, administrative costs of obtaining and
keeping discharge permits, and the risk of substantial fines and
costly citizen suits for incidents of non-compliance.  By eliminating
the discharge of process wastewaters (i.e., by "closing the
loop") the metal finisher can eliminate the administrative
costs and risks of non-compliance while substantially enhancing
its public image. Attainment of a 100% waste and pollution-free
operation may appear remote at this time.  However, efforts in
that direction can only bring platers closer to an era of greatly
reduced operating risk and continuing compliance with federal,
state and local regulations at more reasonable costs.

<h1>Waste Reduction Techniques</h1>
<P>The remainder of this manual will discuss various pollution prevention
technologies.  Included at the end of the text is a matrix table
of vendors and the services which they provide.  This table provides
a reference to further investigate feasibility and costs of pollution
prevention options.  The following sections address reduction
in waste generation through source reduction techniques such as
improved process control and substitute chemistries.  Alternative recovery 
and treatment measures are also addressed.
<HR>
<h2>Reduce Drag-out</h2>
<P>Chemical drag-out is the primary source of contaminated
rinsewater, which requires treatment to remove harmful or regulated
pollutants before the water is reused or discharged. If the drag-out
is reduced, the rinse waters will be less contaminated and will
last longer.  Reduction of drag-out should minimize the amount
of process chemical additions to the bath and the mass of contaminants
that need to be removed from the rinsewater.  Several process
modifications that affect minimizing drag-out are listed below.
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "giffiles/elect2.gif"></CENTER>
<hr>
<h2>Work Piece Withdrawal Rate</h2>
<P>
The speed with which work pieces are removed from a process solution
can have the greatest impact of any single factor on drag-out
volume.  Work piece withdrawal rate will influence the amount
of solution remaining on the work piece.  The more slowly a work
piece is withdrawn from a process bath, the thinner the chemical
film on the work piece and the less chemical contaminants in rinsewaters.

<hr>
<h2>Drain Time (Hang Time)</h2>
<P>
A drain time of at least 10 seconds has been demonstrated to reduce
drag-out by 40+%, compared to the three second industry average.
Longer drain time over the process solution allows more drag-out
to be returned to the bath.  Drain times can be controlled by
posting drain times at tanks as a reminder to employees on manual
process lines or by building in delays on automatic process lines.

<h2>Racking</h2>
<P>
Some work pieces being plated have re-entrant cavities which trap
process water when the work piece is lifted from the plating bath.
Racking these work pieces so that the cavities open downward
will promote draining, thereby reducing the amount of drag-out.

<h2>Work Piece Modification</h2>
<P>
Consultation with work piece manufacturers to adjust design to
provide better bath liquid release, can reduce drag-out. Example:
a plater asked his customer whether he could drill four  holes
in the work piece to improve drainage.  The customer agreed and
this pollution prevention technique was successfully implemented.

<h2>Drain Boards</h2>
<P>
Drain boards are used to collect drag-out/drippings from
work pieces on racks, and direct the solution back into its previous
bath.  Drainboards save solutions and keep them off the floor.
These boards may be constructed of any compatible material. 
It is important that they be oriented to direct drips to
the correct tank.  Use of drain boards is a cost effective technique
which will reduce chemical consumption as well as the amount of
rinsewater.  
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC = "giffiles/elect3.gif"></CENTER>  <P>  

<hr>
<P><P><h2>Angled Barrels</h2>
<P>For large, horizontal double hung type barrels, no
producer/vendor of angled barrel technology has been found.  However,
one of the following modifications of existing barrels may prove
useful in minimizing drag-out.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Lengthen or shorten one arm, so as to create an off-horizontal
position, which allows for quicker runoff
<li>Attach a drip bar at the bottom of barrel edges to facilitate
droplet collection and runoff
<li>Design a slope at the top of barrel carriers; this, and
lengthening or shortening one arm, may require alteration of tank
depth to accommodate angled barrels</ul>

<p>Prior to implementing an angled or sloped barrel technique, the
design of all tanks must be checked to assure proper clearance
for the modified system.
<P>

<hr>
<h1>Efficient Rinsing</h1>
<h2>Spray Rinses and Air Knives</h2>
<P>
These two measures are fairly similar in their application. When
mounted on the edge of a process tank, a pipe directing air or
water at the work pieces through appropriate nozzles can reduce
the amount of solution which is carried over to subsequent process
tanks.  Either fixed or movable nozzles can be used.  This procedure
enables keeping a solution in its tank of origin, rather than
passing into another tank as a contaminant.  Not all process operations
can accept this solution removal procedure; neither spray rinses
nor air knives are easily applied to barrel operations.   One
vendor offers an internal spray rinse system for barrel operations.

<P>
Spray rinses can be used above any heated process tank to recover
drag-out before it is transferred to the next tank.  The spray
flushes drag-out from the work pieces as they are withdrawn from
the process tank.  In rinsing efficacy a spray rinse is equivalent
to approximately one-half a dip rinse.  In many cases spray nozzles
can be sized and water flow rates adjusted such that the spray
rinsewater balances the evaporative losses.
<P>

Air knives are used to blow air across the surface of the work
pieces as they are withdrawn from the process or rinse solution,
physically pushing liquid off the work piece and into its tank
of origin, thereby reclaiming drag-out, reducing the volume of
rinsewater required, and enhancing the drying process.  In some
applications this rapid dry method may cause quality problems.

<h2>Flow Restrictors </h2>    
<P>
Flow restrictors are placed directly in the rinse water inlet
of a rinse tank in order to restrict the flow of water to a predetermined
acceptable level.  Flow restrictors work well to maintain flow
rates at their predetermined values.  However, because restrictors
are non-adjustable in use, they may be less suitable in job shops
where the variety of materials being plated typically requires
variable flow rates.  Good practice entails turning off flowing
rinses when not in use and educating operating personnel in the
advantages of water conservation.<!--Flow restrictors are placed directly in the rinse water inlet of a rinse tank in order to restrict the flow of water to a predetermined acceptable level.  Flow restrictors work well to maintain flow rates at their predetermined values.  However, becau-->

<h2>Conductivity Cells</h2>     
<P>
Flow controllers utilizing conductivity cells can solve
the problem of adjusting rinsewater flow rates to variable production
rates.  These sensors give an indication of contamination in the
rinsewater (the higher the contaminant concentration, the higher
the rinsewater conductivity).  The sensors trigger the inflow
of clean water when the tank water becomes contaminated, the excess
contaminated water overflowing to the drain.  Water is added only
to lower the concentration of contaminants to a predetermined
level, thus reducing the amount of overflow water requiring treatment.
However, many of these systems incur significant maintenance
costs, as most sensing probes must be cleaned and adjusted regularly.
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "giffiles/elect4.gif"></CENTER> 
<HR>
<h2>Contact Time</h2>
<P>
Contact time specifically refers to the length of time the work
pieces are in the tank.  For a given work piece and tank size
the efficacy of rinsing varies with contact time.  Production
rate, on the other hand, varies inversely with contact time. 
Through experimentation the operator must find the contact time
that satisfies production requirements while providing high rinse efficiency.  
For the same rinse efficiency, agitation of rinsewaters may shorten 
required contact time.

<HR>
<H2>Counter-Current or Counter Flow Rinsing</h2>
<P>This procedure substantially reduces the amount of water required
for rinsing, thereby reducing the amount of wastewater to be treated.
Implementation of the procedure is most efficient when several
rinse tanks are used in series.  Fresh water is supplied
to the rinse tank farthest from the process tank.  The flow of
rinsewater is from this farthest tank toward the process tank,
countercurrent to the flow of plated work pieces.  The counter-current
rinse overflows to the preceding rinse tanks until it reaches
the tank immediately following the process tank.  Often the overflow
from this first rinse tank discharges to the drain.  However,
if the process tank operates at a temperature high enough to cause
sufficient evaporation, the overflow may enter the process tank,
thereby reclaiming much of the drag-out.  Overflow to the process
tank is only practical when deionized (DI) water is used for rinsing.

<h2>Static Rinsing  (Recovery Rinsing)</h2>
<P>If direct counter-current rinsewater overflow to the process tank
is not possible, the first rinse tank after a process bath may
be a static rinse that builds up a concentration of &#147;drag-in.&#148;
 Using the static rinsewater to replenish the process bath reclaims
much of the drag-out.  Good practice requires that the static
rinse tank initially be filled with deionized water.  Periodically
the static rinsewater should be concentrated for recycle/reclaim
into the plating bath.

<hr>
<h2>Rinse Bath Agitation</h2>
<P>Agitation of rinse water baths reduces required contact time and
improves rinsing efficiency.  Experience has shown that air sparging
is often not an efficient agitation technique.  Recirculation
of a sidestream from the rinse tank is reasonably effective, but
use of a propeller type agitator results in the highest efficiency.
 Selection of the optimum method of agitation entails balancing
capital and operating costs against revenues from increased production
rates.

<hr>
<h1>Solution Purification</h1>
<h2>Ion Exchange</h2>
<P>In this process rinsewaters are pumped through beds of resin. Platable 
cations in the rinsewater attach to the resin by displacing hydrogen
or alkali/alkaline earth cations which leave in the effluent.
 When these resin beds become saturated, regenerating solutions
restore them to usefulness by stripping the platable cations and
recharging the resin with hydrogen or alkali/alkaline earth cations.
 Platable cations, concentrated in the spent regenerating solution,
may be treated, recycled or reclaimed.  The ion exchange process
can produce treated water   with very low concentrations of pollutants.
 Platable cation concentrations of 0.1 mg/l are attained with
typical installations.  With some additional investment, significantly
lower values can be achieved.  This characteristic identifies
ion exchange as a technology suitable for use in achieving 100%
recycle of wastewater.

<h2>Electrolytic Recovery</h2>
<h3>Electrowinning</h3>
<P>
If solution concentrations become high enough, platable metal
ions may be removed and the solution partially purified, by simply
plating the metal ion onto a stub electrode.  The recovered metal
is either sold or recycled to the plating process.  Because the
plating process becomes inefficient at low metal ion concentrations,
this technique usually is not suitable by itself for producing
wastewater that complies with discharge regulations.  In conjunction
with another technique, however, such as ion exchange, plating
out may allow reclaim/recycle at lower capital costs.  The technique
may be used on spent plating bath solutions, recovered spills,
discharge from static rinse tanks, and regeneration solutions
from ion exchangers.

<h3> Porous Pots</h3>
<P>
For hexavalent chromium plating baths the technique of porous
pot plating has been used to extend bath life, thereby reducing
the discharge of pollutants.  During plating, the concentrations
of iron and other cationic impurities build up in a hexavalent
chromium bath to the extent that plating becomes unsatisfactory.
If this bath is placed in a porous pot, in which a semipermeable
membrane separates cathode from anode, and power is applied, the
iron and other contaminant metal ions pass through the membrane
and accumulate in the cathode chamber, from which they are periodically
removed for disposal.  Chromate ion remains in the anode compartment
as part of an anolyte which, after purification, may be returned
to the plating tank for further use.  Less chromium is wasted
by using this technique.  The liquid in the cathode compartment
must be handled as waste.

<h2>Membrane Processes</h2>
<P>The Ultrafiltration (UF), Nanofiltration (NF), and Reverse
Osmosis (RO)  processes all operate on the principle of
separating suspended or dissolved solids in solutions by use of
a membrane surface.  The passage of liquid (called permeate) and
the blocking of solids is a function of the size of the openings
in the membrane, the size of the impurities, and the magnitude
of the pressure applied.  The following table indicates usage
and pressure for each process.
<P>
 
<P>
UF allows dissolved solids to pass through.  NF blocks some dissolved
solids but allows others to pass through.  RO blocks almost all
dissolved solids.  UF is very effective in separating water from
emulsified oil, and is used in some cases in the metal finishing
industry to separate suspended metals from rinse waters.  NF and
RO are being used in the plating industry to provide a similar
separation for dissolved solids.  Depending on the type of system
(UF-NF-RO) and the characteristics of contaminated solution being
processed, permeates may be reused.  During operation of any of
these systems, the contaminated liquid is recirculated many times
and becomes increasingly concentrated.  In some cases it is also
possible to reuse this concentrated portion.
<P>
 
<P>
UF-NF-RO systems have proved to be economical methods to clean
up waste streams, to recover resources and to meet discharge limits.  
Operating costs for UF systems used to clean aqueous machining
coolants run between $0.013/gal (70,000 gallons per day) to $0.10/gal
(1,000 gallons per day).  Operating costs for NF and RO systems
are higher because of the higher operating pressures required.  
Nevertheless, metal finishers moving toward zero aqueous discharge
or total recycling should consider these systems carefully.

<hr>
<h2>Evaporation</h2>
<P>Evaporation may be successfully used to recover various plating
bath chemicals.  This technology is based on physical separation
of water from dissolved solids.  Water is evaporated from the
collected rinsewater to allow the chemical concentrate to be returned
and reused in the process bath.  The water vapor may be condensed
and reused in the rinse system.  Evaporation units are operated
either at atmospheric pressure or under vacuum.  Evaporation is
often used in conjunction with rinsewater minimization techniques
as the process is energy intensive and becomes expensive for facilities
with large flow rates.  

<h3>Atmospheric Evaporation</h3>
<P>Atmospheric evaporation is more commonly used than vacuum evaporation
due to its lower capital cost.  The evaporation unit either operates
at the normal boiling point of the solution with added heat, or
relies on evaporation at bath temperature.  These units are useful
in reducing the volume of a liquid waste for treatment or disposal,
or for concentrate recycling.  However, the constituents of the
solution can be degraded by high temperatures.  
<P>
<B>Implementing Company</b>
<Br>Lucas Sumitomo - Lebanon, OH

<h3>Vacuum Evaporation</h3>
<P>Evaporation under less than atmospheric pressure serves to lower
the boiling point of the solution.  Solutions with heat sensitive
constituents can be evaporated using the vacuum technology with
little or no degradation to the solution.  These units can substantially
reduce the boiling points of solutions.  The capital cost for
vacuum evaporation units is higher than the cost of atmospheric
units.  Use of heat pumps in evaporation and condensation can
lower operating costs. 
<P>
 
<hr>
<h2>Changing Bath Composition or Bath Chemistry</h2>
<P>Proper control of bath operating parameters will result in more
consistent work piece quality as well as longer bath life.  The
strategy is simple: determine critical operating parameters and
maintain them within the established acceptable limits.  After
values for these parameters have been determined it is essential
to regularly monitor bath chemistry to confirm stability or to
establish the need for corrective actions.  For many
platables, simple field test kits are available which can be used
to establish bath concentrations.  Suppliers sometimes set specifications
for concentrations at levels higher than required for effective
operation.  Experimentation with lowering levels to just above
the concentration at which defects will occur can lead to reduced
chemical costs.  Examples of operating parameters follow.

<h3>pH</h3>
<P>In many cases optimum plating occurs only in a relatively narrow
pH range.  Plating tanks can be equipped with pH monitors and
a control system with a means of adding acid or base as needed.
 Savings in bath chemicals and improved work piece quality usually
will rapidly defray the associated capital costs.

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<P>In several cases optimum plating occurs only over a relatively
narrow range of temperatures (i.e., hexavalent chromium).  Heating
elements and a control system are a normal part of the plating
equipment, so no additional capital expenditures are involved in securing good
performance, but rather good practices.  Management encouragement
and provision of periodic training for operating personnel will
help promote these good practices. 

<h3>Platable Ion Concentration</h3>
<P>The concentration of the platable ion typically specified may
not correspond to the concentration which minimizes drag-out while
enabling good plating efficiency.  As previously mentioned, 
experimentation to achieve good plating at lower ion concentrations
not only can save chemical cost, but can also reduce drag-out.
 
<h3>Additive Concentration</h3>
<P>Chemicals such as brighteners and surfactants may be added to
plating baths to improve quality or reduce drag-out.  Keeping
the concentration of additive in the optimum range will prevent
pollution by reducing drag-out, and the amount of rework or scrap. 

<h3>Surface Tension</h3>
<P>The tendency of liquid to cling to a work piece being withdrawn
from the body of liquid can be reduced by using an additive to
lower the liquid surface tension.  This technique may be applied
to rinsewaters as well as to plating baths.  Experimentation will
show which surfactant is most compatible with process fluids,
and at what frequency additional 
surfactant must be added to maintain low drag-out. 

<hr>
<h1>Hazardous Chemical Replacement</h1>
Chemical replacement
is a technique supported by continuing plating research on a number
of fronts.  Many manufacturers of plating bath chemicals have
active research programs.  EPA regulations spur the development
of substitute materials and alternate plating processes.  The
following discussion focuses on some chemical replacements currently
proving successful.

<hr>
<h2>Chromium</h2>
<P>Hexavalent chromium is used extensively in decorative and functional
plating applications as well as conversion coatings.  Approximately
80% of the available power   supplied to a hexavalent chromium
bath generates hydrogen gas.  Evolution of the gas produces a
mist of fine water particles with entrained hexavalent chromium.
 As hexavalent chromium is a carcinogen and a designated hazardous
air pollutant, protection   of worker health and safety as well
as the environment requires control of its emission.  Wastewater
treatment incurs the cost of an added step to reduce hexavalent
to trivalent chromium.  
<P>
 
In some applications, especially decorative plating, the use of
trivalent chromium has proven successful.  Use of trivalent chrome
eliminates both misting and the added step in wastewater treatment.
 Adherence, throw and coverage are all improved, and higher rack
densities can be achieved.  Because bath concentration is much
lower than for hexavalent chromium, drag-out is less and the amount
of sludge produced by wastewater treatment is substantially reduced.
 Plating thickness is limited to 0.1 mil; thicker coatings exhibit
cracking and spalling.  Thus the technique is usually unsuitable
for hard chromium coatings, which may be 20 mils or more in thickness.
 Although the color tones of trivalent chromium coatings are different 
from those of hexavalent chromium, additives to the trivalent chromium 
bath can often ameliorate the difference.

<h2>Cyanide</h2>
<P>The cyanide anion is an excellent complexer and exhibits wide
tolerance to impurities and variations in bath composition.  It
has long been used in baths for plating copper, zinc, and other
metals.  Its principal disadvantage is its high toxicity.  Another
disadvantage is the cost of treating cyanide in wastewater.  Because
of its toxicity and adverse environmental impacts, EPA regulations
severely limit the discharge of cyanide.For plating copper, certain
non-cyanide alkaline baths of proprietary composition have been
developed.  An alkaline pyrophosphate bath is in use which exhibits
good throwing power and coating ductility.  It is used in printed
circuit board manufacture.  A strike is required if plating over
steel or zinc.  This bath is expensive and its wastewaters hard
to treat.  An acidic copper plating bath using the sulfate ion
has proved versatile; however, the low pH permits substrate attack
and increasing iron concentrations in the bath.  Fluoboric acid
is the basis for another copper plating bath which affords enhanced
solubility and conductivity, as well as high plating speeds. 
This bath is more costly, has fewer additive systems available,
and is more hazardous to use.  Treatment of its wastewater is
more costly.
<P>
 
A non-cyanide alkaline bath based on sodium hydroxide is in use
for plating zinc.  When operated with concentrations and other
parameters in control it performs as well as cyanide-based baths,
and is the least expensive of all zinc plating baths.  Zinc may
also be plated from an acid chloride system, of which there are
three types.  Acid baths offer higher cathode efficiencies and
lower voltages.  Throwing power is less, but deposits are brilliant
and levelling.

<h2>Stripping</h2>
<P>As the baths used in stripping are similar to those used in plating,
similar techniques of pollution prevention and waste minimization
are applicable.  Attention to cleanliness and process control
are important in reducing stripping wastes.  Stripping is usually
accomplished either by chemical immersion or by electrolytic process.
 Although mineral acids, suitably inhibited, are useful for stripping
some coatings, they are aggressive to substrates and thus limited
in application.  
<P>
 
<P>
The majority of alkaline immersion stripping is accomplished with
cyanide, which does not attack steel substrates but dissolves
a number of other metals used as coatings.  However, health and
safety as well as environmental regulations discourage the continued
use of cyanide.  
<P>
 
<P>
Several non-cyanide alkaline immersion stripping baths are available
to remove copper or nickel from various substrates.  These baths
typically employ either the ammonium ion or an amine to provide
complexing.  Persulfate or chlorite anions may be used, as well
as proprietary formulations.  


<hr>
<h2>Reduce sludge generation</h2>
The amount of sludge generated by
treating plating wastewater is proportional to the concentration
of platables and other ions that precipitate at alkaline pH. 
Any of the techniques for reducing drag-out will also reduce sludge
generation.  As the hardness in the water supply will also form
sludge, the use of deionized water for rinsing will reduce sludge
generation.  The use of magnesium hydroxide, instead of sodium
hydroxide, to raise the pH and precipitate heavy metal hydroxides,
will also reduce sludge generation because a lesser mass of precipitant
is required and because the resultant sludge cake will dewater
more easily.  In some cases use of the sulfide ion to precipitate
the heavy metals as sulfides will result in a lesser mass of sludge.
 The use of ion exchange to capture and recover platable metals
can eliminate the generation of sludge, but may not be economical
in every case.
<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<P>
This manual is intended to provide a practical guide to pollution
prevention and waste reduction for the metal finishing industry.
 It should be used to help metal finishing industries identify,
assess, and implement waste minimization options.  Economic feasibility
is a crucial concern in this process.  It is recommended that
metal finishers conduct further research to investigate and evaluate
the technical and economic feasibility of any pollution prevention technologies.  The vendor
matrix table on the next page will aid in this process.  
<P>Reducing generation of wastes is most likely to provide substantial
benefits to the metal finishing industry by reducing raw material
costs, reducing disposal costs, and lowering the liability associated
with waste disposal.

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, which established the legal framework
for dealing with water pollution on a national scale, called for the establishment of 
pretreatment programs with standards and effluent guidelines.  Standards for the metal
finishing industry, first promulgated in the 1970's, were subject to litigation and
revision.  Final promulgation took place in the early 1980's.  The pretreatment regulations
establish a complex program of standards, monitoring, and enforcement.  To achieve 
compliance metal finishers may incur significant capital costs, ongoing operating costs,
administrative costs of obtaining and keeping discharge permits, and the risk of 
substantial fines and costly citizen suits for incidents of non-compliance.  By eliminating
the discharge of process wastewaters the metal finisher can eliminate the administrative costs
and risks of non-compliance while substantially enhancing its public image.  Attainment
of a 100% waste and pollution-free operation may appear remote at this time.  However,
efforts in that direction can only bring platers closer to an era of greatly reduced operating
risk and continuing compliance with federal, state and local regulations at more reasonable
costs.

<h3>NICKEL PLATE:  ELECTROLYTIC (Steel Substrate)</h3>

<p><img src="giffiles/1018-g02.jpg" hspace=15 Align=left border=0>

The electrodeposition of nickel, or <a href="1070.htm">nickel plate</a>, is one of the
most widely used and versatile processes in the surface finishing
industry.  Nickel plate produces finishes with a variety of mechanical
and decorative characteristics .  Although a versatile process,
rigorous process control must be maintained to achieve the desired
performance attributes.
<P>
Nickel deposition is most commonly used as a surface preparation
and a bright undercoat for decorative chromium plating.   Brass,
gold, silver and other metals may also be plated<B> </B>over bright
nickel deposits for a variety of decorative applications.  Engineering
and electroforming applications are other common uses.   
<P>
Bright <a href="1070.htm">nickel plate</a> is most frequently used to give
decorative chromium deposits their smooth, mirror-like appearance<B>.</B>
 Organic addition agents, usually in a sulfate bath, are required
to obtain semi- and full-mirror bright nickel deposits.  These
agents modify the metal deposit during the plating process to
yield desired characteristics.
<P>
Another function of this nickel sub-layer is to provide a limited
degree of corrosion protection to a variety of substrates including
steel, brass, zinc and die castings.  Two developments have resulted
in significant increases in corrosion protection over earlier
decorative nickel-chromium deposits.
<P>
The first development is the use of double- and triple-layer nickel
coatings.  Double-layer nickel plate makes use of an initial layer
of semi-bright, sulfur-free nickel underneath a layer of fully
bright nickel.<B> </B> This initial layer is highly corrosion-resistant
and protects the substrate from  attack which 
begins at pore sites in the final chromium deposit.  Deposition
of a thin, highly reactive nickel layer between the two layers
further enhances this effect.  
<P>
A second change that has increased corrosion protection is the
introduction of chromium plating finishes that exhibit a high
degree of microporosity, or microcracking.  Microporosity causes
corrosive attack to be more uniformly dispersed over a large area,
thus delaying and reducing the pitting characteristic of failure
of the chrome layer at a relatively few sites as is the case with
conventional chromium plating.
<P>
<B>Electroforming</B> involves the deposition of nickel onto a
mandrel which is a form or a shape, producing an electroformed
object.  This object, which is the product itself, is then separated
from the mandrel.  The products formed in this manner usually
cannot be produced easily, or at all, by other means.  Molds,
dies, record stamping dies, textile printing screens and other
intricately shaped objects are among the items manufactured by
electroforming.  Electroforming is most commonly carried out in
a nickel sulfamate bath.  The high concentration of nickel in
this bath yields appreciably higher plating rates than a sulfate
bath.
<P>
 
<P>
Residual stress (tensile or compressive) in the nickel deposit
is an important factor to control due to its tendency to<B> </B>cause
warping or distortion of the electroformed product.  Residual
stress is a function of the concentration of chlorides and 
impurities in the plating solution.  Impurities may result from
breakdown of solution chemicals, trace contamination from the
anode, and drag-in from previous tanks.  Stress factors near zero
are obtained when chloride concentrations are as low as possible
and solutions are as pure as possible.
<P>
<B>Engineering nickel plate</B> is a matte finish used to alter
or enhance characteristics such as corrosion resistance, wear,
hardness and magnetic properties of the substrate.  Other applications
include repair, rebuilding, and salvage of various machine parts,
and heavy undercoatings for hard chrome plating.
<P>
Most engineering nickel plate applications are produced in a sulfate
or sulfamate bath.  Sulfamate is more commonly used because of
its high plating rate and production of stress-free deposits.
 Alternate bath formulations may be used to yield specific properties.
 An example of this is the use of an all-chloride bath to achieve
extremely hard, brittle deposits. <B>  </B>
<P>
<I>Lowenheim (1974)</I> provides a number of different solution
chemistries and discusses nickel plate applications in more detail.

<A NAME="dragreduce"><h2>Reduce Drag-out</h2></a>
<P>Chemical drag-out is the primary source of contaminated
rinsewater, which requires treatment to remove harmful or regulated
pollutants before the water is reused or discharged. If the drag-out
is reduced, the rinse waters will be less contaminated and will
last longer.  Reduction of drag-out should minimize the amount
of process chemical additions to the bath and the mass of contaminants
that need to be removed from the rinsewater.  Several process
modifications that affect minimizing drag-out are listed below.
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "giffiles/elect2.gif"></CENTER>
<hr>

<a name="withdraw"><h3>Work Piece Withdrawal Rate</h3></a>
<P>
The speed with which work pieces are removed from a process solution
can have the greatest impact of any single factor on drag-out
volume.  Work piece withdrawal rate will influence the amount
of solution remaining on the work piece.  The more slowly a work
piece is withdrawn from a process bath, the thinner the chemical
film on the work piece and the less chemical contaminants in rinsewaters.

<hr>
<a name="drain"><h3>Drain Time (Hang Time)</h3></a>
<P>
A drain time of at least 10 seconds has been demonstrated to reduce
drag-out by 40+%, compared to the three second industry average.
Longer drain time over the process solution allows more drag-out
to be returned to the bath.  Drain times can be controlled by
posting drain times at tanks as a reminder to employees on manual
process lines or by building in delays on automatic process lines.
<P>

<HR>     
<a name="racking"><h3>Racking</h3>
<P>
Some work pieces being plated have re-entrant cavities which trap
process water when the work piece is lifted from the plating bath.
Racking these work pieces so that the cavities open downward
will promote draining, thereby reducing the amount of drag-out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>     

<a name="modify"><h3>Work Piece Modification</h3></a>
<P>
Consultation with work piece manufacturers to adjust design to
provide better bath liquid release, can reduce drag-out. Example:
a plater asked his customer whether he could drill four weep holes
in the work piece to improve drainage.  The customer agreed and
this pollution prevention technique was successfully implemented.

<a name="boards"><h3>Drain Boards</h3></a>
<P>
Drain boards are used to collect drag-out/drippings from
work pieces on racks, and direct the solution back into its previous
bath.  Drainboards save solutions and keep them off the floor.
These boards may be constructed of any compatible material. 
It is important that they be oriented to direct drips to
the correct tank.  Use of drain boards is a cost effective technique
which will reduce chemical consumption as well as the amount of
rinsewater.  
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC = "giffiles/elect3.gif"></CENTER>  <P>  

<hr>
<P>

<a name="barrels"><h3>Angled Barrels</h3></a>
<P>For large, horizontal double hung type barrels, no
producer/vendor of angled barrel technology has been found.  However,
one of the following modifications of existing barrels may prove
useful in minimizing drag-out.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Lengthen or shorten one arm, so as to create an off-horizontal
position, which allows for quicker runoff
<li>Attach a drip bar at the bottom of barrel edges to facilitate
droplet collection and runoff
<li>Design a slope at the top of barrel carriers; this, and
lengthening or shortening one arm, may require alteration of tank
depth to accommodate angled barrels</ul>

<p>Prior to implementing an angled or sloped barrel technique, the
design of all tanks must be checked to assure proper clearance
for the modified system.
<P>

<hr>


<a name="rinse"><h3>Spray Rinses and Air Knives</h3></a>
<P>
When mounted on the edge of a process tank, a pipe directing air or
water at the work pieces through appropriate nozzles can reduce
the amount of solution which is carried over to subsequent process
tanks.  Either fixed or movable nozzles can be used.  This procedure
enables keeping a solution in its tank of origin, rather than
passing into another tank as a contaminant.  Not all process operations
can accept this solution removal procedure; neither spray rinses
nor air knives are easily applied to barrel operations.   One
vendor offers an internal spray rinse system for barrel operations.

<P>
Spray rinses can be used above any heated process tank to recover
drag-out before it is transferred to the next tank.  The spray
flushes drag-out from the work pieces as they are withdrawn from
the process tank.  In rinsing efficacy a spray rinse is equivalent
to approximately one-half a dip rinse.  In many cases spray nozzles
can be sized and water flow rates adjusted such that the spray
rinsewater balances the evaporative losses.
<P>

Air knives are used to blow air across the surface of the work
pieces as they are withdrawn from the process or rinse solution,
physically pushing liquid off the work piece and into its tank
of origin, thereby reclaiming drag-out, reducing the volume of
rinsewater required, and enhancing the drying process.  In some
applications this rapid dry method may cause quality problems.

<h3>ION EXCHANGE</h3>

<p><img src="giffiles/1073-g02.jpg" hspace=15 Align=left border=0></p>

Ion exchange is a mature technology with a proven record of reducing
waste in the plating industry. 
<P>
 The technology is applicable to a variety of plating process
solutions including cyanide plating baths.  <I>Cushnie (1994)</I>
discusses a variety of applications for ion exchange based on
information gathered from industry and vendor surveys. 
<P>
Ion exchange is a chemical reaction in which an ion from in solution
is exchanged for a relatively benign, like charged ion attached
to a stationary medium (i.e., ion exchange resin).  This resin
is held in a column through which solution is passed, allowing
exchange to occur.  The reactions are predictable and the capacity
of the resins can be calculated.  When the resin capacity is reached,
the exchanged ions can be removed by displacement using a solution
containing the original ions.  This process is known as regeneration.
<P>
Resins are basically classified as either cationic or anionic.
 Cationic resins exchange hydrogen ions for positive ions such
as nickel, copper and zinc.  Anionic resins exchange hydroxyl
ions for negative ions such as chromates, sulfates, chlorides
and cyanide.  The regeneration step is generally carried out by
a strong mineral acid or base solution containing these ions.
<P>
Cationic resins are generally classified as strong or weak acid
types, and anionic resins as strong or weak base types.  An advantage
of the weak acid and weak base resins is that they require significantly
less reagent for regeneration than their strongly ionized counterparts.
 A number of general purpose and specialty ion exchange resins
are commercially available. 
<P>
The choice of resin for a particular application will depend on
the ion or ions to be removed and recovered, and the chemistry
of the process.  The resin is contained in a tank or container
equipped with valves, piping, retention screens and other components
necessary for proper operation. These containers are commonly
referred to as columns.
<P>
 
<P>
The basic operating cycle consists of: 
<ol><P><li><b>Service cycle</b>:  The solution to be treated  is passed
through the column until the resin is saturated.
<li><P><b>Backwash cycle</b>:  Water is flushed through the column
in reverse direction of the service cycle to redistribute the
resin.
<li><P><b>Regeneration cycle</b>:  A strong mineral acid or base solution
is passed through the exchanger to displace the exchanged ion,
restoring the resin to its original state.  The direction of flow
is generally in reverse of the service cycle.
<li><P><b>Rinse cycle</b>:  Water is passed through the exchanger
to remove excess regenerant.</ol>
<P>
Columns may be installed in parallel or in series.  In a parallel
arrangement, the input stream flows through one column while the
other is regenerated and held in reserve.  In a series configuration,
the input stream flows through both columns in sequence.  When
the first column is exhausted it is taken off line, regenerated
and returned to service as the second or trailing column.  In
both schemes, the roles of the two columns are continually interchanged.
 In most cases the feed solution will require particle and carbon
filtration to prevent solids from fouling the resin.
<P>
Various methods are used to determine the point at which regeneration
should take place.  These include the use of conductivity meters,
specific ion probes, analytical methods, cumulative elapsed time
or flow volume.
<P><a HREF="1078.htm">Drag-out recovery</a> 
or recovery rinsing is generally used
with ion exchange to return the majority of drag-out to the process
tank. This reduces the capacity and cost of equipment required
for ion exchange, and reduces the quantity of regenerant produced.
 Some installations use cation exchange only to remove metals.
 In these cases, the wastewater containing salts is discharged
directly to the POTW<B> - </B>if within discharge limits.  If
above discharge limits, on-site wastewater treatment is required
before discharge.  
<P>
The backwash solutions resulting from step 2 of the operating
cycle typically contain low levels of pollutants and are sent
to on-site wastewater treatment as well.  If zero discharge is
an ultimate goal, eliminating these waste streams becomes a priority.
 Some system designs reuse portions of the regenerant and backwash
streams to reduce total wastewater volume.<B> </B> The flow diagram
illustrates the choices available to handle the metal-rich regenerant
stream.
<P>
Modern ion exchange systems generally incorporate microprocessors
to control the complex switching of columns, through the service,
backwash, regeneration and rinse cycles.  Saturated columns are
either regenerated within the facility or off-site by an external
supplier.  The latter option eliminates the regenerant and backwash
streams along with the equipment and reagents they require.
<P>
<I>Cushnie (1994)</I> reports the following capital costs for
fully automatic equipment as a function of flow rate.  He notes
that pricing comparisons based solely on capacity can ignore factors
such as the degree of customization, level of automation, quality
of instrumentation, etc. 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER COLWIDTH="1,1">

<TR><TD>Flow rate (gpm) <TD>Ion exchange capital cost range ($ x 1000)

<TR><TD><center>10   <TD> <center>30 - 40
<TR><TD><center>20   <TD> <center>60 - 70
<TR><TD><center>30   <TD><center>85</center>
</TABLE>
<P>
Operating costs are dependent on labor requirements, regeneration
frequency and chemistry, energy requirements, and resin replacement.
 Labor requirements will vary depending on the degree of automation.
 Regeneration frequency will depend on the characteristics of
the input stream.  Resin life is also dependent on the input stream
and is usually measured in years.  These factors must be addressed
and determined in order to design, size and deliver an effective<B>
</B>system. The equipment supplier should be able to provide a
reasonably accurate estimate of operating costs using this data.
 A vendor may also be able to provide actual operating costs and
performance data on similar installations.  Design and installation
of an effective ion exchange system is highly dependent on the
vendor's competence.

for metal recovery and deionized water recycle.

<h2>DRAG OUT RECOVERY</h2>
<p>Drag-out recovery may also be called recovery rinsing, static rinsing, or return rinsing. It refers to the processing of  cleaning chemicals or plating solutions that have been removed from the process bath during the particular cleaning or plating process.  Drag-out recovery should be  distinguished from <a HREF="1060.htm">drag-out control/reduction</a> which seeks to reduce the quantity of material actually leaving the process tank. Drag-out control/reduction is treated as a separate topic and may be used as an alternative or complementary technique to drag-out recovery.

<p>Drag-out control, drag-out recovery and counterflow rinsing are all crucial factors in minimizing water usage and the quantity of chemicals which must be treated or recovered by other methods. For this reason they are the most influential factors in determining the size (and cost) of additional recovery systems which might be considered. 

<br><HR>
<br>

<h3>DRIP TANK</h3>
The most basic form of drag out recovery is a simple drip tank. Racks or barrels are allowed to hang or drain over an empty rinse. The accumulated process solution is periodically returned to the process tank. In some cases a drip tank may be the preferred configuration. However, in most cases a recovery rinse tank will be more efficient.

<br>
 <h3>RECOVERY RINSING</h3>
A single recovery rinse tank arrangement followed by a double counterflow rinse is illustrated below. The return volume in this system is equal to one-half the drag-out volume, yielding a  25% recovery. If return volume is equal to drag-out volume, a 50% recovery is realized and flow from the recovery rinse is eliminated. Additional increases in the return volume not only increase the recovery rate but allow decreased rinse flow to obtain the same rinsing levels. Higher temperature processes can recover more materials by replacing evaporation losses from the drag-out rinse. If the evaporation rate is twice the drag-out rate, the recovery rate increases to 66.7%. In such cases deionized water should be utilized to restore the drag out tank volume.

<p>It may be possible to achieve closed loop rinsing on relatively high temperature processes.  A second heated  tank may be employed to increase system evaporation and, hence, enable the  return of a larger drag-out volume.  Closed loop or high return systems will likely require some form of purification. Useful applications of this scheme include nickel plate, with carbon filtration and electrolytic purification prior to return or to alkaline cleaning, with oil separation and filtration prior to return. In the latter case, the heated recovery tank may be eliminated for high temperature cleaners. 
<div align=center><p><img src="giffiles/1078-g02.gif" border=0 ></center>

<br>
<h3>DRAG-IN / DRAG-OUT RECOVERY</h3>
The figure below illustrates a two tank drag-in / drag-out recovery configuration followed by a double counterflow rinse.  A well managed system of this type can reduce chemical losses up to 50 % on room temperature processes.  As noted above, higher temperature processes can recover more materials by replacing evaporation losses from the drag-out rinse and in such cases, deionized water should be used to restore the drag out tank volume.  Manually operated lines can employ a single tank to accomplish the same result by rinsing parts in the drag-out tank prior to processing.  One disadvantage of this arrangement is that work must be transported over the process tank to reach the rinse.  Additional concerns include the capital cost and floor space required to install additional tanks.  A pump may be necessary to equalize solution levels between the two tanks.
<div align=center><p><img src="giffiles/1078-g03.gif " border=0 ></center>

<p>These methods are generally applicable to any process including cleaners, acid pickles and others process solutions.  Many processes, however, are sensitive to high concentration rinses or the return of contaminants inherent in the process and simply cannot accommodate a large return volume.  Some type of recovery rinsing is usually employed to reduce drag-out volumes prior to  application of other recovery technologies such as evaporative recovery and ion exchange.

<h3>NICKEL PLATE:  ELECTROLYTIC (Sulfate/Sulfamate Bath)</h3>

<p><img src="giffiles/1070-g02.jpg" hspace=15 Align=left border=0>

The sulfate and sulfamate baths are the most widely used for nickel
plate general applications. <B> </B>Other nickel salt solutions
may be used for special purpose applications.  <I>Lowenheim (1974)</I><B>
</B>discusses a number of these special purpose applications.
 Knowledge of the specific chemistry for any particular nickel
plate application is essential for proper control of the process.
 The chemical composition and operating parameters for sulfate
and sulfamate baths shown below are representative of most nickel
plating baths.

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Spray recovery rinse following decorative <BR>

</CAPTION>
</TABLE>

<P>Based on recommendations from a waste reduction assessment conducted
by a the Institute of Advanced Manufacturing Sciences, a NIST Manufacturing
Extension Center, a simple spray rinse drag-out recovery tank was installed
on the decorative chrome plating line at the Leonhardt Plating Company
to reduce chromic acid drag-out losses. </P>

<P>Periodically, 10-15 gallons of deionized water is added to an empty
tank immediately following the chromic acid plating bath. The operator
uses a stream of rinse water generated by a recirculating pump to remove
most of the chromic acid drag-out from the work. </P>

<P>Notice the color difference between the rinsed and unrinsed parts in
the photo below. Over time, the chromic acid concentration of the drag-out
bath increases and enriched solution is returned as makeup to the plating
bath. If evaporation losses from the plating bath are sufficiently high,
significant savings in the cost of metal salt addition to the plating bath
can be achieved. It is important to charge the spray rinse tank with deionized
or reverse osmosis water to reduce contamination of the plating bath with
unwanted ion species. </P>

<TABLE ALIGN=LEFT hspace="15" >

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=-1>Detail of recovery spray rinse. Note viscous <BR>
yellow chromic acid on parts at left</FONT></I></B> </P>
</CAPTION>
</TABLE>

<P>Although drag-out reduction is an effective method of pollution prevention,
it may create its own set of problems. When drag-out is reduced, the buildup
of contaminants from the breakdown of bath chemicals and drag-in of minerals
tends to increase. Some method of maintaining or restoring bath chemistry
such as the use of <A HREF="1073.htm">ion exchange</A> for process water
may be necessary. In general, however, it is more cost effective to prevent
concentrated plating solutions from being diluted in subsequent processes
thus increasing the volume of solution that must be treated. </P>

<h2>Fact Sheet: Dual Use Applications Program</h2>

Dual Use Applications Program -- The FY 1997 President's Budget contains $250
million to begin the Dual Use Applications Program (DUAP), a joint program
conducted by the three military departments, <A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil">DARPA</a>, and <A HREF="http://www.dtic.mil/ddre/">DDR&amp;E</a>.  The DUAP will
introduce dual use R&amp;&D approaches into the military services as a new norm by
developing dual use technologies for the direct benefit of military users. 
Building on the lessons of previous dual use programs, the DUAP will embed this
new way of doing business throughout the military services.
<P>

DUAP's pool of R&amp;D funds will create an opportunity for service program managers
and firms to develop dual use technology -- technology that is militarily useful
and commercially viable.  R&amp;D projects will be solicited as government/industry
partnerships, selected to meet service needs, and managed by the services using
new authorities and methods.  Each project must include, up front, a clearly
identified path for the technology to be used in a military system and become
commercially viable.  
<P>

Technology Reinvestment Project -- There will be no further TRP competitions. 
Projects selected in the <A HREF="../select95/95desc.html">1995</a> competition are just beginning, while work on many
of the projects selected in the <A HREF="../annual_95/appendixes.html">1993 and 1994</a> competitions is continuing.   TRP
projects will now be monitored by the Joint Dual Use Program Office.

<h2>Fact Sheet: The Joint Dual Use Program Office</h2>
<HR> 
In December 1995, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, DARPA, and the Army, Navy and Air Force signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the Joint Dual-Use Program Office (JDUPO).  The new office reports to the Director of Defense Research and Engineering and will develop a military-based, DoD-wide approach to dual-use technology development for more effective and affordable military weapon systems.  It will select technology focus areas, offer solicitations, and conduct competitions.  In addition, the office will monitor ongoing TRP efforts from earlier competitions.<p>

The Office will be staffed initially with an Office Director (to be provided by DARPA) and three Service Deputies (one from the Army, Navy and Air Force).  Funding for the first year (FY97) will be provided by DARPA, with future funding to be provided by the Director for Defense Research and Engineering.  Additional staffing and future funding levels have yet to be determined.  The civilian agencies previously part of TRP are not parties to the official Memorandum of Understanding, but DoD hopes to continue its excellent cooperation with the civilian technical experts.<p> 

<!--The JDUPO will continue the tradition of selecting projects competitively.  During 1996, the JDUPO will finalize plans for the FY97 competition, and choose eight to 10 technology focus areas for the competition.<P>-->

<h2>Fact Sheet: The Technology Reinvestment Project</h2>
<HR>

The Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP) was established in 1993.  The program's goal was to develop militarily useful, commercially viable technology in order to improve the DoD's access to affordable, advanced technology.  All of the projects funded under TRP were selected competitively, with competitions held in 1993, 1994 and 1995.  To date, approximately $686 million in DoD funds have been committed to 131 technology development projects.  In addition, each of these projects must receive at least an equal amount of its funding from private organizations.<p>

The TRP was managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), with participation by the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Departments of Transportation, Commerce, and Energy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science Foundation.  All funding was provided by DoD.<p>

No further TRP competitions are planned.  The projects that were selected in the 1995 competition are just beginning, while work on many of the projects selected in 1993 and 1994 competitions continues.  Work on TRP projects will now be monitored by the newly established <A HREF=jdupo_fact.html>Joint Dual Use Program Office</a>.

States has become increasingly involved in world affairs, and, when necessary, conflicts.  At the same
time, we are using a more limited force to respond to more diverse
challenges.  In these circumstances, the United States must constantly
work to find new ways to minimize our casualties, multiply our power, and
protect our people and equipment.  Technology can provide solutions for
many of these concerns.
<P>
The Technology Reinvestment Project, under the management and sponsorship
of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, is ensuring that technology
development vital to current and future national security continues.  At
the same time, it is cooperating with and tapping into the resources of
the commercial sector, allowing Defense to maintain U.S. military
superiority by affordably producing the technology it needs.</font>

<h1>Appendixes</h1>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="append_a.html">Appendix A: Development</a></LI>
<LI><A HREF="append_b.html">Appendix B: Deployment</a></LI>
<LI><A HREF="append_c.html">Appendix C: Manufacturing Education and Training</a></LI>
</UL>

<HR>

These appendixes present a brief description of the projects selected by the
Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP) in its first two competitions. The three
competition areas are presented in separate sections, each of which begins with
introductory text that describes the overall strategy for a set of projects,
followed by specific descriptions of those projects.<p>
Each description is written as a stand-alone paragraph. Thus, there is some
repetition among descriptions, especially in <A HREF="append_a.html">Technology Deployment</a> and
<A HREF="append_c.html">Manufacturing Education and Training</a>, where the general objectives of many of
the projects are similar.
<p>
In addition, a list of participants is given for each project. Every effort has
been made to accurately reflect the status of the projects. However, because
the projects are dynamic, changes in the status of TRP projects and the
partnerships occur from time to time.
<p>
Projects selected in the second competition (1994) are indicated by a
parenthetical note at the end of the section. All others were selected in the
first competition (1993).

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/focus.gif"><p>Military systems often depend on
sophisticated control systems in order to operate close to their performance limits.  New, more affordable
controls technology would reduce the costs of major military systems while
extending their useful life and reducing their maintenance requirements.
Because these same advantages are of interest to many commercial products and
systems, this creates an opportunity for R&amp;D projects in the mutual
interest of the DoD and the commercial sector.  This TRP focus area addresses a
broad spectrum of controls technologies such as standard components for "plug
and play" architectures, distributed high temperature controls, intelligent
sensor/actuator systems, and adaptive controls.  Introducing commercial
dynamism and economies of scale in the design and manufacture of control
systems important to the DoD will create a wider base of affordable controls
technologies for the military.<p>

<p>
This project will develop and demonstrate affordable, reliable, distributed
control systems with electronic modules that operate at up to 200[[ring]] C.
Distributed control architectures offer better performance and reliability,
lower weight, and lower purchase and maintenance costs.  This project will
allow distributed architectures to be more widely used in both military and
commercial applications by improving the ability to place sensors and actuators
in hostile, high temperature environments.  In particular, this project will
demonstrate high temperature, distributed control components on a F119 jet
engine vane actuator and an automotive power steering system.<p>

<p>
This team of control system users and a control system manufacturer will
develop Common Building Block Electronic Modules in order to significantly
lower the design, development, and manufacturing cost of digital controllers.
Such "black box" controllers are used in military and commercial jet engines,
automotive products, industrial automation, and many other applications.  The
electronic building blocks developed under this project would be used as
common, shared parts to create a wide variety of digital controllers at a lower
cost.  For example, it is estimated that this approach might lower the cost of
a typical jet engine controller by 20 to 40 percent.   The building blocks will
be developed by defining functions that can be shared and by constructing high
density electronic modules using new, low cost packaging technology.<p>

<p>
This project will demonstrate intelligent shock mitigation and isolation system
(ISMIS) devices that could be integrated into the structural elements of
buildings and Navy ships.  These devices will reduce the effects of low
frequency, random vibrations on structures by using sophisticated
electromechanical components to intelligently absorb and redistribute the
vibrational energy.  In the case of Navy ships, these vibrations can stem from
underwater weapons and have a devastating effect on shipboard equipment.
Always a danger to ships, these shocks are an even more pressing problem as the
Navy uses more commercial-off-the-shelf equipment.  Earthquakes create a very
similar set of problems for buildings.  ISMIS is a possible solution to both
problems, creating an opportunity for the Navy to leverage the growing market
for seismic protection equipment.  If successful, this team will create a
commercial family of ISMIS products that the Navy could also use to meet its
needs.<p>

solid-state lasers and light detection and ranging techniques to measure the
three dimensional wind velocity vector around aircraft.  This would give the
military improved weapons fire control accuracy for helicopters, as well as
high accuracy air data for the control of high performance aircraft.  The
commercial sector has an interest in this technology because it could help
detect wake vortices from nearby aircraft as well as turbulence in landing
areas.  This project will demonstrate both the performance and the
affordability of such a laser system, so that it will become attractive for
commercial and military customers.<p>

GE and its partners will design, fabricate and test a prototype Model Based
Control and Diagnostics (MBCD) system.  MBCD uses a real-time model, embedded
in the digital controller, to enhance control and diagnostics.  This type of
adaptive control system has the potential to improve the thrust to weight
ratio, fuel consumption, reliability, weight, and cost of military jet engines.
Specific goals of this project are:  design a nonlinear, model based controller
and demonstrate its unique adaptive capabilities; implement the diagnostics
needed to detect, isolate, and accommodate faults; and demonstrate the ability
of the system to run efficiently with a reduced number of sensors. If
successful, MBCD will be introduced in several systems.  GE will use it on
military and commercial jet engines, Ford will insert this technology into
automobiles, and Lockheed-Martin will apply it to aircraft flight controls.<p>

<p>
McDonnell Douglas and its partners will develop the components, interfaces,
practices, software, and tools needed for affordable vehicle management systems
(VMS) that can meet the requirements of both military and commercial aircraft
through an open, "plug and play" architecture.  This approach could be
integrated into current aircraft to extend their useful life and set the VMS
standard for the next generation of military and commercial aircraft.  By
developing components for a variety of dual use applications, the cost of VMS
systems can be reduced. For example, it is estimated that this approach could
reduce the life cycle cost of a fighter VMS by 23 percent over the current F-22
estimates, along with making improvements in weight and reliability.  The VITAL
project will culminate in flight-tests on military and commercial aircraft to
demonstrate its practicality and benefits.  This team, which includes many
major suppliers to the military and commercial aircraft markets, will be able
to sustain the technology and resource base necessary for this new VMS

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/focus.gif"><p>Many soldiers wounded in combat must be diagnosed
and treated during the first hour after they are injured or their chances of recovery are
poor.  In fact, the percentage of wounded who survive this "Golden Hour" has
not changed since the Civil War, partly because it is so difficult to get good
diagnostic information on the battlefield.  This TRP focus area will improve
the quality and timeliness of diagnostic information available both on the
battlefield and in the field hospital by developing technologies that will
provide information about where shrapnel is located in the body, the extent and
nature of wounds, and internal bleeding. <p>
<p>
The civil trauma care community has a very similar set of problems, creating an
opportunity to work on technologies of interest to both the DoD and civil
sectors.  This will help ensure that emerging civil trauma care technology will
meet the military's requirements for "far forward" devices such as low power
consumption, portability, and ruggedness, and that the DoD will benefit from
the interoperability, technological dynamism, and cost reducing
economies-of-scale stemming from the civilian marketplace.  The five projects
in this focus area should lead to commercially viable, militarily useful
devices that will give corpsmen and physicians better diagnostic information
much less invasively, particularly through the use of ultrasound.<p>

<b>Tetrad Corporation</b>, Materials Systems Inc., Medical Media Systems<p>
<p>
This project will develop a system that will allow field surgeons to use
internal, ultrasound probes to rapidly assess internal organ damage far less
invasively.  These small, rugged, autoclavable probes will be inserted through
wounds or other small holes.  The ultrasound data they produce will be fused
with other diagnostic data, such as MRIs or laproscopic video, in order to
produce a more usable and versatile image for the surgeon.  This project will
develop the probes, ultrasound system, and data fusion techniques needed to
integrate this system into a mobile surgery suite located near the front lines.
Civilian applications for minimally invasive surgery and trauma care closely
parallel the needs of the combat surgeon, creating an opportunity for this
technology to be sustained by a larger marketplace.  Eventually, these
capabilities could become one of the building blocks for the remote combat
surgery systems of the future.<p>

<p>
In this project, Teratech and its partners will develop the technology
necessary for a battery-operated, high-resolution, portable ultrasound system.
Current ultrasound systems are ill-suited to the battlefield because they are
bulky, consume large amounts of power, and produce images that can be difficult
to interpret. This project will use innovative charge domain electronics for
the beamforming computation in order to dramatically reduce the power
consumption and size of these scanners and improve their field portability.
This team will also improve the image quality and diagnostic utility of the
ultrasound images by using adaptive beamforming techniques to correct the
aberrating effects of tissue.  Other enhancements to this system include a
technology that will allow physicians to see some internal functions, such as
blood flow, without surgery.  With survival rates highly dependent on treatment
speed, the portability and on-site diagnostic information  provided by this
system will improve the care of a wounded soldier on the battlefield or other
trauma victims.  <p>

dimension) to form ultrasound images of a 3-D volume of tissue.  Additional
features of this project include beamforming electronics integrated with the
transducer arrays, unique interconnection technology, and a modular approach to
imaging software for ease of data transmission.  Compact, real time, 3-D
imaging systems represent a totally new product that will not only serve
existing clinical needs, but will open new diagnostic and monitoring

and in general medical practice.  Focused on reducing the size and cost of
ultrasound, this project will use advanced application specific integrated
circuits to create a hand-held, ultrasound imaging device with telemedicine
capability and an image quality comparable to the current top-of-the-line
conventional clinical systems, which are the size of refrigerators.  Madigan
Army Hospital is participating on the team to make sure that the device will be
suitable for the battlefield.  The portability of this instrument will enable
the diagnosis to be brought to the battlefield, rather than the casualty to the

<p>
This project will develop a virtual endoscope -- a safe, non-invasive, and more
cost-effective method of examining internal organs that will use virtual
reality technology to view large 3-D anatomy data sets produced by CAT scans,
ultrasound, or MRIs.   Essentially, this technology will allow physicians to
view this 3-D data as though they were looking through an endoscope, but
without the invasiveness and expense of an endoscopic procedure.  This will
improve the ability to diagnose and assess internal injuries on the far forward
battlefield by allowing a fast, contiguous, non-invasive examination of hollow
organs.  Moreover, data from a wounded soldier could be shown in a format
familiar to surgeons and endoscopists anywhere in the world, bringing their
radiological expertise to the physicians near the battlefield and wounded.  The
sophisticated image rendering of virtual endoscopy can be applied to other
current ARPA and TRP projects involving remote imaging on the battlefield, such
as handheld ultrasound and portable MRIs.  In the civilian realm, this
revolutionary radiological technology will have a wide variety of applications,
particularly for detecting colorectal cancer more comfortably and less
expensively through virtual colonoscopy.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/focus.gif"><p>Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)
technology uses the materials and processes of semiconductor electronics to create integrated
electromechanical systems that merge computation, sensing, and actuation.  MEMS
technology will give existing and new weapons systems overwhelming sensing and
actuation abilities -- creating new ways to both <I>perceive</I>  and
<I>control  </I>the battlefield.  Embedding MEMS into weapons system, from
precision munitions to high-maneuverability aircraft, will bring the military
new levels of situational awareness and battlefield control.  MEMS is emerging
as one of the most important new technologies for both Defense and commercial
systems; it will make high-end performance affordable for low-end systems,
extend the lifetimes of existing systems, and create radically new
capabilities.<P>
<P>
The projects in this focus area will accelerate the affordability,
manufacturability, and insertion of MEMS devices into specific and mutually
supporting DoD and commercial applications. Starting from demonstrated MEMS
concepts, these projects focus on achievable, dual-use products requiring the
development of affordable manufacturing processes.<P>

<P>
The project will develop the manufacturing, testing, and device technology
necessary to make micromachined silicon gyroscopes and inertial sensor
assemblies available for only tens, instead of tens of thousands, of dollars
and weighing only tenths, instead of tens, of kilograms. Manufacturing these
MEMS devices cost effectively will make them viable for a variety of automotive
systems such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and for guidance applications
in a large class of DoD munitions, such as mortars, precision munitions, and
the Marine's Predator missile.<P>
<P>
This project takes advantage of the fact that the performance requirements for
gyroscopes in the Predator's guidance systems and the next generation ABS are
extremely similar.  By creating the manufacturing techniques and devices to
serve the growing, worldwide ABS market and DoD munitions, the development of a
MEMS-based gyro production capability will accelerate the availability of these
devices and reduce the DoD's acquisition costs for the Predator and related
guidance units. To help ensure that the project can serve both commercial and
military customers, its advisory group consists of the world's largest
manufacturer of conventional munitions and the world's number two auto maker.<P>

<P>
Martin Marietta and its partners will develop a wireless, tactical missile
readiness monitoring system by using MEMS devices, including latching
accelerometers and pressure sensors, to monitor the structural and
environmental integrity of missile housings.  The team will combine existing
and new MEMS technology, low power electronics, and wireless communications
into a unique sensor suite that will let DoD personnel remotely assess the
readiness of missile rounds in storage, transit, and the field.  SMARTS will
use two types of MEMS-based sensors to produce data to be transmitted via a
cellular phone or military data link to a modem anywhere in the world.
Compared to conventional, labor-intensive inspections, SMARTS will make rapid,
accurate, and timely readiness measurements possible for a broad range of
missile systems, improving weapon reliability, readiness, and effectiveness.<P>
<P>
SMARTS technology will also be used to remotely monitor the structural
integrity and traffic load on highway bridges and other structures.  Due to the
prohibitive costs of conventional data collection methods, highway structures
are monitored at intervals measured in years.  SMARTS will not only reduce
inspection costs but create new monitoring capabilities not possible today,
including continuous assessment for extreme weather or traffic conditions.
Using SMARTS for monitoring transportation structures will broaden the market
for integrated MEMS, low-power, and wireless technologies,  and ensure
affordable components and systems for the DoD use.  Civil and military users of
SMARTS will increase their systems' reliability, readiness, and safety with
order of magnitude reductions in maintenance time, labor, and costs.<P>

<h1>Operations Other Than War/Law Enforcement</h1><p><A HREF="../index.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="image/cover_button.gif"></A>

<HR>
<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/focus.gif"><p>Recently, there has been an increased emphasis
on military missions where the armed forces are used for purposes other than large scale combat.  Although
limited in scope, these missions --  termed operations other than war (OOTW) --
still present a hostile environment for the military forces performing them.
They also require a unique set of tools and strategies to accomplish the
mission while minimizing casualties to friendly forces and non-combatants.  For
example, these missions often require interacting with foreign civilian
populations or conducting military operations in urban areas.  The current
mission in Bosnia is a very visible example of this type of operation. <p>
<p>
While the development of technologies addressing these unique operations can
have a major, positive impact, the DoD cannot afford to support the entire cost
of sustaining the technology base for its limited use.  Fortunately, law
enforcement (LE) missions share many of the same operational and technical
requirements as DoD's OOTW mission.  Consequently, this general area has many
opportunities for creating common technologies that benefit both the OOTW and
civilian LE communities.  The benefits of these common technologies include the
sharing of front end conceptual design, engineering and prototype
demonstrations costs as well as providing a larger production base to reduce
unit costs.  Through this dual-use approach, DoD can have access to new
technologies for an important, but limited, operational requirement without the
need to support all of the required technology.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/feature.gif"><h3>Advanced CTP800 Turboprop for Surveillance Aircraft</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Company (Allison Engine Company and
AlliedSignal Engine)</b>, Ages Group, Army/Army Research Lab Program Office,
Chandler Evans<p>
<p>
This project will adapt and reconfigure the T800/CTS800 turboshaft engine
currently used in the US Army RAH-66 Commanche helicopter into a new 1350 shaft
horse power turboprop engine and demonstrate the new engine in aircraft
applicable to both military and commercial use. This will require redesigning
the gear box, flight controls, and various other mechanical aspects of the
engine.<p>
<p>
The performance of the T800 is significantly better than any other engine of
its class, but its cost is likely to remain high because of the limited size of
the helicopter market.  The turboprop market, on the other hand, offers a
larger number of opportunities for engine insertions and economies of scale.
By adapting the T800 engine for that use, its superior performance will be
available for a number of DoD applications. The first intended military
aircraft for the new engine is the Army's Airborne Reconnaissance Low
Surveillance platform, an asset used to support OOTW missions.  With a parallel
intended commercial platform (DeHavilland DHC-7), this new turboprop engine
would benefit both military and commercial aviation, including enhanced safety
and decreased operations, maintenance, and engine costs.  Many of these
improvements would, in turn, flow back to the Commanche engine from which the
new engine sprang, providing a benefit to that Army system as well.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/feature.gif"><h3>Affordable Language Education Software for Government and
CommercialCommerical Use</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Broderbund Software Inc</b>., Corona Corporation, SRI International<p>
<p>
This project will develop and demonstrate a prototype system for affordable,
portable foreign language training and maintenance.  It will develop software
to teach and maintain Spanish for native English speakers using personal
computers. The system will be designed so it can be used for other languages of
interest to the DoD. <p>
<p>
The availability of cost-effective, portable language training and maintenance
software will improve the efficiency of US operations.  Language proficiency is
extremely important in a variety of military situations, especially for the
Special Operations Forces.  Currently, DoD's language training and retraining
is done at centralized locations.  The world wide stationing of our forces on
land and sea makes it difficult and expensive to provide language proficiency.
Furthermore, language proficiency decreases without constant use or
maintenance; retraining is difficult when deployment can be at a moment's
notice. Spanish is an excellent demonstration language because a large number
of Special Operation Forces need this language. The similar needs within the
law enforcement community, counterdrug agencies, and the commercial business
sector will help ensure rapid acceptance and non-DoD funded enhancements of
this technology.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/feature.gif"><h3>Diver Alert and Tracking System</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Sonetech Corporation;</b> Ocean Vision Technology; Perdix, Inc.; Sanders
Design International<p>
<p>
This project will develop and demonstrate a prototype Diver Alert and Tracking
System that will produce navigation accuracy  in the littoral, undersea
environment comparable to differential GPS. Although the need for military
divers to know their precise location is critical, current approaches to this
problem are rudimentary.  Because a GPS signal cannot be received underwater, a
different type of system, like this one, is needed by our military divers. For
example, this system would greatly enhance the mine location and clearance
capability of the Navy's Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Special Warfare
communities.  Because this navigation capability would also be of interest to
sports divers and commercial diving operations, it should be sustained and
enhanced by the non-DoD marketplace once this technology's feasibility is
demonstrated.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/feature.gif"><h3>Electron Bombarded CCD Camera</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Intevac Advanced Technology Division</b>; EEV, Inc.; Federal Bureau of
Investigations,; Honeywell Inc.; The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.;
University of Arizona<p>
<p>
This project will develop and prototype an Electron Bombarded Charged Coupled
Device (CCD) camera that will have two times better resolution at low light
levels, ten times greater sensitivity, half the package size, and a lower cost
than existing night vision CCD cameras.<p>
<p>
Low light vision is obviously of critical importance to the DoD; if this
project is successful, it will significantly improve that capability.  Possible
benefits include more accurate identification of personnel, vehicles, and
markings.  In addition, the smaller size and lower cost of this device will
allow it to be used in many more operational situations than current devices,
including as a subsystem in surveillance platforms.   The advantages of
improved low light vision at a lower cost and size also appeal to the law
enforcement and private security communities, providing a way for DoD to obtain
and sustain this technology at a lower cost.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/feature.gif"><h3>Millimeter Wave Focal Plane Array Radar for Concealed Weapons
Detection</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Millitech Corporation,</b> Riverside Research Institute, Technology Service
Corporation<p>
<p>
This project will develop and demonstrate a millimeter wave focal plane array
radar for detecting weapons and other contraband materials concealed behind
walls, in packages, or under someone's clothing.  Millimeter wave radar is
ideal for this application because it can penetrate buildings or other
materials and clearly  show metal objects.  This project will develop a
brassboard system that can use both active and passive sensing modes.  <p>
<p>
In counterterrorism and hostage rescues, critical decisions must often be made
without fully knowing the number and location of an adversary's weapons.  The
consequences of being wrong can be disastrous.  This technology will be able to
improve the safety and success of military, particularly Special Forces, and
law enforcement missions by giving them significantly more knowledge about
previously unseen dangers. Other potential civil applications include weapons
detection systems similar to those currently used at airports and building
entrances.<p>

<p>
<b>Language Systems Inc.</b>; Air Force/Rome Laboratory; Air Force/Wright
Laboratory; Eloquent Technology, Inc.; Entropic Research Laboratories, Inc.;
Motorola<p>
<p>
This proposal will develop a hand-held or body-mounted translator to assist
military or law enforcement officers communicate with people who speak a
foreign language.  The translator will take simple spoken English from its
operator, translate it into the foreign language, and generate an audible
output in that foreign language.  Conversely, the translator will also handle
spoken input in that foreign language, translate it into English, and generate
audible English output.  Both these translations will take place in very close
to real time.  Spanish will be the first language to be demonstrated, but other
languages, including Arabic, will be added as the system is expanded.<p>
<p>
Ineffective and misunderstood language or hand signals between the US military
and foreign populations can lead to serious, unfortunate consequences during
the confusion of a conflict.   For example, non-verbal offers to surrender are
often taken as just the opposite.  This technology will provide soldiers with
the ability to clearly and directly communicate with foreign populations --
dramatically reducing unnecessary casualties and making US forces more
effective. This capability will also be extremely useful for law enforcement
personnel communicating with people who have a very poor command of English.
The wide range of possible applications for this technology will create
incentives for future enhancement by the commercial sector and lead to lower
costs for the military.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/focus.gif"><p>Optics are a critical component in over 350
current US military weapons systems ranging from relatively simple devices such as night vision optics to the most
complicated precision guided munitions, sensing, targeting, communications, and
reconnaissance systems.  Advances in precision optics in ultraviolet, visible
and infrared regions, will be increasingly important to next generation
advanced defense systems. The ability to fabricate the optics for these
advanced systems with improved performance and reduced manufacturing costs is a
critically important capability.  <p>
<p>
The projects in this focus area will develop technology to cost effectively
manufacture precision optical components to meet the needs of the DoD and a
broad spectrum of emerging commercial technologies  including optical
communications, optical data storage, microlithography, minimally invasive
laser surgery, environmental sensing, and surveillance systems.  These
technologies require high precision reflective and refractive optical elements
such as aspherics, toroids, cylinders, diffractive optical elements, and micro-

optics.
 Many consumer and business products such as copying machines, laser scanners,
laser printers, compact optical disks, and camcorders require low cost high
volume production of these same optics.  Demand for optics is projected to grow
geometrically in the next few decades.  These projects will help ensure that
the DoD can take advantage of the cost and capabilities that will result from
this growth.<p>

Optics</h3><p>
<p>
<b>AOtec, Inc.;</b> Army/Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate;
Kaiser Electro-Optics; Kaiser Electronics; Loral Infrared and Imaging Systems<p>
<p>
This project will develop cost effective manufacturing technology for making
hybrid diffractive/refractive polymeric lenses -- lenses that integrate
diffraction and refraction within the same element.  Hybrid lenses allow the
number of optical elements in a design to be reduced, with a commensurate
reduction in cost, weight, and complexity.  In particular, this project will
develop processes for mass producing low cost, lightweight, compact,
shatter-resistant, precision plastic optics and an advanced automated optical
assembly station featuring real time, on-

line
testing, robotic systems, and image processing.<p>
<p>
Among the DoD systems that could be improved by low cost hybrid optics are
head-mounted displays for aviators, thermal imaging rifle sights, combat
vehicle vision enhancers, and simulators.  AOtec will develop the technology
working with end product developers in the defense area (Kaiser Electronics and
Loral Infrared and Imaging Systems) and the commercial area (Kaiser
Electro-Optics).  The performance improvements enabled by the project will be
demonstrated by the end-users.<p>

metrology for in-situ dimensional measurements) to demonstrate improved system
size, weight, performance, and cost.  The technologies will be prototyped and
evaluated on selected military and commercial systems including:  the TADS/PNVS
(Target Acquisition and Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision System) for the
Apache Helicopter; a digital micromirror device for high definition displays;
and advanced digital cameras.  In general, cost effective aspheric optics will
be needed for a variety of Defense applications such as the 21st Century Land

<p>
This team will develop low cost manufacturing techniques and processes for
fabricating precision, high performance, optical systems using diffractive
optics.  These performance improvements will be enabled by developing:  (1)
computer integrated manufacturing system for fabricating diffractive optics
master elements and molding tools, (2) low cost methods for replicating
visible, infrared optical elements, and (3) a model of stray-light effects in
diffractive optics.  Scatter and unwanted diffraction orders will be
characterized to improve the performance of sensors and displays.  During the
project, interactions between fabricators, system designers, and integrators
will accelerate technology development, evaluation, and insertion.<p>
<p>
Improvements in high-performance, low cost diffractive optics, and aspheric
optical elements will give system designers new degrees of freedom when
designing and optimizing optical systems -- leading to improved performance in
a significant number of Defense systems.  Specific Defense demonstrations in
this project include missile seeker systems, thermal weapons sights, advanced
head mounted displays, advanced electro-optic sensor systems, parallel optical

duty vehicles that combines the advantages of electrical and mechanical power.
Hybrid engine technology offers many potential advantages to military land
systems such as significant improvements in fuel economy (16 percent), reduced
exhaust emissions (10-20 percent), and a reduced IR signature.  This project's
parallel hybrid powertrain system will use mechanical (internal combustion
engine) and electrical (high voltage battery energy storage) input power in
parallel to deliver optimum performance to the wheels.  Keys to this system are
a variable transmission that will maintain  a constant engine speed, even as
the vehicle speed varies, and two highly efficient electrical machines that
will function either as a motor or generator depending on the vehicle's power
requirements.<p>

<p>
<b>Kidde Technologies, Inc</b>., Atlantic Research Corporation<p>
<p>
Halons are ozone depleting substances that are being replaced with new,
environmentally friendly, fire extinguishing and gas generating technology.
This project will develop a fire suppressant delivery system that meets many of
the operational and physical configurations required by DoD for these new fire
fighting devices.  The project will identify extinguishment mechanisms using
innovative solid propellant gas generation technology, demonstrate the
feasibility of these techniques in specific military (dry bay) and related
commercial (industrial explosions) applications, and address residue,
toxicology, and inhabited area usage issues.  The initial demonstration will be
done in conjunction with the Air Force in an F-22 aircraft dry bay.<p>

Antennas</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Raytheon Co.</b>; Anaren Microwave, Inc.; Georgia Tech Research Institute;
Raytheon Advanced Device Center<p>
<p>
This project will develop a design and manufacturing process for small,
millimeter wave, flat panel, phased array antennas. This team of developers and
end-users will address the integration and affordability of high performance
components for DoD and commercial phased array applications. Its multilevel
packaging approach would reduce phased array antenna costs by a factor of 10
and create integrated/transponder assemblies that improve system performance.
The target cost for array unit cells is $30-$50 each.<p>
<p>
Phased array antennas offer significant performance and operational advantages
to the military.  The immediate military applications for thin, flat panel,
arrays include upgrades to airborne Milstar terminals, upgrades to shipboard
systems such as NESP, and satellite communication links for systems such as
J-STARS.  There is also considerable potential to use thin array technology for
multi-function apertures, including search and fire-control radars,
communications, interrogate friend or foe devices, and electronic counter
measures.  In the commercial realm, the application of low cost, thin, phased
array antennas for such things as direct broadcasting to commercial airliners
will help sustain an affordable technology base for the DoD to use.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="image/feature.gif"><h3>SiC Power Electronics for Affordable Next Generation Electric and Hybrid
Vehicles</h3><p>
<p>
<b>Westinghouse Science &amp; Technology Center</b>, Rutgers, The State
University of New Jersey, Silicon Power Corporation<p>
<p>
The project will develop a packaged 600V/100 ampere Silicon Carbide (SiC) Metal
Oxide Semiconductor  turn-off thyristor as a building block for solid-state
power controllers.  Military and commercial needs for power switching
components include aircraft, ships, and industrial power distribution.
Replacing conventional high power devices with semi-conductor technology will
allow a significant reduction in size and weight, a huge advantage for military
systems.<p>
<p>
However, because conventional semiconductors have limited temperature tolerance
and power density capabilities, cost-effective SiC based power-switching
devices are needed. SiC power switching devices are important for the Air
Force's More Electric Aircraft Program, the Navy's Power Electric Building
Block Program, and ARPA's Combat Hybrid Power program. The increased electric
breakdown strength, reduced size and cooling requirements, and increased
reliability of SiC devices will help replace hydraulic systems on aircraft with
wires and distributed motors, build more reliable shipboard power distribution
systems, and enable a hybrid power main battle tank with active armor and
electric guns. This project advances these goals by addressing critical
technical issues in making SiC devices such as packaging, high-temperature and
high power operation, and reduced manufacturing costs.<p>

<h1>2.  Mission and Program Concept</h1>
<HR>

<HR>
<P>
<A NAME="c21"><h2>2.1.  Overview</h2></a>

COSSI's mission is to develop and test a method for reducing Department of
Defense (DoD) O&amp;S costs by inserting commercial products and processes into
fielded military systems. A fielded military system is one that has some current
operational capability. A system that is near the end of its useful life is not
an appropriate target for this program.<P>

The insertion of commercial products and processes is expected to reduce O&amp;S
costs by reducing the costs of  parts and maintenance, reducing need  for
specialized equipment, increasing reliability, and increasing the efficiency of
subsystems.<P>

This program seeks proposals submitted by firms or teams that include at least
one for-profit firm. Proposals must also have the written support of a "military
customer."  Selected proposers will develop, manufacture and deliver prototype
"kits" to the military for installation into a fielded DoD system. Each kit will
consist of a commercial product or process that has been adapted,
qualification-tested and readied for insertion.   Proposers may also choose to
offer maintenance service agreements for their kits to assure their performance
and reliability.<P>

In Stage I of each selected project, DUAP and the chosen proposer will share the
costs of developing and testing the kit. In Stage II, provided Stage I has been
successful, the  military customer may purchase  reasonable production quantities
of the kit and payment for their insertion into the fielded system will be the
responsibility of the military customer. Proposals must include target prices for
kits and - if you choose to propose them - the maintenance service agreements. It
will be the Services' goal to purchase the selected kits and, if applicable,
maintenance agreements in Stage II:<P>

- without recompetition.<P>
- at a fair and reasonable price based on an analysis of the <I>value</I> of the kits to the Service (for O&amp;S savings), and<P>
- without requiring proposers to provide detailed cost and pricing data.<P> 

To reduce the traditional administrative burden and
oversight of government contracts, we plan to use, during Stage I, an innovative
type of agreement--one not generally subject to the normal Federal procurement
laws and regulations--known as an "Other Transaction."  This type of agreement
allows a great deal more flexibility and has far fewer regulatory requirements
than a typical Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) contract. In particular, this
initiative will not generally require government cost accounting standards nor
government cost audits. Futhermore, intellectual property provisions may be
negotiated that differ from those usually found in procurement contracts.<P>

<A NAME="c22"><h2>2.2.  O&amp;S Cost Savings</h2></a>

For the purposes of this initiative, O&amp;S costs
will be computed as the sum of direct costs of owning and operating a military
system, including the cost of personnel.  They do not include any costs
associated with developing, purchasing or disposing of the system.<P>

<A NAME="c23"><h2>2.3.  Commercial Product or Process</h2></a> 

For the purposes of this initiative, a
"commercial product" is a product or service that is of a type customarily used
for non-governmental purposes and that has been sold, leased, or licensed to
non-government buyers, or has been offered for sale, lease, or license to
non-government buyers.  A "commercial process" is a process used to produce a
"commercial product."<P> 

In some cases, kits based on "imminently commercial"
products or processes, those that are <I>just about to be</I> commercialized <I>may</I> be
acceptable to this initiative if the proposer can convincingly show that there
are clear plans for the product or process to be available for sale, lease, or
license by non-government buyers by the time Stage II would begin. However, a
currently available product or process will be preferred over an imminent one.<P> 

<B>If the kit you would propose is not based on a currently available or "imminent"
commercial product or process, please <I>do not</I> submit a proposal.</B>

<A NAME="c24"><h2>2.4.  Proposals Outside the Scope of this Program</h2></a>

Some types of proposals that may be related to
commercial insertion or O&amp;S savings are nevertheless outside the scope of
this program. If your project falls into one of the following categories, please
<b>do not submit</b> a proposal to this program:<P>

- Proposals to reduce either the
procurement or O&amp;S costs of military systems that are not yet fielded or that
are near the end of their useful lives.<P>

- Proposals to conduct studies.<P>

- Proposals to recapitalized a facility or purchase equipment.<P> 
- Proposals to established a center of excellence or other organization that will then seek
out O&amp;S - cost-reducing projects.  Related to this are proposals that submit a
series of potential problems without listing the specific solutions to be
pursued.<P> 
- Proposals to established fee-for-service organizations to test a
series of kits or qualify a broad variety of commerical products and processes
for military use without identifying the specific military system they would be
used in.<P> 

If your proposal is determined to be out of scope, it will not be
evaluated.<P>
 
<A NAME="c25"><h2>2.5  Two-Stage Process</h2></a>

As indicated above, selected projects will be
performed in two stages. In Stage I each selected proposer will: 

- conduct the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) required to create a kit that can be used in a
fielded military system; and<P>

- perform the testing needed to verify that
inserted kits will produce the predicted O&amp;S cost savings while at least
maintaining the current system level performance of the fielded system.<P>

 At the
end of Stage I, the Military Service that operates and maintains the fielded
system for which the kits are developed, will decide whether to proceed. The
military customer will decide, based on the results of the Stage I, whether to
buy the kits and any fixed-price maintenance service agreement the proposer has
offered. Accordingly, Stage I proposals must include target prices and quantities
for the kits and any maintenance service agreement if applicable.<P>

<h3>2.5.1.  Stage I - Non-Recurring Engineering and Qualification Testing</h3>

NRE is the
one-time engineering required to adapt the commercial product or process for use
in a military system.  NRE includes developing and implementing interface,
environmental, or performance improvements (see <A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2-1</A>). NRE may also be
required on the target system to prepare it and to receive the kit. Stage I may
also include any qualification testing required to demonstrate to the military
customer that the kit will preserve an equivalent system-level performance and
produce the expected O&amp;S savings. This testing will enable the military customer
to decide whether to proceed to Stage II. In many cases, this qualification
testing may involve a military laboratory or facility.<P> 

Stage I will nominally
last one to two years. You will be expected to share the cost of Stage I with the
DUAP.<P>

<A NAME="fig2"><CENTER><IMG VSPACE=20 SRC="image/fig2-1.gif" ALT="Figure 2-1"></CENTER></a>


<h3>2.5.2.  Stage II - Service-Funded Insertion of Kits</h3> 

Based on the results of Stage I, the military customer will decide whether to
proceed to Stage II (see Figure 2-1). If the Service decides to proceed, the
military customer's goal will be to purchase a reasonable production quantity of
kits and, if applicable, optional maintenance service agreements:<P> 

-	without recompetition.<P> 
-	at a fair and reasonable price based on an analysis of the value of the kits to the Service (for O&amp;S savings), and<P>
-	without requiring proposers to provide detailed cost and pricing data in the usual sense. The Services reserve the right, however, to purchase no kits in Stage II for reasons that may include;<P>
-	unacceptable system-level performance;<P> 
-	an unacceptable price for the kits, particularly if it exceeds the proposed target
price;<P> 
-	O&amp;S saving expected to stem from the kits that are inadequate or
significantly less than anticipated; and<P>

-	unavailability of funds to purchase
the kits<P>


You must describe your plans for Stage II in your Stage I proposal. This
means stating as part of your proposal your best-estimate target price and
quantity for the kits and (if applicable) your target price for any maintenance
agreement. We need this information to clearly evaluate potential DoD O&amp;S
savings.<P>

<A NAME="c26"><h2>2.6.  Who May Propose?</h2></a>

<h3>2.6.1.  Minimum Requirements</h3>

Each proposal team must include, at a minimum, at
least one for-profit firm. That is, proposals may come from either a single
for-profit firm or a team that includes at least one for-profit firm. The term
"proposal team≤ in this document should be understood to mean a team having one
participant  or more. "Partner≤ and "team" are used in this document to suggest a
close working relationship and do not indicate the creation of a new or separate
legal entity.<P>

<h3>2.6.2.	Other Team Members</h3>

 Your proposal team must include the people and
organizations who have the capabilities needed to carry out both Stage I and
Stage II of the project. The more complete the capability presented by the entire
proposal team to complete both stages, the better your proposal will fare in this
competition.<P>

The typical team would include (or simply consist of) a prime
contractor or a major supplier of defense systems capable either of integrating
the commercial product or process into the military system or of performing the
technological "wrap" necessary to do so, or both. The supplier of the commercial
product or process underlying the kit may also be an appropriate member of the
proposal team.<P>

Small businesses and historically black colleges and univer sities (HBCUs) and
minority institutions (MIs) are encouraged to participate as team members.  In
any case in which the evaluation of two or more proposals is substantially equal,
preference for award will be given to those proposals which include small
businesses, HBCUs and MIs as participants over those which do not.<P> 

<h3>2.6.3.  Role of the Military Customer</h3> 

The military customer is the Army, Navy, or Air Force
organization that (i) will oversee Stage I, (ii) has the authority, assuming
funds are available, to decide whether or not to proceed to Stage II, and (iii)
will be likely to have technical and procurement responsibility for implementing
the insertion and maintenance agreement. In general, this military customer will
be a military program manager, who is responsible for the system into which the
proposed kit will be inserted.<P> 

This  customer is crucial to each proposal team.
The military customer's relationship with  the proposal team is intended to
facilitate the sharing of government program information to support creation of
the proposal. Your entire project and proposal must include a signed statement
from the military customer stating that the proposed project is technically sound
and has a good chance of saving O&amp;S costs without degrading the performance of
the military system. <I>Proposals that do not have the documented support of a
military customer will not score well.</I><P> 

<h3>2.6.4  Statement of Service Support</h3> 

The
military customer must, in a formal statement, recommend that DoD undertake the
Stage I effort and be willing to be responsible for providing the technical
oversight for Stage I, and for the decision to proceed with Stage II.  In
addition, this customer may also make any needed arrangements for qualification
testing at government  facilities, and may supply you with any special equipment
necessary for this testing.<P>

<A NAME="c27"><h2>2.7.  Flexible Cost Sharing Requirement</h2></a>

You will be
expected to share the cost of the Stage I effort with DUAP using non-federal
funds. There is no minimum or specified level of cost sharing for you to propose.
However, proposals that include higher levels of non-federal funding will be
viewed more favorably.<P> 

Willingness to pay a larger share of Stage I costs
demonstrates a confidence by the members of a proposal team that they will
successfully reach Stage II. The form and quality of the way in which you propose
to share costs will be considered in the proposal evaluation process.<P>

Your approach to determining your share of Stage I costs should be simple and
direct. Simply determine the total costs for your team to carry out the Stage I
statement of work (SOW) and decide what portion of them you are willing to bear.
The balance of the Stage I costs in your proposal would then be the portion to be
borne by the DUAP. For more information, refer to Section 3.2.6, below.<P> 

Many
government contractors receive government-reimbursed funds for independent
research and development (IR &amp;D). DUAP intends to use contractual instruments
(called "Other Transactions") for Stage I that will allow you to choose to use
IR &amp;D funds on the Stage I SOW as part of your share of costs (see
FAR 31-205.18(e)).<P> 

<A NAME="c28"><h2>2.8.  New Acquisition Approaches</h2></a>

Both you and your military
customer must be aware of new acquisition approaches that are central to this
initiative.<P> 

During Stage I, we plan to use an innovative type of agreement - one
not generally subject to the normal Federal procurement laws and
regulations - known as an "Other Transaction."   The authority to use such
agreements for prototyping relevant to weapon systems was given to DARPA by
Section 845 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 103-160), as
amended by Section 804 of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense Authorization Act (P.L.
104-201), and to the Services by Section 804 of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense
Authorization Act (P.L. 104-201). This type of agreement allows a great deal more
flexibility and has far fewer regulatory requirements than a typical FAR
contract. In particular, this initiative will not generally require government
cost accounting standards nor government cost audits; and intellectual property
provisions may be negotiated that differ from those usually found in procurement 
contracts.<P> 

Funding under this type of agreement will be based on "payable
milestones." These are significant, observable technical events that you and the
government agree in advance will be the basis for incremental payments making up
DUAP's share of Stage I expenditures. This approach tends to be fairly flexible,
and milestones may be easily changed during the course of the project. The total
amount of government funds available for Stage I of the project will be fixed at
the beginning of the project. No additional funds will be made available by DUAP
for Stage I under any circumstances. If the costs to complete Stage I exceed the
amount initially agreed to, then your team must either absorb them or may
choose - as your "Other Transaction" prototyping agreement will permit - to quit the
project.<P> 

During Stage II, the actual kit insertion will be carried out by the
Services under separate business arrangements in the manner  described in Section
2.5.2, above.

<A NAME="c32"><h2>3.2. Discussion of Selection Criteria</h2></a>

The discussion below will give you a better understanding of how your proposal
will be judged against the selection criteria. Please read it carefully.<P>

<h2>3.2.1 O&amp;S Savings</h2>

Strong proposals will demonstrate large potential savings in
O&amp;S costs resulting from the project within 10 years of the beginning of
Stage II. These benefits will be measured primarily by the Net Present Value and
Benefit-to-Cost Ratio of DoD's investments in Stage I and Stage II. The Payback
Period for these investments will be a secondary measure. The more certain the
DoD is of obtaining these savings, the more attractive the proposal will be. Good
proposals will clearly demonstrate how and when these anticipated savings are
expected to accrue.<P> 

Use the following guidelines in preparing your analysis of
O&amp;S savings: Compute Net Present Value, Benefit-to-Cost Ratio, and Payback Period
using <B>constant 1997 dollars</B> and the following discount rates:<P>

<UL>

<LI>Net Present Value is the present value of the O&amp;S savings to DoD minus the
present value of the costs to DoD of implementing the project. Benefit-to-Cost
Ratio is the ratio of the present value of the O&amp;S savings to the present value
of the costs. Payback Period is the time until the present value of benefits
starts to exceed the present value of costs.

<LI>In computing these figures, include <i>all</I> the costs to the government of implementing your proposal: the NRE
and testing during Stage I, kit purchases during Stage II, purchase of
maintenance agreements, and any other costs to be borne by the government.

<LI>The time period for your O&amp;S saving analysis should be <I>no longer than 10
years</I> from the beginning of Stage II, i.e., the go/no-go decision. Use only one
of the discount rates in 3.2.1 in making your calculations.
</UL>

You should discuss
the top level results of your O&amp;S savings analysis in the main proposal. The O&amp;S
Saving Analysis Supplement should be used to present the data and analysis needed
to clearly substantiate your claims.<P> 

For more information and a suggested format
for your O&amp;S Savings Analysis Supplement, see the Appendix to this Program
Description and Solicitation.<P>

<h3>3.2.2  Commercial Technological Leverage</h3>

You must
demonstrate in your proposal that the product or process that forms the core of
the kit is a commercial product or process. In addition, proposals for kits that
will use open commercial standards will be viewed more favorably, since they
offer the prospect for avoiding obsolescence by ready insertions of new
generations of commercial technology.<P> 

This initiative may also accept technology
that is <I>headed toward</I> the commercial marketplace, but the plans for that
technology actually getting to the commercial marketplace by time of Stage II
must be <I>clearly shown</I>. This type of commercial leverage will be regarded less
favorably than will already commercial products or processes.<P> 

Proposals will
score poorly if they are based on technology that (i) is not currently available
in the commercial marketplace and has neither clear plans nor pathways for sale
to non-government customers, or (ii) is or will be available for sale only to
government customers. Conversely, proposals that are based on widely-used
commercial technologies will fare better than those whose "commercial core" has
more narrow application outside the defense realm.<P> 

<h3>3.2.3.	Equivalent System</h3>

Performance Insertion of the kit must not reduce system performance in the
military system in which it will be inserted. The stronger the evidence in your
proposal and the higher the certainty that your kit will not lower the overall
system's level of performance, the better your proposal will score. Efficacy of
your test plan and its endorsement by your military customer are essential.<P>

Improved performance, whether at the component, subsystem, or system level, is
<I>not</I> a primary driver of this program and will not substantially increase your
proposal's score.<P> 

<h3>3.2.4.	Technical and Management Approach</h3>

Your proposal will
score well in this area if you have a clear technical approach and objectives
with definite decision points and endpoints. Strong proposals will clearly lay
out both project risks and plans for dealing with them. Your project team will be
evaluated favorably if it includes substantially all of the program capabilities,
personnel, and resources necessary to carry out both Stage I and Stage II of the
project. Strong teams will demonstrate a collective synergy between partners and
be organized in a way that permits efficient and effective execution.<P>

<h3>3.2.5.	Military Customer Commitment</h3>

Proposals must be accompanied by a clearly
written, and compelling statement of support signed by the intended military
customer, one showing the customer's confidence that the technical approach
proposed for the NRE and qualification testing in Stage I is acceptable, and that
the kit should maintain equivalent system level performance and should lead to
the claimed O&amp;S savings. The military customer can show support and commitment to
 a project by contributing technical support (e.g., facilities and equipment for
qualification tests). In particular, proposals that have military customers who
demonstrate that they will have funds for acquiring the proposed kits in Stage II
or, failing that, are actively pursuing funds to carry out Stage II, will be
judged more favorably.<P> 

<h3>3.2.6	Non-Federal Share of Project Costs</h3>
You are
expected to share project costs only during Stage I; all Stage II costs will be
borne by the Services.<P> 

<h4>3.2.6.1.  General Principles and Discussion</h4>

For evaluation purposes, we will generally break the way proposers bear their share
of Stage I costs into two categories. It is to your advantage to assure that your
proposed share of costs consist as much as possible of items that will be
considered during evaluation to be  of "High Quality"  as described in this
section.<P> 

1.  <b>High Quality</b> contributions include:<p> 

<UL>

<LI>Financial resources <I>spent</I>
on the Stage I SOW, dedicated to that SOW, and under control of the project
management. Operationally this means spending cash and writing checks to pay for
people, materials, equipment, subcontracts, etc., used to carry out the SOW.
These amounts can include government-reimbursed IR &amp;D funds.

<LI>The cost of
restocking inventoried parts and material consumed on the Stage I SOW

</UL>
 

2.	<b>Low
Quality</b> items that may appear as part of a proposer's share of costs include:<P>

<UL>

<LI>In-kind, non-financial resources used on the project, such as the
wear-and-tear on capital assets like physical plant, equipment, or software. This
category includes the value of space used.

<LI>Resources or activities not
dedicated to or spent on the SOW or not under the control of the project
management.

<LI>Forgone fees and profits.

<LI>Sunk costs, i.e., any costs
occurring before the start of Stage I.

<LI>The value of intellectual property
brought to the project.
</UL> 

Costs for activity not under <I>both</I> the SOW and the control
of the project management will not be included in evaluating your share of
Stage I costs.<P>

<h4>3.2.6.2.  Government Technical Assistance</h4>

Your military
customer may provide you with technical assistance or services as part of the
project. Examples of this include engineering advice and the use of government
test equipment. Do not include the internal government costs of this assistance
in your cost sharing calculations.<P> 

In those cases where there is an exchange of
funds - for example, if you have to pay for the use of a government test
facility - those funds will be an appropriate part of your share of the costs in
your Stage I cost proposal.<P>

<P>

If you have a concept that
addresses O&amp;S cost savings for a specific military system that you think is a
good fit to this program, your most productive route is to contact both your
potential military customer and the prime contractor for that system to discuss
your concept. Both of these parties will typically have a great deal of the
technical and cost information necessary to determine the O&amp;S cost saving
attractiveness of your concept. You should explore the possibility of working
together with the prime contractor on a proposal and approach the potential
military customer about the possibility of supporting your proposal. Prime
contractors, for instance, typically have a great deal of system data and
insight, and partnering with a prime may be the best way to accomplish
successfully the system insertion you are contemplating for Stage II. Please
note, however, that no prime contractor is under any obligation to partner with
you on any proposal, nor is any potential military customer obligated to support
your proposal.<P>

<A NAME="c41"><h2>4.1.  Proposal Structure</h2></a>

Your proposal will consist of several
parts: the main proposal (including the military customer statement  of support),
the Stage I cost proposal, the O&amp;S Savings Analysis Supplement, and, if
warranted, the attachment of modified agreement terms and conditions. Together,
these parts must lay out all of your anticipated plans, costs, and benefits for
Stages I and II, and beyond.<P>

<h3>4.1.1.	Suggested Outline for the Main Proposal</h3> 

The main proposal may not
exceed 35 pages (including the Executive Summary but excluding the cover sheets).
Material appearing beyond the 35th page simply will not be considered in our
evaluation.<P> 

<h4>4.1.1.1.  Executive Summary</h4> 
Include an executive summary of
your entire proposal not more than 5 pages long that presents the entire case for
your project.<P> 

<h4>4.1.1.2.  Military Customer Statement</h4> 

Your proposal must
include a statement from your military customer. It should describe why the
customer believes this project is technically sound and will achieve long-term
O&amp;S savings for the DoD without any sacrifice in the specific system performance.
This is essentially a recommendation that the DoD should undertake this project.
Your military customer should also indicate readiness to assume management
responsibility for Stage I and Stage II, and recognition of the nonstandard
acquisition approaches used under this program.<P> 

Your military customer should
also describe any funds it has set aside for Stage II, or how and when it intends
to obtain these funds. In addition, it should also describe any technical
assistance it intends to provide to the proposal team, e.g., government furnished
equipment, use of military facilities, or any other engineering and qualification
testing support.<P> 

<h4>4.1.1.3.  Statement of Project Plan</h4> 

Describe your
technical and business plans for both Stage I and Stage II of the project.
Discuss the commercial product or process you are inserting and on what basis you
claim it to be "commercial." Describe what NRE is required to insert the product
or process properly into the military system and what testing is required to make
an insertion decision for Stage II. For all phases of the project, you need to
describe, in detail, the management and technical decision points (which need not
coincide with the Payment Milestones in the Cost Proposal) and the associated
risks. Include a project schedule.<P> 

Describe your plans for Stage II, including
your target price and quantities for the kits, and, if you intend to offer one,
the target price and terms for your maintenance agreement.<P>

<h4>4.1.1.4.  Proposal Team</h4>

This section of your proposal must identify the
members of the proposal team (organizations and key individuals) and describe
their roles. Also describe the project management structure - who is in charge, who
is responsible for what portion of the work, and how your team will make
decisions.<P> 

<h4>4.1.1.5.  O&amp;S Saving Analysis</h4> 

In this section, summarize and
discuss the claims made for the O&amp;S cost savings that will accrue to the DoD
within 10 years after the beginning of Stage II. Show the top level financial
analysis, such figures of merit as net present value, benefit-to-cost ratio, and
payback period. Discuss what specific cost elements will produce most of the
savings and why your project or kit will lead to these improvements. The detailed
backup for this discussion and your calculations must be provided in your O&amp;S
Savings Analysis Supplement.<P> 

<h4>4.1.1.6.  Stage I Statement of Work and Payable Milestones</h4> 

This section will include: (i) your proposed Stage I statement
of work, and (ii) a schedule of the Stage I payable milestones.<P>

<h4>4.1.1.7.  Selection Criteria Index</h4> 

We require that you include in your
proposal a one-page index showing the pages on which each of the selection
criteria is addressed in your proposal.<P> 

<h3>4.1.2.  Stage I Cost Proposal Instructions</h3>

Your cost proposal must be structured around the payable milestones.
There is no page limit on the cost proposal. It must include one "COSSI Stage I
Total Cost Summary Sheet C-4" and a "COSSI Stage I Milestone Cost Summary C-5"
for each payable milestone, and any additional data needed to substantiate the
appropriate payment amount for each milestone. Your cost proposal must cover the
NRE and qualification testing costs that are paid by the team, including any
direct payments for the use of any government facility or equipment. Do not
include the costs of technical assistance or use of government facilities or
equipment provided to your team by the military customer.<P>

<h3>4.1.3.  Proposal Formatting Instructions</h3>

The main proposal page count shall include every page,
including pages that contain words, table of contents, executive summary,
management information and qualifications, resum&eacute;s, figures, tables, and
pictures. All proposals shall be printed such that pages are single-sided, with
no more than fifty-five (55) lines per page. Use 21.6 x 27.9 cm (8 1/2" x 11")
paper or A4 metric paper. Use an easy-to-read font of not more than about 5
characters per cm. (fixed pitch font of 12 or fewer characters per inch or
proportional font of point size 10 or larger). Smaller type may be used in
figures and tables, but must be clearly legible. Margins on all sides (top,
bottom, left and right) must be at least 2.5 cm. (1").<P> 

<h3>4.1.4.	O&amp;S Savings</h3>

Analysis Supplement The purpose of this Supplement is to provide necessary backup
data for your expected O&amp;S savings. Include an O&amp;S summary sheet and a
description of the cost elements for each year of the savings analysis.
Significant variations or changes in any year should be described, along with
reasons for the change. If your supplement includes spreadsheets, you must also
provide them in electronic form as EXCEL<SUP>&reg;</SUP> files on a 3 1/2" diskette formatted
for either Macintosh<SUP>&reg;</SUP> or MS-DOS<SUP>&reg;</SUP>.  Be sure to label diskettes to match the title
of the proposal.<P> 

See the Appendix to this Solicitation for detailed instructions.

<h3>4.1.5.	Agreement Terms and Conditions</h3> 

Your proposal should include any changes
that you wish to request from the terms and conditions included in the sample
"Other Transaction" prototyping agreement that may be found at the JDUPO World
Wide Web site or may be requested by fax, email or phone (See Section 1.General
Information). If all of the provisions of the sample agreement are acceptable to
you, then include a statement to that effect. If there are changes that you wish
to propose, then provide the text of the provisions <i>as you would like to see them
included in an agreement as an attachment to your proposal (it will not count as
part of your 35 pages).</i>  In view of the short deadline for entering into
agreements (September 30, 1997), failure to identify any desired changes could
jeopardize awards to proposals selected for negotiation.<P>

<P>
The statutes
and FAR provisions that customarily determine the allocation of rights in
intellectual property in government-funded research projects do not apply to
"Other Transactions." The allocation of rights and grants of licenses in
intellectual property developed in the course of Stage I NRE and testing will be
negotiable. With respect to patentable inventions, however, the government's
initial position will be that the same rights and licenses will apply as if the
Bayh-Dole Act were applicable.<P>

As to "technical data" (as that term is defined under the FAR), there will be a requirement for Stage I that the contractor
provide the government a technical data package containing the form, fit,
function, and interface ("F<SUP>3</SUP>I") specifications of the kit. In most cases, no
other technical data delivery to the government will be required. This F<SUP>3</SUP>I
information may be used by the government at some point beyond the completion of
Stage II to recompete future kit procurements, if necessary. We are not
interested in obtaining any special government rights in proprietary technology
for the inserted kit or in the underlying commercial product or process.<P>

<P>

A suggested approach to the Supplement is to include the following features:

<UL> <LI>A year by year comparison of the system's baseline O&amp;S costs ("baseline"
means the system proceeds without implementing the project you are proposing)
with the costs if your project is implemented. This comparison must use your cost
element structure and show the changes in costs and savings created by your
project in each year. (Totaling the time discounted value of these costs and
benefits yields your top level summary.) You might wish to do one sheet for each
year of your analysis. <A HREF="#app1">Figure App-1</a> illustrates how one year of this cost summary
might appear for a fictitious program.<P>

</CENTER>

<LI>A discussion of the assumptions used in conducting the analysis and their
basis. 

<LI>A top level summary, using your cost element structure, showing the
present value of those cost elements. Adding up these elements yields the Net
Present Value of the project; dividing them yields the Benefit-to-Cost ratio.

might appear.


<LI>Any additional analysis or discussion for any or all years,
needed to explain and substantiate your numbers and claims.
</UL>


<h3>Cost Element Structures</h3>

In conducting your O&amp;S savings analysis, you must identify what DoD cost elements
will be changed by your project -- where the costs and savings benefits will come
from. You should arrange those elements into a structure that will be used
consistently throughout your analysis and proposal. This cost element structure
will be the framework for your O&amp;S analysis.<P> 

Operations and support costs
typically include <I>all</I> the costs of owning, operating, maintaining, and supporting
a fielded DoD system during peacetime. This includes costs for: personnel;
consumable and repairable materials; organizational, intermediate, and depot
maintenance; facilities; and sustaining investment. O&amp;S costs <I>do not include</I> the
costs of developing, initially purchasing, improving the performance of, or
disposing of fielded systems.<P> 

The following is a <I>generic</I> cost element structure
that includes many of the cost elements that could be included in your O&amp;S saving
analysis. <I>It is illustrative only</I>. You should include in your structure only
those elements that will be changed by your project; hence, in most cases, this
entire structure will <I>not</I> be needed. You may arrange your structure in any way
you wish, keeping in mind that the validity of your O&amp;S savings claims must be
made clear.
<CENTER>
<IMG VSPACE=20 SRC="image/app-3.gif">
</CENTER>
<H3>Some Illustrative Cost Questions</h3> 

The following questions provide insight into
major cost drivers for some of the cost elements listed above. These are typical
questions an evaluator might ask in order to fully understand the nature of the
proposed savings. They are illustrations provided for your benefit; the list is
not exhaustive nor will all of them apply to every project. Your main proposal
should answer many of theses types of questions.<P> 

<h3>Stage I Strategy (Element A.1)</h3>

Is NRE required? When will it begin and end? What is the expected cost, by year?
What testing is required? When will it begin and end? What is the expected cost,
by year?<P> 

<h3>Stage II Strategy (Element A.2)</h3>

What price do you expect DoD to pay for
each kit? When will production of the kits begin and end? What are the delivery
and installation schedules for the kits? Does the price include government
transportation and installation costs? If not, what are these costs? What
additional costs are required to integrate the systems using these kits with
other DoD systems? 

<h3>Personnel Costs (Element B.1)</h3>

Will insertion and use of the
kits reduce personnel requirements system for the system? If so, how?<P> 

<h3>Petroleum, Oil, Lubricants/Energy Consumption (Element B.2.1)</h3>

Will the insertion of the kits
reduce fuel/oil consumption?  By how much (in terms of gallons per mile or hour
of operation)?  Explain how kit will cause reduction in fuel/oil usage.<P>

<h3>Consumer Material/Repair Parts (Element B.2.2)</h3>

Will the insertion of your kit reduce
demands for consumable materials/repair parts?  Which ones (be specific with
National Stock Number(s), nomenclatures, and quantity changes from the current
baseline)?  Explain how the kit will reduce these demands.<P>

<h3>Depot-level Reparables (Element  B.2.3)</h3>
 
Will the insertion of your kit reduce demands for depot-level 
reparable parts?  Which ones (be specific with National Stock Number(s),
nomenclatures, and quantity changes from the current baseline)?  Explain how the
kit will reduce these demands. 

<h3>Maintenance Philosophy (Elements B2, B3 and B4)</h3>

Describe the maintenance concept for the kits. Are they to be discarded or
repaired upon failure? Who will repair them and where? How much scheduled
maintenance is required (actions per year)? Is additional test equipment
required? What is the cost of this equipment?<P> 

<h3>Maintenance Costs (Elements B2, B3 and B4)</h3>

What is the expected maintenance cost per kit per year?<P>

<h3>Reliability</h3>

What is the expected operational mean time between failure of the kits? What is the
required frequency of scheduled maintenance (actions per year)?<P>

<h3>Maintainability</h3>

How much personnel time is required for each scheduled maintenance action? What
is the expected material cost per scheduled maintenance action? How much
personnel time is required for each corrective maintenance action? What is the
expected material cost per corrective maintenance action?

<h3>Impact on Spares Holding Costs</h3>

Will there be a change in the required sparing level, causing a decrease or
increase in spares holding (or inventory) costs? Does the existing system have
inventories that could be used? If so, how much exists? Using this existing
inventory is no cost to the Service and should be treated as such in the
analysis.<P>

<h3>Engineering Technical Support (Element B.6.4)</h3>

Will technical support requirements for operations or maintenance functions
increase or decrease as a result of the insertion of the kits? Provide
information justifying your conclusion.<P>

<h3>Software Maintenance (Element B.6.5)</h3>

Integration with other existing components
may require additional code, resulting in additional debugging efforts. Will the
kits require more or less software maintenance? Provide information justifying
your conclusion.<P>

Deployment</A></H2>
On the battlefield, in the sea, and in the air, the ability to mobilize,
deploy, and sustain military operations hinges on transportation and maneuvers.
The TRP recognizes these important requirements and is finding ways to apply
commercial technologies to military transport and vehicle needs. This effort is
making land vehicle technologies--such as electric and hybrid vehicles and
navigation and safety systems--more affordable. It is combining the expertise
of naval systems producers and commercial shipbuilders to manufacture naval
ships more efficiently. It is also looking toward advanced aeronautical
technologies that will contribute to air superiority well into the 21st century.

<H3><IMG SRC="image/smrdsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC3">Aeronautical/Aerospace
Technologies</A></H3>
The United States enjoys a dominant position in the world aircraft market
because of its aggressive research and development investment strategy,
especially in the Defense sector. However, this preeminence is being challenged
by both Europe and Asia. TRP projects in aeronautical technology--a classic
dual-use area--will provide significant Defense and commercial payoffs in
propulsion/engine technologies, flight sensors, aircraft controls, structures,
and design.

This partnership is developing an autonomous aircraft landing system that
allows commercial and military pilots to conduct "clear-day" flight operations
in inclement weather.  The DoD can use this system to plan and complete
military missions without concern for weather conditions. Also, operations
flown under the cover of clouds and fog will render enemy electro-optic systems
useless.
<P>

The system enables pilots to taxi, take off, roll out, and land in conditions
of extremely low visibility such as dense fog or in adverse weather during
combat. The consortium is integrating a Heads-Up Display with a Differential
Global Positioning System, Millimeter Wave Radar (MMWR), and Forward Looking
Infrared Radar. The Heads-Up Display presents sensor imagery and flight
guidance information on the cockpit windshield so that the pilot can compare
the sensor image with the real-world image. The MMWR provides sufficient
clarity to discern craters or obstacles on the runway. Forward-Looking Infrared
Radar complements the MMWR under certain atmospheric conditions.

This project is developing face-gear technology for aerospace and industrial
power transmission. Face gears can significantly improve weight, reliability,
and cost for both military and commercial transmission designers. In addition,
they reduce gearbox weight by <BR>40 percent, gearbox volume by more than 15
percent, noise by 10 decibels, and cost by <BR>10 percent. The DoD is
considering using face gears in the follow-on to the Apache Longbow helicopter.
Because these gears have their teeth on the faces rather than the edges, they
are more efficient, especially in transmission design. The focus of this effort
is on establishing and verifying gear design parameters and on developing
cost-effective manufacturing techniques.

conditions while simultaneously monitoring local air traffic. This flexible
radar for airport terminal areas has electronically steerable beams. It will
allow national airspace transportation systems to operate more efficiently. It
will improve the safety of these systems by reducing air traffic separation,
enhancing precision control of airport traffic flow, and improving hazardous
weather detection and reporting.<P>
The DoD will benefit directly from this project, which will advance the
development of next-generation transmit/receive (T/R) modules. These modules
have extensive military applications. The project could significantly reduce
the cost of the modules.

These partners are developing components critical to making usable Fly-by-Light
technologies for DoD and commercial aircraft. Fly-by-Light will reduce the
weight of military aircraft by 6,000 pounds, make these planes immune to
electronic interference, and increase their reliability and maintainability by
10 percent. Fly-by-Light Advanced Systems Hardware (FLASH) technologies include
cost-effective and reliable fiber-optic cable plants, low-cost flight control
systems, and more reliable and maintainable actuators. The FLASH project will
directly stimulate the incorporation of fiber optics into the design of the
F-22, and both the F-22 and Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program
offices are cooperating to ensure direct and immediate transfer of the
technology. The team believes this technology can help the United States gain a

This project is developing a 250,000-pound-thrust hybrid rocket motor that
integrates a solid synthetic rubber compound fuel with liquid oxygen. Hybrid
fuel performs better at half the cost of current solid boosters. The reduced
cost of boost propulsion for launch vehicles  makes Defense and commercial
launch systems more affordable.<P>
This technology is valuable to the DoD because hybrid rocket engines are
potentially safer and less expensive propulsion systems to operate than their
nonhybrid counterparts. This project has been restructured because one
participant has withdrawn.

navigation, and safety systems and is making them more affordable by
encouraging the commercial sector to meet military needs with commercially
viable technology. Where military and commercial needs are similar, TRP funding
speeds the creation and deployment of the new military capability. More
frequently, special military requirements can be met by shaping commercial
technology goals to satisfy both sectors.

commercial market for this system will stimulate a direct and dramatic cost
reduction to the military for the system's sensors. It will also increase
private sector R&amp;D for technologies applicable to DoD missions, such as
Night Vision and Heads-Up Displays.<P>
Semiautomated systems that track vehicle positions and movements will provide
progressive intervention as a situation proceeds from a low probability to a
high probability of threat. The technologies incorporated in this system will
include Night Vision displays to provide drivers with a clearer view of the
vehicle ahead; Heads-Up Displays to present information in the forward visual
field so drivers do not have to divert their eyes from the road; intelligent
cruise control systems to integrate with antilock brakes and to sense
inadvertent lane changes and vehicle separation; and tire pressure monitoring

This project will adapt military vehicle and aircraft subsystem technologies
for Defense and commercial applications. Through it, the DoD will gain
hybrid-electric and all-electric vehicles for combat. The project will lower
the cost and improve the performance of subsystems associated with large
vehicles, such as military tanks and buses for commercial mass transit.<P>
Specific subsystem technologies include an integrated electric drivetrain;
alternate-fuel generators; compressible suspension systems; and a fiber-optic,
fault-tolerant control system immune to electrical interference. These
technologies will also enable low-emission mass transit vehicles to interact
with the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System. They will reduce transportation

Mobile electric power systems use low-volatility, heavy fuels rather than
conventional gasoline. These fuels are readily available in many parts of the
world and are the preferred fuel in military inventories. Thus, this program
will reduce logistical problems, and the systems will exploit emerging engine
and generator technologies to reduce equipment size and weight by 50 percent

A turboalternator is being developed for automotive hybrid vehicles, which are
powered by electricity and fossil fuels. The DoD will use the product in its
hybrid vehicles and as an Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) for the Army's M1A1 tank.
Instead of running the tank's large turbine engine, the APU will provide quiet,
efficient, and low infrared (IR) signature power for electronic systems. Team
leaders have to make the turboalternator affordable and available enough for
use in other military vehicles, such as the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.<P>
Turboalternators are gas turbines that drive electric generators. This
technology will permit vehicles to operate on fossil fuels during acceleration
and on batteries during cruising mode. The new turbine will be faster and will
use innovative air bearings that magnetically float. In addition to the M1A1

This project is creating a dual-use, portable robotic welding system to greatly
improve the productivity of the U.S. shipbuilding industry. These welding
robots will improve quality and reduce welding costs by 25 to 50 percent. They
will also reduce the need for inspection  and reworking by 50 to 80 percent.<P>
While the use of machines for welding is not new, robotics are currently most
effective on assembly lines, where there is a great deal of repetition.
Shipbuilding requires one-of-a-kind, complicated construction. This project
will integrate technical advances in personal computers, robotic design, 3-D
vision, and weld sensors to provide a portable robotic welding system
especially for the shipbuilding industry. These robots will be highly mobile
and programmable for specific vessel designs. Program operators estimate a 50
percent reduction in the cost of welding robots as a result of the project,
which means that U.S. manufacturers could purchase robots for less than
$25,000. These robots could automate up to 75 percent of ship welding, which
would quickly reduce the cost of shipbuilding.

<H2><IMG SRC="image/blsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC26">Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I)</A></H2>
In this post-Cold War era, even the most primitive country may have forces
armed with powerful and sophisticated weapons. Small conflicts can quickly
escalate into large-scale battles. U.S. troops are usually deployed in
unfamiliar territories and cultures, and they may have difficulty operating
under such circumstances.<P>
These situations place great stress on command, control, communications,
computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems, which are designed to
help the military efficiently strategize and activate plans under any
circumstances. C4I systems allow troops to quickly set up and
operate by gathering, verifying, sorting, and analyzing information to
construct appropriate strategies. Decision makers can then disseminate the
processed information and orders and coordinate resulting tactical
components.
<P>
The TRP is addressing some of the military's most pervasive C4I
needs. Because the best advances in communications, information systems, and
computers are generally being developed in the commercial sector, the military
must work with industry to achieve its goals efficiently and affordably.
Therefore, the TRP is sponsoring collaborative efforts that will give the
military a reliable source of low-cost technology and ensure that future
C<SUP>4</SUP>I systems are simple and inexpensive to update. The following
section describes the TRP's efforts to improve C<SUP>4</SUP>I systems using
communications technology, computer hardware, and computer software.

<H3><IMG SRC="image/smrdsq.gif"> <A NAME="RTFToC27">Communications
Technologies</A></H3>
The Joint Chiefs of Staff identified "maintaining near perfect real-time
knowledge of the enemy and communicating that to all forces in near real time"
as the first of five future joint warfighting capabilities most needed by the
United States. Near real-time communications requires very high bandwidth
networks. The DoD forecasts that by the year 2000, C<SUP>4</SUP>I functions
will need to handle hundreds of terabytes of data per day. While the military's
need for secure, digital, high-data-rate, upgradable networks is well known, it
is no longer feasible for the armed services to develop and maintain special
military communications equipment. It simply costs too much, and technological
momentum in the Defense R&amp;D community is low. Demands for frequent upgrades
leave little choice but to consider commercial systems. However, without the
DoD involvement, the commercial sector will not meet the military's
requirements for bandwidth, robust moving networks, electromagnetic
interference and jamming resistance, rapid mixed deployment, and security. The
TRP keeps the DoD's hand in this incredibly dynamic sector of the commercial
world.

This partnership is using the Army's Enhanced Position Location Reporting
System (EPLRS) technology to develop a position location system for commercial
vehicles. The military uses this technology to determine the precise location
of friendly combat vehicles on front lines and to report that information to
tactical commanders. Commercially, it will precisely locate subway trains, even
in tunnels, and allow passenger trains on the BART system to be run at closer
intervals. This technology will eliminate the need for a second tunnel under
the San Francisco Bay.<P>
For the DoD, the project means a less expensive EPLRS for military use. The
Army has spent considerable effort in developing this system, and has no
alternative with the same capabilities--even less capable systems will not be
available for years. However, the EPLRS is prohibitively expensive. This
project should lower the Army's EPLRS costs by 40 percent in 2 years by
incorporating less expensive commercial components, more efficient design
techniques, and economies of scale.

lower weight and increased performance in portable power applications, but the
technology could be scaled to larger applications such as military vehicles.
These supercapacitors are creating new opportunities for energy storage devices
in both the Defense and commercial sectors, ranging from semiconductors to

Because rapid, effective information transfer affects almost every Defense
operation, the DoD has traditionally been the leader in information technology.
The National Information Infrastructure (NII), begun by the DoD as ARPANET in
the 1960s, is expanding rapidly but is paced by commercial growth. The DoD can
no longer control the direction of the NII, so it must instead leverage
emerging commercial capabilities. This leveraging will only be possible if
those capabilities can work within the DoD--in other words, if there is a set
of consistent, useful standards. The pervasiveness of military information
systems, coupled with a requirement to use commercial capabilities, demands
Defense involvement in developing NII interoperability protocols.<P>
TRP projects in NII interoperability will ensure the creation of open
interoperability standards in a number of areas important to the DoD. These
projects were chosen because they are critical to Defense and are expected to
be commercially viable. If successful, they will expand the NII's commercial
capabilities into airborne and terrestrial communications, health care,

This project is creating open industry software standards that will integrate
computing environments across the U.S. manufacturing industrial base. As a
result, geographically separated organizations will be able to electronically
link into "virtual enterprises" to access, share, and communicate manufacturing
design solutions. The DoD benefits will be twofold: First, development of
common software standards will apply directly to military systems, allowing
them to "cross-talk" with civilian systems as needed. Second, the increased
efficiency of U.S. manufacturing that will result from this project will create
tremendous cost savings for military procurement.

The DoD is an enormous developer and user of software. An estimated 85 percent
of the installed software base for Defense is customized with all components
written especially for that software package. This situation involves a great
deal of duplication that is both costly and time-consuming. An alternative,
called "Object-Oriented Software," allows reusable software components, or
objects, to function as building blocks in creating new programs or in updating
existing ones. This alternative requires that both the program and the object
be created according to a common set of standards.<P>
The TRP's software projects are aimed at reusing software components to
radically reduce the effort required to field new software applications.
Building on emerging industry standards for software object technologies, these
projects will significantly accelerate the development of tools to help build
the infrastructure for component ware, create a pool of developers experienced
in applying the new tools, and deliver a series of demonstration applications
with both Defense and commercial  relevance. In addition to advancing specific
demonstrations of interest to the DoD, these efforts will keep object-based
software from becoming compartmentalized--as might happen under strictly
proprietary development-- and will prevent the DoD from relying on a single
vendor or software approach.

big advantage in battle. The armed forces have recognized the benefits of
advanced sensors for years, but the commercial sector is just beginning to see
broad uses for civilian purposes. Now, as military procurement for sensor
R&amp;D diminishes, the commercial market has begun to grow rapidly. The TRP is

<H3><A NAME="RTFToC58">Uncooled Infrared Sensors</A></H3>

The U.S. military has "owned the night" because of generations of cryogenically
cooled infrared (IR) sensors. These sensors were a major reason for America's
ground victory in Desert Storm. Unfortunately, the high cost of cooled sensors
has prevented their wide distribution to combat troops. Uncooled IR sensors are
a lower cost alternative for a wide range of applications and a high priority
for military users, but they still require more development for both
performance and affordability. While military procurement is low, the potential
civilian market--more than 100,000 units per year--is attracting industrial
investment. The TRP's strategy is to leverage this investment and improve
performance and affordability by adding special military requirements to an

This project is demonstrating the feasibility of allowing the databases in one
medical facility to be directly accessed by other medical facilities. Such a
system will permit the efficient sharing of data critical to the DoD's
treatment of mobile military forces on the battlefield.
<P>
Individual medical facilities throughout the United States collect and process
large amounts of up-to-date, detailed clinical data. The data reside online
only at that facility and are not readily available to other institutions.
Thus, medical testing is duplicated and procedures are performed without the
benefit of the very latest clinical results. By developing better software and
new standards for databases, the TRP project will enable one medical facility
to examine and use the data of another facility as if the data were locally
stored. If successful, this effort will turn individual and collaborative
research efforts into "data banks" available to all facilities and health care
providers.

A noninvasive, low-cost arterial gas measurement device is being developed to

chemical warfare agents. The monitors will eliminate the need to draw arterial
blood (a much more difficult procedure than drawing venous blood) from the
wounded at or near the battlefield, which will reduce cost and waste as well as
limit the incidence of infection from blood-borne pathogens. Continuous
monitoring, as opposed to traditional periodic sampling, is a superior method

This partnership is developing a Trauma Care Information Management System to
aid information flow and patient processing decisions in civilian and
battlefield trauma care. The DoD will benefit from advances in triage and
treatment of combat troops in battlefield situations. Remote medical treatment
and remote consultation with specialists will limit the numbers of and dangers
to medical personnel in battle zones. The new system will monitor patient
medical status remotely, track diagnoses and treatments, and maintain
information about patient location. It will notify medical personnel about
which patients or combat troops need immediate medical attention.<P>
Initial estimates indicate that 20 percent of U.S. health care costs are
consumed in activities directly related to information handling. The Trauma

the efficiency and effectiveness of medical staff.

Mechanical systems and materials are vital to virtually all major operations in
both the Defense and commercial arenas. How these systems are produced and what
materials are used affect their performance, ultimately dictating their
lifetimes, operating costs, and maintenance requirements.<P>
The TRP is sponsoring several activities to develop enabling technologies that
are the bedrock of modern manufacturing capabilities for Defense. The program
is building on emerging commercial technologies and initiating new commercial
markets for Defense technologies. In especially critical areas, such as
composite materials, the TRP is funding innovative efforts for Defense-related

lightweight bridges for use by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in combat
situations or after natural disasters.
<P>
Durable, lightweight composites were originally developed for military aircraft
and missile systems. Composite bridge structures offer several advantages: (1)
rapid modular erection procedures, which reduce construction time and cost; (2)
higher strength-to-weight ratios, which permit smaller and lighter foundations,
abutments, and piers; and (3) superior corrosion resistance, which reduces
maintenance and extends service life. Composite materials can be used to
replace cracked bridge decks, resurface roads, and reinforce crumbling bridge
columns. Developing a robust commercial market for high-performance polymer
composites will also lower costs and help preserve this critical technology for
the DoD.

<P>
Advanced engine designs being considered for future production have the
potential to increase performance and fuel efficiency of both military and

This technology enables the development of more efficient direct-drive systems

This team is developing precision laser machine tools for drilling, cutting,

manufacturing assembly lines. The laser machine tools will also be used to join
advanced high-strength metals and composite materials less expensively than
conventional methods. These tools will improve the DoD's manufacturing and
machining processes. The project promises to improve military aircraft
component performance and fuel efficiency and to reduce life-cycle costs. In
addition, it will improve laser capabilities for battlefield applications such
as optical guidance of munitions; infrared countermeasures against heat-seeking
missiles; remote detection of chemical and biological agents; detection of
underwater mines; target identification, location, and tracking; and remote
disposal of mines and other munitions.
<P>
This technology will improve precision and tooling speeds. For example, it will
allow the drilling of ultrafine, uniformly spaced cooling holes for jet
engines, which will double the life of engine parts and improve engine
performance. This process should replace some chemical machining
methods--thereby eliminating hazardous chemical discharge--and will permit the
use of lighter-weight plastics, which will increase fuel efficiency in both
