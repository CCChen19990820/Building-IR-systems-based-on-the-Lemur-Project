<h1>Recent Developments Affecting Arbitration Under Georgia Law</h1>

<p>
Recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and courts within Georgia will have a
significant impact on future arbitration practice in Georgia.  These cases highlight, among other
things, the need for full awareness of the applicable law and extreme care in drafting arbitration
clauses.  Otherwise, significant rights of a party may be prejudiced. <p>

<h4>1.  Pre-Dispute Contractual Waivers of Jury Trials Are Invalid.</h4>
The Georgia Supreme Court in <i>Bank South, N.A. v. Howard</i>, 264 Ga. 339, 444 S.E.2d 799, (1994), held that pre-litigation contractual waivers of the right to a trial by jury are not
enforceable under Georgia law.  Now, commercial entities such as banks, which had previously
been able to enforce contractual jury trial waiver provisions, no longer have that option. <p>

The <i>Bank South</i> decision makes arbitration and other forms of ADR all the more important to all parties seeking to avoid exposure to jury trials.  This is because, although by agreeing to settle their dispute in an arbitration forum, parties implicitly waive their right to a jury trial, valid agreements to arbitrate are still favored even after <i>Bank South</i>.  Therefore, parties who wish to avoid the possibility of trial by jury must hope that their opponents will not ask for a jury trial or draft an effective contractual provision for the arbitration of disputes. <p>

<h4>2.  One-Party Options To Arbitrate Are Valid.</h4>
In a significant, but not widely-known case, <i>W.L. Jorden &amp; Co. v. Blythe Indus., Inc</i>., 702 F. Supp. 282 (N.D. Ga. 1988), the Court, applying the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), held that a
clause providing that one party, in its sole discretion, could elect to submit a dispute to
arbitration, is valid and binding.  This decision is important for parties concerned that they will
be unable to predict at the time of contracting whether ADR will be in their best interest in
resolving a dispute which may later arise under the agreement.  For entities with the bargaining
power to include such an arbitration option clause in their agreements, they will be able to pick
and choose which disputes they wish to arbitrate and which ones to litigate --after the dispute has
arisen.<p>

<h4>3.  The FAA Controls Arbitration Agreements Involving Interstate Commerce
Regardless Of What The Parties Contemplated.</h4>
In a resounding affirmation of the policy favoring arbitration, in January of 1995, the U.S.
Supreme Court decided <i>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos., Inc. v. Dobson</i>, ____ U.S. ____, 115 S.Ct.
834 (1995).  This case arose out of a dispute between Allied-Bruce and the transferees of a home
Termite Protection Plan (the "Agreement"), which provided that:<p>

<blockquote><i>any controversy or claim . . . arising out of or relating to the interpretation,
performance or any breach of any provision of this agreement shall be settled
exclusively by arbitration.</i>
</blockquote>
The Alabama transferees of the Agreement sued Allied-Bruce, and the company moved to stay
the litigation pending the outcome of the arbitration.  The trial court denied the motion and the
Alabama Supreme Court affirmed, relying on an Alabama statute that made pre-dispute
arbitration agreements unenforceable.  In doing so, the Alabama Supreme Court noted that
Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.  2, provides:<p>

<blockquote><i>A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or
transaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable . . .</i>
</blockquote>
The Alabama Supreme Court, however, held that the FAA applied only if, at the time the parties
entered into an arbitration agreement, they contemplated substantial interstate activity.  The
Court found that a home termite protection plan was not the sort of an agreement where the
parties would contemplate substantial interstate activity--instead, activity was primarily local.<p>

The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Alabama Supreme Court, explaining: "The basic purpose
of the Federal Arbitration Act is to overcome courts' refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate."<p>

The Court also stated that Section 2 of the FAA indicated Congress' intent to exercise its
Commerce Clause powers to the fullest extent possible and that whether or not a transaction
"affects commerce" is determined by the "commerce in fact" test and not the "contemplation of
the parties" test applied by the Alabama Supreme Court.  Accordingly, if a pre-dispute
arbitration agreement relates to a transaction, which in fact "affects commerce," the FAA
preempts any conflicting state law that would make such an agreement unenforceable.  See also
<i>Primerica Fin. Serv., Inc. v. Wise</i>, No. A94A2290-91, 1995 Ga. App. LEXIS 361 (Ga. Ct. App.
March 14, 1995) (the Georgia Court of Appeals held that Georgia law requiring that all
employment related arbitration agreements must be initialed to be enforceable is not binding
when the FAA applies).<p>

<h4>4.  Additional Ripples From Allied-Bruce Which Affect Georgia Arbitrations.</h4>
Based on the <i>Allied-Bruce</i> broad definition of "affecting commerce," the FAA will preempt any
state law that would otherwise prevent the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate that
involves interstate commerce.  In this regard, the Georgia Arbitration Code has specific areas in
which pre-dispute agreements to arbitrate are either prohibited or are otherwise exempted from
the general arbitration rules.  These exempted areas, all potentially affected by <i>Allied-Bruce,</i>
include medical malpractice claims, collective bargaining agreements, contracts involving
insurance, loan agreements or consumer financing agreements of $25,000 or less, contracts for
the purchase of consumer goods, residential real estate agreements, employment agreements, and
personal injury or wrongful death claims.  See O.C.G.A.  9-9-2. <i>Primerica Fin. Serv., Inc. v.
Wise,</i> No. A94A2290-91, 1995 Ga. App LEXIS 361 (Ga. Ct. App. March 14, 1995) Georgia law
requiring that employment related arbitration agreements must be initialed to be enforced is not
binding when the FAA applies).<p>

<h5>a.  When Would An Otherwise Enforceable Agreement To Arbitrate Be Deemed Invalid Under FAA's Savings Clause?</h5>
The primary open issue under <i>Allied-Bruce</i> is whether, and if so, to what extent, the FAA
savings clause in Section 2 (agreements to arbitrate are enforceable "save upon such grounds as
exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract") permits invalidation of arbitration
agreements based on such doctrines as adhesion, public policy, and unconscionability.  The
<i>Allied-Bruce</i> Court acknowledged that states can regulate contracts under general contract law
principles to protect "consumers against unfair pressure to agree to a contract with an unwanted
arbitration provision."  But the Court noted:<p>

<blockquote><i>What States may not do is decide that a contract is fair enough to enforce all its basic terms (price, service, credit), but not fair enough to enforce its arbitration clause.  The Act [FAA] makes any such state policy unlawful, for that kind of policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal "footing," directly contrary to the Act's language and Congress's intent.</i>
</blockquote>
<h5>b.  Impact Of A Severability Clause.</h5>
Although the <i>Allied-Bruce</i> Court prohibited focusing solely on the arbitration clause in assessing the enforceability of an agreement, the Georgia Court of Appeals in <i>Primerica Fin. Serv., Inc. v. Wise, </i>No. A94A2290-91, 1995 Ga. App. LEXIS 361 (Ga. Ct. App. March 14, 1995), in accordance with a severability clause, upheld the trial court's decision to strike a section of an arbitration clause that provided for certain qualifications of arbitrators.  The trial court acknowledged that the FAA applied, but found that the qualifications provision was "an inherently unfair, unjust and inequitable procedure designed to favor only the defendants."  The Court so ruled even though the FAA at Section 5 provides: that "if in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator . . ., such method shall be followed." <p>
The trial court in <i>Primerica</i> held that given the parties' intention to arbitrate their disputes and the strong public policy in favor of arbitration, it would strike only the arbitrator qualifications section (i.e., blue-pencil the agreement) rather than striking the entire arbitration provision or invalidating the entire agreement.  Because the <i>Primerica</i> Court did not consider the "fairness" of the agreement taken as a whole (as required by <i>Allied-Bruce</i>), but instead invalidated only a portion of the arbitration clause, it is uncertain whether this approach will survive as a permissible application of the FAA savings clause in light of <i>Allied-Bruce</i> (which did not address the impact of a severability clause). <p>

<h4>5.  Parties May Alter The Role Of The Reviewing Court.</h4>
The <i>Primerica</i> case also highlights the importance of nuances in drafting arbitration clauses dealing with the scope of a court's review on appeal from an arbitration award.  In <i>Primerica</i>, the court ruled that the parties' agreement to expand the scope of the reviewing court's role did not violate the FAA or public policy.  The court reasoned that although the clause expanded the court's review of an arbitration award, it was nonetheless valid because the standard of review was similar to the "any evidence" standard applied to administrative agency appeals in Georgia.  <p>
<h4>6.  Parties Can Grant Arbitrators The Authority To Award Punitive Damages
Regardless Of Contrary State Law.</h4> The United States Supreme Court, in <i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc</i>., ____ U.S. ____, 115 S.Ct. 1212 (1995), addressed the authority of the arbitrators to craft awards.  The <i>Mastrobuono</i> court held that arbitrators may award punitive damages in an arbitration proceeding conducted pursuant to an arbitration agreement that incorporates an arbitration organization's rules permitting such awards.  The Court made this ruling even though the agreement also contained a choice-of-law provision stating that the agreement was governed by the laws of New York, which empowered courts, not arbitrators, to award punitive damages.<p>

<TITLE> Is Design/Build The Right Choice for the Project Owner?</TITLE>

<H1>Is Design/Build The Right Choice for the Project Owner?</H1><P>
<H2>Michael L. Bishop</H2><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
Full service project delivery may be the defining phrase for the construction industry in the 1990s, as owners seek alternatives to the "traditional" approach to project delivery. 
<P>
This bulletin will examine the choices available to a corporate owner in deciding which type of construction delivery method to use in completion of construction projects, and will offer perspectives on the relative strengths of traditional processes and the design/build model.
<P>
<H4>Traditional Construction Contracting Methods:</H4>
<STRONG>The Owner/Architect/Contractor Triangle</STRONG><P>
Traditionally, projects were accomplished using the "design-bid-build” method. This involves a separation of roles between the designer and builder, with each being retained separately by the owner. Responsibilities are fragmented under the traditional model, and the owner is placed in the position of being arbiter of disputes and claims. 
<P>
The contractor is typically a latecomer to the scene in the design-bid-build model. 
<P>
The conventional design-bid-build method offers clear lines of authority and clear divisions of contractual responsibility. Its critics also argue that it is slow, inefficient, and tends to drive up costs. And it complicates the owner’s position by making him the contractual privity of two parties who may end up pointing at each other in the event problems arise.
<P>
<STRONG>Design/Build: The Ideal Model?</STRONG><P>
In an attempt to accelerate design and construction, reduce costs, and minimize the owner’s efforts in managing the construction process, the design/build concept has emerged. 
<P>
Design/build refers to a project delivery system in which a single entity provides to the owner all services necessary to design and construct the project. 
<P>
Many observers of the construction industry believe that the design/build model brings together an optimal selection of the best features of the traditional project delivery methods while adding its own unique benefits.
<P>
During the predesign phase, the design/builder typically may assemble a variety of experts to address predesign factors and issues. During the design phase, the design/builder may either call on its own architectural staff or subcontract with an architect. Either way, the architect is charged with interpreting the owner’s needs. The design/builder’s in-house experts typically take on scheduling, costing, constructability and quality assurance analysis tasks. The design/builder assumes full liability for design efficacy. 
<P>
During the construction phase, the design/builder actually builds the project. Projects may be fast-tracked, insofar as the interface of design/build functions is streamlined within one organization. 
<P>
<STRONG>When is Design/Build the Best Option?</STRONG><P>
No single set of project characteristics dictates the use of design/build. The design/build model has been successfully used on extraordinarily complex facilities and on "straightforward" office buildings. 
<P>
Owner’s criteria that might be considered for determining when to use design/build include (1) time constraints for delivery of the project; (2) the capability and experience of potential contractors with the design/build process; and (3) the capability (or inability) of the owner to manage the project, including personnel to oversee the project who are familiar with the design/build process.
<P>
<STRONG>The Owner’s Role in the Design/Build Process</STRONG><P>
For the design/build approach to be used successfully, the owner must clearly define the needs and requirements of the project so that they are understood by design/build contractors submitting proposals on the project. It is crucial that the owner issue comprehensive scope of work information that may include some or all of the following: detailed space and equipment requirements, site surveys, soil borings, outline specifications, budget parameters and scheduling requirements. <P>
<STRONG>Advantages of the Design/Build Model</STRONG><P>
Experience with the design/build approach has demonstrated its benefits: 
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Establishes Single Source of Responsibility</STRONG>. Eliminates disagreements over project responsibility and reduces the owner’s administrative tasks.
<LI><STRONG>Encourages Contractor Participation</STRONG>. Greater participation by the contractor during the design process results in a more cost-effective design.
<LI><STRONG>Facilitates Communication</STRONG>. Communications between design and construction personnel result in more effective transformation of design concepts into construction reality.
<LI><STRONG>Reduces Total Project Delivery Time</STRONG>. Design documentation can be reduced due to the direct collaboration of the contractor and architect. Construction on some phases of the work can begin while later phases of project design are still in process (i.e., "fast tracking"). Schedule delays may also be reduced because "finger-pointing" is unlikely to occur. 
<LI><STRONG>Reduces Change Orders</STRONG>. Swift and informal internal communication can take care of problems that would have become change orders under the traditional project delivery methods.
<LI><STRONG>Lowers Total Project Costs</STRONG>. Reducing project delivery time saves construction overhead costs and, for the owner, saves project financing costs. Less time may also be spent on construction administration due to collaborative decision-making.
<LI><STRONG>Fosters Innovative Solutions</STRONG>. Creative design and construction solutions can be developed within the design/build process (e.g., value engineering is an implicit aspect of the process).
<LI><STRONG>Enhances Owner’s Protection from Liability</STRONG>. If any defects or omissions in design or construction occur, the owner is free to hold the entire design/build entity liable.
</UL>
<STRONG>Disadvantages of the Design/Build Model</STRONG><P>
An obvious disadvantage of the design/build model is that the combination of design and construction responsibilities in one provider may deprive the owner of the "checks and balances" protection inherent in more traditional project delivery systems. <P>
Other concerns exist:<P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Loss of Independent Architect</STRONG>. The owner may not receive the same type of guidance and advice from an architect who is only a part of the design/ builder, and who has a direct financial interest in the construction of the project.
<LI><STRONG>Inspection Services</STRONG>. Owners will not have the benefit of independent architectural inspection during construction of the project, whereas traditionally, architects reviewed both the individual structural components and the overall integrity of the project design. The owner may have to provide its own inspection services or hire an independent inspection team.
</UL>
<STRONG>"Bridging": A Variation on Design/Build</STRONG><P>
The design/build model has spawned its own variation, called "Bridging."
<P>Bridging is a hybrid of the traditional process and the design/build model, and seeks to promote involvement by the owner in design aspects of the project.
<P>The owner selects an architect to conceptualize the project design through the design development phase and prepare scope of work documents that form the basis for competitive selection of the project design/build team. The owner’s architect specifies the project’s functional and aesthetic requirements but leaves the details of construction technology up to the design/builder. The design/builder then has responsibility for final design and construction of the project.<P>
<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><P>
In either the traditional or design/build context, the owner must make an assessment of its own capacity, and inclination, to manage the construction process. An owner that regularly engages in the planning, design and construction of its own facilities, and maintains a sufficient staff of experienced construction professionals, may be capable of managing designers and contractors and, in essence, performing the role of construction manager. 
<P>In most cases, however, corporate owners are not in the business of construction and it is not economical to maintain a staff of employees for such purposes. For these owners, the design/build model - the modern "full service" option - may be the best choice for successful construction project completion.

<H1>Georgia Mechanics’ Liens: Winning Stategies for Owners and General Contractors</H1><P>
<H2>Michael L. Bishop</H2><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
Filing and perfecting a lien on a construction project is not an easy procedure. The entire process provides a variety of opportunities for mistakes, missteps and missed deadlines. For a subcontractor wishing to file and recover on a lien, the process presents headaches. For an owner or general contractor who wishes to avoid or fight liens, this presents a series of opportunities to stop a lien claim dead in its tracks.<P>
Therefore, when a subcontractor files a claim of lien on a project, it is important that the project owner or general contractor identify any defects in the claim of lien, or in the subcontractor’s efforts to enforce its claim of lien. <P>
Many lien defenses are "fact-based", that is, they require the project owner or general contractor to be aware of, and to communicate to their attorneys, any defects observed in the lien claim.<P>
The following checklist will be helpful in determining if a lien, or a subcontractor’s efforts to recover on a lien, suffers any fatal defects:
<UL>
<LI>Georgia law requires that a project owner file a Notice of Commencement. If the owner files the Notice of Commencement, a lien claimant must, in turn, serve a notice to contractor on both the general contractor and the owner if the lien claimant does not have a direct contract with the owner or the general contractor. The notice of contractor ‘announces’ that the subcontractor is supplying labor, materials or services to the owner’s project. If a subcontractor files a lien on a project, and they have not filed a notice to contractor, they have forfeited their right to claim a lien.<P>
<LI>In order to maintain a lien, a lien claimant must have substantially complied with its own contract responsibilities. In other words, a lien claimant who has breached his own performance responsibilities cannot recover on a lien claim against the project owner.<P>
<LI>The lien claim must have been filed within three months (not 90  days) of the date on which the last labor, materials or services were furnished to the project by the lien claimant. (For example, if the last day of a subcontractor’s work was January 1, the subcontractor’s lien would have to be filed by April 1.)<P>
<LI>The claim of lien may not be filed prior to the completion of the lien claimant’s work on the project.<P>
<LI>The lien claimant must show that it segregated the labor and material charges for which the lien is claimed from other labor and materials that may have been provided on other projects.<P>
<LI>The lien claimant must show that it is an authorized subcontractor or supplier and has not performed work or supplied materials on the project in violation of a relevant contractual provision (for example, a clause against subcontracting or assignment).<P>
<LI>A claim of lien can only be maintained if the services, labor or materials were actually furnished to the project.<P>
<LI>The claim of lien document must correctly name the property owner.<P>
<LI>The claim of lien document must correctly identify the property on which the lien is to be placed. (For example, a claim of lien that incorrectly identifies your neighbor’s property rather than the project property may be an irritation to your neighbor, but it is not a valid claim of lien on your property.)<P>
<LI>The claimant must sue the original debtor (i.e., the party to whom the lien claimant supplied materials or labor) within 12 months from the last date labor or materials were furnished.<P>
<LI>The lien claimant must file a notice of suit with the clerk of the Superior Court of the Georgia county where the property is located at the time the suit against the original debtor is filed.<P>
<LI>If the original debtor is bankrupt, the lien claimant must sue the owner within twelve months of the last date on which labor or materials were furnished.<P>
<LI>A subcontractor that is a non-resident of Georgia cannot maintain an action to enforce lien rights in the Georgia courts unless the subcontractor has registered with the Georgia Department of Revenue pursuant to the Georgia Non-Resident Contractors Act.<P>
<LI>A subcontractor that has released and waived its claims by providing an unconditional final waiver cannot maintain a lien on the property that is the subject of the release.<P>
</UL>

When a lien claimant fails to meet one or more of the above requirements, the lien may be invalid under Georgia law.<P> 
And remember: Under Georgia Law a subcontractor’s avenue of recovery against an owner is pursuant to the lien law. A subcontractor’s breach of contract claim is typically brought against the party with whom it contracted, not the owner.
Determining whether any of the foregoing legal defenses are applicable requires investigation and the careful keeping of records by the owner and general contractor on a project. <P>
The foregoing list of possible defects is provided in order to assist owners and general contractors in making a quick evaluation of the strengths, or weaknesses, of liens that may be filed against their projects. Armed with this assistance, you should be able to negotiate with lien claimants from a position of strength.<P>

<TITLE> The Georgia Prompt Pay Act: Issues and Answers For Owners and General Contractors

<H1>The Georgia Prompt Pay Act: Issues and Answers For Owners and General Contractors
</H1><P>
<H2>Michael L. Bishop</H2><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
The Georgia Prompt Pay Act (Georgia Code §§13-11-1. - 11. the "Act") establishes conditions and time limits for payments to general contractors and to subcontractors.<P>
The Act also sets out grounds for withholding of such payments, specifies conditions for payments of retainage, provides for the collection of interest on late payments under certain circumstances, and allows recovery of attorneys’ fees in actions to enforce claims under the Act. <P>
<STRONG>Can parties avoid the Act?</STRONG>
Section 13-11-7 contains the most important limitation on the coverage of the Act. <P>
Subsection (b) expressly allows agreement by contract to interest rates, payment periods and other terms different from those stated in the Act, and in the event of such agreement the contract terms will control. <P>
<U>The Act is applicable only where no superseding contract provisions have been entered into by the parties. </U><P>
We suggest that this preemption be made clear by including the following language in all construction agreements: <P>
<EM>The parties hereby agree that the provisions stated in this Agreement with respect to payment(s), withholding of payment(s), interest rates on late payment(s), and recovery of attorneys’ fees supersede and replace the terms of the Georgia Prompt Pay Act, O.C.G.A. §13-11-1, et seq.  The provisions of the Georgia Prompt Pay Act shall not apply to this Agreement.</EM><P>
<STRONG>Who is covered by the Act?</STRONG><P>
In addition to contractors and subcontractors, the coverage of the Act’s payment requirements extends to private owners as well as state, local and municipal government agencies, excepting counties with populations of less than 10,000 and cities of less than 2,500 people. <P>
The Act’s definition of "real property" includes not only land and the improvements thereon but also lease-holds, thereby subjecting to the Act tenants who order improvements.
Who is a subcontractor?<P>
A subcontractor is defined by the Act as any person who contracts to furnish, or who furnishes, labor or materials to a contractor or subcontractor in connection with a contract for improvements to real property. <P>
Including those "contracting to furnish" and of those "actually furnishing" labor and materials, the definition appears to include subcontractors and materialsmen not strictly in a chain of privity of contract with the owner.<P>
<STRONG>What are payment conditions?</STRONG><P>
The Act states the prerequisites to a contractor’s or subcontractor’s entitlement to payment. 
These prerequisites are:<P>
1.	Performance of the terms of the contract; and<P>
2.	Satisfaction of any contractual conditions precedent to payment.<P>
Presumably, although the statute uses the unqualified terms "performance" and "satisfaction," the concept of substantial performance will be engrafted judicially upon the statute and such performance will suffice for entitlement to payment.<P>
<STRONG>What are payment terms?</STRONG><P>
The basic "prompt pay" requirements of the Act are set out in §13-11-4, which mandates payment by an owner to a contractor within 15 days of any payment request by the contractor for completed work. <P>
This section further provides that each contractor and subcontractor must pay to their respective subcontractors within 10 days of receipt of any periodic or final payment the full amount received for the subcontractors’ work.<P>
Unlike the time deadline for payment by an owner to the prime contractor, the deadline for payments to subcontractors is qualified. <P>
The 10-day payment provision must be met only when the subcontractor provides "satisfactory reasonable assurances of continued performance and financial responsibility," within the discretion of the contractor, including, but not limited to, the posting of payment and performance bonds. <P>
General contractors and upper tier subcontractors are limited only by the subjective standard of "reasonable discretion" in refusing payment to subcontractors based upon some real or reasonable fear of future default.<P>
<STRONG>When can payment be withheld?</STRONG><P>
The Act also sets out a variety of grounds upon which payment may be withheld. <P>
Section 13-11-5 provides that owners may withhold payment from contractors, and that contractors and subcontractors may withhold payment from their subcontractors, for unsatisfactory job progress, defective work, disputed work, actual or potential third-party claims, failure to make timely payments for labor or materials, damage to other entities connected with the project, or reasonable evidence that the contract cannot be completed for the balance of the contract price. <P>
In addition, this section allows withholding of retainage. Retainage withheld from a contractor cannot exceed the contractual retainage percent. Retainage withheld from a subcontractor cannot exceed the percentage retained by the owner on account of the subcontractor’s work.<P>
Further conditions upon the 10-day limit for payment to subcontractors are set out in §13-11-6. Pass through of payments and reduction of retainage for subcontractors is required within the Act’s time constraints only where the value of the subcontractor’s completed work equals 50% of the subcontract value, including change orders. <P>
In addition, this section restates that the Act’s time limitations for payments to subcontractors are applicable only upon provision by the subcontractor of reasonable assurances of performance.<P>
<STRONG>What are interest and penalties?</STRONG><P>
Section 13-11-7(a) states the penalty for failure to make payment within the Act’s time constraint in the form of a statutory interest provision. <P>
Amounts due and unpaid under the terms of the Act will bear interest at the rate of 1% per month, provided that, at the time of the request for payment, the person to be charged was notified of the interest provision of the code section. <P>
Apparently, a contractor or subcontractor lien claimant may include in its lien claim the interest provided under the Act, rather than the lower interest rate of 7% per annum typically allowed under Georgia Code §7-4-2. <P>
Acceptance of a progress payment or of final payment releases any claim for interest on that payment under the Act.<P>
The prevailing party in any action to enforce a claim under the Act is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees, including, but not limited to, fees incurred in trial, appeal or arbitration of such a claim, pursuant to §3-11-8. <P>
This right to recover attorneys’ fees and the right to recover interest under the Act are nonexclusive remedies, and the Act does not modify remedies available under differing contract or statutory terms. (Section 13-11-9). <P>
Presumably, therefore, suppliers of materials on account remain entitled to collect 1.5% interest per month as provided in Georgia Code §7-4-16.<P>
<STRONG>A pay-when-paid provision?</STRONG><P>
Another potentially far-reaching and perhaps unintended consequence of the Act arises from §13-11-4, which sets up the 10-day limit for payments to subcontractors. <P>
The section on its face appears to be a boon to subcontractors in that it is meant to speed payments to them from the higher tiers of the project. <P>
However, this section could be used by higher tier contractors to the extreme detriment of these same subcontractors. <P>
As a general proposition, payment to a subcontractor is not conditioned upon receipt of payment by the entity obligated to pay, absent a contractual "pay when paid" clause. <P>
The language of §13-11-4, in mandating that contractors and subcontractors pay their subcontractors within 10 days of receipt of payment from above, appears to be a statutory "pay when paid" provision, arguably applicable wherever not expressly contradicted by contract terms. <P>
The Act could therefore create a significant defense to payment obligations in the construction field, which had previously existed only when specified by contract. <P>
Clearly, the courts will have the final say on this interpretation.<P>
<STRONG>The bottom line</STRONG><P>
The new Prompt Pay Act is essentially a "default" mechanism: It applies unless the parties agree otherwise. <P>
The key, then, is for owners and contractors who desire to be exempted from the Act to provide their own terms of payment, retainage, etc., and parties should make it clear that they are providing "preemptive" terms by utilizing the contract insert suggested in this bulletin.<P>
<P>

<H1>Advice For Georgia Owners and General Contractors: How To Use The Notice of Commencement</H1><P>
<H2>Michael L. Bishop</H2><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
The Notice of Commencement procedure set out in Georgia Statute §44-14-361.5 requires mutual disclosure of information by Owners and General Contractors on one hand, and Sub-subcontractors on the other. A “Notice of Commencement” must be filed by the Owner, an agent of the Owner, or the General Contractor on a construction project no later than 15 days after the General Contractor has physically begun work on the Owner’s property. The “Notice of Commencement” must be:<P>
<UL>
<LI>filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court in the county in which the project is located; and<P>
<LI>a copy posted on the Project site. <P>
</UL>
The following items must be included within the Notice:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a legal description of the property upon which the improvements are being made,<P>
<LI>the name and location of the project being constructed, and<P>
<LI>the names and addresses of the General Contractor; the true owner of the property, or the person other than the Owner at whose instance the work is being furnished, if other than the true owner (e.g., a tenant); the surety (if applicable); and the construction lender (if applicable). <P>
<LI>Subsequent to the “Notice of Commencement” filing, any potential lien claimant who is not in privity with the General Contractor (i.e., sub-subcontractors) must furnish a “Notice to Contractor” to the Owner, or the Owner’s agent and the General Contractor within 30 days from the date that the “Notice of Commencement” was filed, or 30 days from the time that the potential lien claimant first furnished materials or labor on the project, whichever is later. <P>
</UL>
The “Notice to Contractor” must include the name, address and telephone number of the lien claimant, the name and address of each person at whose instance the labor, services or materials are being furnished, the name and location of the Project and a description of the labor, services or materials being provided, including the contract price or anticipated value. <P>
If the potential lien claimant fails to furnish the “Notice to Contractor” within the required time period, the claimant will not be entitled to enforce its lien rights. <P>
However, if a “Notice of Commencement” has not been filed, then sub-subcontractors are relieved from their duty to file a “Notice to Contractor,” and this section will not be applicable. If a party requests a copy of the “Notice of Commencement” from the General Contractor, the General Contractor is obligated to provide such copy to the requesting party within 10 days of the request.<P>
There are two underlying purposes for the “Notice of Commencement” procedure. First, it permits the potential lien claimant a better opportunity to file a lien, as the necessary filing information will be provided in the “Notice of Commencement.” Second, the “Notice of Commencement” provides the Owner and the General Contractor with the mechanism for keeping track of all of the entities performing work or supplying materials on the project and for making sure that payments are made. <P>

<HR>
<P>The issue of stranded utility investment in electric generating facilities
is not new.  The huge cost over-runs associated with many nuclear power plants
constructed in the mid-1970s were in many cases thought to be sufficiently large
as to prevent their immediate and direct recovery from ratepayers.  Stranded in
time, those costs were transformed into &quot;regulatory assets&quot; and
special arrangements were made to collect the costs from ratepayers, often on a
deferred basis.</P>
<P>The delayed recovery of these stranded costs did not make them go away, it
merely shifted the problem in time -- to now.  The public clamor over high
electric rates, in the very states that previously &quot;solved&quot; the
problem via regulatory assets, has made it clear that such an approach will not
work.   Thus, the quest has begun to find another way to recover uncompetitive
generation costs, while simultaneously affording electric consumers access to
lower cost, competitive electric generating markets.</P>
<P>At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&quot;FERC&quot;)
has proposed allowing access to competitive generation by opening the interstate
electric transmission grid.  If this comes to pass, customers may use the
opportunity to flee from utilities with high electric prices.  However, the FERC
proposes to protect those high priced utilities that previously built generating
facilities (or entered into long-term fuel or purchased power contracts),
expecting to provide continued generation services.  Under the FERC's proposal,
a utility would be entitled to recover such stranded investments by increasing
transmission charges imposed pursuant to Sections 205, 206 and 211 of the
Federal Power Act.  See Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and
Transmitting Utilities, Docket No.  RM94-7-000, 59 Fed.  Reg.  35,274 (July 11,
1994).  In other words, the uneconomic generation costs would be passed onto the
interstate electric transmission system and recovered there.</P>
<P>State regulatory commissions are acting, or considering acting, along a
similar path.  For example, the Public Utilities Commission of the State of
California has instituted proceedings to consider restructuring the California
electric services industry to permit access to competition.  However, the
stranded investment of utilities would be recovered through Competition
Transition Charges  (&quot;CTCs&quot;).  See, e.g., Commissioner Jessie J.
Knight, Jr.'s May 24, 1995 Proposal and Recommendations in Dockets R.94-04-031
and I.94-04-032 (proposing to compensate utilities for 90 percent of uneconomic
generation assets).  &quot;[B]ecause the utility will retain its monopoly on
local distribution, the Commission can apply [CTCs] to customers of the
[electric distribution company] without regard to which generation company [the
customers] choose, or whether they remain a utility service customer.&quot;  Id.
at 85.</P>
<P>Recently, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities
imposed very similar charges in a case involving the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (&quot;MIT&quot;), which has installed its own on-site generation
facilities.  Petition of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, D.P.U. 94-
101/95-36 (Sept. 28, 1995).  There, a Customer Transition Charge (in the amount
of 75% of Cambridge Electric Light Company's stranded generating costs)  was
added to MIT's bill for stand-by services provided by Cambridge.  Although the
charge was assessed against generation, transmission and distribution services
provided to supplement MIT's own generation, and not just wire services, the
only reason the charge could be imposed is because Cambridge enjoys a monopoly
on transmission and distribution that prevents MIT from looking to a third party
for stand-by services.</P>
<P>Each of these methods of recovering utilities' stranded costs relies on the
existence of a utility monopoly on transmission and distribution services and
the electric consumer's presumed inescapable need to use such services in
obtaining competitive generation service.  Each of these methods also
frustrates, in whole or in part, the ultimate goal of consumers in seeking to
obtain electric generation service at competitive rates.  That goal, of course,
is simply to lower their total cost of electric supply.  Lowering the cost of
generating service, while raising the cost of other related and necessary
services, does not achieve that goal; hence consumers cannot be expected to be
satisfied with the new arrangements being proposed.  Having succeeded in
obtaining low cost generation, they will next seek to avoid the high costs of
transmission and other services.</P>
<P>The question raised here is whether the monopoly status of transmission and
distribution facilities is sufficiently secure, and those services so necessary,
that regulators can safely assume that CTCs will succeed in spreading the cost
of stranded investment over a broad base of consumers.  In other words, can the
consumers' quest for lower electric bills be held in check?  If a significant
amount of electric load can find economic routes to avoid CTCs by declining to
take the services to which they are attached, a death spiral for such charges
may ensue.  That is, as consumers bypass the transition charges, the same
stranded utility investment will have to be spread over a smaller number of
electric consumers, thereby necessitating higher CTCs.  In turn, the higher CTCs
will make it economic for more consumers to find ways to  avoid the over-priced
services, and so on, until no one is left who is either willing or able to pay
down the utility's stranded investment.</P>
<P>It is useful to recall that what makes a monopoly &quot;natural&quot; is its
ability to charge a lower price for a product than its competitors charge for
competing products.  This situation is normally the result of economies of scale
that reduce the monopoly's average and marginal costs of output with each
additional unit sold.  The addition of CTCs to a utility's rate can swamp the
utility's cost advantage, such that competing products have a lower price if the
CTCs can be avoided.  Under these circumstances, the monopoly provider loses its
ability to drop prices to attractive levels in the face of competition and
monopoly rents can only be charged if artificial, in this case regulatory, means
are used to preserve the monopoly.</P>
<P>As is so often the case, the regulatory scheme used to secure a utility's
monopoly hold on transmission and distribution is not perfect.  One source of
potential competition is privately held electric transmission and distribution
lines that eliminate the need to use utility facilities.  Even before the advent
of CTCs, privately operated transmission lines were used to deliver power from
independent power projects to electric consumers.  While the majority of these
lines are under a mile in length and serve just one producer and customer,
longer lines exist.  For example, a group of Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act Qualifying Facilities share a 214-mile long transmission line running from
Nevada to California.  Another Qualifying Facility owns and operates a 10-mile
long line running between Pennsylvania and New York.</P>
<P>Throughout the New England states, and undoubtedly many other states, 
numerous industrials own small hydroelectric projects that are near, but not
directly connected to, the  owners' industrial loads.  Historically, it made
economic sense for such industrials to sell their generating projects' output to
utilities and separately purchase power to serve their industrial loads. 
However, as regulators allow the prices paid for generation to drop, while
holding the cost of delivered power essentially constant through CTCs, it will
quickly become economic to build transmission lines to link generation to load.</P>
<P>Despite the general perception that siting electric transmission lines is
difficult, the potential for the installation of competing transmission and
distribution facilities by entities who would not need to collect CTCs is
enormous.  The United States is covered with potential pathways for competing
transmission lines.  For instance, according to the Association of American
Railroads, there are approximately 155,000 miles of active railroad rights of
way in the United States today.  Add to this, close to another 100,000 miles of
abandoned rail beds, and their total length of approximately 250,000 miles is on
the same order of magnitude as the current electric transmission grid.  (The
U.S. transmission network consists of approximately 340,000 circuit miles. 
Multiple circuits along the same rights of way mean that the total miles of
electric transmission rights of way is something less.)</P>
<P>The U.S. Congress may soon clear the way for at least one competitor to make
ready use of such rights of way.  The Amtrak and Local Rail Revitalization Act
of 1995, currently pending in Congress, would permit Amtrak to purchase power at
wholesale (allowing access to existing wholesale competition in electric
generation) and resell the power at retail.  See Section 803 of 1995 S.  1318. 
Whether or not the Amtrak bill succeeds, many hundreds of thousands of miles of
rights away will remain waiting to be used by potential transmission
competitors.</P>
<P>State laws may create still other opportunities.  Upon close examination,
what are often considered to be exclusive utility service franchises are not. 
For example, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission recently declared
that Public Service Company of New Hampshire's franchise to provide electric
service to certain discrete geographical regions of the state is not exclusive
as a matter of law.  Re Freedom Electric Company, 161 PUR 4th 491 and 163 PUR
4th 223 (1995).  Similarly, the Georgia Territorial Electric Service Act
provides for at least two exceptions (i.e., new load or unsatisfactory service)
to otherwise exclusive franchises granted in Georgia.</P>
<P>In sum, once CTCs are imposed, it is only a matter of time before new
competitors, not saddled with stranded costs, offer services that allow
consumers to bypass CTC-charging utilities altogether.</P>
<P>Even if the routes for competition from third-party providers are blocked by
law or regulation, the opportunity for self-generation is likely to remain. 
Recent improvements in technology will make it economically feasible for many
industrial customers to install self-generation in response to the first wave of
CTCs.  Thomas Casten, president, CEO and founder of Trigen Energy Corp., has
observed that, when the waste heat associated with electric generation is fully
used for productive thermal uses, gas-fired combustion-turbine generators in the
three to five megawatt range are the most economical form of electric generation
today.  The cost of electric power from these cogeneration units, when running
baseloaded, is just 2.0 to 2.5&#162; per kilowatt-hour.  See Casten, &quot;Whither
Electric Generation?  A Different View,&quot; The Energy Daily's News
Environment Extra, September 7, 1995.</P>
<P>The increments of capacity involved are small enough and the cost low enough
that industrial electric consumers that wish to self-generate will be able to
install redundant capacity sufficient to ensure that such on-site generation is
as or more reliable than utility delivered electricity.  Consider that a common
industrial heat load is 250 mmBTU per hour, which will support up to 15
megawatts of electric production by a cogeneration facility with full heat use. 
Assuming that the 15 MW of generation was comprised of five 3 MW generators,
each of which operates  at 90% reliability (a conservative reliability estimate
based on experience), the probability of all five generators working at any
given time would be only 59%.  However, if a sixth generator is added, the
probability of at least five generators being in operation at any time jumps to
88.5%.  Furthermore, unlike a single 90% reliable unit, an outage would not be 
&quot;all or nothing.&quot;  The probability that at least four generators would
be available is 98.4%.  Many industrial and commercial facilities could handle
the infrequent loss of the fifth 3 MW generator through load shedding.</P>
<P>The cost for electricity in this hypothetical, but not unrealistic, case is
1.2 times 2.5&#162; per kWh or just 3.0&#162; per kWh.  Adding even a 50%
allowance, for the inability to perfectly match electric and thermal loads and
other inefficiencies, produces a cost estimate of 4.5&#162; per kWh.  This is a
highly competitive price against utilities with CTCs.  No transmission or backup
services would be required, and the regulatory impediments to self-generation
would be manageable in every jurisdiction with which we are familiar.</P>
<P>As the industrial self-generators with the most cost-effective combinations
of thermal and electric loads bypass utility CTCs, those charges will increase
for other customers.  Utility costs may spiral so that even facilities with 3 MW
electric loads could cost-effectively put in fully redundant capacity (with the
added advantage of system reliability of approximately 99% without load
shedding).  At some point, if utility shareholders do not relent, stranded
investment will be spread over so few users that even residential customers may
find existing technologies such as solar or small packaged cogeneration
facilities financially attractive.  Alternatively, the widespread formation of
new municipal electric utilities may prove to be the lowest cost option.</P>
<P>To conclude, it is not safe to assume that CTCs can be successfully
employed.  Before trying to pass the buck once again, it is time to squarely
face the realities facing the electric utility industry.  Naturally, it would be
prudent for utility management to push the pain of stranded investment onto
others, if they can.  But successful utility competitors should realize the
technological and entrepreneurial limitations on pursuing that strategy and
start thinking differently about competition -- the sooner, the better.  </P>

<HR>
<P>The destination is now recognized as inevitable.  We are on the road to full
competition in electric generation.  Many utilities would like to prepare for
such competition by gaining experience outside their rate-regulated world. 
However, not every utility is ready to bet the farm on competition, many
regulators are not yet prepared to fully deregulate utility generation, and the
existing playing field may be tilted in favor of facilities enjoying qualifying
facility (&quot;QF&quot;) status under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act of 1978 (&quot;PURPA&quot;).   Utilities, through unregulated subsidiaries,
can get a head start on competition and gain valuable experience by acquiring
ownership interests in, and operating, QFs.  </P>
<P>Some utilities may believe that they should discount the potential for
developing QFs or taking advantage of opportunities to purchase operating QFs
because their participation in such projects would necessarily be limited to a
non-controlling interest.  However, they are wrong.</P>
<P>Under the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (&quot;FERC&quot;) existing
rules, a utility can exercise almost complete control over a QF provided that
the project documents are properly structured.  The primary restrictions are:
the utility must share fifty percent of the QF's benefit stream with one or more
non-utility partners; and the utility owner must lack the power to engage in
self dealing at above-market rates.  Thus, utilities can invest in QFs, take
advantage of the many statutory and regulatory exemptions to which QFs are
entitled, and actively manage these ventures, without sharing control.  </P>
<P>PURPA gives little guidance with regard to the level of involvement that a
utility may have in the ownership, development and operation of a QF.  It merely
states that a QF must be &quot;. . . owned by a person not primarily engaged in
the generation or sale of electric power (other than electric power solely from
[QFs]).(1)  The FERC's regulations provide that a QF will be &quot;considered to
be owned by a person primarily engaged in the generation or sale electric power,
if more than 50 percent of the equity interest in the facility is held by an
electric utility or utilities, or by an electric utility holding company or
companies [or subsidiaries of these entities.](2) </P>
<P>While the term &quot;equity interest&quot; is not defined, a review of the
FERC's case-by-case determinations reveals that it is possible for a utility to
enjoy unilateral control over a QF's management, without violating the fifty
percent equity interest limitation.  For example, the FERC has certified a QF
whose management committee was controlled by subsidiaries of Pacificorp and
Southwestern Public Service Company.(3)  Further, a utility can enter into a
wide variety of service contracts with a QF.  Some of the services provided to
QFs by utility-owner affiliated companies include: construction, start-up and
testing, management, and  operation and maintenance. (4) </P>
<P>Of course, if the utility would control the QF, one might well ask who is
going to be willing to supply the other fifty percent of the capital needed to
develop or own the project.  Surprisingly, it can be the QF-owning utility.  In
the many decisions issued since its PURPA regulations were promulgated, the FERC
has determined that the fifty percent equity interest limitation does not
necessarily relate to the amount of capital a utility supplies to a project. 
Instead, the FERC's analyses have focussed on the electric-utility owner's share
of the stream of economic benefits from a particular QF, and the ability to
control that stream of benefits.  In one of its early decisions on this issue,
the FERC certified a QF even though the utility partner provided two thirds of
the initial capital and the non- utility partner provided one third.  The FERC
determined that the initial capital contribution was not part of the &quot;equity
interest&quot; as that term is used in the FERC's regulations, and that the
capital contribution should be viewed as debt rather than equity, since it
conveyed no management rights and did not affect the stream of benefits from the
QF.(5)</P>
<P>In considering a variety of other arrangements relating to utilities'
capital investment in QFs, the FERC has consistently followed its stream of
benefits analysis.  For example, in CMS Midland, Inc.,(6) the assets owned by
Consumers Power Company were to be transferred to the partnership that would own
and operate the QF.  Alternatives to a pure equity investment by the utility
were examined, such as the partnership's purchase of the assets in exchange for
a promissory note, or a lease of the assets to the partnership.  The FERC
observed that if excessive payments were made in exchange for such assets, they
could effectively constitute a distribution of profits from the facility, and
thereby, could result in more than fifty percent of the benefits from the QF
flowing to the utility -- in contravention of the FERC's rules.  However, the
FERC determined that the purchase or lease of the assets from the utility would
be acceptable, provided that such arrangements were not priced above market. 
The ability to lend a joint venturer, or the joint venture, the funds needed to
finance or participate in a project may expand the universe of willing, silent
partners.</P>
<P>Furthermore, recent decisions from the FERC demonstrate that a utility owner
may, at any one time,  be permitted to own and share in more than fifty percent
of the stream of benefits from a QF, so long as the fifty percent limitation is
not exceeded over the term of their involvement.  For example, in Saguaro Power
Company, the FERC recertified a QF in which the stream of benefits flowing to
the  utility owners could exceed fifty percent in certain years, when a true-up
agreement ensured that the utilities' benefit stream would not exceed fifty
percent over the entire period of their participation in the project.(7)</P>
<P>In sum, utilities that want to expand their competitive arsenals before
their existing generation portfolios are deregulated should consider investing
in QFs.   These utilities need not fear that they will be unable to control
their QF ventures or find partners that will concede control to them.  Of
course, as Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners found out when their
application for certification was initially denied by the FERC,(8)  it is vital
to structure the project documents carefully so as not to run afoul of the
FERC's requirements.  With the proper expertise, forward thinking utilities need
not hesitate to play the QF card when the opportunity arises.</P>

<p>
A few years from now we will look back on the change from monopoly to competition for local
telephone service as the dividing line between the old and the new information marketplace. The
change is not limited just to "who" provides local telephone services. There is a fundamental
change in "what" are telephone services. <p>

Traditional regulation of point to point voice communications is being completely reshaped by
new competitive and technology forces. These forces are creating big changes for all companies
that transport, create, sell, use or compete with information.<p>

Those in the old "local telephone" and "long distance" businesses are busy buying and selling
new technology and ventures. It is not idle talk. Billions of dollars are being invested to combine
traditional "cable", "movie", "television" and "telephone" businesses. Like the ancient alchemists
seeking a formula for gold - the modern search is to create greater value by mixing elements of
"content" and the "conduit" which carries the information.<p>

These markets, however, are subject to legal and regulatory overlays that have created a virtual
tower of Babel. The federal government through the FCC, the Justice Department and Judge
Greene, regulate parts of broadcast, cable, telephone and radio based telecom (cellular, PCS,
trunk radio). The states through the public service commissions regulate local and intra-state
communications. The local city governments regulate (for a fee) the cable franchise and access
to local utility right of way.<p>

In the early 1990's the Congress "re-regulated" the cable business when opinion polls showed
that people were tired of price gouging monopolies that provided indifferent service. There are
now bills pending before Congress seeking to require the states to open up their telecom markets
to new competition.<p>

Georgia, however, has already taken an important step in this new direction. In 1995 Georgia
enacted Senate Bill 137 which changes the state's reliance on public regulation to a reliance upon
private competition in the market. Under the new Georgia Act the role of the Public Service
Commission changes from master planning (comprehensive rate of return regulation) to
referee(protecting the competitive marketplace). A 5 year freeze in the price for single line
residential and business phones (universal service) is granted in exchange for permitting the
telephone companies to start setting prices for their other services.<p>

Georgia SB 137 opens the Georgia local telephone market to competition. The Act authorizes
new local service providers and requires that services needed to operate and interconnect to
existing networks be sold separately at non-discriminatory rates. The Act also allows the resale
of services purchased by one service provider from another.<p>

All this will have major impacts even on businesses that do not see themselves as being in the
"telecommunications" business.<p>
<ul>
  <li>	If you sell services to telephone companies - they will be getting smaller and much more
competitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	If you sell to the public - they will increasingly demand that you provide them with immediate,
individualized and hassle free services with quality support at times that are convenient to them.
The new telecom will be the new weapon of choice in the competition for quality, service and
low unit cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	If you are a big company - you have had your own network for some time. These changes will
convert you to a possible seller (and certainly a reuser) of your own business information. Both
your suppliers and your customers are likely to become new competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	If you are a small company - the increase in capacity and the lowing costs mean that you will
combine with other firms to provide competitive services on a "peer" basis with and to larger
firms.</li>
</ul>
In the "new" telecom market the line between "local" and "long distance" will disappear. The
growth of radio based communications will shift the telephone from communications to a
"place" to a "person" regardless of location. The binding together of firms and customers with
fiber, cable and radio lines of data, pictures will create new demands and new services. In next
few years the intense rivalry between phone, cable, wireless and power companies to provide
telecom will create remarkable opportunities for cost savings and new partnering.<p>

<h1>Doing Business on the Internet:<br>Protection of Intellectual Property</h1>
<h2>Bradley A. Slutsky</h2>
<p><H6>An earlier version of this article originally appeared in the December 1995 issue of <EM>Legal Trends Advisory for Corporate Leaders</EM>. Reproduced by permission.</H6>
<HR></center>
<p>
With the rapid expansion of commerce on the Internet, the need to control and protect intellectual property on the Internet has increased dramatically.  Among the key emerging issues are questions of:<p>
<ul>
<li>How companies can protect their trademarks against domain name piracy</li>
</ul><p>
<ul><li>How companies can address trademark and copyright infringements on the Internet</li></ul><p>
<ul><li>How companies can address potential liability associated with providing Internet access</li></ul><p>
<ul><li>Jurisdictional considerations associated with doing business on the Internet</li></ul>
<h4>Protecting Trademarks Against Domain Name Piracy</h4>
Disputes over Internet domain names are occurring more and more frequently as companies begin to seek protection for the use of their trademarks in "cyberspace".  Hasbro, Inc. obtained an injunction prohibiting the Internet Entertainment Group from using the CANDYLAND name or the candyland.com domain name in connection with its adult-oriented World Wide Web site, MTV sued former "VJ" Adam Curry over the "mtv.com" domain name, <EM>see MTV Network v. Curry</EM>, 867 F. Supp. 202 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), and Kaplan Educational Centers is reputed to have won an arbitration against Princeton Review after Princeton Review registered the Internet domain name "kaplan.com".<p>

Unlike in "real space", in "cyberspace" it is not currently possible to resolve these disputes by permitting geographically disparate users to use the same name in different territories, or to use the same name in the same territories for different goods or services.  What should a company do if it finds "its" domain name taken?<p>

Network Solutions, Inc. ("NSI") is the entity responsible for allocating domain names on the Internet.  If someone is using your trademark as a domain name, you can provide NSI with a copy of your registration and, if the holder of the domain name does not also have a registration, the domain name will automatically be placed on hold (and thus will be unusable) until the dispute is resolved through traditional means. <EM>See </EM><a href="ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/internic.domain.policy"><EM>
ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/internic.domain.policy</EM></a>.<p>

<h4>Addressing Copyright And Trademark Infringements On The Internet</h4>
Suppose you are the author of a copyrighted work or the owner of a trademark, and a fan takes pieces of your work and places them on the Internet or uses your trademark in connection with a page on the World Wide Web.  In many cases, the only information you will initially have about the person is their e-mail address.  Do you send them a standard cease-and-desist letter by e-mail?  If you choose to follow this traditional route, be prepared to have millions of copies of your letter circulated around the world.<p>

It pays to think through this situation before sending a typical demand letter.  If you can logically explain the reasons for your concerns to a nonlawyer, you are less likely to encounter retaliation. A phone call, perhaps followed by a confirming letter, may be in order.  Such disputes can also be resolved by contacting the user's Internet Service Provider--particularly in light of recent legal decisions in this area.  Should litigation prove necessary, the practice of inserting "steganographic" signatures into data can be effective in demonstrating that materials were copied.<p>

<h4>Addressing Potential Liability For Providing Internet Access</h4>
Those who provide unfettered access to infringing materials on the Internet can be held liable as direct or contributory copyright infringers.  <EM>Compare <A HREF="http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/erlich/whyte-11.21.95">Religious Technology Center v. NETCOM On-Line Communication Services, Inc.</A>,</EM> No. C-95-20091 RMW (N.D. Cal. November 21, 1995) with <EM>Sega Enterprises, Ltd. v. MAPHIA, </EM>857 F. Supp. 679 (N.D. Cal. 1994) and <EM>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Frena</EM>, 839 F. Supp. 1552 (M.D. Fla. 1993).  Even e-mail access to the Internet can expose one to such liability.<p>

On the other hand, too much editorial control over the contents of computer files can result in liability for defamatory statements "published" through one's computer network.  <EM>Compare Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co.</EM>, 23 Media L. Rep. 1794, 1995 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 229 (S.Ct. N.Y. 1995) with <EM>Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc.</EM>, 776 F. Supp.135 (S.D.N.Y. 1991). This puts access providers in a dilemma.  If they do not control users' actions, they can be held liable for copyright infringements.  If they control users' actions, they may be considered "publishers" and may face exposure in defamation cases.<p>

Well crafted policies and procedures can help decrease potential liability for providing access to the Internet.  The trick is to balance sensitivity to suspected or alleged infringements with limited editorial control over the contents of e-mail messages and other documents.<p>

<h4>Jurisdictional Considerations Associated With Doing Business On The
Internet</h4>
Suppose your World Wide Web home page says that your widget is 50% better than the brand X widget.  Also suppose your World Wide Web page is accessed by someone who resides in one of the many countries that prohibit comparative advertising.  Are you liable for violating foreign comparative advertising laws?
<p>
CompuServe recently restricted (but now has restored) access to various UseNet Newsgroups based on threats from the Bavarian government. Similarly, in <EM><A HREF="http://www.callaw.com/tommy.html">United States v. Thomas</A>, </EM> 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 1069 (6th Cir. January 29, 1996), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction in Tennessee of a couple that distributed allegedly obscene images from a computer bulletin board in California.  The community standards in Tennessee were applied to determine whether the materials were obscene. The Minnesota Attorney General also recently sued six entities for offering allegedly fraudulent and/or illegal schemes to Minnesota residents over the Internet.  According to the Minnesota Attorney General, "persons outside of Minnesota who transmit information via the Internet knowing that information will be disseminated in
Minnesota are subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota courts for violations of state criminal and civil laws."  <EM>See <a href="http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/memo.txt">http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/memo.txt</a>.</EM><p>

Jurisdictional issues remain problematic.  Until generally accepted rules evolve, the "least
common denominator" may control what is safe and what is risky with respect to commerce on
the Internet.<p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Although there are few "Internet law" precedents at this time, some early lessons have emerged. 
First, if you have taken the time and effort to register a trademark, you should register an Internet
domain name now, before someone beats you to it.  Second, think twice about using traditional
means to pursue infringers on the Internet.  If you send a standard cease and desist letter by
e-mail, you are playing on the infringer's turf.  Third, if you provide access to the Internet,
carefully crafted policies and procedures can help decrease your potential exposure to liability. 
Finally, it is important to consider the implications of potentially nation-wide or world-wide
jurisdiction over one's actions on the Internet.<p>

<h1>Trends in Outsourcing</h1>
<h2>Steven J. de Groot</h2>

Ask five people in the "outsourcing industry" where the industry is today and where it will be
tomorrow and you'll get five different answers.  The industry has changed and will continue to
change rapidly; the future face of technology is uncertain.  These changes and uncertainties
make it difficult for the prognosticators to predict with any certainty what the outsourcing
landscape will look like tomorrow, much less years from now. <p>

Despite the uncertainties of the future landscape of the outsourcing industry, certain trends are
emerging in the way today's outsourcing deals are being done:<p>
<ul>
<li>A broader variety of enterprise functions are being outsourced today.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Outsourcing is being used as a stategic tool to add enterprise value.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Joint ventures and other types of strategic alliances are becoming more prevalent in structuring outsourcing deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Outsourcing deals today tend to have shorter lives than earlier deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A variety of economic models are being used to price outsourcing deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Many of yesterday's outsourcing deals are being restructured.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Consultants and lawyers are increasingly being used as a means of adding value to the
outsourcing process.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A Broader Variety of Functions are Being Outsourced</h4>
The types of enterprise functions being outsourced today have expanded dramatically in scope. 
Ten years ago management was hesitant to depend on third parties to undertake core
competencies at a time when outsourcing was a relatively new phenomenon.  As a result, to the
extent managers outsourced enterprise functions at all, they tended to outsource nonessential
functions such as payroll, accounts payable and other more mundane data processing functions. 
With the maturation of the outsourcing industry and the growth of proven niche outsourcing
vendors, managers are now outsourcing such "mission critical" functions as design, process and
quality control management, logistics, sales and customer support, telecommunications,
LAN/WAN management, applications development, maintenance and training, help desk, and
human resource management.<p>

<h4>Outsourcing is Being Used as a Tool to Add Value</h4>
More than simply a means to reduce enterprise costs, management is now looking at outsourcing
as a strategic tool to add value to the enterprise and  help achieve and/or maintain a competitive
edge in the marketplace.  Cost reduction remains a significant driver in many of today's decisions
to outsource.  However, management is increasingly insisting that the outsourcing vendor
perform the outsourced function more efficiently, effectively and creatively, and in a manner that
assists the outsourcer to maintain a competitive edge in the market.  The decision to outsource is
as often a strategic one as it is an economic one.<p>

<h4>There is an Increased Focus on the Relational Aspects of Outsourcing</h4>
Outsourcers and vendors are beginning to focus on the relational aspects of outsourcing
transactions; hence more transactions are being structured as joint ventures, partnerships and
other types of strategic alliances.  While the "service contract" model of outsourcing continues to
be the norm, outsourcers and vendors are becoming more creative in the structuring of their
arrangements.  Such creativity is permitting outsourcers and their vendors to take advantage of
risk and cost sharing, as well as capture the synergies resulting from their alliances. <p>

<h4>Use of the "One-Stop" Shopping vs. Integrator Model</h4>
The "one-stop" shopping approach to vendor selection is giving way to a paradigm that typically
includes a large vendor serving as the integrator of a number of "niche vendor" outsourcing
arrangements.  Increasingly, these integrators are managing outsourcing arrangements which
have components being performed by telecom, applications development and maintenance, help
desk, sales and customer support, and other specialty vendors.<p>

<h4>More Deals Have Shorter Lives</h4>
Today's outsourcing deals tend to have shorter terms than those of even a few years ago.  Most
of today's vendors prefer long-term deals, permitting the vendor to lock up customers, take
advantage of historical reductions in the cost of technology and amortize the "up-front" costs of
their investment in the customer over a longer period of time.  Conversely, outsourcers are
typically seeking shorter terms (e.g., 3-5 years) to preserve vendor flexibility as new players
enter the outsourcing arena and enterprise needs change, and to take advantage of historical cost
reductions and advancements in technology.<p>

<h4>Creative Pricing Models are Being Utilized</h4>
Fixed fees pricing models, now generally a small component of any outsourcing deal, are being
replaced by a variety of variable pricing schemes, including per unit (e.g., per call, CPU, seat,
server, MIP), technology replacement and refresh, indexing and benchmarking schemes.  As
outsourcing services become more of a commodity in today's market, outsourcers are
increasingly insisting on provisions that require their vendors to price and provide their services
on market terms.  Additionally, many outsourcing economic models are incorporating
"benchmarking" schemes which reward and/or penalize the vendor for meeting or failing to meet
stated objectives or benchmarks.<p>

<h4>Old Outsourcing Arrangements are Being Restructured</h4>
Increasingly, many outsourcing deals being entered into today are actually restructures of
existing outsourcing arrangements.  Deals are being restructured today for a variety of reasons,
including changes in technology and the cost of technology, migrations of the outsourcer's
business that requires changes in the IT function, management changes, competition in the
outsourcing marketplace and entities' increasing use of outsourcing to gain a competitive edge in
the marketplace.<p>

<h4>Consultants and Lawyers are Being Used to Add Value</h4>
The use of consultants and lawyers as a means of adding value to the outsourcing process is
becoming prevalent.  It has long been an industry paradox that, while a significant corporate
transaction has historically attracted teams of financial advisors, consultants and lawyers to
undertake the task at hand, many outsourcing transactions involving significantly greater sums of
money have garnered little attention from groups other than the organization's management
information personnel.  This approach appears to be changing as outsourcing entities are
increasingly utilizing outside consultants and lawyers to add value to the outsourcing process. 
Entities are recognizing that in arrangements which include the payment of significant sums of
money, and perhaps more importantly, the entrustment of "mission critical" functions to outside
parties, it is important that the deal be structured and documented in a manner that adequately
protects the interests of the outsourcer.<p>

As the outsourcing industry continues to evolve from the "cottage" industry it was ten years ago
and the multi-billion dollar industry it is today, outsourcers, vendors and their consultants and
counsel will continue to be challenged by the array of issues such evolution inevitably spawns.<p>

<HR>
<H2>I.   Introduction</H2>
<P>The process of conducting commercial transactions over the Internet can take
several forms.  For instance, a business can advertise its goods or services
using electronic mail, through Usenet newsgroups, and over the World Wide Web. 
Similarly, a business can accept orders by various methods, including by
electronic mail and through a World Wide Web site.  It also has become possible
for a number of businesses to fill orders over the Internet.  If the goods or
services that are being ordered consist of digital information, that information
can be sent to users as an attachment to an electronic mail message, users can
be given access to the information through File Transfer Protocol, or users can
download the information directly from a World Wide Web site.</P>
<P>In such transactions, the seller may be located in one jurisdiction, the
buyer may be located in another jurisdiction, the computer that sends or
receives the electronic mail messages or the hypertext transfer protocol
messages of the World Wide Web may be located in another jurisdiction, and the
computers in between the buyer and the seller which facilitate their
communications likely are located in one or more other jurisdictions.</P>
<P>The laws that govern the commercial transaction between the seller and the
buyer traditionally have been territorial in nature.  Federalist and social
contract theories of government teach us that &quot;the people are the only
legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional
charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is
derived&quot;.  The Federalist No. 49 (Alexander Hamilton or James Madison).  In
other words, &quot;the persons within a geographically defined border are the
ultimate source of law-making authority for activities within that border.&quot;
 David R. Johnson and David G. Post, <a href="http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html">Law
and Borders--The Rise of Law in Cyberspace</a>, ___ Stan. L. Rev. ___ (1996) (hereinafter Rise
of Law in Cyberspace). 
Thus, as the United States Supreme Court has noted, &quot;[a]ll legislation is
prima facie territorial.&quot; <U>American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co.</U>, 213 U.S.
347, 357 (1909).  These principles typically also are inherent in our domestic
view of the power of foreign sovereigns. <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, Restatement (Third) of
Foreign Relations Law of the United States &#167; 201 (1987) (&quot;Under
international law, a state is an entity that has a defined territory and a
permanent population, under the control of its own government ... .&quot;); <U>Id.</U> &#167;
402 (a state has &quot;jurisdiction to  prescribe law with respect to (1)(a)
conduct that, wholly or in substantial part, takes place within its territory;
(b) the status of persons, or interests in things, present within its territory;
(c) conduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have substantial
effect within its territory ... .&quot;)</P>
<P>Thus, if a buyer and seller both are located in the same state in the United
States, the law governing their transaction typically will be the law of the
state in which the transaction occurred, unless the parties agree to apply the
law of another jurisdiction and that jurisdiction has a reasonable relationship
to the transaction.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, 15A C.J.S. Conflict of Laws &#167;&#167;
11(4)a,b.  If the buyer is located in one jurisdiction and the seller is located
in another, we have choice of law rules that govern which law applies.  In
contract cases, the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was created--the
lex loci contractus-- typically will govern.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, 15A C.J.S. Conflict of
Laws &#167;&#167; 11(1),(2).  In tort cases, the law of the jurisdiction where
the harm was suffered--the lex loci delicti--often will govern.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, 15A
C.J.S. Conflict of Laws &#167;&#167; 12(2)b.</P>
<P>The Internet breaks down barriers between physical jurisdictions.  When a
buyer and seller consummate a commercial transaction through a World Wide Web
site, there is no need for the traditional physical acts that often determine
which jurisdiction's law will apply and whether the buyer or seller will be
subject to personal jurisdiction in the courts where the other is located.</P>
<P>Thus, in assessing whether and under what circumstances governments can
assert jurisdiction over commerce on the Internet, it also is relevant to ask
whether and under what circumstances they should assert such jurisdiction.  In
other words, to what extent should we force old models and analogies on this new
way of communicating and doing business?  While this topic easily could form the
subject of an entirely separate paper, there are at least two issues one should
consider when approaching this problem.  First, because physical jurisdiction
boundaries typically have delineated legal boundaries as well, we have come to
expect that &quot;[p]roper boundaries have signposts that provide warning that
we will be required, after crossing, to abide by different rules ... .&quot;  <a
href="http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html">Rise of Law In Cyberspace</a>, ___ Stanford
Law Review at ___.  Since &quot;Cyberspace
has no territorially- based boundaries&quot;, &quot;[t]he Net thus radically
subverts a system of rule-making based on borders between physical spaces&quot;.  <U>Id.</U> 
Second, as was noted in <a
href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Comm_Decency_Act/HTML/960612_aclu_v_reno_decision.html">American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno</a>, &quot;[i]t
is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet has achieved, and continues to
achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass speech that this country - -
and indeed the world -- has yet seen.&quot;  929 F. Supp. 824, 881 (E.D. Pa.
1996).  As such, many believe that &quot;the Internet deserves the broadest
possible protection from government-imposed, content-based regulation.&quot; 
<U>Id.</U></P>
<P>Substantive and procedural law often vary from  jurisdiction to
jurisdiction.  Thus, the questions of what laws govern transactions over the
Internet and where the buyer and seller are subject to jurisdiction can be
important.  This article analyzes those questions in the context of Internet
transactions involving electronic mail, Usenet posts, and World Wide Web sites. 
While the law in this area still is somewhat unsettled, it seems fair to say
that electronic mail messages targeted at specific recipients in identifiable
locations probably can give rise to jurisdiction over the sender in the
recipients' locations.  Further, if the messages violate the laws of the
recipients' locations the sender likely can be judged by those laws.  For Usenet
posts and World Wide Web sites, the analysis is more difficult.  While there are
significant legal and policy-based defenses to jurisdiction in such cases, the
recent trend of court decisions seems to indicate that jurisdiction may be
asserted over the sender or seller conducting business through Usenet or the
World Wide Web, particularly if the identity and location of the buyer is known
to the seller.</P>
<H2>II. Electronic Mail Transactions</H2>
<P>Sending e-mail to an individual whose location is known to the sender is
similar to sending regular mail addressed to an individual at a known location. 
Thus, one could argue that there is little reason not to exercise jurisdiction
over the sender in the location to which the e-mail was sent.
 <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <U>McGee v. International Life Insurance Co.</U>, 355 U.S.
220, 222-24 (1957) (&quot;Today
many commercial transactions touch two or more States and may involve parties
separated by the full continent.  With this increasing nationalization of
commerce has come a great increase in the amount of business conducted by mail
across state lines.  At the same time modern transportation and communication
have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State
where he engages in economic activity.  ...  It is sufficient for purposes of
due process that the suit was based on a contract which had substantial
connection with that State.  [cit. om.]  The contract was delivered in
California, the premiums were mailed from there and the insured was a resident
of that State when he died.  It cannot be denied that California has a manifest
interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents when their
insurers refuse to pay claims.  These residents would be at a severe
disadvantage if they were forced to follow the insurance company to a distant
State in order to hold it legally accountable.  When claims were small or
moderate individual claimants frequently could not afford the cost of bringing
an action in a foreign forum -- thus in effect making the company judgment
proof.  ...  Of course there may be inconvenience to the insurer if it is held
amenable to suit in California where it had this contract but certainly nothing
which amounts to a denial of due process.&quot;).</P>
<P>There are, however, complicating factors introduced by the technology of the
Internet.  For instance, if one sends e-mail to JohnDoe@CompuServe.com, Mr. Doe
could be located almost anywhere in the world, as CompuServe has subscribers
throughout the world.  If one sends e-mail to JohnDoe@atlanta.com, Mr. Doe could
have implemented a &quot;forward&quot; file that forwards his mail from his
computer in Atlanta, Georgia to anywhere in the world.  If one sends e-mail to
JohnDoe@alpha.c2.org (alpha.c2.org is a re-mailer designed to maintain the
anonymity of those with accounts there), not only does one not know where Mr.
Doe is located, but Mr. Doe has specifically taken steps to try to ensure that
one does not know where he is located.  As the District Court recognized in <a
href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Comm_Decency_Act/HTML/960612_aclu_v_reno_decision.html">ACLU v. Reno</a>, &quot;[a]n e-mail address provides no authoritative information
about the addressee, who may use an e-mail 'alias' or an anonymous remailer.&quot; 
929 F. Supp. at 845.  &quot;With the possible exception of an e-mail to a known
recipient, most content providers cannot determine the identity and age of every
user accessing their material.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at 854.  Thus, except for e-mail sent
to a known recipient, it may be difficult to say that e-mail distribution is a
method by which a company &quot;purposefully avail[s] itself of the privilege of
conducting activities within the [recipient's] forum State.&quot; <U>Hanson v. Denckla</U>,
357 U.S. 235, 253 (1958).</P>
<H2>III.  Advertising Through Usenet Newsgroups</H2>
<P>Posting commercial information to Usenet newsgroups is, in some ways,
similar to sending e-mail.  In other ways, however, it is completely different. 
In the case of a Usenet post, the poster knows or should know that their post
will be sent to computers in every State in the United States and in many
locations throughout the world.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <a
href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Comm_Decency_Act/HTML/960612_aclu_v_reno_decision.html">ACLU v. Reno</a>, 929 F. Supp. at 835 (&quot;USENET
newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc, peer to peer connections between
approximately 200,000 computers (called USENET 'servers') around the world.&quot;).
 The poster does not necessarily know, however, that their post will be received
and read by a person in any particular location (although the poster of a
commercial advertisement presumably hopes that the advertisement will be
distributed and read as widely as possible).  If a fraudulent sale is made by
delivering worthless goods to the recipient's location, that presumably would
provide an independent basis for jurisdiction.  If, however, the post is alleged
to be harmful in itself (perhaps because it is libelous or solicits
participation in a &quot;scam&quot;), the jurisdiction issue becomes more
difficult.</P>
<P>The fact that it is foreseeable that a Usenet post may end up in a
particular jurisdiction probably is not, alone, sufficient to give rise to
jurisdiction.  <U>See</U>, <U>e.g.</U>, <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27444+u!2Es!2E+286!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27444+u!2Es!2E+286!27]/doc/{@298303}/hit_headings?">World-Wide
Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</a>, 444 U.S. 286,
297-98 (1979) (&quot;the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis
is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum
State.  Rather, it is that the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum
State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court
there.  ...  The forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process 
Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its
products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be
purchased by consumers in the forum State.&quot;).  The law is somewhat
unsettled, however, with respect to whether knowledge that the post will be
received in the jurisdiction is sufficient, <U>see</U> <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27465+u!2Es!2E+770!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27465+u!2Es!2E+770!27]/doc/{@203551}/hit_headings?">Keeton v.
Hustler Magazine, Inc.</a>, 465 U.S. 770, 774 (1983) (&quot;Such regular monthly sales of
thousands of magazines cannot by any stretch of the imagination be characterized as random,
isolated, or fortuitous.&quot;), or whether additional conduct is required.  <U>See</U>
<a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+102!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+102!27]/doc/{@143486}/hit_headings?">Asahi Metal
Industry, Inc. v. Superior Court of California, Solano County</a>, 480
U.S. 102, 112 (1987) (&quot;Additional conduct of the defendant may indicate an
intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum State, for example, designing
the product for the market in the forum State, advertising in the forum State,
establishing channels for providing regular advice to customers in the forum
State, or marketing the product through a distributor who has agreed to serve as
the sales agent in the forum State.  But a defendant's awareness that the stream
of commerce may or will sweep the product into the forum State does not convert
the mere act of placing the product into the stream of commerce into an act
purposefully directed toward the forum State.&quot;) (plurality decision). 
Regardless of one's ability to control the destination of one's communication,
however, if the communication is calculated to cause injury in a specific
geographic location one will be subject to jurisdiction there.  <U>See</U> <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27465+u!2Es!2E+783!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27465+u!2Es!2E+783!27]/doc/{@203502}/hit_headings?">Calder v.
Jones</a>, 465 U.S. 783, 789-90 (1983) (&quot;petitioners are not charged with mere
untargeted negligence.  ... [T]hey knew that the brunt of that injury would be
felt by respondent in the State in which she lives and works and in which the
National Enquirer has its largest circulation.  Under the circumstances,
petitioners must 'reasonably anticipate being haled into court there' to answer
for the truth of the statements made in their article.&quot;).</P>
<H2>IV. Commerce Over The World Wide Web</H2>
<P>The issues raised by World Wide Web sites are slightly more difficult.  In
the case of a Usenet post, the poster at least undertook some action
specifically designed to send the communication to computers outside of their
location.  In so doing, they knew or should have known that their post would end
up residing on computers in every state in the United States and in many foreign
countries, and it probably is fair to assume that one who posts commercial
advertising hopes and perhaps anticipates that the advertising will be read in
those locations.  The unpredictable element, in that circumstance, is whether
the advertisement will be read by a person--not whether the post will find its
way into a particular foreign jurisdiction.  In the case of a World Wide Web
site, there is no way for a person to know, in advance, where the materials on
the Web site will be received.  &quot;[T]he creation and posting of a Web site
allows users anywhere in the country [and in many places throughout the world]
to see that site&quot;. <a
href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/Comm_Decency_Act/HTML/960612_aclu_v_reno_decision.html">ACLU v. Reno</a>, 929 F. Supp. at 878.  One can take steps
to try to encourage the viewing of one's Web Site by users in certain locations
(such as by advertising the Web site in local newspapers or placing links to the
Web site on other Web sites that would be of interest to people in specific
geographic locations).  Perhaps such steps would amount to the &quot;additional
conduct&quot; that the plurality in <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+102!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+102!27]/doc/{@143486}/hit_headings?">Asahi</a>
sought to require.  One also can fail
to take steps to prohibit users in certain locations from accessing one's Web
site.  For instance, one can require registration and a password to view a World
Wide Web site, and part of the registration process could involve verification
of the user's address.  One also can attempt to restrict access to a World Wide
Web site to users at certain Internet domains, although such efforts usually
will not be successful<a name="TEXT2">.</a><a href="#FN2">(2)</a> The failure to take such
steps, however, may not be sufficient to give rise to jurisdiction.  <U>See</U> <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+112!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+112!27]/doc/{@143536}/hit_headings?">Asahi

<P>Nevertheless, the Minnesota Attorney General has taken the position that
those who solicit business over the Internet as a whole, such as through a World
Wide Web site, are subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota if the information can
be viewed by Minnesota residents.  The Minnesota Attorney General has filed at
least six lawsuits against out-of-state residents in connection with on-line
activities that allegedly are harmful to Minnesota residents.  <U>See</U>
<a href="http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/">http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/</a>.  The
alleged activities of the various
defendants include:  allegedly false claims about the health benefits of &quot;germanium&quot;;
the alleged sale of information about using two-cent stamps instead of
thirty-two-cent stamps to save money; a credit repair service that allegedly
recommends the use of an Employer Identification Number (instead of a Social
Security Number) when applying for credit; an alleged pyramid scheme; a Web site
&quot;advertising&quot; that a company is &quot;planning&quot; to offer an
on-line gambling service; and the alleged sale of information about making money
by locating people who are owed money by HUD.</P>
<P>According to a brief filed by the Minnesota Attorney General in response to
a motion to dismiss one of those cases for lack of personal jurisdiction, &quot;courts
have repeatedly held in consumer enforcement cases that defendants who advertise
or solicit business within a state have the requisite minimum contacts with that
state.&quot;  <U>See</U> <a
href="http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/brief.txt">http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/ag/brief.txt</a>, pg. 22.  The
Minnesota Attorney General argues that contacts with the nation as a whole,
though not directed at any particular State, are sufficient for jurisdiction.  <U>Id.</U> at 23-24
(<U>citing</U> <U>Tobin v. Astra Pharmaceutical Prod.</U>, 993 F.2d 528, 543-44 (6th Cir.),
<U>cert.</U> <U>denied</U>, 510 U.S. 914 (1993); <U>A. Uberti &amp; C. v.
Leonardo</U>,
892 P.2d 1354, 1362 (Ariz.), <U>cert.</U> <U>denied</U>, __ U.S. __, 116 S. Ct.  273 (1995);

<U>review</U> <U>granted</U> (Minn. Feb. 9, 1996); and <U>Sunrise Specialty Contracting 
v. S.A.
Komet</U>, No. C7-92-924, 1992 WL 295127 *1, *2  (Minn.  Ct. App. Oct. 20, 1992)). 
In fact, this position may draw some support from the 1993 amendment to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 4.  Rule 4(k)(2), which was added in 1993, provides that
for claims arising under federal law, service of process may be made on a
foreign entity that has sufficient contacts with the United States as a whole,
even if the entity does not have sufficient contacts with any individual State
to be subject to jurisdiction in any individual State based on those contacts.</P>
<P>The Minnesota Attorney General's brief goes on to argue as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Attorney General is not maintaining that anyone who places information
on the Internet is subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota.  The Attorney General
is contending that businesses who advertise to Minnesota residents on the
Internet, seeking business from all who view those advertisements, are subject
to Minnesota's consumer protection statutes.</P>
<P>Defendants also claim that the facts of this case are similar to a Minnesota
resident going to a library, seeing an advertisement for a business in an
out-of-state phone book and then calling that business for further information. 
This analogy is a gross understatement of defendants'  activities and, once
again, ignores the nature of their advertising contacts with Minnesota. 
Defendants have not placed their advertisements in a place, such as an
out-of-state phone book in a library, where advertisers would not reasonably
anticipate that a consumer would view it.  Defendants' conduct is much more
purposeful. Indeed each time a Minnesota computer user views defendants'
advertisements an electronic impulse is sent into Minnesota.  [cit. om.]  A more
accurate parallel to defendants' purposeful and continuous advertising conduct
would be the placement of an enormous billboard directly across the state's
borders.  Defendants' actions are also similar to the placing of an
advertisement in a nationally distributed magazine listing an 800 number for
consumers to call to receive further information, and then giving out
information to all consumers who call in, regardless of where the consumer
lives.  <U>See</U> <U>Classic Auto Sales</U>, 832 P.2d at 234 (upholding jurisdiction where
plaintiff saw advertisement and then called for more information).  ... 
Defendants, like advertisers in other media, place their advertisements where
Minnesota consumers are sure to read them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In one of the cases brought by the Minnesota Attorney General, the defendant responded to
the complaint by filing a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The Minnesota state
trial court denied the motion and upheld the arguments asserted by the Attorney General.  The
court noted that "[i]n matters of consumer protection, courts routinely hold that out of state
defendants soliciting in-state residents have purposely availed themselves of the privilege of
conducting business within the State. ... Here, Rogers and WagerNet maintain a Web-site which
can be accessed by any Internet user, and which logically appears to be maintained for the purpose
and in anticipation of being accessed and used by any and all Internet users, including Minnesota
residents.  This activity certainly arises to the type of promotional activity or active solicitation to
provide the minimum contacts necessary for exercising personal jurisdiction over non-residents."

Minnesota v. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc.</a>, No. C6-95-7227 (Minn. Dist. Ct., 2d Dist,
December, 1996).  The court also noted that the factors of
inconvenience, and whether the defendants could reasonably anticipate being sued in Minnesota,
weighed in favor of jurisdiction, because the defendants' Web site apparently contained a notice
that the defendants "can either sue you [their customers] in your State or Belize."  <U>Id.</U> 
The court thus held that the defendants were not in a position to assert that it was inconvenient or
unanticipated for them to be in court in Minnesota.  <U>Id.</U></P>
<P>The Illinois Attorney General apparently has brought a series of similar suits, and the Texas
Attorney General has expressed similar views regarding jurisdiction.  <U>See</U> <a

bulletin board service, by means of which he knowingly assisted persons in
playing and betting on card games located on that bulletin board service and
charged for the services used by the persons playing the game, would violate one
or more of the penal provisions of chapter 47, Penal Code.&quot;).</P>
<P>In contrast, the Florida Attorney General has concluded that regulation of
Internet activities is a matter for national or international authorities,
rather than a matter that states should address individually.  According to
Florida's Attorney General, &quot;any effort to regulate the use of the Internet
is better suited to federal regulation than to patchwork attention by the

ability of government to regulate gambling activities on the Internet and of law
enforcement to enforce such regulations. Thus, resolution of these matters must

Ct. 74 (1996).  The defendants in that case operated the
Amateur Action Computer Bulletin Board System from their home in California.  A
United States Postal Inspector located in Tennessee called the bulletin board,
registered under an assumed name, and viewed various graphics files.  The
defendants asserted that venue was improper in the Western District of Tennessee
because &quot;it was Dirmeyer, a government agent, who, without their knowledge,
accessed and downloaded the GIF files and caused them to enter Tennessee&quot;. 
<U>Id.</U> at 709.  The Sixth Circuit noted that &quot;'there is no constitutional
impediment to the government's power to prosecute pornography dealers in any
district into which the material is sent.'&quot;  <U>Id.</U>  The Court found that
pornography is a continuing offense &quot;'that occurs in every judicial
district which the material touches'  ... [and that] 'venue for federal
obscenity prosecutions lies &quot;in any district from, through, or into which&quot;
the allegedly obscene material moves.'&quot;  <U>Id.</U>  The Court also noted that
materials from the bulletin board system &quot;were distributed to an approved

the same material' ... [for] it is not unconstitutional to subject  interstate
distributors of obscenity to varying community standards.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at 711.</P>
<P>Another case finding jurisdiction based on electronic transmissions into a
state is <a
href="http://www.leepfrog.com/E-Law/Cases/Compuserve_v_Patterson.html">CompuServe, Inc.
v. Patterson</a>, 89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996).  In that
case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the
District Court and held that a shareware author who sold his shareware though
CompuServe's shareware registration system was subject to jurisdiction in Ohio. 
CompuServe sued Patterson in Ohio seeking a declaratory judgment that CompuServe
had not infringed Patterson's trademarks for certain computer software packages.
 Although Patterson never had set foot in Ohio and had sold his software to but
12 Ohio residents (for a total of less than $650), the Court found that
Patterson had purposefully availed himself of the privilege of doing business in
Ohio.  The Sixth Circuit relied on the Supreme Court's decision in World-Wide
Volkswagen for the proposition that &quot;the confluence of the 'increasing
nationalization of commerce' and 'modern transportation and communication,' [has
resulted in the] relaxation of the limits that the Due Process Clause imposes 
on courts' jurisdiction.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at 1262.  The Court found that there was &quot;no
question&quot; that Patterson had taken steps to create a connection with Ohio:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>He subscribed to CompuServe, and then he entered into the Shareware
Registration Agreement when he loaded his software onto the CompuServe system
for others to use and, perhaps, purchase.  Once Patterson had done those two
things, he was on notice that he had made contracts, to be governed by Ohio law,
with an Ohio-based company.  Then, he repeatedly sent his computer software, via
electronic links, to the CompuServe system in Ohio, and he advertised that
software on the CompuServe system.  Moreover, he initiated the events that led
to the filing of this suit by making demands of CompuServe via electronic and
regular mail messages.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Id.</U> at 1264.  The Court noted that &quot;[a]dmittedly, merely entering into
a contract with CompuServe would not, without more, establish that Patterson had
minimum contacts with Ohio.  [cit. om.]  By the same token, Patterson's
injection of his software product into the stream of commerce, without more,
would be at best a dubious ground for jurisdiction.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at 1265. 
Nevertheless, because Patterson had done both of these things and more, the
Court found that Patterson was subject to jurisdiction in Ohio.</P>
<P>In the context of World Wide Web sites, a District Court in New York applied
similar reasoning to hold an Italian company in contempt of court in the United
States.  In <a
href="http://zeus.bna.com/e-law/cases/playmen.html">Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Chuckleberry
Publishing, Inc.</a>, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8435, 39 U.S.P.Q.2d 1746 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), a
group of companies had been enjoined in 1981 from &quot;using 'PLAYBOY', 'PLAYMEN' or
any other word confusingly similar ... in connection with the sale, offering for sale or
distributing in the United States, importing into or exporting from the United
States, English language publications and related products.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at *4, 39
U.S.P.Q.2d at 1748.  The defendants had (in 1981) been distributing in the
United States a magazine called &quot;Playmen&quot;.  Playboy obtained an
injunction against the publication of the magazine in the United States and in
several other countries, but was unsuccessful in obtaining an injunction in
Italy.  The defendants thus continued to publish &quot;Playmen&quot; in Italy.</P>
<P>Around 1995, the defendants created a &quot;Playmen&quot; World Wide Web
site at http://www.playmen.it.  When Playboy discovered the site, it brought a
contempt proceeding.  The primary question before the court, in determining
whether the defendants were in contempt, was whether the defendants had used the
name &quot;PLAYMEN&quot; &quot;in connection with the sale, offering for sale or
distributing in the United States, importing into or exporting from the United
States, English language publications and related products.&quot;  The
defendants argued that they were</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>merely posting pictorial images on a computer server in Italy, rather than
distributing those images to anyone within the United States.  A computer
operator wishing to view these images must, in effect, transport himself to
Italy to view Tattilo's pictorial displays.  The use of the Internet is akin to
boarding a plane, landing in Italy, and purchasing a copy of PLAYMEN magazine,
an activity permitted under Italian law.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Id.</U> at *21, 39 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1752.  The Court, however, disagreed.  The
Court found that the</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Defendant has actively solicited United States customers to its Internet
site, and in doing so has distributed its product within the United States. 
When a potential subscriber faxes the required form to Tattilo, he receives back
via e-mail a password and user name.  By this process, Tattilo distributes its
product within the United States.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Id.</U> at *21-22, 39 U.S.P.Q.2d at 1752.  Recognizing the territorial limits of
its authority, the court held that the defendants could continue to maintain
their World Wide Web site, but the court prohibited the defendants from
accepting subscriptions from customers in the United States.</P>
<P>More troubling, however, is the court's expansion of its opinion in
connection with a motion for reconsideration.  <U>See</U> <U>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v.
Chuckleberry Publishing, Inc.</U>, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9865 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).  On
reconsideration, the court clarified its ruling with respect to the
non-subscription portion of the Playmen World Wide Web site--the portion that
could be visited without the defendants knowing the identities or locations of
the users viewing the site.  The court held that the fact that users &quot;pull&quot;
the images from a computer in Italy rather than having the transaction initiate
in Italy &quot;is irrelevant.  By inviting United States users to download these
images, Tattilo is causing and contributing to their distribution within the
United States.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at *9.  The Court thus required the defendants to
&quot;either shut down PLAYMEN Lite completely or prohibit United States users from
accessing the site in the future.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at *11.</P>
<P>Using similar reasoning, a District Court in Connecticut found that a
Massachusetts company was subject to jurisdiction in Connecticut based merely on
the Massachusetts company's use of an Internet domain and an 800 number that
were accessible from Connecticut.  <U>See</U> <a
href="http://www.leepfrog.com/E-Law/Cases/Inset_v_Instruction.html">Inset Systems, Inc. v.
Instruction Set, Inc.</a>, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7160 (D. Conn. April 17, 1996).  According to
the Court, &quot;[t]he Internet as well as toll-free numbers are designed to
communicate with people and their businesses in every state.  Advertisement on
the Internet can reach as many as 10,000 Internet users within Connecticut
alone.  Further, once posted on the Internet, unlike television and radio
advertising, the advertisement is available continuously to any Internet user.
[The defendant] has therefore, purposefully availed itself of the privilege of
doing business within Connecticut.   ... [S]ince [the defendant] purposefully
directed its advertising activities toward this state on a continuing basis
since March, 1995, it could reasonably anticipate the possibility of being
hailed into court here.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at *11.</P>
<P>Note that there was little if any discussion in the <U>Inset</U> case regarding
whether any users within Connecticut actually had accessed the defendant's
domain or called the defendant's 800 number.  There also was little if any
discussion of any allegation or evidence that the defendant in that case was
aware that individuals in Connecticut had accessed the domain or called the
number.  Thus, the exercise of jurisdiction in that case would seem to violate
the principle that one does not &quot;appoint the chattel his agent for service
of process&quot;, <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27444+u!2Es!2E+296!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27444+u!2Es!2E+296!27]/doc/{@298340}/hit_headings?">World-Wide
Volkswagen</a>, 444 U.S. at 296, for the foreseeability
that individuals in Connecticut &quot;could&quot; access the defendant's
Internet domain or call the 800 number forms an insufficient basis for the
assertion of jurisdiction.  &quot;'[F]oreseeability' alone has never been a
sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.&quot;  <U>Id.</U>
at 295.</P>
<P>With at least one exception, this issue is similar to the &quot;stream of
commerce&quot; issue on which the Supreme Court split in <U>Asahi Metal</U>.  The issue
in <U>Asahi Metal</U> was whether the foreign defendant could be subject to
jurisdiction in California because its goods made their way to California and
were used there.  The Supreme Court split in that case on the issue of whether &quot;[t]he
placement of a product into the stream of commerce, without more, is not an act
of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum State.&quot; <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+112!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+112!27]/doc/{@143536}/hit_headings?">480 U.S.
at 112</a>.  There is at least one way in which a Web site is &quot;in the stream of
commerce&quot; in a different way than a product that enters a state.  When a
product enters a state and a consumer uses it, the product has, in a sense, been
directed to the state, even if only by the stream of commerce.  When a Web site
is available on the Internet, it typically is not directed anywhere in
particular.  An Internet user typically needs to take affirmative steps to get
to the site, and often will understand that the server providing the Web site's
information is located elsewhere.  Finding a Web site with a search engine and
then viewing the site on the World Wide Web is like calling long distance
information to get a business' telephone number and then calling that number for
information about the business.  In both cases, the location of the caller may
not be known to the business providing the information, and the caller reached
out to the business' location more so than did the business reach out to the
caller's location.</P>
<P>One recent decision that recognizes these principles is <a
href="http://www.leepfrog.com/E-Law/Cases/Bensusan_v_King.html">Bensusan Restaurant
Corp. v. Richard B. King</a>, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13035 (S.D.N.Y. September 9,
1996).  In Bensusan, a jazz club named The Blue Note had set up a Web site
located on a computer server in Missouri.  The Web site listed a telephone
number that users could call to order tickets to attend shows at the club.  The
plaintiff owned a jazz club in New York which also was known as The Blue Note,
and the plaintiff had a federally registered trademark for &quot;The Blue Note&quot;.
 In assessing the defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the
Court noted that the plaintiff's &quot;primary argument in support of both
statutory bases for personal jurisdiction is that, because defendant's Web site
is accessible in New York, defendant could have foreseen that the site was able
to be viewed in New York and taken steps to restrict access to his site only to
users in a certain geographic region, presumably Missouri.  Regardless of the
technical feasibility of such a procedure [cit. om.], mere foreseeability of an
in-state consequence and a failure to avert that consequence is not sufficient
to establish personal jurisdiction.&quot;  <U>Id.</U> at *14.  The Court carefully
analyzed the facts, and noted that</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It takes several affirmative steps by the New York resident, however, to
obtain access to the Web site and utilize the information there.  First, the New
York resident has to access the Web site using his or her computer hardware and
software. [cit. om.] Then, if the user wished to attend a show in defendant's
club, he or she would have to telephone the box office in Missouri and reserve
tickets.  Finally, that user would need to pick up the tickets in Missouri
because King does not mail or otherwise transmit tickets to the user.  Even
assuming that the user was confused about the relationship of the Missouri club
to the one in New York, such an act of infringement would have occurred in
Missouri, not New York.  The mere fact that a person can gain information on the
allegedly infringing product is not the equivalent of a person advertising,
promoting, selling or otherwise making an effort to target its product in New
York. [cit. om.] Here, there is simply no allegation or proof that any
infringing goods were shipped into New York or that any other infringing
activity was directed at New York or caused by King to occur here.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Id.</U> at *10-11.  Thus, the Court also concluded that the defendant had</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>done nothing to purposefully avail himself of the benefits of New York. 
King, like numerous others, simply created a Web site and permitted anyone who
could find it to access it.  Creating a site, like placing a product into the
stream of commerce, may be felt nationwide -- or even worldwide -- but, without
more, it is not an act purposefully directed toward the forum state. <U>See</U> <a
href="http://www.nfoweb.com/folio.pgi/ussc-1/query=[field+citation!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+112!27]+or+[field+pages!3A!27480+u!2Es!2E+112!27]/doc/{@143536}/hit_headings?">Asahi
Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court</a>, 480 U.S. 102, 112, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 1032, 94
L.Ed.2d 92 (1991) (plurality opinion).  There are no allegations that King
actively sought to encourage New Yorkers to access his site, or that he
conducted any business -- let alone a continuous and systematic part of its
business -- in New York.  There is in fact no suggestion that King has any
presence of any kind in New York other than the Web site that can be accessed
worldwide.  Bensusan's argument that King should have foreseen that users could
access the site in New York and be confused as to the relationship of the two
Blue Note clubs is insufficient to satisfy due process.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><U>Id.</U> at *16<a name="TEXT3">.</a><a href="#FN3">(3)</a></P>
<P>Note the implications of a contrary ruling such as <U>Inset</U> or those sought by
the Minnesota Attorney General.  If the mere presence of a Web site subjects the
owner of the site to jurisdiction anywhere the site can be accessed, then the
same argument will apply to foreign jurisdiction as well.  Thus, every
individual and company outside the United States suddenly would be subject to
jurisdiction in every state in the United States if the individual or company
has a Web site<a name="TEXT4"),</a><a href="#FN4">(4)</a> and likewise every individual
and company in the United
States would be subject to jurisdiction in numerous foreign countries if the
individual or company has a Web site.  While this hardly makes sense, it follows
closely from holdings, such as that in <U>Inset</U>, that the accessability of a Web
site from within a jurisdiction equates to &quot;purposeful availment&quot; of
the privilege of doing business within the jurisdiction such that Web site owner
should &quot;reasonably anticipate the possibility of being hailed into court&quot;
there.  <U>Inset Systems</U>, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7160, *11. </P>
<P>As a final note, it is important to recognize that the FTC, DOT, and other
federal agencies also exercise jurisdiction over commerce on the Internet.  For
information about the FTC's recent action against a company alleged to be
conducting a pyramid scheme through a World Wide Web site, see <a

<H2>V. Conclusion</H2>
<P>As the Sixth Circuit noted in CompuServe, the judicial trend has been to
relax jurisdiction requirements in connection with the globalization of our
economy.  The Internet is, perhaps, the epitome of that globalization.  Yet with
that globalization comes the obliteration of traditional physical jurisdiction
boundaries, and the minimization of the effort, or purposeful availment, that
formerly was necessary to do business in a foreign jurisdiction (and to assert
personal jurisdiction over one doing such business).  On the Internet, &quot;[m]essages
can be transmitted from any physical location to any other location without
degradation, decay, or substantial delay, and without any physical cues or
barriers that might otherwise keep certain geographically remote places and
people separate from one another.&quot; <a href="http://www.cli.org/X0025_LBFIN.html">Rise
of Law In Cyberspace</a>, ___ Stanford
Law Review at ___.  It also frequently is true that, as popularized in a New
Yorker cartoon, &quot;on the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog&quot; (i.e.,
sellers often will not know the identity or location of buyers).</P>
<P>The trend toward relaxing jurisdiction requirements seems to have manifested
itself in many of the recent decisions that have addressed jurisdiction in the
context of electronic transmissions.  While the analogy between electronic mail
sent to a known recipient and regular mail sent to a known recipient is,
perhaps, justifiable, Usenet posts and World Wide Web transactions--entered into
with individuals whose identities and locations are unknown--make for difficult
analogies.  Perhaps the closest analogy is the United States Supreme Court's
plurality decision in <U>Asahi Metal</U> relating to stream of commerce jurisdiction. 
Because that was a plurality decision, however, its lessons are, in the words of
the Sixth Circuit, somewhat &quot;dubious&quot;--particularly given the
differences between a Web site that a user must seek out and &quot;bring&quot;
to their jurisdiction, and a physical product that may come to an individual's
attention after it already is within the individual's jurisdiction</P>
<P>Until the law in this area becomes more clear, there are at least some
lessons we can learn from the cases that have been decided thus far.  For
instance, the Sixth Circuit in CompuServe emphasized the importance of the
contracts into which Patterson had entered and the fact that the contracts
stated they were entered into in Ohio and were governed by Ohio law.  Similarly, the Minnesota
court in <a
href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/consumer/news/OnlineScams/ggOrder.html">State v. Granite
Gate Resorts</a> emphasized the fact that the defendant's Web site
warned users they could be sued in their home state.  Thus, if
one is concerned about jurisdiction in connection with commercial transactions,
it may be advisable to create on-line agreements that govern those transactions
and to specify the jurisdiction in which any disputes will be litigated and
the law that will be applied.  It probably also is advisable to require users to
manifest their assent to such agreements before they enter into any transactions
(in order to help avoid &quot;shrink wrap&quot;-type arguments that the
agreements are unenforceable).  In addition, if jurisdiction is a concern,
consider what portions of a transaction need to be conducted with knowledge of a
user's address.  Once you have valid credit card information, not only is it
easier and cheaper to send that software to JohnDoe@CompuServe.com (that is, 
easier and cheaper than mailing the software to John Doe's physical address),
but it also is less jurisdictionally risky.  Finally, there may be some
jurisdictions in which you will not want to do business at all.  The Thomases,
for instance, thus far have learned the hard way that their amateur action
graphics files were not welcome by the authorities in Tennessee.  If the nature
of your business requires that users be a certain age or if your business is
banned or regulated in certain areas (for example, gambling), then it may become
necessary to identify all users before they can be permitted to engage in
transactions, and to prohibit transactions with certain users and in certain
jurisdictions.</P>

Based on these decisions, the Court concludes that Missouri's long-arm statute

activities have produced an effect in Missouri as they have allegedly caused
Maritz economic injury. ...  Clearly, CyberGold has obtained the website for the

maintaining a 'passive website,' its intent is to reach all internet users,
regardless of geographic location. ...  Through its website, CyberGold has
consciously decided to transmit advertising information to all internet users,

<H1>Technology Stock Values</H1>
<H2>Kenneth R. Hannahs, Jr.</H2><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
As the values of some technology stocks fell sharply in January 1996, the long awaited technology correction appeared to have arrived.  Notwithstanding the recent stabilization of technology stock values, many once solid companies such as Apple Computer now seem close to becoming insignificant, at best, and extinct, at worst.  Increasingly, these companies as well as thriving companies such as Microsoft have focused on Internet related products to ensure financial success in the future.  This trend is founded on the dramatic growth of the World Wide Web and the increasingly wide acceptance of the Web's point and click graphical user interface.
<P>
In Georgia, the announcements of the sales of hi-tech companies and proposed ventures between these companies were common.
<P>
Two Atlanta based companies, American Software Inc. and Intellimedia Sports, Inc. formed a venture to provide Internet services.  The company will be known as Intellimedia Commerce and will be headed up by President and CEO Ben Dyer, who is currently chairman and CEO of Intellimedia Sports.  Cox Enterprises will also own an interest in the new venture.
<P>
Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc., one of the largest producers of modems, is seeking approval in its Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceeding for the sale of 49% of the company to Northern Telecom and ACMA of Singapore.  Other prospective purchasers of Hayes are US Robotics, Inc. and Diamond Multimedia Systems, Inc.
<P>
Servantis Systems, Inc. was sold for approximately $170 million in cash and stock to Checkfree Corp. of Columbus, Ohio.  Both companies have either developed of are developing products for use on the Internet.  Checkfree's expertise is the electronic processing of transactions over the Internet, while Servantis produces banking software and is reported to be developingInternet related products.  The fate of Servantis' management and five hundred employees is not currently known.  
<P>
Dun & Bradstreet Software, Inc. was put up for sale by its parent Dun & Bradstreet Corp. on January 10, 1996.  Dun & Bradstreet Corp. purchased DBS in 1990 for $330 million.
<P>
Atlanta based Five Paces Software, Inc. and SecureWare, Inc. supplied an authentication and encryption security platform package used by Security First Network Bank.  SFNB is the world's first "Virtual Bank" in which all services are provided on line.  Information concerning the services of SFNB may be found on SFNB's home page at <A HREF="http://www.sfnb.com">http://www.sfnb.com</A>.

<P>Several initial public offerings of Atlanta based hi-tech companies occurred in the second half of 1995.  For example, A.D.A.M. Software, Inc. a developer of educational multimedia software products that provide anatomical, medical, scientific and health-related information for academic, professional and consumer markets went public in November, 1995;  Harbinger Corp., a developer of electronic commerce software went public in August, 1995; and IMNET Systems, Inc., a developer of information and document management systems went public in July, 1995.  
<P>
Illustrative of the changes taking place among some of the world's largest hi-tech companies, recent editions of the Wall Street Journal and other national publications disclosed the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Potential Sale of Apple Computer Company</STRONG>.  Stung by weak fourth quarter performance, Apple's board of directors is negotiating with Sun Microsystems, Inc. Sun made an initial offer to purchase Apple's stock at a price equal to $23.00 per share.  Apple's financial troubles are generally blamed on Apple's failure to license the right to build Mac clones in the 1980's.  During this time, large numbers of IBM PC clones were being manufactured.  As a result, Apple's market share deteriorated despite the fact that the sales of its Mac personal computers have actually increased. Some analysts believe that Sun's expertise in the advanced business and academic settings and Apple's expertise in the personal computing market would make a good fit.  Earlier in 1995, Apple rejected overtures made by IBM for close to $40.00 per share.  However, reports indicate that Apple may again be seeking out IBM as a possible purchaser.  Apple's shares were trading for $30.625 on Friday, January 26, 1996.
<P>
Another area of synergy between Apple and Sun noted by analysts is the development of products for the Internet by both companies.  For example, Sun unveiled a prototype of a cheap desk top computer that uses Sun's Java networking language to browse the Internet(See PC junior, below).  The Java computer language, once fully developed, will permit any program written in Java to run on any operating system.  As a result, the "stranglehold" currently held by PCs running Windows software may be loosened.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>PC Juniors</STRONG>.  The $500 Internet browser is an active subject of discussion in financial and trade periodicals.  These "pc juniors" would contain minimal or no hard disk memory and may be hooked directly to a consumer's television sets. Oracle Corp. has indicated that its machine will cost approximately $500.  Sun's proposed system would be a streamlined version of today's PCs and would include a 110 megahertz chip and other circuitry in a 5x9x2 inch box, with minimal memory.  Sun has not committed to introducing this package.  The slower thanexpected sales growth of  personal computers in the fourth quarter 1995 (25% v. 20%) indicates that the population at large is either unwilling or unable to buy a $2,500 system.  The newer systems, which may operate without keyboards, would perform basic functions using a point and click interface directly on an individual's television set. Some analysts believe that once the $500 threshold is passed, wide scale public acceptance will occur thereby further fueling the use of the World Wide Web.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Miscellaneous</STRONG>.  MCI and Microsoft have agreed to form a partnership to sell each other's products worldwide.  The agreement will be non-exclusive and took place after talks between Microsoft and AT&T stalled.  The Wall Street Journal reported the imminent sale of the WordPerfect Corp. subsidiary of Novell Inc. to Corel Corp. for $50,000,000.  WordPerfect's sharp declines in sales can be attributed in part to the increase in sales of Microsoft Word.  Microsoft and NBC announced the formation of MSNBC, which will combine the expertise of the two companies in the area of the internet (Microsoft Network) and in television broadcasting (NBC Network).  The proposed transaction between Microsoft and Intuit (the maker of the popular Quicken personal finance personal software) failed as the result of anti-trust concerns.

<HR>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Compliance with the Revisions to U.S. Export Control
Regulations</H1>
<H6 ALIGN="CENTER">This article originally appeared in the November 1996 issue
of <EM>Legal Trends Advisory for Corporate Leaders</EM>. Reproduced by
permission.</H6>
<HR>
<P>The agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (&quot;GATT&quot;) and the North American Free Trade Agreement
(&quot;NAFTA&quot;) have raised expectations for the expansion of export
opportunities for U.S. industries. Companies that are currently exporting or are
planning to take advantage of new export opportunities, however, should ensure
that they comply with U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the
revised Export Administration Regulations (&quot;EAR&quot;) recently promulgated
by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The EAR applies to virtually all exports,
reexports (i.e., shipments between foreign countries of U.S.-origin goods or
technology), and other transactions involving U.S. goods, software, technology,
and certain services. Violations of the EAR can result in substantial civil and
criminal penalties.</P>
<P>On March 25, 1996, the Bureau of Export Administration (&quot;BXA&quot;) of
the U.S. Department of Commerce issued an interim rule simplifying the EAR. 61
Fed. Reg. 12,714 (Mar. 25, 1996). The new interim rule is intended to clarify
the language of the EAR, simplify its application, and generally make the export
control regulatory regime more user-friendly. Final regulations will be issued
after consideration of public comments on the interim rule, although the interim
rule will be effective while BXA considers any appropriate amendments.</P>
<P>The new rule simplifies BXA's export control regime by establishing a
presumption that exports or reexports are authorized unless the EAR expressly
prohibits such transactions without a license. Under the EAR, exporters and
reexporters are only required to obtain a license if one of the ten General
Prohibitions applies and no License Exception is available.</P>
<P>Companies that are exporting or reexporting any goods, software, technology,
or services should carefully evaluate whether any obligations under the EAR
apply to their transactions. The EAR, however, is generally intended to control
exports and reexports to certain countries that pose national security or
foreign policy concerns. The items controlled under the EAR generally include
advanced goods, software, and technology that could be used for military or
intelligence-gathering uses (especially relating to nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons and missile technology). Only a relatively small number of
exports and reexports subject to the EAR require an application to BXA for a
license. Items that are not listed in the EAR's Commodity Control List (&quot;CCL&quot;)
do not require a license, and some items on the CCL require a license only to a
limited number of destinations. License Exceptions may apply to other
transactions.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the limited scope of export or reexport transactions that
may require a license, virtually all exports or reexports involving U.S. goods,
software, or technology are covered by the EAR. Accordingly, companies should
develop an internal checklist or export compliance program (discussed below) to
enable company personnel to identify efficiently whether a more comprehensive
analysis of the EAR's application to a particular transaction may be needed. For
example, if an exporter or reexporter answers &quot;no&quot; to the following
questions, it likely does not need a license for the transaction and is only
obligated to comply with certain documentation requirements under the EAR.</P>
<P>(1) Could the item be used for military or intelligence-gathering purposes,
including goods, software, or technology in the electronic, computer,
telecommunications, or other high-tech industries?</P>
<P>(2) Is the country of ultimate destination in the Middle East, Far East, or
former Soviet Union?</P>
<P>(3) Is the ultimate end-user using the item for military,
intelligence-gathering, or other uses that may be adverse to the national
security or foreign policy interests of the United States?</P>
<P>If the &quot;no&quot; answers to the above questions are not absolutely
certain, the exporter or reexporter should analyze its transaction under the EAR
in more detail.</P>
<P>The EAR describes four questions that exporters and reexporters should
address in determining their obligations under the EAR: (1) whether an item or
transaction is subject to the EAR, (2) whether a General Prohibition applies,
(3) whether a License Exception applies, and (4) whether other documentation and
reporting requirements are applicable. </P>
<H3>ITEMS AND TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO THE EAR</H3>
<P>The EAR covers the following items:</P>
<UL>
<LI> All items in the United States, including items in a U.S. foreign trade
zone or moving in-transit through the United States from one foreign country to
another;
</LI>
<LI> All U.S. origin items wherever located;
</LI>
<LI> U.S. origin parts, components, materials, or other goods incorporated
abroad into foreign-made products; U.S. origin software commingled with foreign
software; and U.S. origin technology commingled with foreign technology in
quantities above de minimis levels;
</LI>
<LI> Certain foreign-made products of U.S. origin technology or software; and
</LI>
<LI> Certain goods produced by any plant or major component of a plant located
outside the United States that is directly produced using U.S.-origin technology
or software.
</LI></UL>
<P>The EAR covers the following types of transactions:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Traditional exports;
</LI>
<LI> Reexports;
</LI>
<LI> Foreign products -- exports of technology from the United States that may
be subject to assurances that the direct product of the technology will not be
exported to certain destinations;
</LI>
<LI> Non-traditional exports -- examples include release of technology to a
foreign national in the United States through demonstration or oral briefing;
return of foreign equipment to its country of origin after repair; shipments
from a U.S. foreign trade zone; and electronic transmission of non-public data
received abroad; and
</LI>
<LI> U.S. persons' activities -- the provision of services or support by U.S.
persons anywhere in the world for transactions relating to nuclear, chemical, or
biological weapons technology.
</LI></UL>
<P>The EAR also enumerates items and transactions that are not subject to the
EAR. If an item is not subject to the EAR, the exporter or reexporter is not
subject to any obligations under the EAR.</P>
<P>Transactions not subject to the EAR include (1) exports under the exclusive
jurisdiction of another federal agency, (2) exports of &quot;publicly available&quot;
software and technology (as defined under the EAR), and (3) certain reexports of
items shipped from one foreign country to another.</P>
<H3>GENERAL PROHIBITIONS AND LICENSE EXCEPTIONS</H3>
<P>If an export or reexport is subject to the EAR, the exporter or reexporter
must determine whether one of the ten enumerated General Prohibitions applies.
The General Prohibitions include, inter alia, prohibitions on (1) exports and
reexports based on CCL classification and designated end-use, end-user, or
country of destination; (2) transactions involving parties that have been denied
export privileges by BXA; (3) exports, reexports, and other transactions
involving embargoed countries (Boznia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
Libya, North Korea, Rwanda, and Serbia and Montenegro); and (4) unloading and
shipping certain items in-transit to specified countries.</P>
<P>If a General Prohibition applies, the EAR provides a number of License
Exceptions that exempt exporters and reexporters from licensing requirements,
although certain conditions and documentation requirements may still apply. If a
License Exception does not apply, an exporter or reexporter is obligated to
obtain an export license from BXA or to refrain from making the export,
reexport, or other transaction. If a General Prohibition does not apply, an
exporter or reexporter is only obligated to comply with certain documentation
requirements. </P>
<H3>PENALTIES</H3>
<P>Violations of the EAR include engaging in prohibited conduct under the EAR
or otherwise aiding, attempting, conspiring, or acting with knowledge of a
violation. BXA may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each
violation (not to exceed $100,000 for each violation involving national security
controls) and restrict the ability of named persons to engage in designated
export or reexport transactions.  With respect to criminal penalties, anyone
knowingly violating or conspiring to or attempting to violate the EAR or any
order or license issued thereunder may be fined not more than five times the
value of the exports involved or $50,000, whichever is greater, or imprisoned
not more than five years, or both. For exports controlled for foreign policy
purposes or knowingly used for military or intelligence gathering purposes,
firms may be fined not more than five times the value of the export involved or
$1,000,000, whichever is greater. An individual may be fined not more than
$250,000 or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.</P>
<H3>EXPORT COMPLIANCE PROGRAM</H3>
<P>The most effective method for companies to mitigate potential civil or
criminal penalties under the EAR for inadvertent violations is to establish an
internal export compliance program (&quot;ECP&quot;). ECPs are intended to
monitor and maintain compliance with laws and regulations governing the export,
reexport, and transfer of goods, software, technology, and services originating
in the United States or involving U.S. entities. ECPs generally consist of
written internal procedures administered by a company to provide checks and
safeguards at key steps in the order processing system to ensure compliance with
the U.S. export control laws and regulations. The EAR specifies that voluntary
disclosure of potential violations is a mitigating factor in determining what
administrative sanctions, if any, will be sought, and the establishment of an
ECP is recognized as a mitigating factor under the Federal Corporate Sentencing
Guidelines of 1991.</P>
<P>Whatever the level of a company's international trading activity, the
implementation of an ECP is highly recommended. An effective ECP benefits a
company by (1) providing for the early identification and prevention of
potential export control violations; (2) acting as a mitigating factor in civil
and criminal cases for inadvertent violations of the EAR; (3) facilitating
adherence to new Customs Service standards of &quot;informed compliance&quot;
and &quot;reasonable care&quot;; and (4) restricting the potential subjects of
administrative proceedings to isolated individuals, departments, or
subsidiaries, rather than the entire company. </P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Country-Of-Origin Determinations Under NAFTA </H1>
<H6 ALIGN="CENTER">This article originally appeared in the November 1996 issue
of <EM>Legal Trends Advisory for Corporate Leaders</EM>. Reproduced by
permission.</H6>
<HR>
<P>Imagine that you are a manufacturer with facilities in the United States,
Mexico, and France.  Some of the products you sell in the United States are
processed in Mexico using ingredients or components produced in France.  Other
products you sell in the United States are processed in both Mexico and the
United States prior to sale.  What rate of duty applies to the merchandise
imported into the United States?  Do the products need to be labeled to indicate
their country of origin?  If so, what is the country of origin?  The answers to
these questions depend on an analysis of how the imported  merchandise is
produced and the location of the manufacturing operations, based on rules
promulgated by the U.S. Customs Service.</P>
<P>Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (&quot;NAFTA&quot;), tariff
duties have been eliminated (or are being phased out) on products imported from
Canada and Mexico.  Imported merchandise originating in a NAFTA country is
either duty-free or subject to lower duties than products imported from
non-NAFTA countries.  Therefore, if the country of origin of merchandise
imported into the United States from a NAFTA country is determined to be a NAFTA
country, a preferential duty rate can result in substantial savings to the
importer.  Moreover, because U.S. customs law requires articles of foreign
origin to be labeled to indicate their country of origin, the origin of all
merchandise imported into the United States must be ascertained to enable
importers to comply with country-of-origin marking requirements.</P>
<P>On September 5, 1995, Customs published its final rules for determining
whether an imported product is subject to preferential duty treatment under
NAFTA.   These rules, called the Origin Rules, became effective October 1, 1995.
 On June 6, 1996, Customs published its final rules for determining the
country-of-origin marking requirements for imports into the United States (other
than textile and apparel products) from Canada or Mexico.  These rules, called
the Marking Rules, became effective August 5, 1996.  Both the NAFTA Origin Rules
and the NAFTA Marking Rules fundamentally alter the analysis used to determine
the country of origin, and, consequently, the tariff rates and marking
requirements for imports into the United States from Canada and Mexico.</P>
<P>For non-NAFTA trade, Customs generally determines a product's country of
origin based on the location where the product was wholly obtained or produced
or the country of the last &quot;substantial transformation&quot; of the
product.  The country in which the last substantial transformation occurred is
usually the country in which the product assumed its final and distinctive
identity prior to importation.  A substantial transformation generally occurs
when processing results in a &quot;new and different article&quot; having a &quot;new
name, character, and use.&quot;  For example, Customs has ruled that the
assembly of semiconductors into integrated circuits constitutes a substantial
transformation.</P>
<P>To determine origin for purposes of NAFTA, however, the United States,
Canada, and Mexico rejected the substantial transformation standard and adopted
a tariff-shift approach.  For NAFTA origin determinations, therefore, Customs
generally determines that a product originated in a NAFTA country if the product
was wholly grown or manufactured in that country using domestic materials, or if
processing in that country resulted in a change in the product's Harmonized
Tariff System classification at the six-digit level.  For some products, the
value of the NAFTA-origin ingredients or components must reach a certain
percentage of the product's total value for the product to be considered a
product of a NAFTA country.  For example, passenger cars must have a &quot;regional
value content&quot; of at least 50 percent to be considered NAFTA-origin
merchandise.  For products subject to the tariff-shift analysis, Customs no
longer attempts to determine whether a &quot;substantial transformation&quot;
has occurred, but instead bases its origin determination for NAFTA solely on
whether processing in a NAFTA country has resulted in a change in tariff
classification.  Nevertheless, in most cases, a substantial transformation is
sufficient to change the tariff classification of a product.  </P>
<P>Some of the NAFTA tariff-shift provisions in the Marking Rules also have
local content requirements.  For example, a change of origin can occur as a
result of blending certain imported bulk pharmaceuticals with NAFTA-origin
pharmaceuticals if at least 40 percent, by weight, of the total active
ingredients in the finished product are NAFTA-origin.  The importer must make
this determination on a product-by-product basis, applying the applicable
tariff-shift provisions.</P>
<P>To answer the questions posed at the beginning of this article, an importer
would ordinarily need to determine the tariff classification of (1) the
merchandise imported into Mexico from France and (2) the merchandise imported
into the United States from Mexico.  Using this information, the importer would
then review Customs' tariff-shift tables to determine whether the necessary
tariff shift occurred to change the country of origin of the merchandise.  As
noted above, different tariff-shift rules apply to determine origin for
preferential duty and marking purposes.</P>
<P>In general, if processing in Mexico resulted in a change in tariff
classification under the NAFTA Origin Rules, the product would become Mexican
origin.  The product would then be subject to the preferential NAFTA duty rate
upon importation into the United States.  If processing in Mexico also resulted
in a change in tariff classification under the NAFTA Marking Rules, the product
would need to be marked &quot;Made in Mexico&quot; in a manner conspicuous to
the ultimate U.S. purchaser of the product.  If no tariff shift occurred in
Mexico under either the Origin Rules or the Marking Rules, the product would be
considered French origin and therefore not subject to the preferential NAFTA
duty rate.  It would also need to be marked &quot;Made in France.&quot;  In
either case, if a tariff shift based on the Marking Rules occurred in the United
States prior to sale to the ultimate purchaser, the product would be considered
U.S. origin and no country-of-origin marking would be required.</P>
<P>On July 8, 1996, in <I>CPC International, Inc. v. United States</I>, the
U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled that the NAFTA Marking Rules were
contrary to law.  The CIT held that Customs must continue to apply the
substantial transformation standard in determining origin for marking purposes. 
Customs has appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit and intends to continue applying the Marking Rules pending a decision by
the Court of Appeals.  Pending this appeal, importers who object to the NAFTA
Marking Rules and would prefer application of the substantial transformation
standard for determining marking requirements should seek a ruling from Customs,
and, if the ruling is adverse, file suit in the CIT seeking to have the holding
of <I>CPC International </I>applied in their case.</P>

<p>
The U.S. antidumping statute provides U.S. producers of manufactured goods and agricultural
products a tariff remedy against economically injurious imports that are sold at "less than fair
value" (dumped).  The Uruguay Round Agreements Act, effective January 1, 1995, significantly
changed the statute to implement the requirements of the international Antidumping Agreement
that was negotiated during the Uruguay Round.  These GATT negotiations sparked considerable
controversy between countries, like the United States, that wanted to retain effective remedies
against unfairly traded imports and other countries whose economies are highly dependent upon
exports and wanted to weaken these remedies.  The Uruguay Round did result in a number of
changes to the GATT Antidumping Agreement and to the U.S. laws implementing the
Agreement.  Perhaps the most significant change is the incorporation of a five-year "sunset"
requirement for antidumping orders.  Even with these changes, the antidumping law remains an
effective measure to counter unfairly priced imports.<p>

The antidumping law can provide a U.S. industry significant relief against unfairly priced
imports, as demonstrated by the successful experience of the cement industry (described below). 
Successful cases have been brought on behalf of a wide variety of industries, including those
engaged in producing basic industrial goods, agricultural products, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, advanced technology products, and consumer goods.  <p>

If import prices and volume are adversely affecting a domestic producer's profitability, it may be
time for that company to consider whether to seek a trade remedy from the U.S. Government. 
The antidumping duty law usually provides more effective relief than other available remedies
against imports.  Unlike other forms of trade relief, such as an "escape clause" action under
section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, the decision whether to grant a tariff remedy under these
laws is not subject to White House discretion, but is based on the application of legal standards
by administrative agencies that are subject to review by the courts.  In addition, the standards for
obtaining relief are less rigorous than under section 201 and other forms of trade relief.  Finally,
the antidumping law responds directly to the situation most commonly faced by companies
concerned about import competition--sales of imports at unfair prices in the United States.  <p>

For an importer or foreign producer, imposition of antidumping duties can greatly increase the
cost of doing business in the United States or make it uneconomical to continue importing into
this country.  Any company importing significant quantities of a product that competes with
U.S.-produced goods should be aware of the risk that it may have to defend against an
antidumping action and should consider reviewing its business practices either to make such an
action less likely or to prepare possible defenses.<p>

Dumping is essentially price discrimination between purchasers in different national markets. 
Under U.S. law, dumping is defined as selling a product in the United States at less than its
"normal value," which is usually the price at which the foreign exporter sells the product in its
home market.  Additional duties are assessed to offset the amount by which the normal value
exceeds the price in the United States.<p>

These laws are administered by the International Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of
Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC"), an independent federal
agency.  Commerce is charged with determining whether imports of a product are dumped.  The
ITC determines whether the imports are materially injuring or threatening to materially injure a
domestic industry.  Congress and the White House have no role in the determinations.<p>

Antidumping investigations seek to remedy, not punish, foreign unfair trading practices.  If an
action is successful, it does not lead to an award of damages to the domestic producer.  Rather,
the U.S. Government will collect additional duties to remedy the unfair practice.  The additional
tariffs will only be imposed prospectively, and thus will not affect imports on which the Customs
Service has finally assessed the duties owed by the importer.<p>

<h4>Antidumping Investigations</h4>
Antidumping investigations are initiated by a petition filed by a U.S. producer, a trade
association, or an ad hoc coalition of producers representative of the industry producing the
product that is the subject of the petition.  Commerce decides whether to initiate an investigation
based on the sufficiency of the information in the petition.  Before initiating an investigation,
Commerce must determine that  the domestic producers supporting the petition account for at
least 25 percent of total U.S. production of the affected product and more than 50 percent of
production by those companies expressing a position on the petition.  <p>

In the course of the investigation at both Commerce and the ITC, the parties are given the
opportunity to present evidence, file briefs, and appear at hearings.  The ITC first makes a
preliminary determination whether there is a "reasonable indication" that the domestic industry is
materially injured or threatened with material injury by the allegedly dumped or subsidized
imports.  Because the "reasonable indication" standard is relatively easy to satisfy, few
investigations are terminated at this preliminary stage.<p>

If the ITC finds a reasonable indication of injury, Commerce then makes a preliminary
determination whether there is a "reasonable basis to believe" that imports are sold at less than
fair value.  If the determination is affirmative, Commerce will require importers of the affected
goods to post bonds or make cash deposits with the U.S. Customs Service in the amount of the
estimated dumping margin.  Commerce then "verifies" the data provided by the foreign exporter
by reviewing its books and records and issues a final determination of the margin.  A negative
final determination by Commerce terminates the investigation, at which time all bonds or cash
deposits posted by importers are released or refunded..  <p>

If Commerce's final determination is affirmative, the ITC will make a final injury determination. 
If the ITC determines that the imports are causing or threatening material injury to the domestic
industry, Commerce will issue an antidumping order directing the Customs Service to collect
cash deposits from importers on future customs entries of the product under investigation in the
amount of the final margins.  A negative ITC determination terminates the investigation,
resulting in the release or refund of all bonds and cash deposits.<p>

Cash deposits are payable upon the entry into the United States of merchandise covered by an
antidumping order.  All duties and cash deposits are the responsibility of the importer, and the
law forbids the foreign producer or exporter to reimburse the importer.<p>

The agencies' determinations must be made within strict statutory deadlines.  The schedule of a
typical antidumping case is as follows: <p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Day 20</dt>
<dd><i>Commerce initiates investigation</i></dd>
<dt>Day 45</dt>
<dd><i>ITC issues preliminary injury determination</i></dd>
<dt>Day 160</dt>
<dd><i>Commerce issues preliminary dumping determination</i></dd>
<dt>Day 235</dt>
<dd><i>Commerce issues final dumping determination</i></dd>
<dt>Day 280</dt>
<dd><i>ITC issues final injury determination</i></dd>
<dt>Day 287</dt>
<dd><i>Commerce publishes antidumping order</dd>
</i></dl>
<p>
Commerce bases its determination of whether imports are dumped primarily on price and cost
information submitted by the foreign exporters in response to questionnaires from Commerce. 
This information usually covers sales in the six-month period ending with the last day of the
month in which the petition is filed.  Commerce compares the U.S. price of the imports to their
"normal value," which is usually the price of the same or most similar product in the home
market.  Commerce will disregard home market sales that are at prices below the cost of
production or that are outside the ordinary course of trade.  Because goods sold in the foreign
market and in the United States may differ in physical characteristics, quantities, the level of
trade at which they are sold, selling costs, transportation costs, and other circumstances of sale,
Commerce makes adjustments to the gross price in each market to arrive at "ex-factory" prices. 
The difference between the ex-factory price for sales in the home market and the ex-factory price
for U.S. sales determines the dumping margin.  Thus, if the ex-factory price of a product sold in
the home market is $1.00 and the ex-factory price of the identical product sold in the United
States is $.80, the dumping margin calculation is as follows:<p>

<p>

1.00-.80/.80 =  .20/.80  =  25%<p>

<p>

If there is an insufficient quantity of home market sales to allow a comparison with the U.S.
price, Commerce will compare U.S. price either to the ex-factory price for sales to a third
country or to the "constructed value" of the merchandise, which is calculated as the sum of the
cost of production (including the cost of materials, direct labor, and general, selling, and
administrative expenses), profit, and packing cost.  <p>

Dumping margins are normally based on a comparison of the foreign producer's weighted
average price for sales in the United States to the weighted average price of its sales in the home
market (or third country market) or the constructed value.  The margins may also be based on a
comparison of prices of individual transactions in the two markets.  Margins are calculated on a
company-by-company basis for foreign exporters that participated in the investigation.  Other
exporters from the same country are subject to an "all others" margin that is based on the
weighted average of the margins for all companies that participated in the investigation.    <p>

The ITC gathers information for its injury determination from questionnaire responses by
domestic producers, purchasers, and importers and from other information obtained from the
parties to the investigation or from public sources.  In determining whether imports are injuring
the domestic industry, the ITC examines the volume of imports, the imports' market share, and
the effect of imports on the domestic industry's pricing, production, capacity utilization, sales,
market share, profit, and employment.  The ITC may consider the combined or "cumulated"
effects of imports from more than one country.  <p>

To determine that dumped or subsidized imports threaten material injury to the industry, the ITC
must find that the threatened injury is "real and imminent."  In assessing threat of injury, the ITC
considers whether the volume of imports and their share of the U.S. market are rapidly
increasing, the likelihood that increasing imports will depress U.S. prices, and the existence of
unused foreign production capacity that could lead to increased exports to the United States.<p>

Agency determinations in antidumping cases involving imports from countries other than
Canada and Mexico are reviewable by the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court. 
The court may not second-guess the issues determined by an agency, but may only review
whether the agency has complied with legal standards and has based its decision on the evidence
in the agency's record.  Cases involving imports from Canada and Mexico may be appealed to
binational review panels established under dispute resolution provisions of the North American
Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA").  NAFTA panels have five members, selected from the
importing country and the exporting country.  NAFTA panels are required to apply the same
laws and the same standards for judicial review that would apply if the appeal were taken to a
court in the importing country.  Thus, U.S. law governs appeals in cases arising from U.S.
antidumping cases. <p>

An antidumping order establishes the rate at which importers must pay cash deposits of
estimated duties.  Actual duties on customs entries of goods covered by an order are not finally
assessed until Commerce conducts an administrative review to determine the precise duty rate
that must be paid.  Commerce conducts reviews annually, if requested by a party.  If no party
requests a review, imports into the United States for the affected period are finally assessed
antidumping duties at the cash deposit rate (the dumping margin) established in the investigation
or the last administrative review.  If a review is conducted, Commerce's determination
establishes the duties to be paid on prior entries during the period covered by the review and the
cash deposit rate on future entries pending the next review.<p>

As a result of the changes brought about by the Uruguay Round, an antidumping order is
required to terminate five years after its imposition, unless it is determined that expiration of the
order "would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence" of the dumping and injury.  If
requested by the domestic industry, Commerce and the ITC are required to conduct a "sunset"
review of an order every five years to determine whether it should continue in effect.   <p>

<h4>The Cement Industry's Experience</h4>
The experience of the U.S. cement industry indicates that the antidumping law can be an
effective remedy for unfairly priced imports.  U.S. consumption of cement increased
substantially during the 1983-1989 economic expansion as construction boomed.  U.S. cement
producers, however, were prevented from benefitting from this growing demand by a surge in
low-priced cement imports during the same period.  The volume of imports grew 500 percent
from 1982 to 1987, as the imports' share of the U.S. market increased from less than 5 percent to
nearly 20 percent.  Delivered import prices declined by 24 percent between 1981 and 1988, from
$45 to $34 per ton.  Import prices were at their lowest in 1987-1988, when import penetration of
the U.S. market was at its highest.  <p>

Rapidly increasing imports depressed domestic prices, took market share from domestic
producers, forced plants to close, and prevented the domestic industry from modernizing or from
capitalizing on expansion opportunities in growing regional markets.  Even though U.S. cement
demand increased 40 percent from 1980 to 1990, U.S. production capacity declined 10 percent,
and the number of U.S. plants decreased from 142 to 109.  The industry's problems with
low-priced imports were especially acute in the southern tier of U.S. states, where the market
was heavily affected by imports from Mexico, Japan, and Venezuela.  <p>

Beginning in 1989, southern tier cement producers successfully prosecuted antidumping
petitions against imports from Mexico and Japan.  Commerce found dumping margins of 58
percent for imports from Mexico and 64 percent for imports from Japan.  A third case against
imports from Venezuela was suspended--after Commerce's preliminary determination of a 49
percent margin on Venezuelan imports--on the basis of an agreement by Venezuelan exporters to
price their exports to the United States above quarterly benchmarks established by Commerce. 
As a result, imports from Mexico, Japan, and Venezuela declined 85 percent from 1989 to 1994,
allowing cement prices and domestic producers' returns on investment to increase substantially. 
The industry's recovery was tied directly to its successful antidumping petitions.<p>

<h4>Evaluation Of A Potential Case</h4>
As the cement industry's experience demonstrates, the antidumping law can be an effective
countermeasure to injurious and unfairly priced imports.  Because of this potential, domestic
producers competing with low priced imports should consider whether it would be advantageous
to file a petition.  The likelihood of success differs from case to case, and the decision to proceed
should be based on a careful analysis of the potential benefits and costs.  Generally speaking,
petitions are more likely to succeed where imports from certain countries are gaining U.S.
market share due to their lower pricing.  Factors to be considered include (1) the volume of
imports and whether imports are increasing; (2) the imports' market share and whether the
imports' market share is increasing; (3) the scope of the industry and the products on which a
case would be based; (4) industry trends during the last three calendar years in consumption,
production, capacity utilization, employment, market share, pricing, sales, and profitability; and
(5) evidence that prices are higher in the foreign country than in the United States.  The outcome
of a petition is often dependent on the most advantageous definition of the product and the U.S.
industry and the most advantageous timing for filing the petition.  <p>

U.S. importers and foreign producers should also undertake a careful analysis of their potential
liability for dumping duties.  A review similar to that undertaken by a petitioner prior to filing a
petition would be particularly well advised if imports are increasing or if domestic producers
have complained about import competition.  This review would enable a company either to
revise its pricing or importing practices or to develop useful information and arguments for
defending against a potential petition.<p>

<h1>Country of Origin Marking: When is a Product "Made in the USA?"</h1>
<h2>Stephen A. Jones</a></h2>
<H6>This article originally appeared in the November 1995 issue of <EM>Legal Trends Advisory for Corporate Leaders</EM>. Reproduced by permission.</H6>

<p>
Imagine you are a manufacturer or seller of athletic footwear assembled in the United States
from imported components.  Do you need to disclose the foreign origin of the shoes' components
to the consumer?  Because the shoes are assembled in the United States, can you label and
advertise the shoes as "Made in the U.S.A.?"<p>

Competitiveness in the international marketplace often demands that manufacturers source
components from one or more different countries in order to achieve the lowest possible cost. 
Given the prevalence of multiple-country sourcing and processing, determining the country of
origin of a product, and the corresponding marking and labeling requirements, is increasingly
difficult.  The U.S. Customs Service requires all products of foreign origin to be marked with the
country of origin.  The Federal Trade Commission specifies when a seller may identify its
products as "Made in the U.S.A."  Due to the increasing complexity of international commerce,
both Customs and the FTC are currently modifying their rules in this area.  The new rules that
emerge from these review proceedings will affect the marking and labeling requirements for
many products sold in the United States.<p>

<h4>The Customs Marking Requirements</h4>
Section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 requires that every imported article of foreign origin be
marked legibly, conspicuously, and permanently so as to indicate the article's country of origin to
the ultimate purchaser in the United States.  The law has two purposes.  First, it enables the
ultimate purchaser in the United States to buy, or refuse to buy, a product based on its country of
origin.  Second, determining country of origin is necessary for Customs to administer the tariff
laws, which provide different tariff rates for products depending on their origin.  <p>

The "country of origin" is generally the article's country of manufacture, production, or growth.  
Further production or the addition of material in a second country will render the second country
the country of origin if the further production results in a "substantial transformation" of the
article.  Customs defines substantial transformation as "production which results in a new and
different article, with a new name, character, and use."  The country of origin is therefore the
country in which the last substantial transformation took place.<p>

In determining whether the combining of parts and materials constitutes a substantial
transformation, Customs considers the extent of the operations performed and whether the parts
lose their identity and become integral parts of the new article.  Minimal or simple assembly
operations would generally not result in a substantial transformation.  If there is no substantial
transformation, each part must be individually marked to indicate its country of origin prior to
sale to the ultimate purchaser.<p>

The ultimate purchaser is generally considered the last person to receive the merchandise in the
United States in the form in which it was imported.  If the imported merchandise is intended to
be further processed or manufactured in the United States, a determination must be made as to
who the ultimate purchaser will be.  A U.S. manufacturer that buys foreign merchandise will be
considered the ultimate purchaser if the manufacturer processes the imported merchandise such
that it undergoes a substantial transformation in the United States.  If that occurs, the product is
"Made in the U.S.A." for purposes of Customs law and the U.S. manufacturer need not mark the
product it sells to the ultimate consumer.  If the U.S. manufacturer does not substantially
transform the merchandise, however, the manufacturer's customer will be the ultimate purchaser,
and the manufacturer must mark the product with the foreign country of origin.<p>

Under current law, Customs administers the substantial transformation rule on a case-by-case
basis, which often involves subjective judgments as to what constitutes a "new and different"
product, or whether certain processing steps have resulted in a product with a "new name,
character, and use."  These standards are difficult to apply and have created uncertainty and
unpredictability within Customs and the international trade community, especially in situations
involving assembly of components from multiple countries.  Notwithstanding the large number
of administrative and judicial determinations, little guidance exists on the effect of certain types
of processing on the determination of origin.<p>

In our example involving athletic footwear, Customs would require each of the components to be
marked with its country of origin, unless the components were substantially transformed in the
United States.  Customs would analyze whether the assembly operations in the United States
resulted in a new and different product, with a new name, character, and use.  If there were a
substantial transformation in the United States, that is, if the products were "Made in the U.S.A."
under Customs law, Customs would require no marking whatsoever.  <p>

On January 3, 1994, in conjunction with the publication of standards for determining origin
under the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"), Customs published two important
notices.  First, Customs notified the public that for determinations of origin within the NAFTA,
substantial transformation would be based on whether there was a change in the tariff
classification of the article.  Second, Customs stated that it was considering extending the
"change in tariff classification" test to all situations in which Customs must determine the
country of origin of a product.  <p>

Under the "change in tariff classification" test, an article would be considered to be substantially
transformed if further processing changed the article's tariff classification.  The change in
classification necessary would, in most cases, involve a change in the first four digits of the
product's classification number under the Harmonized Tariff System.  The location of the
operation resulting in the change of tariff classification would be the article's country of origin. 
The new rule is designed to provide more certainty and uniformity to the substantial
transformation test.<p>

Since January 3, 1994, Customs has revised its proposal twice and continues to review
comments submitted by interested parties.  The effective date of the new regulations will be 90
days after notice of the new regulations is published in the Federal Register.<p>

U.S. manufacturers must analyze whether products assembled in the United States are
substantially transformed in the United States to determine whether the product must be marked
with the foreign country of origin.  The "change in tariff classification" test should provide
additional predictability and certainty to this determination.  Determining the origin and marking
requirements for products comprised of components from various countries, however, will likely
remain an extremely difficult task.<p>

<h4>Federal Trade Commission Requirements</h4>
In the interest of protecting the consuming public, the FTC has repeatedly determined that it is
an unfair or deceptive act within the meaning of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act
to sell a product of foreign origin without disclosing its country of origin.  The rule is based on
the presumption that a substantial portion of the consuming public may have a preference for
products manufactured in the United States, and the absence of any mark or label would mislead
consumers into thinking that a product was of domestic origin.<p>

According to FTC practice, if a product manufactured in the United States contains an imported
component, the seller of the product must disclose the origin of the foreign component if it
retains its essential character despite incorporation into a product.  If assembly of the finished
product caused the foreign component to "lose its identity," however, disclosure of the foreign
origin of the component would not be required.  This standard is essentially the same as the
current Customs law of substantial transformation, discussed above.<p>

The FTC also regulates the circumstances in which a domestic seller may state that a product is
"Made in the U.S.A."  The FTC's standard for an unqualified "Made in the U.S.A." claim is that
"all or virtually all" of the parts and labor used to manufacture the product must be of domestic
origin.  The FTC's standard is therefore different than Customs', which requires merely
substantial transformation in the United States for a product to be considered domestic in origin. 
The FTC's standard is based on evidence demonstrating that "Made in the U.S.A." claims are
highly important to consumers and that consumers interpret such claims to mean that all or
virtually all of both parts and labor are American.  The purpose of the standard is to protect
consumers from deceptive claims and to deny companies that misuse the term "Made in the
U.S.A." an unfair competitive advantage.<p>

In recent cases involving two manufacturers of athletic footwear, the FTC applied the standard
described above and ruled that the companies could not state that their products were "Made in
the U.S.A."  Since significant portions of the parts and labor of the companies' products were
foreign-origin, the FTC's position was that it would be deceptive to describe the products as
"Made in the U.S.A."  The FTC reiterated its position that "all or virtually all" of the parts and
labor used to manufacture the products must be of domestic origin for a product fairly to be
described as "Made in the U.S.A."<p>

The FTC subsequently received 150 comments from consumers, industry, and trade associations
objecting to the "all or virtually all" standard.  Many of the comments stated that, given the
globalization of commerce, the "all or virtually all" standard is unrealistic and unduly restricts
use of the "Made in the U.S.A." claim.  In response to the criticism, the FTC has decided to
convene a public workshop in early 1996 to explore the best ways to balance protection of the
consumer with the reality of today's global economy.<p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
With respect to whether a product is "Made in the U.S.A.," Customs and the FTC use different
tests.  Under Customs law, a product that is substantially transformed in the United States is
"Made in the U.S.A.," despite significant previous processing abroad or the use of foreign
components .  Conversely, under FTC law, a product is not "Made in the U.S.A." unless all or
virtually all of the parts and labor are domestic origin.  It is therefore possible that a product
could be "Made in the U.S.A." under Customs law, but not under FTC law.  Since Customs law
is primarily concerned with accurate determinations of foreign origin, the FTC has primacy over
the use of "Made in the U.S.A." claims.<p>

Pending Customs and FTC proceedings highlight the need for accurate country of origin marking
and labeling.  With regard to "Made in the U.S.A." claims, current Customs and FTC practice are
not consistent and may add to the uncertainty faced by U.S. manufacturers and sellers.  Parties
wishing to make "Made in the U.S.A." claims in connection with products to be sold in the
United States should participate in the FTC's public workshop in February 1996 and make their
views known to the agency.  In addition, parties should become generally familiar with the law
and practice in this area and be prepared to revise their practices if necessary to conform to new
Customs and FTC policies.<p>

Supervisor Liability and Other Recent Developments</TITLE>

<HR><P>
<H1>The Family and Medical Leave Act: 
Supervisor Liability and Other Recent Developments</H1><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
One of the most significant recent issues regarding the Family and Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") is the extent to which supervisors can be subject to individual liability for decisions regarding FMLA leave. An Illinois district court recently ruled that supervisors who exercise sufficient control over an employee’s terms and conditions of employment may be held individually liable for FMLA violations. <EM>Freemon v. Foley</EM>, 1995 W.L. 669607 (N.D. Ill.). However, more recently, a Tennessee district court reached the opposite conclusion. <EM>Frizzell v. Southwest Motor Freight, Inc.</EM>, 1995 W.L. 713459 (E.D. Tenn.).<P>
In the Illinois case, a hospital employee was terminated when she failed to provide medical verification for her entire absence to care for her sons with chicken pox. Following her termination, the employee sued the hospital, the human resources vice-president, and her immediate and department supervisors under the FMLA. The court, relying on cases under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which has an identical definition of "employer," ruled that a supervisor can be liable for FMLA violations when the supervisor possesses control over the violation. Because each individual sued was capable of impeding or denying the employee’s FMLA leave, the Court denied their motion for summary judgment. <P>
In the Tennessee case, the former employee, who allegedly became pregnant by her supervisor, sued her employer and supervisor under the Tennessee Human Rights Act ("THRA"), FMLA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court relied on its earlier decsion that supervisors are not employers for purposes of the THRA to conclude that a similar result should apply for purposes of Title VII and the FMLA. <P>
The Illinois decision is consistent with the Department of Labor regulations interpreting the FMLA. However, the Tennessee case shows courts do not always follow the regulations. <P>
In a case more favorable to employers, another Illinois court ruled that an employee who had previously been granted a reduced work schedule under the FMLA failed to show that her subsequent discharge for excessive absenteeism amounted to discrimination under FMLA. <EM>McCown v. UOP, Inc.</EM>, 1995 W.L. 519818 (N.D. Ill.). The employee was granted a reduced work schedule under the FMLA in order to be home with her recently molested daughter. In a memorandum regarding her absences, her supervisor stated that it was "doubly important" for her to be at work when scheduled because she was already on a reduced schedule under the FMLA. The employee later alleged she was terminated because of her reduced schedule in violation of the FMLA and provided her supervisor’s memorandum as evidence of his discriminatory intent. The court ruled that the memorandum alone was insufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to defeat the employer’s motion for summary judgment, stating that the "FMLA is not a shield to protect employees from legitimate disciplinary action by their employers if their performance is lacking in some manner unrelated to their FMLA leave." <P>
In one of the first Department of Labor ("DOL") actions filed against an employer under the FMLA, the DOL charged a Texas employer with firing an employee for taking leave to care for his hospitalized pregnant wife. <EM>Reich v. Associated Milk Products, Inc.</EM>, D.C. N.Texas, No. 2-94-CV-218-J (2/10/95). The DOL asked for back pay, benefits and other equitable relief. After acknowledging in writing that it recognized the FMLA and that it would not knowingly or intentionally violate the FMLA, the employer settled the lawsuit for $10,000. <P>
The DOL’s first case actually litigated under the FMLA was won by the employer. A Michigan court ruled that a pregnant employee who was discharged for excessive absenteeism after contracting chicken pox was not entitled to reinstatement because she did not inform her company that she was taking leave under the FMLA. <EM>Reich v. Midwest Plastic Eng’g, Inc</EM>., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8772; dismissed, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12130. The court stated that the FMLA regulations require that "at a minimum, an employee must inform her employer of her condition with sufficient detail to make it evident that the requested leave is protected as FMLA-qualifying leave." The employee did not meet the minimum notification requirements because she failed to tell her employer that she was under a doctor’s care or that she had been hospitalized. Moreover, the court found that she failed to update her employer as to her status and her intent to return to work as required by the employer’s policy, stating that "[t]his alone gave [the employer] a ground to terminate [her] employment." <P>
As the cases above demonstrate, employer and employee rights and responsibilities under the FMLA will be shaped by the courts. These cases also underscore the importance of awareness of FMLA requirements at all management and supervisory levels. <P>

<TITLE> Participant Contribution Regulations </TITLE>

<HR><P>
<H1>Participant Contribution Regulations </H1><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
Recently, the Department of Labor ("DOL") issued proposed regulations shortening the period within which employers must pay participant contributions to an employee benefit plan trust or to an insurance company. <P>
The current regulations provide that participant contributions to an employee benefit plan generally must be paid into a trust or to an insurance company as soon as they can reasonably be segregated from the employer’s general assets, but no later than 90 days from the date the employer receives or withholds the contributions. <P>
According to the DOL, the revision is necessary because many employers are abusing the current regulations by treating the 90-day maximum as a "safe harbor," allowing a 90-day delay in transmitting participant contributions to the trust or insurance company. Further, the DOL believes the 90-day maximum is too long. <P>
Under the proposed regulations, employers would be required to transmit participant contributions to a trust or insurance company for the plan within the same time period within which the employer is required to make deposits for federal income and employment taxes. For many employers, the proposed regulations would require transmitting participant contributions to the plan trust or insurance company by the next banking day after the employer withholds or receives the contributions.<P>
The proposed regulations apply to participant contributions under medical, dental, life insurance and other welfare plans as well as to 401(k) plans and other retirement plans. Surprisingly, the proposed regulations do not appear to affect the DOL’s 1992 position that participant contributions deducted on a pre-tax basis under a § 125 cafeteria plan are not required to be held in trust. <P>
Employers should contact us if they want more information on the proposed regulations and how they could affect their plans.

<H1>Proposed Legislation to Ensure the Legality of Employee Participation Programs and Committees</H1><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has issued several decisions holding that certain employee participation programs and employee committees violate the National Labor Relations Act. <P>
Because of these NLRB cases, many employers who are committed to employee participation and involvement in the workplace run the risk that continuation of these programs may violate the law.<P>
Bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate to correct this situation. Both versions of this pending legislation, called the "Teamwork for Employees and Management Act of 1995" or "TEAM," have the objective of protecting an employer’s right "to establish, assist, maintain or participate in any organization in which workers may discuss issues relating to terms and conditions of employment." The House Bill, HR743, passed the House by a vote of 221 to 202 on September 27, 1995. The Senate Bill, S.295, introduced by Sen. Kassenbaum (R. Kansas) is pending before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.<P>
If you are interested in this pending legislation and its chances for passage, feel free to contact <A HREF="http:/htm/hester.htm">Ted Hester</A> in our Washington office (phone: 202/626-2901).

<H1>§ 125 Cafeteria Plan Regulations on FMLA</H1><P>

<HR></CENTER>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service recently proposed regulations coordinating existing guidance on § 125 cafeteria plans with the group health plan coverage requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"). <P>
The proposed regulations generally require an employer to offer to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave one or more of the following premium payment options: 
<OL>
<LI>the employee may pre-pay the premiums due for the FMLA leave period, 
<LI>the employee may pay premiums on the same schedule as active employees and 
<LI>the employee may reimburse the employer upon return from FMLA leave. 
</OL>

Premiums may be paid on a pre-tax or after-tax basis, but special rules apply if an FMLA leave spans more than one plan coverage year.<P>
The proposed regulations also contain special rules that apply to health flexible spending accounts. Please note that this article is intended only as a brief summary of certain provisions of the new proposed regulations. If you would like further information regarding the proposed regulations, please contact a member of our group.

<TITLE> Eleventh Circuit Extends Constitutional Protection to a Woman’s Plan to Marry Another Woman</TITLE>

<HR><P>
<H1>Eleventh Circuit Extends Constitutional Protection to a Woman’s Plan to Marry Another Woman</H1><P>
<HR></CENTER>
<P>
In a decision potentially affecting the employment policies of public employers throughout the country, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta rules that "strict scrutiny" must be applied to a woman’s First Amendment claims that the Attorney General of Georgia reneged on a job offer in the Law Department of the State of Georgia because of her plans to marry another woman in a religious ceremony recognized by a branch of Judaism. <EM>Shahar v. Bowers, </EM>70 F.3d 1218 (11th Cir. 1995). The Attorney General is expected to seek review by the Supreme Court of this decision which has been hailed as a significant victory by gay and lesbian rights groups. <P>
In July 1991, the Attorney General withdrew an offer of employment as an attorney in the State’s Law Department previously made to Robin Shahar after learning that Ms. Shahar intended to marry another woman. Ms. Shahar sued the Attorney General under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that his actions violated her rights of intimate and expressive association, freedom of religion, equal protection, and substantive due process. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Attorney General on all claims. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the Attorney General on all claims except the claims of interference with the rights of intimate association and expressive association. <P>
The couple were married in South Carolina on July 28, 1991 by a Rabbi performing a traditional Jewish marriage ceremony. Ms. Shahar did not assert that the religious ceremony constituted a valid Georgia civil marriage. Her marriage is apparently recognized by the Reconstructionist Branch of Judaism (of which she and her partner are adherents) and she claimed the ceremony conferred on her and her partner a religious-based "married" status apart from and independent of the civil marriage provided by Georgia law. <P>
The Eleventh Circuit held that the intimate relationship between Ms. Shahar and her partner, although not involving marriage in a civil, legal sense, is nonetheless an intimate relationship entitled to constitutional protection because it was "intimate and highly personal" as well as "inextricably entwined with Shahar’s exercise of her religious beliefs." The Court was careful to note that it was not holding that an association based solely on the sexual orientation of a same sex couple was an intimate association meriting constitutional protection. <P>
After finding the relationship constitutionally protected, the Court went on to apply the standard of strict scrutiny to the claim. Under that standard, the act of the Attorney General in firing Ms. Shahar after learning of her relationship must be deemed to violate her First Amendment rights of intimate association unless the Attorney General could show that his actions were narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. The majority remanded to the district court for a determination on this issue. Finding with little analysis that strict scrutiny should apply, the Eleventh Circuit also remanded the expressive association claim.<P>
Although the ultimate outcome is as yet unknown, the case represents a major victory for individuals involved in same sex relationships. It is the first decision of which we are aware that applies the strict scrutiny standard to the government’s actions with respect to homosexual relationships. Nongovernmental employers should be unaffected by the <EM>Shahar </EM>decision.

<h1>How to Keep the Other Shoe from Dropping: The Interrelationship of Civil RICO and Criminal Proceedings</h1>
<p>
<a href="/htm/thompson.htm"><H2>Larry D. Thompson</H2></a>
<H6>Reprinted with permission from the <EM>Georgia State Bar Journal</EM>, Vol. 30, No.4</H6>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
<h4>THE DILEMMA:  TO PARTICIPATE IN DISCOVERY OR NOT?</h4>
"[R]acketeering activity," as expressly defined by the federal RICO statute,1 encompasses
numerous specific criminal offenses.  There are four categories of "predicate acts" set forth under
RICO, the commission of which may trigger civil liability:  crimes of violence (murder,
kidnapping, arson, robbery, extortion and obstruction of justice); crimes involving illicit goods
and services (gambling, pornography, narcotics, counterfeiting, theft and trafficking in restricted
goods); crimes involving breach of fiduciary obligations and labor contracts (restrictions on
payments and loans to labor organizations); and crimes of commercial fraud (embezzlement,
securities fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud).2<p>

The great majority of civil RICO cases are brought by plaintiffs alleging violations of the
"commercial fraud provisions," with mail and wire fraud being the most frequently used.3 
Although most civil RICO cases are essentially business disputes, some cases, given the nature
of the predicate act allegations, involve sensitive matters that could give rise to potential criminal
liability for one or more of the parties or representatives of parties.  RICO's predicate acts
involve criminal statutes that are subject to expansive interpretations by some federal
prosecutors and investigative agencies.4  Counsel representing a party or witness involved in
activity within the scope of these statutes therefore should never take the possibility or fact of a
criminal investigation lightly.<p>

Moreover, counsel representing a party or witness in a civil RICO case also needs to be aware of
certain additional issues that may unwittingly involve him or her in a criminal case along with
the client.  For example, the federal witness tampering statute prohibits, among other things,
engaging in misleading conduct with the intent to influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of
any person "in<i> an official proceeding</i>,"5 which can be a civil or administrative matter. 
"Misleading conduct" is not defined, and some commentators have suggested that it may apply
even to routine witness preparation.6 Federal law also prohibits perjury in discovery devices
such as depositions, affidavits or written testimony,7 as well as the subornation or procurement
of perjury.8  The author is aware that some federal judges are referring perjury concerns arising
out of depositions to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution.9<p>

For all of the above reasons, a party or witness in a civil RICO case with concerns about
potential criminal liability needs to be sensitive to the fact that testimony, and even in some
instances the production of documents, may be held to constitute a waiver of the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.10  In <i>United States v. Kordel</i>,11 the United
States Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment privilege clearly can be waived where a
party did not invoke it in civil proceedings.12  The specter of losing the Fifth Amendment
privilege is a very strong argument for invoking it, but by doing so a party runs the risk of having
an adverse inference drawn against him by the trier of fact in the civil proceeding.  Thus, in
Baxter v. Palmigiano,13 the Supreme Court held that an adverse inference was not an
impermissible penalty for the exercise of a constitutional right and noted that an adverse
inference was but one of many factors used by the fact-finder in determining whether to assess a
penalty.14<p>

A lawyer who represents a party in a civil RICO case concerned with potential criminal liability
has three primary alternatives:  (1) file a motion to stay the RICO proceedings; (2) file a motion
for a protective order; and (3) advise the client to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege.  The
remainder of this article addresses each of these possible options.<p>
<p>
<h4>STAY OF CIVIL RICO PROCEEDINGS</h4>
The authority for a stay may be found in three sources.  First, "'[t]he power to stay proceedings is
incidental to the power inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its
docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.'"15  Second, the
All Writs Act empowers the federal courts to issue "all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of
their respective jurisdictions."16  Finally, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that: 
"In all cases not provided for by rule, the district judges and magistrates may regulate their
practice in any manner not inconsistent with these rules or those of the district in which they
act."17  <p>

The burden of persuasion is on the party seeking the stay,18 and, according to some courts, such
a party "'must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being compelled to proceed.'"19 
Although a primary consideration is the extent to which a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights
are implicated,20 the most commonly considered additional factors are those listed by the court
in <i>Golden Quality Ice Cream Co. v. Deerfield Specialty Papers, Inc</i>.21:<p>

<blockquote>	(1) the interest of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously with [the] litigation or
any particular aspect of it, and the potential prejudice to plaintiffs of a delay; (2)
the burden which any particular aspect of the proceedings may impose on the
defendants; (3) the convenience of the court in the management of its cases, and the
efficient use of judicial resources; (4) the interests of persons not parties to the civil
litigation; and (5) the interest of the public in the pending civil and criminal
litigation.22  
</blockquote>
Because "[o]ther factors a court should consider will vary according to the case itself,"23
reported cases also have taken account of the similarity between the civil and criminal
proceedings24 and the extent to which the invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege would
essentially gut a civil defense.25<p>

	The impossibility of predicting accurately the appropriate length of a stay, particularly in cases
in which the defendant has not yet been indicted, has led some courts to dismiss outright
defendants' motions.26  In<i> Roe v. Operation Rescue</i>,27  for example, the court denied a stay in
part because "there is no way of knowing how long it will be before criminal proceedings (if
any) against the defendants conclude and the applicable statutes of limitation expire."28  The
Supreme Court, however, has indicated that some type of stay may be available and even
appropriate during the pendency of a criminal investigation.29  This approach is supported by
two leading commentators on the grounds that an indictment/no indictment distinction seems
overly formalistic, particularly in cases where indictment is a near certainty or where there is a
very active criminal investigation.30 <p>

	In a recent and important case, <i>In Re Grand Jury Proceedings</i>,31 the Eleventh Circuit has
suggested that a stay of civil proceedings is appropriate for civil litigants facing criminal
investigation and concerned about losing their Fifth Amendment rights.32  In this era of
increasing concern over crowded court dockets, civil RICO litigants should cite this case for the
proposition that a witness' Fifth Amendment rights clearly outweigh the inconvenience of
delaying civil proceedings.<p>

<p>

<h4>PROTECTIVE ORDERS</h4>
	If a civil RICO case involving sensitive matters must proceed, a party then should try to limit
information that can be obtained through discovery or, in the event information is produced,
keep the information confidential or sealed.  The concept of protecting information or limiting
access is directly authorized by Rule 26(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.33  Although
a protective order in a civil RICO case can be attacked, such an order also can serve to protect
the legitimate interests of a party subject to potential criminal liability.<p>

	In <i>Martindell v. International Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp</i>.,34 for example, depositions were taken pursuant
to a stipulation of confidentiality between the parties and a protective order entered by the court. 
On the basis of the protective order, the district court subsequently denied a government motion
to obtain access to the deposition transcripts for the purpose of a criminal investigation.35  The
Second Circuit affirmed, holding that defendants had testified in reliance on the court's order and
finding that the district court's order appropriately balanced the competing interests of the private
litigants and the public.36 <p>

	The Eleventh Circuit, however, in <i>In Re Grand Jury Proceedings</i>,37  recently rejected the
Second Circuit's <i>Martindell</i> test, and held that a Rule 26(c) protective order does shield relevant
information from a subsequent grand jury investigation.38  In this case, a federal grand jury
issued a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> for the court reporter's notes of a deposition that had been taken
only after the district court had issued a protective order sealing it.  The district court quashed
the subpoena, noting that the deponent had relied on the protective order and waived his Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent.39  The court of appeals reversed, noting that a district court
does not have the authority under Rule 26(c) or any other provision to grant, in effect, "use
immunity" to civil witnesses.40 <p>

<p>

<h4>AVOIDING SANCTIONS OR ADVERSE INFERENCES RESULTING
FROM THE EXERCISE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE</h4>
	In addition to moving for a stay of civil proceedings and securing a protective order, a lawyer
who represents a party in a civil RICO case concerned with potential criminal liability may
advise his or her client to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege.  Obviously, however, such an
exercise may lead to an adverse inference or even sanctions against the client and, for that
reason, a lawyer faced with these possibilities should consider taking steps to preclude them
from coming to reality.<p>

<p>

<h5>Use of a Stay to Preclude Sanctions</h5>
	As in other types of cases, a court in a civil RICO case has the discretion to impose sanctions
upon a party invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege.  In addition to the other possible
advantages of a stay in proceedings discussed above, however, moving for a stay may preclude
the imposition of sanctions for such a strategy.<p>

	In <i>Wehling v. Columbia Broadcasting System</i>,41 for example, the plaintiffs, owners of
proprietary and trade schools in Texas, instituted an action alleging defamation as a result of a
news story broadcast over television on the CBS Evening News.  The broadcast contained
statements to the effect that the plaintiffs had defrauded their students, as well as the federal
government, through abuse of federal student loan and grant programs.  When CBS sought
pre-trial discovery concerning the details of the operation of the school, one owner invoked his
Fifth Amendment privilege.  The court ordered the plaintiff to answer the questions posed to him
or, in the alternative, have the lawsuit dismissed under the discretionary authority accorded the
courts under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to comply with an order
of discovery.42 <p>

	The plaintiff moved for a protective order requesting a stay of discovery until the threat of
criminal liability had passed.  Plaintiff previously had appeared five times before a federal grand
jury investigating federally insured student loan programs, and in each instance asserted his Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  At the time of deposition, plaintiff's counsel
had stated that plaintiff was still a target of the investigation.  The district court denied the
motion, restated the order and, upon the plaintiff's continued assertion of the privilege, dismissed
the action with prejudice.43 <p>

	The former Fifth Circuit reversed the decision and ordered the district court to enter a protective
order staying discovery for a period of three years, the time within which plaintiff could still be
prosecuted criminally under the applicable statute of limitations.44  In support of its action, the
circuit court stated that it could find no provision in the federal rules authorizing sanctions on a
party resisting discovery by asserting a valid claim of privilege.45  Moreover, the circuit court
could find no valid distinction between a defendant who was sued while under threat of criminal
prosecution, and a plaintiff who is required to bring a lawsuit while also under the threat of
criminal prosecution.46  Because Rule 26 limits the scope of discovery to those matters "not
privileged," the circuit court reasoned that CBS had no valid right to the information protected
by the Fifth Amendment, and, therefore, the plaintiff did not violate the discovery rules in
exercising his privilege.  Balancing the defendant's discovery rights against the plaintiff's
constitutional privilege, the court determined that the sanction of dismissal was simply too
severe.47 <p>

	The Eleventh Circuit recently cited <i>Wehling</i> approvingly in In Re Grand Jury Proceedings,48 in
which the target of a grand jury investigation was deposed in related civil litigation only after
entry of a Rule 26(c) protective order in that litigation.  In reversing the district court's quashing
of a subpoena of the deposition transcript, the Eleventh Circuit held that the protective order did
not shield the transcript.49  In the process, however, it relied upon <i>Wehling</i> to suggest that a stay
of the civil proceeding could protect a litigant's Fifth Amendment rights.50 <p>

<p>

<h5>Avoiding Adverse Inferences</h5>
	A party's decision to exercise its Fifth Amendment right not to testify carries with it the risk of
an adverse inference.  One approach to resisting such an inference being drawn is through Rule
403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides:<p>

<blockquote>	Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or
misleading the jury, or by consideration of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
presentation of cumulative evidence.
</blockquote>
This rule was successfully invoked in <i>Farace v. Independent Fire Insurance Co</i>.,51 in which the
plaintiff insurance claimant previously had exercised his Fifth Amendment privilege in a
criminal arson investigation.  In excluding the evidence of the plaintiff's previous refusal to
testify, the court recognized that the prejudicial effect of the plaintiff's having exercised the
privilege outweighed the probative value of that evidence and justified exclusion by the trial
court.52 <p>

	Another approach to avoiding an adverse inference is the suggestion of possible prosecutorial
abuse.  In SEC v. Musella,53 the court noted, in dicta, that it would be reluctant to impose a
penalty on a party who has been indicted for invoking the privilege against self-incrimination
"given the invitation to prosecutorial abuse this might entail."54  As this observation suggests,
the specter of the government cooperating with one side in a civil RICO proceeding and
suggesting whom to depose is very troubling to many, including most judges.<p>

	Although an adverse inference against a party or witness in a civil RICO proceeding is a serious
matter, a witness can refuse to testify on Fifth Amendment grounds and an adverse inference
may not carry the day for the opposite party.  Obviously, in many cases, there are good and
persuasive arguments that can be used to defeat an adverse inference.  Nevertheless, the dilemma
of a party in a sensitive civil RICO case faced with critical considerations of potential criminal
liability is to avoid drawing an adverse inference while still preserving the Fifth Amendment
privilege.55 <p>

</CENTER>
<H4>I.	Introduction</H4>
	In recent years, the Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") has greatly increased its enforcement efforts with regard to employment tax matters.  Since establishing the Employment Tax Examination Program in 1988, the Service has assessed more than $670 million in penalties and back taxes and has forced businesses to reclassify over 430,000 independent contractors as employees.  Compliance efforts have focused primarily on businesses with assets of $3 million or less.  The Service claims that these smaller businesses are most likely to misclassify the status of workers.  However, the painful and unfair by-product of this policy is that most businesses undergoing employment tax audits do not have the financial resources necessary to overcome a reclassification and assessment by the Service.  As a result, aggressive Service agents often use strong arm tactics in an effort to raise revenues while ignoring facts that indicate independent contractor status and failing to inform unwary taxpayers of relief provisions that are available in the event of reclassification.<P>
	At the National Office level, the Service is aware of the grave concerns that small business owners have regarding IRS enforcement efforts to reclassify their workers and is taking actions to address these concerns.  The Service recently has announced two test programs for resolution of employment tax issues.  In addition, the Service has announced that all examining agents handling worker classification issues will receive additional training and has released a proposed draft of the training materials (the "Training Guide") for comments from the private sector.  <P>
	While commentators and industry representatives generally are encouraged by the Service's efforts to level the playing field in the employment tax arena, it is certain that handling an employment tax audit will remain a difficult task.  As with many factual determinations, the investigation into the work relationship often will involve asking innumerable questions and reviewing countless documents.  The determination of a worker's status turns on many factual nuances, so one must be acutely aware of all facts surrounding the applicable work relationships. <P>
	It is equally important to understand the legal issues that can arise in the audit and the administrative routes that are available to settle the audit.  This article is intended to serve as a guide to these various issues.  The article begins by discussing the different tax and reporting requirements that follow under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), from the classification of a worker as an employee or an independent contractor.  It follows with a discussion of the factors and provisions that control in determining whether a worker is classified as an employee or an independent contractor.  The article then sets out the various parties who can be held liable for employment taxes, some of whom generally are not thought of as an "employer" in the traditional sense of the word.  Next, this article discusses numerous employment tax relief provisions that are available where workers are reclassified.  The article follows with a discussion of penalties and interest that may be applicable where a worker is reclassified and indicates situations where such penalties and interest may be reduced or avoided.  This article then discusses the application of the statute of limitations to an employment tax case and finally concludes with a discussion of the new programs available for resolution of employment tax audits.  
<P>
<H4>II.	Ramifications of Worker Reclassification</H4>
<P>
	Numerous ramifications can follow where workers are reclassified as employees.  The obligations imposed on a company under the Code are very different depending upon how workers are classified.  The Code essentially imposes no obligation on the company that uses an independent contractor, except that the company must file a Form 1099 reporting amounts paid to the independent contractor in the taxable year where the amount of such payments exceeds $600.  By contrast, a company must withhold income and social security (FICA) taxes on wages paid to employees.  In addition, an employer is required to match the amount of FICA taxes withheld and also must pay Federal unemployment taxes (FUTA) on wages, subject to credits for tax payments made into state unemployment funds.  Where workers are reclassified as employees, the company may be liable for all FICA, FUTA, and income withholding taxes owed with respect to such workers for all open years, plus applicable penalties and interest.  <P>
	While liability for employment taxes generally will be the most significant concern in an employment tax audit, there are other potentially disastrous ramifications that can follow from the classification of workers as employees.  First, a company must take all employees into consideration in determining whether a qualified retirement plan is nondiscriminatory.  If the nondiscrimination rules are violated, the employer's plan will become disqualified, and the Service could disallow any deductions taken with respect to contributions made on behalf of participants who are not vested with respect to such amounts.  Furthermore, amounts contributed to a plan on behalf of individuals who are vested with respect to such amounts could be imputed as income to these individuals in the year they became vested.  The worker who previously thought that he or she was an independent contractor also may forfeit the ability to establish and maintain a Keough Plan.<P>
	In addition to the disqualification of retirement plans, key employees and/or highly compensated individuals could be forced to include in income (1) all amounts attributable to the cost of group term life insurance, (2) a portion of amounts received under accident and health plans, and (3) amounts received as no-additional-cost service fringe benefits and qualified employee discounts where such benefits are provided on a discriminatory basis.  Finally, workers who are reclassified as employees will be limited by the 2% floor in deducting business expenses incurred with respect to their employment.

</H4>	There are numerous ways for a worker to be classified either as an employee or independent contractor.  The tax ramifications that follow from the reclassification of a worker can vary depending on which provision is used.  This section details the various provisions that govern the determination of a worker's status.  <P>
	<STRONG>A.	Common Law Employee.</STRONG><P>
	In an employment tax audit, the Service is most likely to assert that workers are employees under the common law rules.  The Treasury Regulations generally provide that an employer-employee relationship exists if the person for whom an individual performs services has the right to control and direct the individual with respect to both "the result to be accomplished by the work" and "the details and means by which that result is accomplished."  In other words, if the "employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but how it shall be done," a common law employment relationship exists for federal employment tax purposes.<P>
	The Service has published a list of 20 factors on which it relies to characterize a worker's status.  The 20 factors are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>	Whether a worker is required to comply with other persons' instructions about when, where, and how he is to work.
<LI>	Whether a worker is required to be trained.
<LI>	Whether a worker's services are integrated into business operations so that the success or continuation of the business depends to an appreciable degree on the performance of such services.
<LI>	Whether the services must be rendered personally.   
<LI>		Whether the persons for whom the services are performed hire, supervise, and pay assistants.
<LI>		Whether the services are performed as part of a continuing relationship between the worker and the person for whom the services are performed.
<LI>	Whether the worker has set hours during which he must work. 
<LI>	Whether the worker is required to work substantially full-time. 
<LI>	Whether the work must be performed on the employer's premises.
<LI>Whether the order or sequence of the services the worker is to perform are set by the person for whom the services are performed.
<LI>Whether the worker is required to submit regular oral or written reports.
<LI>Whether the worker is paid by the hour, week or month, or whether he is paid by the job or on a straight commission basis.
<LI>Whether the worker's business expenses are paid by the person for whom he performs the services.
<LI>Whether the worker is furnished with tools and materials.
<LI>Whether the worker has a significant investment in facilities used in the performance of his services.  
<LI>Whether the worker can realize a profit or suffer a loss from his services, greater than the profit or loss ordinarily realized by employees.
<LI>Whether the worker performs services for multiple unrelated parties at the same time.
<LI>Whether the worker makes his services available to the general public.
<LI>Whether the person for whom the services are performed has the right to discharge the worker.
<LI>Whether the worker has the right to terminate his relationship with the person for whom the services are performed at any time without incurring liability.

</OL>

	As one might imagine, the application of these 20 factors is very subjective.  Some factors are given more weight than others, depending upon the occupation at issue.  As the taxpayer's representative, it will be important to understand the nature of the taxpayer's industry and to be aware of any authority that might exist applying the factors to workers in that industry. 
<P>	In the recently released draft of the Training Guide which will be used in training IRS examiners on worker classification issues, the Service emphasizes that there is no "magic number" of relevant factors and that the 20-factor test does not embody the legal control test used for determining worker status.  These "factors merely point to facts to be used in evaluating the extent of the right to direct and control."
	<P>In the Training Guide, the Service segregates some of the 20 factors into different categories that relate to the type of control for which the factors are relevant.  First, the Training Guide addresses "behavioral control" and indicates that factors 1 and 2 should be analyzed to determine whether there is a right to direct or control how the worker performs the specific task for which he or she is hired.  Second, the Training Guide discusses "financial control" and indicates that factors 12, 13, 15, 16, and 18 should be considered in determining whether there is a right to direct or control how the business aspects of the worker's activities are conducted.  Third, the Training Guide states that the examining agent should analyze the "relationship of the parties" and should evaluate factors 6, 19, and 20 as well as considering employee benefits and the intent of the parties as evidenced by the written contracts in determining how the parties perceive their relationship.  Finally, the Training Guide indicates that factors 6 through 9 generally should be accorded lesser significance.
	<P>The Training Guide correctly states that control is a matter of degree and that even in the clearest case where a worker is an independent contractor, the worker will be constrained in some way.  In an obvious effort to curb the zeal of overaggressive agents, the Training Guide also makes the following statement:
     <P>It is important to remember that the results can be either that the worker is an employee or an independent contractor.  A case which results in a 'no change' does not indicate there is a problem with the examination process.  In fact, if numerous cases selected for audit result in 'no change,' there may be a problem with the process for selection of returns for audit, not with the examination results.
<P>
	<STRONG>B.	Statutory Employees.</STRONG><P>
	The Code provides that individuals holding certain positions or engaging in certain occupations will be considered employees for FICA tax purposes regardless of their status under the common law rules.  These "statutory employees" are:
<OL>
<LI>	an officer of a corporation;
<LI>	an agent or commissioned driver who delivers produce, meat, or laundry;
<LI>	a full-time life insurance salesman;
<LI>	a person who works at home under the direction of the party that supplies the materials and supplies for the work;
<LI>	a traveling salesman; or
<LI>	a common law employee.

</OL>

	With the exception of full-time life insurance salesmen and home workers, these persons are considered employees for FUTA tax purposes as well.  
<P>	The Treasury Regulations provide certain exceptions with respect to these various classifications.  For instance, an individual will not be classified as an employee merely by falling within one of the occupational groups set forth above unless (i) the individual's contract for services contemplates that substantially all the services to which the contract relates with respect to the designated occupation will be performed personally by such individual, (ii) the individual does not have a substantial investment in the facilities used to perform the services, and (iii) the services are part of a continuing relationship with the person for whom the services are provided and are not in the nature of a single transaction.  It is important to note that where workers are classified as statutory employees but not common law employees, the employer will not be liable for federal income withholding taxes.
	<P><STRONG>C.	Code § 3508 Statutory Non-Employees
</STRONG><P>	Code § 3508(a) provides that "qualified real estate agents" and "direct sellers" are treated as non-employees for purposes of all taxes imposed under the Code.  A "qualified real estate agent" must be a licensed real estate agent.  A "direct seller" must be engaged in the trade or business of selling (or soliciting the sale of) consumer products in the home or a place other than a permanent retail establishment.  
<P>	A direct seller need not necessarily sell consumer products, but may recruit, train, counsel, or otherwise motivate individuals who sell such products.  The proposed regulations provide that "consumer products" include only tangible personal property which is distributed in commerce and which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes.  However, the requirement that a direct seller must be limited to selling tangible personal property finds no support in the statute, and two courts have held that the term "consumer product" should be construed to include tangible consumer products as well as intangible consumer services.  Based upon a statement in the Training Guide, it appears that the Service intends to follow the result reached in these two cases, "pending finalization of the regulations and further consideration of the issue in that context."
	<P>The compensation paid to both qualified real estate agents and direct sellers must be directly related to sales or other output rather than the number of hours worked.  This requirement will be satisfied if at least 90% of the total remuneration received by the individual is determined on such basis. 
	<P>Finally, both qualified real estate agents and direct sellers must perform services pursuant to contracts which provide that they will not be treated as employees for Federal tax purposes.  According to the proposed regulations, a contract stating that an individual will not be treated as an employee will satisfy the written contract requirement only if it specifically states that such treatment is for "Federal tax purposes." 
	<P>It is conceivable that a worker could be classified as both a statutory employee under Code § 3121(d) and a statutory non-employee under Code § 3508.  For example, this could arise where a full-time life insurance salesman calls on customers in their homes or offices.  In this situation, it appears that Code § 3121(d) will override Code § 3508 so the worker will be treated as an employee for FICA, and in some situations FUTA, tax purposes, but will remain a non-employee (i.e., independent contractor) for purposes of federal income tax withholding. 
<P>
     <H4>IV.	Employers and Other Liable Parties</H4>
	People generally think of the person for whom a worker provides services as being the only party that is liable for employment taxes.  However, this is not always the case.  This section outlines the various parties that can be held liable for such taxes.  
	<P><STRONG>A.	Employers.</STRONG>
	<P>The "employer" is primarily liable for employment taxes.  The term "employer" generally means the person for whom an individual performs or performed services as an employee.  However, Code § 3401(d) provides that if the person for whom the individual performs services does not control the payment of wages, the term "employer" means the person having control of the payment of such wages.  While Code § 3401(d) technically applies only for purposes of federal income withholding taxes, this definition of employer has been judicially expanded to include FICA and FUTA taxes as well.  
	<P>"Payor liability" under Code § 3401(d) has become particularly significant in recent years, given the increased scrutiny by the Service of industries such as nurse registries and referral agencies where the service recipient and payor are not the same party.  Companies involved in these and other industries that "lease" workers to other parties often do not exert sufficient control to cause the workers on their payroll to be classified as their common law employees.  However, where the "lessee" exercises sufficient control to cause the worker to be treated as its common law employee, the "lessor" may be treated as that worker's employer by virtue of its "control" over payment of the worker's wages.  
	<P>There is little guidance regarding the meaning of "control" for purposes of Code § 3401(d).  However, to the extent that a party exercises or has the right to exercise control over who gets paid, the amount paid, and when payments are made, such party likely will be treated as an employer for federal employment tax purposes.  The Service and at least one court have gone even further, holding that regardless of who fixes the amount or terms of the payment, the party who actually pays the wages will be treated as the employer under Code § 3401(d).   
	<P>Because the payor's liability for employment taxes derives from the worker's status as a common law employee of the service recipient, it appears that where the service recipient would be exempt from paying some or all of the employment taxes if it were the payor, the actual payor will be exempt as well.  In addition, where "payor liability" applies under Code § 3401(d), only the payor is liable for employment taxes; the lessee of the worker will not be secondarily liable.
     	<P><STRONG>B.	Code § 3505 Liability for Third-Parties Paying or Providing for Wages
</STRONG><P>
	Code § 3505 imposes liability for employment taxes on certain third parties who are not employers but who pay or provide for wages.  It is easier to appreciate the situations in which a party will be held liable under Code § 3505 if one first understands why the provision was added to the Code.  Prior to enactment, third parties engaged in "net payroll financing," whereby they advanced funds to troubled employers (usually subcontractors in the construction industry) in an amount sufficient to cover the net wages due to employees without paying the government the withholding taxes that were due on those wages.  The government usually could not collect such taxes because the employer was insolvent, and the third party did not "control" the payment of wages and thus was not an "employer" responsible for withholding and paying employment taxes under Code § 3401(d).
	<P>Congress addressed this problem by imposing liability in two distinct situations.  First, where a lender, surety, or other person pays wages directly to an employee or group of employees of another, such party is liable for an amount equal to the taxes that the employer is required to deduct and withhold, but not the employer's portion of the employment taxes.  Second, if a lender, surety, or other person supplies funds to an employer for the specific purpose of paying employee wages, that person can be held liable for withholding taxes if the indirect payment was made with actual notice or knowledge that the employer did not intend or would not be able to make timely payment or deposit of amounts required to be withheld from wages.  In the latter situation, the third party's liability (including liability for pre-judgment interest) cannot exceed 25% of the amount supplied to the employer for the payment of wages.  In both cases, amounts paid by the third party are credited against the liability of the employer.  Accordingly, there can be no double recovery even though Code § 3505 imposes liability in the form of a penalty rather than a tax.
<P><STRONG>C.  100% Penalty for Responsible Persons Under Code § 6672</STRONG><P>
Any person who is required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over withheld taxes, and who willfully fails to do so is liable for a penalty equal to the tax not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.  This penalty is commonly referred to as the "100% penalty" since it imposes on responsible persons a penalty equal to 100% of the employment taxes that should have been withheld and paid over. 
<P>	For purposes of Code § 6672, a "person" is an officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership who is "under a duty" to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over withheld taxes.  This definition is not all inclusive, however, and other persons such as directors, prospective purchasers, creditors, accountants, and bankers also have been held liable.
	<P>The determination of whether an individual is a responsible person is dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.  Courts generally inquire as to whether the potential responsible persons had authority over the allocation of corporate funds.  In determining whether such authority existed, courts have looked at factors such as the entity's governing documents, the person's position within and financial interest in the company, the individual's authority to hire and fire employees, his or her authority to execute corporate checks or prepare corporate tax returns, the ability to borrow money, and the authority to make corporate financial decisions.  Generally, the mere ability to write checks and pay taxes on behalf of a company is not enough to make an individual a responsible person.  In order to be liable under Code § 6672, a person must also have discretion over which creditors are paid and when. 
	<P>To impose liability under Code § 6672, the Service also must show that the responsible person's failure to withhold was "willful."  However, the standard for showing willfulness is low.  Willfulness will be present where withheld employment taxes are "knowingly and intentionally" used to pay other expenses.  Under this standard, it will be very difficult for a responsible person who was aware or should have been aware that payroll taxes were delinquent to show that he or she did not act willfully.  
	<P>While it seems inappropriate to assess the Code § 6672 penalty against a responsible person when such amounts are still collectible from the employer, the Service is under no obligation to pursue the employer before imposing the 100% penalty.  Moreover, if someone is a responsible person, that person may be required to pay an amount equal to the entire tax due, even though there may be other responsible persons who also could pay a portion of the tax. 
	<P>In the past, the Service has been very aggressive in asserting that individuals were responsible persons.  However, in 1993, the Service revised its policy with respect to identifying responsible persons and indicates that it now will focus its collection efforts on those persons truly responsible under the law for collecting and paying over employment taxes.  According to the revised statement, responsibility should be determined based upon a person's status, duty, and authority.  Persons who perform ministerial acts without exercising independent judgment will not be subject to the 100% penalty.  In addition, the Service generally will not impose the 100% penalty on responsible persons where the Service has entered into an installment agreement or bankruptcy payment plan with the company for payment of the taxes as long as the company adheres to the plan.
	<P>Code §§ 3505 and 6672 both impose liability in the form of a penalty rather than imputing liability for the underlying tax.  Accordingly, it is possible that the Service could attempt to collect the full amount of the tax due twice; once from the lender under Code § 3505 and once from the responsible person under Code § 6672.  In Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. v. U.S., the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the Service to collect the amount of the underlying tax from a responsible person under Code § 6672 and to collect pre-judgment interest (which was not available under Code § 6672) from a lender under Code § 3505(b).  There, the Service did not obtain a windfall since it merely collected the taxes and interest that it was owed.  It is doubtful that the Service would attempt to treat Code § 3505 or 6672 as a real penalty rather than a means for collecting the tax owed since courts probably would impose a heavy burden of proof upon the Service in establishing entitlement to a true penalty.  
<P>
     <H4>V.	Relief Provisions</H4>
		A determination that a company's workers are employees does not necessarily mean that liability for employment taxes will be imposed.  There are a number of relief provisions that can limit or eliminate an employer's liability for unpaid employment taxes.  These provisions are discussed below.  
<P><STRONG>A.	Section 530 Statutory Relief
</STRONG><P>		If the examining agent determines that a class of workers should be reclassified as employees, the first and foremost weapon for use in combatting any deficiency is section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 ("Section 530").  Section 530 is an "off-Code" provision that was enacted in 1978 to combat what Congress perceived to be abusive practices by the Service in connection with employment tax audits.  Congress saw the need for legislative guidance in this area and felt it necessary to provide "interim" relief until Congress could complete its study of the employment tax area.  Initially, Section 530 was to expire on December31, 1979.  However, this provision was extended indefinitely by the Tax Equity and Fairness Reform Act of 1982.
		<P>Section 530 provides that an employer is relieved from federal employment tax liability where the employer can demonstrate (i)that it has consistently treated similarly situated workers as independent contractors since 1977, (ii)that it filed all federal tax returns, including information returns, since 1978 on a consistent basis with the workers being treated as independent contractors, and (iii)that it had a reasonable basis for treating the workers as independent contractors.  Relief under Section 530 will continue on a prospective basis as long as the employer continues to satisfy the reporting consistency rule even after it is determined that such workers are properly classified as employees.  
		<P>Section 530 can apply to both common law and statutory employees.  This section terminates an employer's liability for employment taxes as well as related interest and penalties but does not change the status of a worker from an employee to an independent contractor.  Accordingly, Section 530 does not affect the employee's liability with respect to his or her share of employment taxes due.  In addition, Section 530 only applies with respect to employment tax determinations and does not affect liability for income taxes that can arise from plan disqualifications and other such actions.  
		<P>While the Service traditionally has shown a strong bias against applying Section 530, it is clear that the Service cannot ignore the existence of this provision in conducting an audit.  In assessing liability against the Service for a taxpayer's costs and attorney's fees under Code §7430, a court recently defined the relative burdens of the Service and the taxpayer as follows:  <P>
[T]he most logical interpretation of section 530 is that Congress intended taxpayers and the IRS to work together to establish reasonableness.  This joint responsibility can be allocated most appropriately by requiring the taxpayer to come forward with an explanation and enough evidence to establish prima facie grounds for a finding of reasonableness.  However, as reflected in the statute, this threshold burden is relatively low and can be met with any reasonable showing.  Once the taxpayer has made this prima facie showing, the burden then shifts to the IRS to verify or refute the taxpayer's explanation.

<P>
	<P>	According to the Training Guide, it is not even necessary for the taxpayer to claim relief under Section 530 for this section to apply.  This appears to signal a shift in the Service's willingness to consider Section 530.  Pursuant to the IRS mission, an examining agent "must explore the applicability of section 530 even if the taxpayer does not raise the issue." 
		<P>In order to qualify for relief under Section 530, the taxpayer must satisfy a number of requirements.  These requirements are discussed in detail below.  
	<P>	<STRONG>1.	Consistent Treatment of Similarly Situated Workers</STRONG>
		<P>If an employer is to qualify for relief under Section 530, the employer must demonstrate that it has treated workers holding substantially similar positions as independent contractors for any period beginning after December 31, 1977.  While this requirement seems relatively simple, a closer analysis reveals a number of thorny issues.  
		<P>	a.	 What is "For Any Period"?  
		<P>Although Section 530 provides that the taxpayer must not have treated similarly situated workers as employees for any period beginning after December31, 1977, where an employer treated its workers as independent contractors but subsequently reclassified such workers as employees, relief will not be denied for any periods prior to the period in which such individuals were treated as employees.  For example, if a company treated a class of its workers as independent contractors for all periods prior to 1996 but began treating some of these workers as employees in that year, Section 530 relief could be available with respect to all similarly situated workers for taxable years prior to 1996, but would not be available for any such workers thereafter.  <P>
			b.	 What is "Treated"?  <P>
		For purposes of determining the "treatment" of workers, the statute does not focus on the day-to-day treatment of the worker, but instead looks specifically to the treatment for employment tax purposes.  Revenue Procedure 85-18 sets forth specific guidelines for determining whether a taxpayer "treated" an individual as an employee within the meaning of Section 530.  First, the revenue procedure states that the withholding of income or FICA taxes from an individual's wages will constitute "treatment" of the individual as an employee, regardless of whether the tax is paid over to the government.  Second, except in the limited circumstances discussed below, the filing of an employment tax return for a period with respect to an individual is "treatment" of the individual as an employee for that period, regardless of whether tax was withheld from the individual. 
		<P>One exception where the filing of an employment tax return will not constitute "treatment" of an individual as an employee applies where the Service prepares a return for a taxpayer under the authority granted by Code §6020(b).  The signing of an audit Form 2504 also will not constitute "treatment" under Section 530.  <P>
		The more important exception where a taxpayer will not be considered to have treated a worker as an employee by virtue of filing an employment tax return and paying the underlying tax involves the filing of a delinquent or amended employment tax return for a particular period as a result of Service compliance procedures.  If this exception did not exist, a taxpayer would be unable to dispute an employment tax determination in court without destroying its qualification under Section 530.  A taxpayer cannot file for relief in the Tax Court for employment tax disputes and thus, in order to get into federal district court or the Claims Court, the taxpayer must pay the deficiency and sue for a refund.  If the filing of an amended return and payment of taxes for a period under audit constituted "treatment" for purposes of Section 530, the taxpayer would be caught in a catch-22 because it would be deemed to have "treated" the worker as an employee by fulfilling the requirements to challenge the assessment in court and would forego relief under Section 530 for periods subsequent to the filing.<P>  
		The revenue procedure provides that collection or examination activities constitute compliance procedures.  However, where the Service sends a notice merely advising the taxpayer that no return has been filed and requests information from the taxpayer, such action is not a compliance procedure.  As long as the taxpayer only withholds employment taxes or files employment tax returns pursuant to compliance procedures for the period under audit, it will not be deemed to have "treated" the workers as employees.  But where employment taxes are paid or returns are filed for periods following those under audit, such action will constitute "treatment" of the workers as employees for those periods.<P>
			c.	What are "Substantially Similar Positions"?  <P>
		In order to satisfy the first requirement of Section 530, all workers in "substantially similar positions" must have been treated as independent contractors.  The determination of whether workers are similarly situated is important in another context under Section 530 as well.  In relying on a prior audit for purposes of obtaining relief under Section 530, the taxpayer must show that the workers covered by the audit held positions that are substantially similar to the current workers.  Although the incentives vary depending upon the context of the determination, the analysis should be the same under both scenarios.<P>
		The determination of whether workers are similarly situated is dependent on all the facts and circumstances.  According to the Training Guide, "the day-to-day services that workers provide and the method by which they perform those services" as well as the similarity of job functions are important factors in determining whether workers hold substantially similar positions.  <P>
		The Service will disregard certain factors in analyzing the similarity of workers' positions.  The Service believes that "[d]ifferences in the positions held by the respective individuals that result from the treatment of one individual as an employee and the other" as an independent contractor should be disregarded in making this determination.  For example, the fact that an employee participates in the taxpayer's qualified pension plan or health plan and an independent contractor does not will not be considered as support for disparate treatment of the workers.  <P>
		There is not a great deal of case law authority discussing when workers will be treated as holding substantially similar positions.  In Lambert's Nursery and Landscaping, Inc. v. U.S., the Fifth Circuit focused on the structure of the relationship between the service recipient and the worker rather than the type of work performed in determining whether the workers' positions were substantially similar.  The court affirmed the decision of the magistrate who found that the taxpayer could rely on a prior audit in which landscape workers were treated as independent contractors for purposes of gaining Section 530 relief with respect to janitors, since landscape workers and janitors were "substantially similar" in their relationship to the taxpayer.  In making this determination, the court looked at whether the workers were treated similarly "in terms of control, supervision, pay, and demands."  <P>
		More recently, in Crowd Management & Services, Inc. v. U.S., the court analyzed a situation where the relevant workers were engaged in the same line of work as workers who previously had been classified as employees.  In attempting to show that the change in the workers' status to independent contractor was justified and that these workers were not in a substantially similar position to those workers previously classified as employees, the taxpayer introduced evidence that the workers classified as independent contractors had more autonomy in performing their jobs than the prior employees.  While seemingly agreeing that a substantial decrease in the workers' level of autonomy could cause workers to be treated as not holding "substantially similar positions" to others workers in the same line of business, this court rejected the taxpayer's argument because it found that while these workers did exercise more autonomy, they, in fact, were still subject to the same degree of control as the prior employees.  <P>
		Although the courts in Lambert's Nursery and Crowd Management did not consider the workers' line of business to be determinative of whether the workers had substantially similar positions, the Service seems to give a significant amount of weight to this factor.  In fact, in determining whether a taxpayer can qualify for the prior audit safe harbor, the Service takes the position that a corporation cannot rely on a prior audit where it subsequently begins conducting a new line of business, apparently because the workers engaged in the new business cannot hold positions that are substantially similar to those workers who were engaged in the old business.  In taking this position, the Service acknowledges that the Fifth Circuit held against it on this issue in Lambert's Nursery.  <P>
		<STRONG>2.	Reporting Requirements</STRONG><P>
		In order to qualify for relief under Section 530, the taxpayer must have timely filed all federal tax returns, including information returns, for all periods beginning after December 31, 1978 consistently treating the workers as independent contractors.  Treas. Reg. §1.6041-1(a) requires, with certain exceptions, that information returns for compensation aggregating $600 or more paid to another person by one who is engaged in a trade or business must be made on Forms 1096 (Annual Summary and Transmittal of U.S. Information Returns) and 1099 (Information Return).  No information return need have been filed with respect to workers who received less than $600 from the taxpayer during the year.  In addition, a taxpayer that mistakenly, but in good faith, files the wrong type of Form 1099 will not forfeit eligibility under Section 530. <P>
		It appears that the filing requirement must be satisfied for all periods after 1978 or such shorter period as the taxpayer has been in business and using workers occupying positions similar to those workers involved in the audit.  Merely filing the appropriate returns for the periods under examination will not be sufficient.  <P>
		<STRONG>3.	Reasonable Basis</STRONG><P>
		Finally, a taxpayer must show that it had a reasonable basis for treating the applicable workers as independent contractors to qualify for relief under Section 530.  This requirement can be met by satisfying any one of three safe harbors or by showing that the taxpayer had an "other reasonable basis" for classifying its workers as independent contractors.  The legislative history states that the reasonable basis requirement is to be construed liberally in favor of taxpayers, and the Training Guide repeats this command. <P>
			a.	Safe Harbors
			<P>	(1)	Judicial Precedent<P>
		The first safe harbor provides that a reasonable basis will exist where the employer can show that there is judicial precedent or published rulings, or a private letter ruling or determination letter issued with respect to the employer, supporting its position that the worker was an independent contractor.  The Internal Revenue Manual provides that in order to rely on judicial precedent or a revenue ruling, the taxpayer must document (particularly by the cases or arguments) how the issues in the precedents relied upon parallel the treatment of the taxpayer's similarly situated workers.  A taxpayer cannot rely on a precedent where additional substantial evidence of an employer-employee relationship exists.  However, given Congress' command in the legislative history that "reasonable basis" should be construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer, it should not be necessary to show identity of facts to rely on established precedent.  <P>
		Court cases provide little guidance as to the similarity of facts that must be shown.  The Service recognizes that the precedent relied on need not relate to the taxpayer's business or industry, and in one ruling, the Service allowed a taxpayer to rely on precedent with facts that were "generally similar" (i.e., the similarities outweighed the differences) to those present in the taxpayer's situation.  In more recent rulings, however, the Service has taken a stricter approach, seemingly requiring a near identity of facts before a taxpayer may rely on this safe harbor.  <P>
		One troubling point with this safe harbor should be acknowledged.  The statute provides that "the taxpayer's treatment of such individual for such period was in reasonable reliance" on judicial precedent, etc.  Based on this language, the Service takes the position that a taxpayer cannot rely on precedent decided after the years that are at issue in the audit (or presumably any years under audit that are prior to the court decision).  However, even if the Service's interpretation of this safe harbor is correct, a taxpayer still should be granted relief under Section 530 since a subsequent court decision rendered on similar facts shows that the taxpayer had an "other reasonable basis" beyond the safe harbor for classifying its workers as independent contractors.  <P>
		With regard to private letter rulings and determination letters, it is clear that a taxpayer cannot meet the safe harbor unless the taxpayer was the subject of the ruling or determination letter relied upon.  However, although private rulings issued to other parties and information letters will not qualify a taxpayer for relief under the "precedent" safe harbor, they also may provide the taxpayer with an "other reasonable basis" for its classification of the workers.  <P>
			(2)	Prior Audit<P>
		The second safe harbor under Section 530 provides that an employer can rely on a prior audit by the Service that did not result in the assessment of employment taxes, even if the prior audit was not an employment tax audit.  An "audit" must involve an official I.R.S. examination of the taxpayer's books; a compliance interview will not suffice.  In addition, audits conducted by agencies other than the Service will not qualify a taxpayer for relief under this safe harbor.  The audit of another party engaged in the same industry will not bring a taxpayer within the prior audit safe harbor, although such an audit may provide the taxpayer with an "other reasonable basis" for treating its workers as independent contractors.  <P>
		There appears to be no limitation as to when the audit may have occurred, although prior audits may be relied on only for avoiding deficiencies for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1977.  While taxpayers may rely on audits that were closed well before the period under examination, the statute requires that the workers who were the subject of the prior audit must hold positions that are substantially similar to the current workers, so it is important that the circumstances of the work relationship not have changed since the time of the prior audit.  <P>
		In order to qualify for the safe harbor, the prior audit must relate to the business of the taxpayer that hired the workers who are potentially subject to reclassification.  A business may rely on the audit of its predecessor in treating its workers as independent contractors.  However, an audit of the worker or of the individual that owns the corporation operating the business will not suffice.  In addition, where a common parent of an affiliated group is audited, the Service takes the position in its Training Guide that the subsidiary will not be entitled to relief unless it is examined in connection with the parent.  <P>
		As with the judicial precedent safe harbor, the Service will require taxpayers to show actual reliance upon the prior audit in deciding to treat workers as independent contractors.  However, the Training Guide states that in order to show such reliance, the taxpayer need only show that the class of workers currently under consideration were treated as independent contractors during the period covered by the prior audit. <P>
		According to the Training Guide, the taxpayer has the burden of showing that a prior audit took place.  The taxpayer can meet this burden by furnishing a copy of correspondence connected with an IRS audit.  In addition, if the taxpayer informs the examining agent that an audit was conducted in a particular year, the taxpayer will be deemed to have satisfied its burden if the Service can verify through existing records that the audit did occur.  <P>
			(3)	Industry Practice<P>
		Under the third safe harbor, an employer can rely on a long-standing recognized practice of a significant segment of the industry in which the services were performed of treating similarly situated workers as independent contractors.  There are several questions that must be answered in determining whether a taxpayer qualifies for this safe harbor.  <P>
		First, one must determine what constitutes a "recognized practice."  The most significant question here is what is the relevant area for determining whether the practice is recognized.  The Service initially argued that the practice of treating workers as independent contractors in the relevant industry must be recognized nationwide.  However, it now is generally accepted that the relevant area for evaluating the taxpayer's industry consists of the geographic region where businesses compete for the same customers and provide the same or similar services as the taxpayer.  Accordingly, the determination as to whether taxpayer's treatment of the workers constitutes a "recognized practice" ordinarily will be made by reference to the geographic area where the taxpayer conducts its business.  <P>
		It also is necessary to ascertain the "industry" in which the taxpayer is engaged.  There often are a number of segments that make up a broad industry.  The Service states in its Training Guide that the same standard used in determining the relevant geographical market (i.e., competitors for the same customers) should apply in determining the appropriate industry.  While this position is not illogical, the one court that has addressed this issue has taken a narrower view.  In addition to looking for those who competed for the same customers, the court looked for other parties who operated and were structured similar to the taxpayer in defining the relevant industry.  <P>
		The numerical standard for determining what constitutes a "significant segment" of the industry is far from clear.  An official at the Service has stated that this requirement would probably be satisfied where 80 percent of the businesses in the relevant industry treated their workers as independent contractors, and the Service has argued in one case that a "significant segment of the industry" means more than 50 percent of the members of the industry.  One court has indicated that an amount well below 75 percent could represent a "significant segment of the industry," while another has stated that a "significant segment" is less than a majority of the firms in an industry.  Still another court has stated, in dicta, that 39 percent of the relevant businesses would represent a "significant segment" of the industry.  
		<P>Finally, after a taxpayer has shown that the treatment of workers as independent contractors represents a "recognized practice in a significant segment of the industry," it is still necessary to prove that this practice has been "long-standing."  The Service has stated that there is no fixed time period that represents a "long-standing" industry practice.  The Training Guide indicates that satisfaction of the long-standing practice requirement is most clear where the industry has treated workers as independent contractors since 1978, when Section 530 was enacted, although it recognizes that taxpayers may use the industry practice safe harbor if it began business after 1978.  One court has held that seven years was sufficient to constitute a "long-standing" practice, while another has held that 10 years would qualify.  There is little other precedent or published guidance giving content to this requirement, and one certainly can argue that a shorter time period should be sufficient.
		<P>As with the other safe harbors, the Service requires that the taxpayer must actually have relied on the industry practice in determining to treat its workers as independent contractors.  According to the Training Guide, the taxpayer must show both how and when it knew of the industry practice.  If the taxpayer did not know of the industry practice at the time it began treating its workers as independent contractors, the Service believes that the industry practice safe harbor is not available.  Even if this is so, the fact that a significant number of businesses in the taxpayer's industry treat their workers as independent contractors could provide the taxpayer with an argument that it has an "other reasonable basis" outside the safe harbor for treating its workers as independent contractors. 
		<P>b.	Other Reasonable Basis
		<P>A taxpayer still may satisfy the "reasonable basis" requirement of Section 530 without satisfying any of the three safe harbors.  The legislative history states that Section 530 "grants relief if a taxpayer had any reasonable basis for treating workers as other than employees."  As mentioned above, Congress also has stated that the reasonable basis requirement is to be construed liberally in favor of taxpayers.  The Service has paid lip-service to this mandate.  However, in reality the Service's construction of this term has been anything but liberal.
		<P>The case law authority, while generally following a liberal construction, has failed to develop a consistent analysis or standard for determining whether a taxpayer has an "other reasonable basis" for treating its workers as independent contractors.  Existing authority can be divided into three categories, based upon the burden of proof imposed and the type of evidence that the courts considered.
		<P>The first line of cases analyze whether a taxpayer has a reasonable basis for treating its workers as non-employees by reference to the common law factors, but reduce the taxpayer's burden of proof in making this determination.  Ordinarily, the taxpayer must show by a preponderance of the evidence that its workers are independent contractors in order to avoid liability in an employment tax case.  However, in order to prevail under Section 530, this line of cases holds that the taxpayer need only show that it had a "reasonable basis" for treating its workers as independent contractors and need not show by a preponderance of the evidence that they are in fact independent contractors.
		<P>In determining whether the taxpayer has an "other reasonable basis," this line of cases analyze the same types of evidence that would be considered in an ordinary employment tax case where Section 530 did not apply.  These courts have not inquired into evidence affecting the subjective beliefs of the taxpayer, but merely looked at the facts surrounding the workers' relationships with the taxpayer to determine if it was objectively reasonable to treat such workers as independent contractors.  Only one of these courts specifically held that a taxpayer is precluded from showing a reasonable basis outside the safe harbors by any method other than by reference to the common law factors.  Presumably, the other courts would be willing to consider additional evidence indicating that the taxpayer had some other reasonable basis for classifying its workers as independent contractors.  
		<P>The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals recently called the validity of this line of cases into question in Boles Trucking, Inc. v. U.S..  In this case, the court held that it was reversible error for the lower court to instruct jurors that the taxpayer "need only show that the existence of a reasonable basis is just as likely true than not."  According to the court, "reasonable basis is what must be proved by the taxpayer -- it is not an expression regarding the level of proof or quantum of evidence."  Taxpayers still have to show by a preponderance of the evidence that they had a reasonable basis for classifying their workers as independent contractors.
		<P>The Eighth Circuit's analysis in Boles Trucking is not necessarily inconsistent with the authorities discussed above.  It is quite conceivable that a taxpayer could review the relevant worker classification authority and come to the reasonable conclusion that its workers are independent contractors although a court applying the preponderance of the evidence standard might hold that the workers are employees.  In other words, the burden of proof in showing that the workers were independent contractors is lowered because the determination is made by reference to a reasonable basis standard.  However, the burden of showing that the taxpayer's belief was objectively reasonable is still a preponderance of the evidence.  The jury instructions in Boles Trucking merely required the taxpayer to show that it more likely than not had a reasonable basis for treating its workers as independent contractors.  The real question should be "can the taxpayer show by a preponderance of the evidence that its belief regarding the classification of its workers was reasonable?".  The authorities that allow a finding of reasonable basis under the common law factors are consistent with this standard.  
		<P>The second line of authority utilizes a more subjective analysis in determining whether the taxpayer had an "other reasonable basis."  Under these cases, the taxpayer need not show that it has a reasonable basis under the traditional common law factors.  Instead, the taxpayer need only show that it took reasonable steps to determine the proper classification of its workers.  Here, courts are more willing to hear evidence that could affect the taxpayer's beliefs, not just evidence relating to the actual relationships with the workers.  Some cases have indicated that taxpayers may rely on the advice of attorneys and accountants in treating their workers as independent contractors.  Determinations by state agencies also may constitute a reasonable basis for treating workers as independent contractors for federal income taxes, although not all courts agree on this point.  
		<P>While this line of cases considers third party advice in determining whether the taxpayer had an "other reasonable basis," the taxpayer must show not just that it believed the advice rendered, but also that it was reasonable to rely on such advice.  Based upon statements contained in the Training Guide, the Service appears to agree with this analysis.  Under this line of reasoning, taxpayers should be prepared to show that they disclosed all relevant information to their counsel or the applicable agency and, in the case of counsel, that such party was knowledgeable with respect to employment tax matters.  
		<P>In addition to relying on advice of counsel and state agency determinations, one court has implied that a taxpayer may rely on the audit of another taxpayer involved in the same industry.  Also, while taxpayers may not rely on private letter rulings issued to third parties, they may use such rulings to show that the Service had repeatedly taken the position that similarly situated workers are non-employees.  Although these rulings may not prove that it was reasonable under the common law factors to treat workers as independent contractors, the fact that the Service consistently took this position in the form of private letter rulings and that the taxpayer was aware of the Service's position may be sufficient to show that it was reasonable for the taxpayer to believe that its workers were not employees, thus giving it an "other reasonable basis" for purposes of Section 530.
		<P>Finally, some courts not only consider evidence extraneous to the work relationship, but also lower the taxpayer's burden further, requiring only that the taxpayer exercise "good faith" in determining that its workers are independent contractors.  Under this line of analysis, the reasonableness of the taxpayer's actions will be measured in light of the taxpayer's own knowledge and experience.  Presumably, the inquiry required of an unsophisticated sole proprietor would be lower than the inquiry required by a large corporation that has greater awareness with respect to such matters.  
		<P>Numerous courts have paid lip-service to the "good faith" standard, but few courts have applied the standard in a way that would allow the taxpayer to blindly rely on the advice of others.  However, one case does seem to have gone this far.  In Queensgate Dental Family Practice, Inc. v. U.S., the taxpayer's sole inquiry was to the Pennsylvania Dental Board, which informed the taxpayer that it was illegal under state law for a non-licensed business corporation to enter into an employer/employee relationship with a licensed dentist.  Although the taxpayer provided the agency with no information regarding the details surrounding its relationship with the workers, the court held that Section 530 relief was appropriate based upon the taxpayer's "good faith inquiry" into the treatment of its members.
		<P>It appears that a taxpayer will proceed at some peril where it attempts to rely solely on a good faith determination that its workers are non-employees.  While the legislative history provides for a liberal construction of the reasonable basis standard, there is no clear justification for lowering the burden of proof so far as to require only a good faith inquiry.  However, it also seems inappropriate to limit taxpayers to a common law analysis in showing an "other reasonable basis."  First, the legislative history indicates that a taxpayer should be granted relief where it had any reasonable basis for treating its workers as other than employees.  Second, two of the three safe harbors (i.e., prior audit and industry practice) do not involve a common law analysis but relate to other facts that would cause a taxpayer to believe that its workers should be classified as independent contractors.  Accordingly, a taxpayer should be considered to have a reasonable basis for treating its workers as non-employees where a reasonable taxpayer would believe that its workers are independent contractors, whether determined under a common law analysis or otherwise.<P>
		<STRONG>4.	Application of Section 530 With Respect to Code §3401(d) "Payor Employers" and Other Third Parties<P>
</STRONG>
		While the application of Section 530 is fairly straightforward with respect to traditional employers, many complexities arise where this section is invoked on behalf of Code §3401(d) "payor employers" or other parties who are potentially liable for the penalties imposed under Code §3505 or 6672.  There is very little authority addressing these issues, so one generally is left to argue for the logical result.  <P>
			a.	Section 530 and Code §3401(d) "Payor Employers"
<P>
		The Service has ruled privately that Section 530 can apply with respect to Code §3401(d) "payor employers."  However, some field agents apparently have taken the position that such an employer cannot invoke Section 530.  The rationale is as follows:  Revenue Procedure 85-18 provides that Section 530 relief applies to taxes imposed under Code §§3101, 3102, 3111, 3301, 3402, and 3403.  Because the revenue procedure does not mention Code §3401, those parties who are subject to tax as "payors" under Code §3401(d) are not entitled to Section 530 relief.
	<P>	The position taken by these field agents is unjustified.  Revenue Procedure 85-18 refers only to those statutory provisions that impose an employment tax or withholding obligation on the taxpayer.  Code §3401(d) does not impose a tax; it merely determines who is an employer and thus who is subject to the tax and withholding obligations that are imposed under the provisions set forth in Revenue Procedure 85-18.  Accordingly, despite the contention of these misguided field agents, Code §3401(d) "payor employers" should be eligible for relief under Section 530 where they can meet the requirements of the statute.
		<P>It is unclear how the reasonable basis requirement of Section 530 should be applied with respect to "payor employers."  Presumably, the taxpayer must show that it had a reasonable basis for not treating the workers as its common law employees.  This should not be difficult since, if the Service is attempting to impose liability under the "payor" portion of Code §3401(d), the taxpayer obviously did not exercise extensive controls over the workers.  However, the inquiry probably does not end there.  It is likely that the taxpayer also must show that it had a reasonable basis for not treating the workers as its deemed employees under Code §3401(d).  
		<P>If the taxpayer has undergone a prior audit where it was not determined that the workers were employees or if it is the practice of third party payors in the taxpayer's industry to treat similarly situated workers as independent contractors, the taxpayer should satisfy the reasonable basis requirement regardless of how the relationship is analyzed.  In addition, the taxpayer should satisfy this requirement where it had a reasonable basis for concluding that it did not "control" the payment of wages to the employees.  However, if none of these arguments are available to the taxpayer, there presumably must be some analysis of the relationship between the service recipient and the deemed employee to determine if the "payor employer" satisfies the reasonable basis requirement.  
		<P>If there is judicial precedent or published rulings that would justify the service recipient in treating the workers as independent contractors were it the payor of such workers, that certainly should be enough to protect the Code §3401(d) "payor employer."  Advice that the workers are not employees of the taxpayer from a professional who is experienced in employment tax matters and is fully apprised of the facts surrounding the relationship also should be sufficient to show an "other reasonable basis."  But what happens if the taxpayer understood the underlying facts of the relationship between the workers and service recipient to be such that they would indicate that the workers were independent contractors when, actually, the facts were different and more indicative of an employment relationship?  Should the analysis be with respect to the facts as they actually existed or with respect to the taxpayer's perception of the facts?  Given the Congressional mandate that Section 530's reasonable basis requirement should be liberally construed, it seems that as long as the taxpayer was reasonable in its belief of the facts underlying the relationship, it should be the taxpayer's perception of the facts that control in determining whether the taxpayer had a reasonable basis for concluding that the workers were not its employees.
			<P>b.	Section 530 Relief Where Liability is Imposed Under Code §3505 or 6672
<P>
		Where a taxpayer can satisfy the requirements of Section 530, it is entitled to relief from liability for employment taxes.  Because neither Code §3505 or 6672 impose an employment tax, but instead impose liability in the form of a penalty equal to the employment taxes owed, the question arises as to whether a taxpayer who is subject to liability under either of these provisions can claim relief under Section 530.  
	<P>	Revenue Procedure 85-18 apparently answers this question affirmatively.  The revenue procedure provides that <P>
If a taxpayer is relieved from liability under section 530(a)(1) of the Act, liability for interest or penalties attributable to that liability is forgiven automatically.  The relief from interest and penalties applies whether charged directly against the taxpayer or personally against a corporate taxpayer's officers.
<P>
The language highlighted at the end of this quote clearly is made with reference to the 100 percent penalty imposed under Code §6672.  There is no valid basis for distinguishing the penalty imposed under Code §6672 from the one levied under Code §3505, given that both derive from the employment tax liability of the underlying employer.  Thus, parties who may be subject to liability under Code §3505 should be entitled to relief under Section 530 as well.<P>
		Based upon the language in Revenue Procedure 85-18, it appears that relief from liability under Code §§3505 and 6672 is derivative from qualification of the underlying employer for Section 530 relief.	 Accordingly, the various inquiries to be applied in determining qualification under Section 530 will be made by reference to the underlying employer and not the party from whom the Service is trying to collect.  This is logical:  Because the parties against whom liability is being imposed are not actually "employers," the questions of whether they treated the workers as non-employees or had a reasonable basis for doing so are not really appropriate.  However, the fact that the taxpayer's fate under Section 530 lies in the hands of another party (i.e., the underlying employer) can cause some significant problems.  Namely, the taxpayer, particularly one who is potentially subject to liability under Code §3505, may not have access to records and other information with respect to the underlying employer which are necessary to show that relief under Section 530 is available.  For instance, without the cooperation of the underlying employer, how can the taxpayer show that the employer filed all applicable returns with respect to the workers, that the workers were always treated as independent contractors, or that the employer was previously subject to an audit where the workers were not determined to be employees?  It is these logistical questions, rather than legal questions, that often will cause the greatest anguish in trying to gain Section 530 relief for parties who otherwise will be subject to liability under Code §3505 or 6672.  
		<P>A recent case, Crowd Management Services, Inc. v. U.S., indicates that a responsible person need not go so far as satisfying Section 530 to avoid liability under Code §6672.  In that case, the corporation failed to satisfy Section 530 because it previously had treated similarly situated workers as employees.  Nonetheless, the court found that because the responsible person had a "reasonable basis" for believing that the workers were independent contractors and that no withholding was required, the Service could not show that he "willfully" failed to withhold taxes.  Accordingly, Code §6672 did not apply.  <P>
		<P><STRONG>5.	Whipsawing the Government Under Section 530</STRONG><P>
		As discussed above, Section 530 relief should be available on both a retroactive and prospective basis.  Therefore, even if the agent determines that the workers are employees, where Section 530 applies, the taxpayer will not be liable for past employment taxes and will not be required to pay employment taxes with respect to the workers on a going-forward basis.  In addition, because Section 530 does not recharacterize the workers as independent contractors, where the workers have considered themselves to be independent contractors and have paid the self-employment tax attributable to their wages, they will be entitled to a refund of the amount of self-employment tax paid.  The refund will be reduced by the worker's share of FICA tax imposed under Code §3101, but even after this offset, the worker will receive back approximately half of the self-employment tax paid.  In addition, since the worker will be classified as an employee on a going forward basis, in the future it will be required to pay only its share of the FICA tax and will no longer be subject to the self-employment tax.  Accordingly, it often will be to the government's advantage to find that the taxpayer's workers are not employees where the taxpayer otherwise would be entitled to relief under Section 530.  <P>
		This point is strategic and could convince an I.R.S. agent to determine that workers are actually independent contractors rather than finding that they are employees.  This could be important if the taxpayer is concerned that the scope of the audit could expand to consider the qualification of its retirement plans or other issues on which an employment determination could have an impact.  This also could be important if Section 530 is eventually amended and the taxpayer's prospective protection is terminated (which is a very real possibility).<P>
	<STRONG>B.	Partial Relief from FICA and Income Tax Withholding Under Code §3509
</STRONG><P>
		<STRONG>1.	In General</STRONG>
<P>
		Code §3509 provides some relief where an employer fails to deduct and withhold income tax and the employee's share of FICA tax with respect to any employee "by reason of treating such an employee as not being an employee."  Code §3509 provides for two levels of relief.  The degree of relief that a taxpayer is entitled to under Code §3509 essentially is dependent on whether the taxpayer has satisfied certain filing requirements or has shown that its failure to satisfy these requirements was reasonable.  
	<P>	Code §3509 does not provide for relief with respect to FUTA taxes imposed under Code §3301 or the employer's share of FICA taxes imposed under Code §3111.  It applies only to "trust fund" or withholding taxes.  Where the taxpayer can show that it did not intentionally disregard the requirement to deduct and withhold tax from the employee's wages and that it met the reporting requirements applicable under Code §§6041(a), 6041A, and 6051, the employer's liability for income tax withholding will be limited to 1.5 percent of the wages paid to such employee, and the employer's liability for the employee's share of FICA taxes will equal 20 percent of the amount that otherwise would be imposed without the application of Code §3509.  The reporting requirements are determined as if the taxpayer had treated the worker as not being an employee and generally will be satisfied where the employer has timely filed Form 1099 with respect to the worker and has timely filed Form 1096 including the worker for the applicable period.  Where the worker misclassification was not due to intentional disregard, but the taxpayer failed to satisfy the reporting requirements and such failure was not due to reasonable cause, the taxpayer's liability will double so that it becomes liable for income tax withholding in an amount equal to three percent of wages paid and 40 percent of the employee's share of FICA taxes that otherwise would have been due.  Code §3509 will not apply where the taxpayer's liability for employment taxes is due to intentional disregard of the requirement to deduct and withhold such taxes.  
		<P>The benefits afforded by Code §3509 are not available in certain circumstances even where the taxpayer's failure to pay employment taxes was not due to intentional disregard of the applicable rules.  Code §3509 will not apply with respect to any wages where the taxpayer deducted and withheld income tax from such wages but failed to deduct and withhold the employee's share of FICA taxes.  A taxpayer also will not be eligible for protection under Code §3509 with respect to wages paid to statutory employees described in Code §3121(d)(3).  For purposes of this determination, if an individual would be treated as an employee under Code §3121(d)(3) but for the fact that he or she is an employee under Code §3121(d)(1) or (2), the individual will be treated as an employee under Code §3121(d)(3) so that Code §3509 will not apply.
		<P>A taxpayer will not be excused from the payment of penalties, additions to tax, or additional amounts otherwise applicable when Code §3509 applies.  However, the amount of such penalties or other additions will be calculated as if the amount of tax determined under Code §3509 were the amount that the taxpayer was required to deduct, withhold, and pay over.
		<P>Where Code §3509 applies, a taxpayer is not entitled to recover from the employee for taxes ultimately collected from the taxpayer.  While income tax and FICA withholding reported and paid over by the taxpayer with respect to the applicable employees will be credited against the employer's liability under Code §3509, the taxpayer cannot take advantage of Code §§3402 and 6521 to credit taxes paid by the employee against its Code §3509 liability.   In addition, the Service takes the position that Code §3509 is mandatory and a taxpayer cannot voluntarily elect out of its application even where crediting employee-paid taxes under Code §§3402 and 6521 would produce a better result.  This can make Code §3509 disadvantageous to taxpayers employing compliant workers who paid their taxes.  However, because the information taxpayers must collect in order to take advantage of Code §§3402 and 6521 often will not be available, Code §3509 generally will provide a better result.  
		<P><STRONG>2.	Code §3509 Relief Where Liability is Imposed Under Code §3505 or 6672</STRONG><P>

		Because Code §3509 only applies to reduce an "employer's liability" with respect to "taxes" imposed under chapter24 (income tax withholding) and subchapterA of chapter21 (employee FICA withholding) of the Code, there is some question as to whether relief should be available to parties who incur liability under Code §3505 or 6672.  Payors under Code §§3505 and 6672 are not treated as "employers" but are merely liable as third parties.  Accordingly, reducing the liability of such payors does not reduce the "employer's liability" for taxes.  Likewise, under both sections, the payor is not considered to actually pay the "taxes" referred to in Code §3509; instead, in the case of §3505, the party pays a penalty equal to the "taxes ... required to be deducted and withheld" and, in the case of Code §6672, a penalty equal to the "tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over."  
		<P>In spite of these technical problems, one can argue that because the liability imposed under Code §§3505 and 6672 derives from the income tax withholding and employee FICA withholding obligations imposed on the employer, these parties should be entitled to take advantage of Code §3509 where the underlying taxpayer qualifies for such relief.  The Service has already accepted this reasoning with respect to parties that are subject to liability under Code §6672 in the context of Section 530 even though this section only provides for relief from liability for "employment taxes."  There does not seem to be any rational basis for applying a different analysis in the context of Code §3509.  
		<P>As is the case with third parties seeking relief under Section 530, there may be practical barriers to such parties qualifying for relief under Code §3509.  First, it may be difficult to prove that the taxpayer did not intentionally disregard the requirement to deduct and withhold the tax.  Second, a third party also will have difficulty showing that the employer fulfilled the applicable reporting requirements.  Code §6672 responsible parties often were officers of the employer and thus may have access to this information.  However, Code §3505 lenders, sureties, and other persons generally are unrelated to the employer.  Accordingly, in many instances, these parties will be unable to gain access to information necessary to prove that these requirements have been fulfilled.  
	<P><STRONG>C.	Credit for Employee-Paid Taxes</STRONG><P>
		Code §3402(d) provides that where an employer fails to deduct and withhold income tax, but such tax is subsequently paid by the worker or some other party, the tax shall not be collected from the employer.  In order to claim such relief, the employer must show that the underlying tax, in fact, has been paid.  While this section relieves employers from liability for the underlying tax, it does not relieve employers for any penalties or other additions attributable to such tax.  <P>
		Code §6521 provides somewhat comparable relief with respect to FICA and self-employment taxes.  Under Code §6521(a), employer's liability for failure to deduct and withhold the employee's share of FICA taxes will be reduced by the amount of self-employment tax paid by the employee where certain conditions are satisfied.  Specifically, an amount must have been erroneously treated as self-employment income, the correction must require an assessment against the employer and a refund of self-employment tax to the employee, and the correction of the error must be allowed as to the employer's liability for FICA tax but prevented as to the employee's refund of self-employment tax by any rule of law.  This provision generally will apply only when the statute of limitations remains open with respect to the employer but is closed with respect to the employee, thus preventing the employee from filing a claim for refund.  <P>
		<P>Like Code §3509, these provisions do not affect the employer's liability for its share of FICA or FUTA taxes.  In addition, as stated above, where Code §3509 applies, the employer may not take advantage of the relief provided under Code §3402(d) or 6521.  
<H4>VI.	Penalties and Interest
</H4>		The Service may assess interest and a variety of penalties in connection with employment tax deficiencies.  However, as is the case with the deficiencies themselves, a number of relief provisions are available that can limit or even eliminate a taxpayer's liability with respect to such amounts.  
<P><STRONG>A.	Penalty for Failure to Deposit Taxes
</STRONG>		<P>An employer is required to deposit with the Government depositary the employee's share of FICA tax, the employer's share of FICA tax, and income taxes withheld from an employee's wages.  Code §6656 provides that where a person fails to deposit such taxes by the prescribed date, a penalty equal to the applicable percentage of the amount of the underpayment shall be imposed.  The applicable percentage equals two percent where the failure is not for more than five days, five percent where the failure is for more than five days but not more than 15 days, and ten percent if the failure is for more than 15 days.  <P>
		The penalty for failure to deposit taxes will not apply where the taxpayer can show that "such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect."  Likewise, where the taxpayer treats its workers as independent contractors rather than employees and thus fails to withhold income tax and the employee's share of FICA taxes, the penalty under Code §6656 will apply only with respect to the employer's share of FICA taxes and not with respect to the other taxes which the taxpayer failed to pay over because it did not actually withhold such taxes.  <P>
<STRONG>B.	Penalty for Failure to File Appropriate Returns
</STRONG><P>		An employer is required to file Forms 940 (FUTA) and 941 (social security and income tax withholding) quarterly with respect to wages paid during such quarter.  Where such forms are not filed, Code §6651(a)(1) imposes a penalty equal to five percent of the amount of tax required to be shown on the return, provided that the form is not more than one month overdue.  For each additional month, the penalty increases by an additional five percent up to a maximum of 25 percent.  The penalty is greater where fraud is involved.  <P>
		If the failure to file Forms 940 and 941 is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, no penalty will be imposed.  In addition, many taxpayers will have filed Forms 940 and 941 with respect to workers that it properly classified as employees.  The mere fact that additional workers reclassified as employees were not included on the return should not cause the penalty to apply.  This failure to file penalty is not invoked by the mere underreporting of tax due.  
<P><STRONG>C.	Interest
</STRONG><P>		Under the general rule, interest will accrue with respect to employment tax deficiencies at the statutory underpayment rate from the last date prescribed for the payment of such tax.  However, if the taxpayer can negotiate an acceptable settlement for the amount of tax due, payment of interest can be avoided.  Where a taxpayer pays the proposed deficiency prior to receipt from the Service of a notice and demand for payment, there will be no assessment of interest.  Even if the potential interest is significant but a settlement cannot be achieved, it may be worth paying the full amount of the proposed deficiency prior to receipt of such a notice and demand and then suing for a refund.
	<P>	There are certain situations where the Service will not allow an interest free adjustment even though the tax is paid before receipt of a notice and demand for payment.  Specifically, such an adjustment will be denied where the taxpayer's returns were audited for prior years and additional tax was found to be due with respect to the same issue involved in the current audit.  Also, where a taxpayer has been informed by the Service of its status as an employer and knowingly underreports its employment tax liability in subsequent years, the interest free adjustment will not be allowed.
<P>
<H4>VII.	Statute of Limitations
</H4>		One last legal issue that must be considered in handling an employment tax audit is the statute of limitations.  In general, employment taxes must be assessed within three years after the taxpayer filed its return for the applicable period.  Where a return covering FICA tax and income tax withholding (i.e., Form 941) for any period ending with or within a calendar year is filed before April15 of the succeeding calendar year, the return will be deemed filed on April15 of such succeeding calendar year.  
		<P>One court has held that the filing of a Form 1099 for a worker will not start the statute of limitations for taxes due with respect to that worker where it is determined that the worker should have been classified as an employee.  The court based its holding on the conclusion that the Form 1099 would not allow an IRS agent to determine the amount of tax due since it did not indicate that the worker/recipient was an employee.  From a policy perspective, this holding is questionable since it effectively eliminates the statute of limitations for employment taxes where a company uses only independent contractors in its operations.  In reality, however, few companies have zero employees.  Assuming that a company files Forms 940 and 941 with respect to the workers it classifies as employees, the statute of limitations should be triggered for all employment taxes attributable to the period covered by the returns, regardless of whether the workers subject to reclassification were included in the returns.
<P>
<H4>VIII.	The Service's New Settlement Programs</H4>
		At the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business and at a number of town meetings with small business owners sponsored by the Service, the participants identified worker classification as one of their primary concerns.  In an effort to ease the taxpayers' burden in resolving employment tax audits, the Service has developed two test programs.  These programs are discussed below.
	<P><STRONG>A.	The Classification Settlement Program</STRONG><P>
		The Classification Settlement Program ("CSP") establishes an optional settlement program that is designed to allow resolution of worker classification cases as early in the administrative process as possible and to ensure that Section 530 is properly and consistently applied.  The CSP will allow examining agents to offer businesses a worker classification settlement using a standard closing agreement.<P>
		Under the CSP, the examiner must develop the various issues relevant to the audit, which will include gathering facts to determine whether improper classification has occurred, whether Section 530 is available, and whether the taxpayer is eligible for a CSP offer.  The agent then must consult with the examination group manager, who will confirm or deny the taxpayer's eligibility for a CSP settlement off.  If the offer is made and the taxpayer chooses to accept it, the parties will sign a CSP closing agreement based on a standard closing agreement provided by the National Office.<P>
		Taxpayers may qualify for a series of graduated settlement offers under the CSP depending upon the facts of their case.  If the taxpayer has filed the appropriate returns with respect to the workers as required by Section 530 ("reporting consistency"), but either has not treated similarly situated workers as independent contractors ("substantive consistency") or clearly cannot satisfy the reasonable basis requirement under Section 530, the offer will be a full employment tax assessment for one taxable year computed using Code §3509, if applicable.  If the taxpayer satisfies the reporting consistency requirement and has a colorable argument that it meets the substantive consistency requirement and the reasonable basis test, the offer will be an assessment of 25 percent of the withholding and FICA tax liability for the audit year, again computed using Code §3509, if applicable, along with 100 percent of the FUTA tax liability.  In accepting either settlement, the taxpayer must agree to reclassify its workers prospectively.<P>
		If a taxpayer clearly meets the reporting and substantive consistency requirements and satisfies the reasonable test under Section 530, all of the requirements of Section 530 will be met.  Under this scenario, no assessment will be made and the taxpayer may continue treating its workers as independent contractors.  However, if the taxpayer wishes to begin treating its workers as employees, the taxpayer will not give up its claim to Section 530 relief for prior years.<P>
		If a taxpayer fails to satisfy the reporting consistency requirement, it will not be eligible to participate in the CSP.  A taxpayer may qualify for more than one CSP offer if multiple classes of workers are at issue.  <P>
		Participation in the CSP is entirely voluntary, and a taxpayer may accept a CSP settlement offer at any time during the examination process.  In declining such a CSP offer, the taxpayer will not waive any of its rights to a conventional administrative appeal with the Service or any of its rights to judicial review.<P>
		The CSP is being implemented on a two-year basis, beginning on March 5, 1996, and the future of the program beyond the two-year period will depend on its success during that time.  The CSP will be available to any taxpayer with an open case in either IRS Examination or Appeals on March 5, 1996 or who has a case initiated during the two-year period thereafter.  <P>
	<STRONG>B.	Early Referral to Appeals
	</STRONG><P>	In Revenue Procedure 96-9, the Service set forth a process through which a taxpayer could request referral to Appeals of any developed, unagreed issue (subject to certain exceptions) that is under the jurisdiction of the District Director arising from an examination.  The Revenue Procedure was developed in an effort to resolve cases more expeditiously by having Examination and Appeals work simultaneously.  The Service has now published an announcement applying the provisions of the Revenue Procedure 96-9 to employment tax issues on a one-year test basis.
		<P>According to the announcement, issues considered appropriate for early referral include those that if resolved can reasonably be expected to result in quicker resolution of the entire case and that both the taxpayer and the District Director agree should be referred to Appeals early.  Examples of employment tax issues considered appropriate for early referral include worker classification issues such as whether a worker is a common law or statutory employee or a statutory non-employee, whether Section530 or Code §3509 applies, and whether the taxpayer qualifies for an interest-free adjustment under Code §6205, as well as other issues such as whether certain payments are excepted from the definition of "wages" and whether certain services are excepted from the definition of "employment."  
		<P>A taxpayer may request early referral by submitting such a request in writing to the case manager.  The announcement states that a "case manager" includes Compliance, Examination, Collection, and EP/EO group managers.
		<P>Once the issue is approved for transfer to Appeals, the procedure is similar to the procedure that follows when a proposed notice of deficiency is issued (i.e., a "thirty-day letter").  The District Director will prepare and send to the taxpayer an employment tax report for each approved early referral issue which identifies the amount of employment taxes in dispute, describes the issues, and describes the District Director's position.  The taxpayer must then respond in writing to the Director's report in a manner similar to that which would be provided in an Appeals protest.  The taxpayer's response must be submitted to the case manager within 30 days of the date of the District Director's report, but the 30-day requirement may be extended with the case manager's consent.  After the taxpayer has filed its response, the early referral file is sent to Appeals and the issues are handled essentially according to Appeals' normal operating procedures.  If an agreement is not reached at Appeals with respect to an issue, Appeals will close the early referral file and return jurisdiction to Examination.  Appeals will not reconsider an early referral issue if the entire case is later referred to Appeals, unless the circumstances relating to the early referral issue have changed substantially.  
<P>
<H4>IX.	Conclusion
</H4>		Conducting an employment tax audit traditionally has been a very frustrating and difficult task, but given the Service's apparent new-found attitude in the context of worker classification issues, there is hope that undertaking such an audit may become a more manageable endeavor.  Only time will tell whether the Service's programs will have a significant effect on the examining agents in the field.   
<P>		Even anticipating the Service's more lenient approach, the factual and legal issues involved in an employment tax audit are numerous and complex so representing a taxpayer will continue to require substantial knowledge and preparation.  This article has attempted to set forth a guide to the various issues that can arise in an employment tax audit and the manner in which such issues should be resolved.  By anticipating the arguments that the government will present and realizing the weapons that are available to combat such arguments, the chances of obtaining a favorable result should be greatly increased.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996: Making the Transition to
a More Competitive Telephone Industry</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="http:/htm/coen.htm">Timothy F. Coen</A></H2>
<H6 ALIGN="CENTER">This article originally appeared in the November 1996 issue
of <EM>Legal Trends Advisory for Corporate Leaders</EM>. Reproduced by
permission.</H6>
<HR>
<P>The passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &quot;Act&quot;)
radically alters the rules governing the U.S. telephone industry.  As described
recently by the Federal Communications Commission (&quot;FCC&quot;), two of the
principal goals established by the telephony provisions of the Act are:  (1)
opening the local exchange and exchange access markets to competitive entry, and
(2) promoting increased competition in telecommunications markets that are
already open to competition, including the long distance services market.</P>
<H3>OPENING LOCAL TELEPHONE MARKETS TO COMPETITION</H3>
<P>The principal method employed by the Act to accomplish the goal of
increasing local competition is the wholesale elimination of artificial legal
and regulatory barriers to entry as a matter of preemptive federal law.  In
particular, under Section 253 of the Act, Congress eliminates nearly a century
of local telephone monopolies by sweepingly prohibiting &quot;all state or local
statutes, regulations or other legal requirements that may prohibit or have the
effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or
intrastate telecommunications service.&quot;  The states retain authority to
impose competitively-neutral rules to ensure universal and quality local service
within their jurisdictions, but the FCC is given ultimate authority to preempt
state or local rules to the extent they are inconsistent with the terms of
Section 253 of the Act.</P>
<P>In order to successfully make the transition to a more competitive
telecommunications marketplace, however, Congress had to do more than tear down
existing statutory and regulatory entry barriers.  It also had to address
defacto entry barriers created by the existence of historical monopolies and it
had to create a new industry structure for the provision of competitive local
telephone service.  Congress addressed these issues by imposing specific legal
duties on new and incumbent providers and by conditioning incumbent providers'
access to new markets on the opening of their existing markets to competition.
</P>
<P>Under Section 251 of the Act, for example, Congress imposes on all
telecommunications carriers a new legal duty to interconnect with each others'
networks.  This overarching legal duty is intended to replace the previous
monopoly driven industry structure and to create a new duty of common carriage
among carriers, rather than just to end-users, which did not exist prior to the
Act.  </P>
<P>To address technical and operational barriers, the Act also places new legal
duties on all local telephone companies (a &quot;LEC&quot;), whether incumbent
providers or new entrants.  LECs are required to permit others to resell their
services and to provide certain other network features, such as number
portability (the ability of customers to retain, at the same location, their
existing phone number if they change carriers) and dialing parity (the ability
of customers to automatically route their calls to their presubscribed local or
long distance provider without having to dial an access code).  LECs must also
grant competing providers access to their rights of way and must enter into
reciprocal compensation arrangements with other carriers for the transport and
termination of telecommunications traffic. </P>
<P>Lastly, Congress placed a third set of specific additional duties solely on
companies providing local phone service as of the date the Act passed (known as
&quot;incumbent local exchange companies&quot; or &quot;ILECs&quot;).  The Act
requires ILECs to negotiate in good faith the terms of their interconnection
agreements and to provide interconnection to competing providers on just,
reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms at &quot;any technically feasible point&quot;
in their network.  The quality of interconnection provided must be equal to that
which the ILEC provides itself and its affiliates.  In addition, ILECs must (1)
unbundle their networks so that other competing carriers can buy on a &quot;cost-plus&quot;
basis only those facilities they need to provide service to their customers, and
(2) offer their retail telecommunications services to competing service
providers at &quot;wholesale rates&quot; for resale.</P>
<H3>INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE LONG DISTANCE MARKET</H3>
<P>The Act also seeks to enhance competition in the already competitive long
distance industry by authorizing the entry of the Regional Bell Operating
Companies (&quot;RBOCs&quot;) into a market from which they have been prohibited
since the breakup of the Bell System in 1983.</P>
<P>The Act permits the RBOCs to engage in &quot;incidental&quot; long distance
service and in long distance service for calls originating outside their local
service territories immediately.  However, the Act conditions the RBOCs
provision of so-called &quot;in region long distance service&quot; (i.e.  long
distance service for calls originating in their local service territory where
they currently have a strong customer base) on the opening of their local
telephone markets to competition.  Thus, under Section 271 of the Act, an RBOC
will be allowed to provide in-region long distance service only when it faces
facilities-based competition (as opposed to resale competition) in its local
telephone market in a particular state, and has otherwise met a 14 point &quot;competitive
checklist&quot; set out in the Act.  Once an RBOC has met these conditions, it
must then apply to the FCC on a state by state basis for a finding that the
RBOC's entry into the in-region long distance business in that state meets the
statutory test and is in the public interest.</P>
<H3>NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW CHALLENGES</H3>
<P>Under the Act, increased competition is intended to supplant regulation in
all segments of the telephony marketplace.  Congress has outlined a new industry
structure and has supplied a roadmap for the development of competitive entry
into the local and long distance telephone markets.  Proponents of the Act
expect competition to create new economic opportunities and to bring new
packages of services, lower prices and increased innovation to residential and
business consumers.  Certainly, the transition to a more competitive telephone
industry will present tremendous opportunities and tremendous challenges to the
U.S. telephony industry.  </P>
<P>Businesses in particular will have access to new markets and to a dizzying
array of new services and service providers.  Rather than relying on regulators
and &quot;one size fits all&quot; tariffs to determine what services will be
available and at what cost, businesses will have the opportunity to obtain
customized service packages and, in some cases, to negotiate their own deals
with their telecommunications provider.  Additional cost savings and better
service will be available to large users by aggregating their local and long
distance traffic to obtain greater volume discounts and requiring end to end
service guarantees from their service provider.  These new opportunities will
challenge business users and their advisors to understand the marketplace, the
communications needs of their business and their service provider's capabilities
better than they have ever had to in the past.</P>
<P>Perhaps the ultimate challenge of the new industry structure created by
Congress in the Act will be to maintain the quality, affordability and universal
access of the previous system and to make it better by lowering cost and
increasing innovation through the introduction of efficient competition into the
marketplace.  </P>

<HR>
<P>The number of users connected to the Internet doubles approximately every
year.  By one estimate as many as 40 million users currently are connected to
the Internet.  As Internet use has expanded, state and federal governments have
taken notice and have attempted to regulate this new medium.  Recent decisions
reviewing the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, 47
U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)-(h) (the &quot;CDA&quot;), indicate that regulations in
this area may be difficult to enforce.</P>
<P>The CDA was signed into law as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996
and was designed to limit the exposure of children to sexually explicit
materials available &quot;on-line.&quot;  The day the CDA became law, two
separate lawsuits were filed to test its constitutionality.  Both cases held
that because the CDA restricts speech based on content, its constitutionality is
judged under a &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard: it &quot;will only be
upheld if it is justified by a compelling government interest and if it is
narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest.&quot;  <I>American Civil
Liberties Union v. Reno</I>, 929 F. Supp. 824, 851 (E.D. Pa. 1996).  See also
<I>Shea v. Reno</I>, 930 F. Supp. 916, 939 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).</P>
<P>In analyzing whether the CDA met the strict scrutiny test, the reviewing
courts first heard extensive testimony and argument regarding the nature of the
Internet and the state of its technology.  This was necessary because &quot;differential
treatment of the mass media has become established First Amendment doctrine. ...
 This medium-specific approach to mass communication examines the underlying
technology of the communication to find the proper fit between First Amendment
values and competing interests.&quot;  <I>ACLU v. Reno, </I>929 F. Supp. at
873.</P>
<P>With respect to the nature of the Internet, the court in <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>
found that &quot;[i]t is no exaggeration to conclude that the content on the
Internet is as diverse as human thought. ...  Such diversity of content on the
Internet is possible because the Internet provides an easy and inexpensive way
for a speaker to reach a large audience, potentially of millions. ...  The
Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium of communication.&quot; 
Id. at 842, 843, 844.  See also <I>Shea v. Reno</I>, 930 F. Supp. at 929-30.</P>
<P>In assessing whether, given the current state of Internet technology, the
CDA is sufficiently &quot;narrowly tailored,&quot; the courts concluded that &quot;content
providers using most forms of Internet communication have no way of transmitting
indecent content with certainty that it will not reach a minor.&quot;   Id. at
941.  See also <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>, 929 F. Supp. at 845.  The courts found that
the inability of the technology to limit minors' access to allegedly indecent
material impermissibly chilled otherwise protected speech, and rendered the CDA
overbroad--&quot;[b]ecause adults would lack means of engaging in
constitutionally protected indecent communications over the Internet without
fear of criminal liability, the statute would unquestionably be
unconstitutional.&quot;  <I>Shea v. Reno</I>, 930 F. Supp. at 942.  See also
<I>ACLU v. Reno</I>, 929 F. Supp. at 854.</P>
<P>The trend toward regulation of Internet content and communications may
therefore be in for a rough road.  &quot;As the most participatory form of mass
speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from
governmental intrusion.&quot;  <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>, 929 F. Supp. at 883. 
Because the current state of technology makes it difficult if not impossible for
many content providers to selectively deliver content over the Internet to
identifiable users, Internet regulations will be suspect unless access
limitations imposed on content providers are feasible given the state of
technology at the time the regulations are enacted.  As Internet technology
advances, however, the government's ability to regulate communications over the
Internet may concomitantly increase.</P>

<HR>
<P>For many small businesses, the main barrier to competition and growth in the
telecommunications industry is lack of access to capital. In one of the
provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &quot;Act&quot;), Congress
has created a new source of funding to encourage the entry of small businesses
into the telecommunications industry.</P>
<P>Section 707 of the Act adds a new section 714 to the Communications Act of
1934 which establishes the Telecommunications Development Fund (&quot;TDF&quot;).
 The purpose of the TDF is threefold: (1) to promote access to capital for small
businesses in order to enhance competition in the telecommunications industry,
(2) to stimulate new technology development and promote employment and training,
and (3) to support universal service and promote delivery of telecommunications
services to underserved rural and urban areas.  </P>
<P>The TDF will be capitalized, in part, from the interest that accrues on the
deposits made by bidders in the Federal Communications Commission (&quot;FCC&quot;)
spectrum auctions.  Within forty-five (45) days of an auction's conclusion, the
interest accrued from the deposits of bidders will be placed into the TDF.  The
provision requiring auction bidders' upfront payments to be placed into an
interest-bearing account is one of the more innovative approaches to raising
capital ever taken by Congress and the FCC.  The TDF is also authorized to
receive capital from funds appropriated to the FCC for advances to the TDF,
contributions and donations, and any repayment of, or payment made with respect
to, loans, equity, or other credit extensions made from the TDF.  The TDF has
over $7 million in interest from auctions in it today, but it is expected to
grow larger from future auctions and contributions or donations.   </P>
<P>All funds deposited with the TDF will be used solely for making loans,
investments, and other extensions of credit to eligible small businesses,
providing financial advice to eligible small businesses, and other
administrative purposes.  A small business is eligible to apply for a loan or
other credit extension from the TDF if it is engaged in the &quot;telecommunications
industry&quot; and its annual revenue is $50 million or less on average over the
past three (3) years prior to submitting its application.  Under the Act, the
term &quot;telecommunications industry&quot; is defined broadly to include
communications businesses using regulated or unregulated facilities or services
and includes broadcasting, telecommunications, cable, computer, data
transmission, software, programming, advanced messaging, and electronics
businesses.   </P>
<P>Section 714 provides that loans and other credit extensions to eligible
small businesses will be based on the following criteria: (1) the analysis of
the business plan of the eligible small business, (2) the reasonable
availability of collateral to secure the loan or credit extension, (3) the
extent to which the loan or credit extension promotes the purposes of the TDF,
and (4) other lending policies as defined by the TDF Board of Directors. </P>
<P>For further information concerning the status of the TDF, contact the FCC's
Office of Communications Business Opportunities at 202-418-0990 or see the FCC's
web site at <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov">http://www.fcc.gov</A>.</P>

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">States Remain at the Forefront of the Telecommunications
Revolution </H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A HREF="http:/htm/sibley.htm">Horace H. Sibley</A></H2>
<H6 ALIGN="CENTER">This article originally appeared in the November 1996 issue
of <EM>Legal Trends Advisory for Corporate Leaders</EM>. Reproduced by
permission.</H6>
<HR>
<P>With this year's passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the
recent attempt by the Federal Communications Commission (&quot;FCC&quot;) to
establish nationwide rules for pricing and interconnection of competitive local
telephone service, a great deal of attention has been focused on
telecommunications activity at the federal level.  However, prior to the latest
federal action a number of states had already passed legislation to authorize
local competition and many were in the process of implementing competition in
their local markets.  Indeed, the states have been the catalysts for many of the
changes now occurring at the federal level.  </P>
<P>Local service has traditionally been primarily the province of state
regulators, and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 continues to carve out a
major role for states to manage the transition to competition within their
jurisdictions.  State regulators are given, among other things, the role of
overseeing the implementation of  interconnection agreements between the local
phone company and new competitors, and the states must approve the pricing of
services for resale and the cost to competitive providers of unbundled services
that they need to obtain from the local phone company.</P>
<P>Universal service issues - what it is, who will get it and how it will be
paid for - are also critical to the states.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996
established a Federal-State Joint Board to explore these issues from a federal
perspective.  The Joint Board's recommendations were recently issued to the FCC
on November 7th and must be acted on by the FCC by May 8, 1997.  Access charges
currently paid by long distance companies to local companies, which currently
provide a tremendous contribution to support universal service at the local
level, are also slated for revision by the FCC in a proceeding scheduled to be
completed by mid-1997.  States will have to be deeply engaged in these federal
processes to protect state interests and will have to create their own
intrastate mechanisms to assure the continued availability of universal service
within their respective jurisdictions.  </P>
<P>The states will also have to find new and creative ways to manage the
development of the telecommunications industry in their state in the new
post-regulatory competitive era.  In Georgia, one effort that has already been
undertaken is the development of a three-sector partnership of the state's
research universities, the business community and state government to foster
economic development in the area of advanced telecommunications.  As part of
this effort, and to provide a base for future growth in the state's
telecommunications industry, the Georgia Center for Advanced Telecommunications
Technology (&quot;GCATT&quot;) was established.  GCATT's overall mission is to
provide a focal point to help shape and support the emergence of an advanced
telecommunications industry in the state.  To accomplish this goal, GCATT has
five specific missions, several of which are in direct support of universal
service goals:</P>
<P>(1) to further economic development in the state through the growth of an
advanced telecommunications industry;</P>
<P>(2) to advance the quality and cost effectiveness of education, health care,
and human services through the use of advanced telecommunications; </P>
<P>(3) to conduct basic research in technologies that underlie the advanced
telecommunications industry; </P>
<P>(4) to further the development of enlightened public policies to resolve the
ethical and regulatory issues that surround advanced telecommunications; and</P>
<P>(5) to conduct applied, industrial research and to develop applications in
support of the advanced telecommunications industry.  </P>
<P>There are many advantages that the states will enjoy as a result of the
introduction of competition into the local telephone markets.  However, there is
also no doubt that any dislocations resulting from the transition from a
monopoly to a competitive environment will fall most heavily on the local
economy, businesses, and ratepayers.  As a result, states will have to remain at
the forefront of the telecommunications revolution and find new and innovative
ways to channel the benefits of competition in a positive direction for the
states.  </P>

<h1>Litigation Support</h1>
<HR><p>
</center>
<p>
King & Spalding has long recognized the power of technology to improve its lawyers' productivity while greatly reducing clients' litigation costs.  In 1993 King & Spalding made a substantial capital investment in document imaging technology and established an in-house Litigation Support Department to better serve its clients.  King & Spalding is one of the only law firms in the Southeast that currently offers this range of litigation support services in-house.
<P>
Document imaging—producing a digital picture or "image" of a document—replaces the need to duplicate original documents in litigation, provides simultaneous access to documents by remote users, and maintains the quality of originals.  Imaging is most effective when used in conjunction with document coding—the summarization of documents into a computerized database—or OCR scanning, which enables full text searching of all documents.
<P>
A document imaging network at King & Spalding enables the lawyers and legal assistants working on a case to access the imaged documents from their desk top PC with just a few keystrokes.  Document imaging and coding saves clients significant dollars in terms of attorney and legal assistant time, copying charges, and storage and retrieval time during the life of a case.  There is no charge to clients for "computer time" or other hardware and software costs associated with use of the imaging network.
<P>
The Firm is qualified to handle both large and small document projects.  King & Spalding employs two full-time Litigation Support Managers as well as a trained staff of document coders and scanners who work exclusively on these matters.  During the past two years, the Firm has imaged or coded more than five million pages of documents.
<P>
King & Spalding Document Coders code the documents "on-line" directly into the database, cutting out the steps of completing coding forms by hand and subsequent data entry.  Quality control is performed on a daily basis for both imaging and coding.
<P>
Having in-house capability for imaging, coding and other Litigation Support services provides clients the additional benefit of safeguarding the confidentiality of sensitive documents.  All of the document coders and scanners are required to sign confidentiality agreements upon hiring.  Security is built into the imaging software; only those individuals working on a particular matter have access to those images.<P><P>

<P>CURWOOD: The concept of night and day is the subject of our next
story. It's the tale of an ant and a bear who have different ideas on
how to divide the night from the day. Our storyteller is Dovie
Thomason , a Lakota Kaiwa Apache storyteller and cultural educator
based in Virginia. Her latest recording is called Lessons from the
Animal People. Welcome, Dovie Thomason.</P>

<P>(Applause)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, your story is Ant Dances for Light. Is this Lakota
or a Kaiwa story?</P>

<P>THOMASON : It was a story told to me by my Kaiwa Apache
grandmother, but she would borrow stories from Nova Scotia or the
Yukon. To me it's just grandma's story.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well, let's hear it, then.</P>

<P>THOMASON : In the beginning times the Earth was not as we know it
today, for it was an Earth of darkness. Dark and cold covered this
earth in all directions, and it was a difficult Earth for the animals
who lived upon her. In the darkness they could not see each other. So
it was those animals with eyes that could see in the dark, those
animals who were sharp of tooth and claw who did well on this earth,
and the others? They were the hunted. That was their place. They were
the meat. And they were afraid in this dark world. They hid, they
ran, but they could not spend their lives hiding and running. They
wanted something else. They wanted a difference in this earth. But
they could imagine nothing but the darkness that was their world.
There were other problems. In this world of darkness the animals
crashed into each other, stepped on each other, tangled with each
other -- oop! Augh! Ow! Ooh! Who's on my paw? Who's that antler, get
that antler -- who did that? That hurt! Ow! Ooh! Ow! Soon, they were
arguing. There was trouble with the planet. There were troubles with
the animals who lived in this place. They fought, who was doing what
to who? Whose sharp toe? Whose claw was that? And there was trouble,
trouble, in this dark place. There had to be another way. But they
could not conceive of it.</P>

<P>So they went to the maker of this place. They went to the maker
and asked that he could rethink this creation. Something was missing.
They wanted something, they did not know what. The maker looked at
them. "You cannot imagine. There is something else. You cannot
imagine it. It is called light. It will bring warmth. You will be
able to see." Oh, to some of the animals, this sounded so good. The
birds having wings knew that they -- they could do something with
them if they could but see. This world of light, it sounded good to
them. But then the great animals, the hunters, stood. It was bear who
spoke for them. "I want no light. I want the dark. I like the night."
</P>

<P>And now the animals began arguing again. The birds spoke out for
light. "We want to fly! We want this light. We want the light," but
other birds turned on their own. "We don't want it. We like the
dark." It was owl and nighthawk, those hunters of the night. They
were happy with the Earth as it was, and soon all of the creatures of
this Earth were arguing before their very maker.</P>

<P>He raised his hands. "There must be a solution. An Earth of light.
An Earth of dark."</P>

<P>And suddenly a little voice spoke out before him. It was Ant.
"Could -- could there not be dark and light? I can almost imagine
color. Color. We would see in light. There would be goodness in both
dark and light. Could we not have both?"</P>

<P>Bear looked down at her. "I don't want it! I don't like it! I
don't want to see it. I like dark!"</P>

<P>And before the argument could erupt again the Maker raised his
hands and said, "This must be settled fairly. We will settle this as
many things have been settled, with a dance contest." (Audience
laughter) "There will be dancing and the winner, the one who creates
the greatest, strongest, dance, the one who stands at the end of the
dance, that is the way it will be. Bear, you will dance for dark."
And Bear pulled himself up tall. "And I see none who truly want an
Earth of only light." And they did not. They could not imagine this.
What if they changed for something much worse? "And Ant, will you
dance for dark and light?" And she agreed.</P>

<P>And so all the animals began to prepare for this great contest.
They prepared the food, for each contest is ended with feasting,
where all hard feeling is lost in the joy of the feast. And Bear
prepared to dance as he prepares to do everything: he ate. And ate.
And ate. He ate so much the animals preparing for the feast thought
there would be none left for the feast. And he ate, and ate. While
Ant prepared in a different way. She sat and folded her hands. She
prayed. She fasted. She sipped only of pure water.</P>

<P>Bear had eaten enough. He was ready to dance. He stood. The
animals looked up at him. He was big. He was strong. He took his
first step. "I am Bear! I dance for Night! I want the dark, I want no
light! I am Bear, I dance for Night!" And his dance was strong. The
animals watched and thought ooh, we are going to live in darkness.
(Audience laughter) And then it was Ant's turn. She stood, they
looked at her. Tiny before them, she pulled her belt tight, and she
began to dance. She danced for dark. She danced for light. She danced
for day, she danced for night. She danced for peace among all people,
and that everyone would get what they need. And then she sat and the
animals thought: that was -- different. But it was strong. It was
beautiful. It was graceful, but -- then Bear stood up, he had been
eating all this time, and he was huge! "I am Bear!" And Earth shook
under his feet and the animals shook, thinking of the darkness that
would be their home forever. "I dance for Night! I want the dark, I
want no light! I am Bear, I dance for Night!"</P>

<P>Ant had been fasting. Ant had been praying. She stood, she was
lightheaded and dizzy. She tightened her belt against her hunger. And
she danced. She danced for dark, she danced for light, she danced for
day, she danced for night. She danced for peace among all people, and
that everyone would get what they need. And the people smiled. It was
good, this dance, it was strong, this dance. Perhaps it could be as
she was dancing, as she was praying, but then Bear stood. He'd been
eating still more. His belly was like a boulder in front of him. "I
am Bear! Uuhhh..." (Audience laughter)</P>

<P>And he fell forward with a great crash! And soon was snoring. The
animals cheered. The Earth was going to change. Ant had won. She
didn't need to dance again, but she did. She danced for dark, she
danced for light, she danced for day, she danced for night. She
danced for peace among all people and that everyone would get what
they need. Now, when we see the ants today, the ones I grew up with,
their bodies are black and red, the color of the night, and the
colors we can only see in light. And we all notice their tiny waists.
</P>

<P>(Applause; music)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Dovie Thomason , the story you just told us, Ant Dances
for Light, this just isn't about how day and night were divided, is
it? But it's a lesson on moderation?</P>

<P>THOMASON : The lessons for the stories I've been told are what we
each take away from them. For me, it's a story about the power of
small things and that each of us have our own needs, and that somehow
we have to accommodate those and respect them.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well, thank you.</P>

<H2>Feeling SAD</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: And speaking of the weather, it's late in the afternoon
on a gray winter day. You're alone in your living room. And as you
stare past the drizzle on the window to a dim landscape of leafless
trees silhouetted against a steel gray sky, you're overcome by a
sinking feeling. A feeling of hopelessness, hopelessness bordering on
despair. You're feeling sad. You may call it the blues. Medical
experts call it Seasonal Affective Disorder, and it's our body's
natural reaction to days with less and less natural sunlight. Our
internal biological clocks are out of synch with the natural rhythms
established by the rising and setting of the sun. For some reason we
may crave carbohydrates: sweets for some, alcohol for others.
Whatever gets you through the twilight. Gila Lindsley knows about
SAD. She's a psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders, and has
been treating people with SAD for years. Dr. Lindsley says SAD can
affect almost all of us, and it can range from a mild case of the
winter blahs to clinical depression with severe consequences.</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: When I had my sleep center in a psychiatric hospital, we
saw some patients who came in suicidally depressed. There was one
woman who actually had made a suicide attempt. She came to me because
they couldn't get her out of bed; she was sleeping all the time, they
wanted to see what was wrong. When I took her history I found out
that she'd had this every year since she was about 17, and this was a
woman with several school-aged kids at this point. And I said, "Have
you ever been hospitalized before?" and she said, "No." I said, "But
this happens every year?" and she said, "Yeah?" and I said, "This
severely?" and she said, "Yeah." And I said, "Well, why the suicide
attempt this year?" She said well, she could always hang on until
February vacation, and then they'd go down to the Bahamas and it
would all go away, because by the time they got back it was spring.
And she said this year, February vacation came in March, and she just
couldn't hang on any longer.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: How common is SAD?</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: Severe SAD of the kind we are talking about probably
isn't terribly prevalent, but you just throw out a number, I'd bet it
was as high as 15% of the population in the Northeast.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Can't function at some times because of the Seasonal
Affective Disorder.</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: Yeah. And in fact there have been some real interesting
studies coming out of Alaska, and the prevalence rate there of severe
depressions in the winter time, I don't know numbers but it's
extraordinarily high. And there are some who believe it accounts for
some of the high alcohol rates in that part of the world, to try to
deal with a day with no sunlight.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It does seem, though, that even in the North, even here
in Boston or in Alaska or in Minnesota there are people that are
apparently unaffected by SAD. Why do you suppose that is?</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: I believe the difference is probably genetic. People
with blue eyes tend to get it more than people with brown eyes. It
may affect how much light they're actually able to take in. And
people with SAD tend to have family members with SAD as well.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I'm wondering if SAD is related to the fact that we used
to follow the natural rhythms, you know, being, getting up when it's
light and going to bed when it was dark. And in the winter time that
would mean we would sleep longer. But in today's world, you know,
there's a clock. We get up, we go to work, we're there at 8 o'clock
or 9 o'clock every day, whether it's the summer when it's bright or
it's the winter and it's barely getting light. Do you think that has
anything to do with it?</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: Yeah, I do. Because of course, in the winter in the old
days, when we didn't have all that pressure and pushing and
electrical lights so we could extend our days, it was a time when
farms were fallow, and it was probably a time where people just
rested. And I think what probably happens now with SAD, I think, is
really is just excessive sleepiness from the shortening of the days.
But if we're trying to push against that, then we're not functioning
very well and our self esteem can drop and we can feel dysfunctional,
and for those who are vulnerable that may be the key to why it
becomes a depression rather than just sleepiness.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now in health food stores these days, you'll see displays
of what's being touted as the natural wonder drug. It's called
Melatonin. It's a pill. I guess you take it once a day and it's being
taken by many people to treat SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder, and a
number of disorders as well. So can you tell us just what is
Melatonin, and what role it might play in SAD?</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: It comes from a gland that's in the brain, and the gland
is called the pineal gland. There's a lot of evidence now that
Melatonin is probably the key hormone in our entire body that
organizes all of our different biological clocks.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Really. Now if you have Seasonal Affective Disorder, if
you're SAD, can you take Melatonin to somehow make you feel better?
</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: I think that's a terrible idea. If you think about it,
Seasonal Affective Disorder, one of the most important symptoms of it
are people who want to squirrel up in bed and not get out until
spring. If you think of Melatonin as a sleep inducer, it's about the
last thing that you want to do. In fact, what you really want to do
is to suppress Melatonin and kind of fool the body into thinking
there's more daylight. Now it may be that if you take Melatonin
exactly timed right, that you can up the amount of Melatonin at
night, maybe, but I've not seen it work and really the treatment
seems to be anything that can make Melatonin be out of the body for
about the same length of time you'd normally expect in the spring.
That's the normal strategy for treating SAD.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: The best treatment for SAD?</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: Bright light therapy.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh.</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: Basically what you're trying to do is to convince your
body that it's really spring. You just think you see darkness
outside. Now, the bright lights that are used, that are called broad
spectrum bright lights, and what that means is that as opposed to
these little 60- or 100-watt dealies that we have, that they're
simulating broad sunlight midday during the spring time. Now these
tricky lights were eventually the ones that began to be used for
Seasonal Affective Disorder, and those are still the treatment of
choice.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, besides bright light therapy, are there simpler
remedies to ward off SAD? I mean, should I get out of the office
every day at noon if there's sun to go around the block for a walk?
Or is the only solution to pack my bags for the Pond, the Caribbean
or something?</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: I think the best solution is to pack your bags for the
Caribbean, frankly. But before you start packing your bags and
uprooting your life, the common sense things to do are number one, be
aware it's a seasonal pattern. Number two, anticipate it in advance
of the winter so that part of the depression, part of it is feeling
alone and isolated, so build your life so that you're going to have a
lot of contact with people during the winter months. Of course it's
absolutely critical to get a lot of light, and before it even really
starts, resist the impulse to stay in bed a little longer because
it's not going to help you.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Gila Lindsley is a clinical psychologist and sleep
disorder specialist who practices in Lexington, Massachusetts. Thanks
for joining us.</P>

<P>LINDSLEY: Thanks for having me.</P>

<H2>Homebuilding 101</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of December 27, 1996 (Original Air Date: December
15, 1995)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Copyright 1995 by World Media Foundation. No

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: The image of pioneers building their own homes is an icon
of American life. But in today's frantic and highly mobile society
few of us have the time or the skills needed to construct a shelter
with our own hands. Besides, nowadays, who stays in one place long
enough to invest more than money in their home?</P>

<P>(Hammering sounds)</P>

<P>CONNELL: People now relate to their homes, or have been since the
second World War, as a product that you move into for a certain phase
of your life, hope it appreciates, and then sell it. And with it you
sell all the relationships that you have with the other people in
that community. You sell your children's memories. You sell a whole
section of your life down the road. And a lot of people never put
their lives into their homes just because of that.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: John Connell is founder of the Yestermorrow School in
Warren, Vermont. An architect and a builder, he started this training
program in 1980 to help people build communities by teaching them how
to design and construct their own homes.</P>

<P>CONNELL: We say look, you want a home? We'll help you design it,
we'll help you build it, it will be more expressive of who you are.
It'll cost you less. If you want to change it as your kids grow older
and stuff, we'll empower you to do that. And you know, by the way, as
we're teaching you how to do all this, don't you think you'd rather
build it this way that's going to save you money and energy, than
that way? Wouldn't you rather put your house here on the land that's
not going to trash this habit at of this animal, and keep it around
for your kid?</P>

<P>(Construction sounds, hammering, a drill. Man: "The rafter needs a
compound cut on the bottom." Man #2: "A compounder. Okay, it's this
angle in relationship to that...")</P>

<P>CURWOOD: About a dozen latter-day Thoreaus surround their
instructor. Inside a roofless structure about a 10-minute drive from
the school.</P>

<P>(A drill sounds.)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Under the watchful eye of 3 teachers, these students are
building a small horse barn on which they practice basic construction
skills. They learn to hammer a nail, cut a beam and shingle a roof.
The students range from a California truck driver nearing retirement
to a young couple from Alaska.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: We're going to build a stone house, is what we're
interested in. There's plenty of river stone around where we live.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Doryi McDannold lives with her husband outside of Palmer,
Alaska.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: We live in a kind of harsh environment up in Alaska,
and I think it's important just to consider where you live and what
elements you have to deal with and build a building that suits that.
Otherwise, you're always sort of fighting nature. I mean, you know,
you do things the wrong way, you know, if you see people put huge
windows on north sides of house and then they end up having to heat
like heck, you know ? And so it just doesn't make sense.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Lynn Preston wants to build her dream home in rural
Maryland.</P>

<P>PRESTON: I wanted something that was designed around the way I
live. I guess I wanted a greenhouse; I also want a nice big tub in
there, so that I can actually sit down and have my knees covered when
I sit in the tub. I wanted -- I wanted a big library. I have a
bookshelf right now that's about 8 foot tall and 24 feet long and
there aren't a whole bunch of houses that they feel that will
accommodate a library like that.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Liz Preston and the others are introduced to construction
skills, but they learn there is much more to homebuilding.</P>

<P>(People gathering in a room; ambient conversation)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: In an architect's studio, students toil, often until the
early hours of the morning, shaping and re-shaping their designs on
paper. Then they build models to test their house plans in 3
dimensions. For now, Dori McDannold's stone home looks like a
cardboard doll house.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: This is going to be the roof and that will be where the
sawed roof is, so you have to use your imagination and imagine that
this will just look like the ground.</P>

<P>But magically the roof comes off, and --</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Ms. McDannold peels off the roof and opens up the first
floor of her model for viewing. She points out some problems that the
model revealed and how she coped with them.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: If you've got this plus the second floor laid over top
here, actually approaches 2,000 square feet, 2,100.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: That's a big house.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: Yeah, it got too big on me last night, in the wee
hours. (Laughs) So I went ahead and thought okay, well if I eliminate
that and just go with this and put the stairs back over there, then
it dropped it back down to the 1,700 square foot, which includes the
root cellar and the greenhouse.</P>

<P>ROOD: Unfortunately the attitude these days often is that hey,
we'll just make it big. That'll make it flexible enough so that it'll
work somehow.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Yestermorrow instructor Mac Rood explains that
controlling house size is</P>

<P>an important environmentally sound building concept.</P>

<P>ROOD: You spend the time on paper, with paper and pencil and
building models. You can design a space that is efficient, uses every
square foot to the maximum, maybe just by moving some doors around
you can reduce the traffic flow through a room and therefore be able
to make the room smaller. Still as functional, still as gracious, but
with less square footage, thereby saving material, saving the energy
cost that's involved in heating that building for the 50, 100, 200
years that we hope this building's going to last.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: That's another of the key lessons taught at the
Yestermorrow school. Building a sustainable home means building a
structure that's going to last a long time.</P>

<P>ROOD: It means that the energy that's gone into creating that
building, the materials and resources that have gone into that
building, are going to be 2, 3 times more valuable if the building
lasts 2 or 3 times as long. We've got to get away from the notion of
disposable buildings.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Mr. Rood and 2 other instructors go over these ideas
again and again with students during marathon studio sessions. They
also spend hours going over general architecture, building codes, and
other basic concepts needed to plan a house. While those ideas seem
simple enough, the students quickly learn that putting it all
together takes time. Lots of time. Dori McDannold.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: Before I came I was thinking, when we walk away from
here we'll have blueprints for our house. But by the second week of
this course I was like, yeah, I can let go of -- I'm not going to
have blueprints. I'm not even going to be close. There are so many
details and so many decisions, and I realize what a complex project
it is just making all those decisions. So it might be a year, might
be 2, who knows?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: You're going to be cold for a while.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: Yeah!</P>

<P>CURWOOD: For those students who don't actually go on to build
homes with their own 2 hands, Yestermorrow training puts them in a
better position to deal with the architects and contractors who may
create their home for them.</P>

<P>(A car door closes; people move around, ambient conversation)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Every day Yestermorrow students take field trips to local
homes. Most often the owners are architects or builders themselves
who have created the long lasting space and energy efficient homes
the school trumpets. Today, they visit the log house of instructor
Joe Brent, who greets them as they pile out of the school van.</P>

<P>CHUCK: How's it going, Joe?</P>

<P>BRENT: Good, Chuck. You?</P>

<P>CHUCK: Good. This is neat.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: The log home is simple but elegant.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: Nice job, Joe!</P>

<P>BRENT: Thanks, Dori.</P>

<P>McDANNOLD: That's great. This looks like a well-done log house.
</P>

<P>BRENT: Oh, well.</P>

<P>MAN: There's a crack you could get a rhino through here!
(Laughter)</P>

<P>BRENT: I didn't have anything to do with that...</P>

<P>CURWOOD: A cheerful man, Joe Brent describes how he built this
house himself, using a lot of local resources. The logs came from
trees on his own land and were milled nearby. Pieces of his furnace
were salvaged from old copy machines. Mr . Brent says it was not a
conscious effort to reduce waste or save energy, it was just the
cheapest, simplest course to take. As the students gather in the
living room, Joe Brent uses the midsummer sun to explain how
designing with nature makes it easier to keep the building
comfortable.</P>

<P>BRENT: Now as you can see it's about 1:20 and the sun's up about
as high as it's going to get, and there's just a very narrow band of
sun that's hitting the porch. And very little coming in the windows.
Now here it is the middle of summer, we're just not getting that
solar gain that you would get if you didn't have enough overhang and
some other factors. But in the winter, when the sun is much lower in
the sky, the light just literally streams right in to where Rob is
standing. So -- yeah, it's astounding.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Mr. Brent expects that he and his family will spend the
rest of their days here. Yestermorrow School founder John Connell
says no matter where you live, that sense of place is the best reward
from personal home building.</P>

<P>CONNELL: See, if you build your own home, you put a lot of effort
into it. If you live there, and for a long time, it's important, all
of a sudden it's important to know where the water's coming from and
where the waste is going to. But if you buy your home and you're
going to sell it in 5 years, or flip it as they say, then you can
endure whatever kind of crime or waste or poor schools or other
social ills come along with that home, because you're going to sell
it. It's only when you invest in a spot and commit to a community of
people that you really start to see the reason for cleaning up our
streets, for saving the environment.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Cleaning up the whole world is not the goal of John
Connell or the Yestermorrow School. But he hopes the hundreds of
prospective home builders sent out from this rural Vermont valley
will try to change their own corners of it. Perhaps then their
message of constructing a home to reflect the owner's values, as well
as respect the environment, will catch on.</P>

<H2>Subways</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No
portion of this transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted
without the written authority of World Media Foundation.</FONT></P>

<P>In January of 1863, London's Metropolitan, the world's first
underground passenger railway, opened to the public.  It wasn't util
1897 that Boston became home to the first US subway.  Seven years
after that New York City one-upped Boston and started operating what
was to become the world's largest subway system.  The New York City
subway runs over more than 490 miles of track and carries 1.1 billion
people every year.  Despite a recent fare increase to $1.50 per trip,
the system is a money losing proposition.  Each passenger trip costs
the system $1.80.  Americans must have a  special place in their
heart for subways.  There are 15 US cities with underground railway
systems, far more than any other nation.  The newest major subway is
under construction in Los Angeles.  If all goes according to plan, by
the time it is finished it will include more than 95 miles of rail, a
third of that underground.  And the fare?  Right now it's a quarter. 
The bargain fare is an effort to coax Angelenos out of their cars.

CHECK-UP</A><BR>

Untouched by humans for millions of years, the frozen south is now an
important outpost for studying human impact on the planet. In the
first of a four part series, Terry FitzPatrick reports how greenhouse
gases, ozone depletion, and surging tourism are affecting the fragile
continent</P>

<P><A HREF="antarctica/antarctica2.html">CLEAN-UP TIME</A><BR>

The otherwise pristine waters around Antarctica have been a garbage
and waste dumping ground for scientific researchers based there for
years. Now researchers are working to clean-up their acts as they go.
Terry FitzPatrick continues with his 4-part Antarctica series, having
recently travelled there for Living on Earth.</P>

<P><A HREF="antarctica/antarctica3.html">IS GLOBAL WARMING AFFECTING
POLAR ICE SHELVES?</A><BR>

Terry FitzPatrick reports on the latest research into what is causing
large masses of ice to break off the world's frozen continent. If
uncontrolled global warming is in fact the cause, predictions
forecast a significantly more watery world.</P>

<P><A HREF="antarctica/antarctica4.html">AN ICE JOURNAL</A><BR>

In this final installment, reporter Terry FitzPatrick shares a
personal audio journal of his experiences and impressions while
traveling to Antarctica for Living on Earth on a National Science
Foundation grant. These days, with hot tubs, VCR's, wet bars, and
nude snowmobilers, things have certainly changed since the days when
early explorers and their dog teams sank in wooden ships at the
bottom of the world. Bottoms up!<HR><B>Comments? Suggestions? Living

<P><B><A HREF="grocery.html">NATURAL FOODS GAIN GROUND</A></B><BR>

Natural foods supermarkets with huge aisles of organic produce and
nutritional guarantees are sprouting up all over.  Living On Earth
producer Kim Motylewski went to the openings of two grand scale new
markets to see who these new ventures will be benefitting.  Chances
are, competition will be driving some prices down, and consumers wil
be faring better along with farmers and merchandisers.  </P>

<P><B><A HREF="grain.html">ORGANIC GRAIN</A></B><BR>

Not all organic products are in demand, according to Fred
Kirschenmann, president of Farm Verified Organic, Inc.  Mr.
Kirshenmann, who serves on the National Organic Standards Board, says
crop rotation for soil health is another important component in the
organics movement.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="saxon.html">SUSTAINABLE DAIRY FARMING</A></B><BR>

Steve Curwood visits a family farm near the shores of Lake Michigan
to report on a sustainable alternative to traditional dairy farming.
"Rotational Grazing" combines old-fashioned grazing practices with
modern technology to reduce production costs, improve soil quality,
prevent manure runoff and attract wildlife back to the farm.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="almond.html">ALMOND BROTHERS</A></B><BR>

Matt Binder reports from the Great Central Valley of California about
two brothers who farm almonds, side by side, in the tiny town of
Hilmar. One brother cultivates his nuts the way most almond farmers
do, with synthetic chemical fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides and
herbicides. Just across the road his brother farms organically. And
as you can imagine, they have some spirited debates.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="amish.html">AMISH</A></B><BR>

Many see America's tightly-knit Amish communities as odd throwbacks
to the days of the horse and buggy. But Amish beliefs don't reject
progress so much as they call for the sustainable use of God's gifts
of creation.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="caretaker1.html">COMMUNITY-SUPPORTED
AGRICULTURE</A></B><BR>

Steve Curwood talks with the owners of Caretaker Farm in
Williamstown, MA, a community-supported agriculture enterprise that
links traditional organic, local food production and an
unconventional approach to marketing.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="../../Liz/Web%20stuff%20for%20Liz/caretaker3.html">PICK
YOUR OWN PESTO</A></B><BR>

Steve Curwood returns to the Caretaker Farm in Western Massachusetts
for the fall harvest season. The Anderson family have paid shares in
the farm, and Curwood is invited back to their kitchen to sample some
homemade pesto they're preparing for the winter ahead.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="caretaker4.html">COMMUNITY-SUPPORTED FARMS</A></B><BR>

Caretaker Farm in Williamstown, Massachusetts finishes out the year.
</P>

<P><B><A HREF="cuba.html">ORGANIC FOOD REVOLUTION IN CUBA</A></B><BR>

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union four years ago, Cuba's
supply of fertilizers and pesticides was cut back 80 percent, its
fuel supply cut in half. Now, there is an urgent need for the country
to feed its people, but there is no money to buy farm chemicals or
oil. So Cubans have turned to organic farming on a national scale.
It's a high risk gamble that uses plows and oxen instead of tractors
and turbines and biological pest controls instead of chemical
pesticides. Reporter Bruce Gellerman traveled to Cuba to find out
what farmers have learned and what lessons the experiment holds for
sustainable growers around the world.<B> </B></P>

<P><B><A HREF="whitehouse/clinton.html">CLINTON FOR
PRESIDENT</A></B><BR>

Expectations ran high among environmentalists when Bill Clinton was

public votes, and closed door deals, thus far.</P>

WASHINGTON STATE</A></B> <BR>

BALLOT</A></B><BR>

under attack.</P>

DATE</A></B><BR>

Commentator Michael Silverstein states a case for a Dole presidency
being good, and in fact better, for United States environmental
policy and activism than Clinton's tenure thus far.</P>

CNN'S PETER DYKSTRA</A></B><BR>

Peter Dykstra of Atlanta's Cable News Network Environmental Unit
shares his insights with Steve Curwood about what the presidential
nominees are up to this fall election season. And what they're
leaving out.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="whitehouse/seastrand.html">SEASTRAND V. CAPPS IN SANTA
BARBARA, CA</A></B><BR>

The contest is on again for the same two politicians who fought it
out two years ago in California's 22nd congressional district which
includes the affluent city of Santa Barabara. Stephanie O'Neill
reports that the opponents environmental voting records are a key
factor for voters in this tight race.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="whitehouse/mtwater.html">CLEAN WATER INITIATIVE IN
MONTANA</A></B><BR>

campaign.</P>

<H2>Tracking the Planet's Most Important Story</H2>

<IMG SRC="../images/Small_Steve.gif" width=212 height=165 align=left hspace=9 vspace=5>
The creator, executive producer, and host of National Public Radio's 
environmental journal of the air, "Living On Earth" rocks in his office chair, now leaning forward, now stretching back, juggling urgent phone calls, putting out production brush fires. His brainchild is almost five years old now, featured on more than 260 NPR stations across the country and in 400 countries worldwide as part of the Armed Forces Radio Network. Steve Curwood is an immensely proud papa. And "Living On Earth" is a pretty demanding child.
<P>
"Early on, somebody told me, 'Steve, you know what? You'll get six months into this and you'll be dying on Earth. How are you going to do more than twenty programs on the environment?'" Curwood chuckles. "Now we have more stories than we can use."  And that's despite the fact the show recently doubled its available airtime to an hour. 
<P>
The show blends two important streams of his life: a love of the natural world, and a driving desire to write and report. The first Curwood traces to his boyhood on a farm in southern New Hampshire, where the family moved from Boston after his father's death when Curwood was two. His mother, then a graduate student in social psychology and junior faculty member at Harvard, instilled in Curwood a fascination with nature. There wasn't a lot of money, and "when we moved to the country, for Christmas presents she'd get glass jars, go into the woods, and get a little bit of moss or berry, and make terrariums for friends as presents. She'd literally go around handing out pieces of the earth." 
<P>
When Steve was five, his mother took a tenure - track position at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  Steve's Quaker family attended the Yellow Springs Friends Meeting, where Steve learned that "it was really important to be involved with the community, with the tribe, really," he recalls. Much later, Steve learned to appreciate his own tribal heritage: his maternal great-grandmother was a member of the Cherokee Nation and his mother's generation had tribal rights. Curiously, the family didn't embrace that indigenous heritage, says Curwood, although "my ethnic background is varied, a lot of African people, a lot of Irish, and then this Native American ancestor." He speculates that his mother's, and his own intense interest in the outdoors may stem from this link.
<P>
Another love was born during those days in Yellow Springs, and "love brought me into it," Steve laughs. A crush on the local correspondent for the 4-H club led him to accept the position of scribe for his Boy Scout troop. "I could get out of school to deliver my copy to the local paper, and spend a little time seeing if I could catch her eye,  well, why not?" But what turned his head was something quite different. He watched as the copy editor finished his changes and walked back to the typesetter. "And this big old Linotype machine started setting this story, my story," he recalls, with some of the same awe. "And then the thing came out in the paper, and I was completely hooked. I have no idea what happened to the girl, but newspapers? That was it."
<P>
In 1965, Curwood entered Harvard, and spent his summers as an engineer for the Boston news/talk radio station, WEEI-AM. The second summer at WEEI, riots broke out in Boston's Roxbury section.  Curwood was at the right place at the right time. "They didn't have anybody they could send out to the riots. So they gave me a microphone, a tape recorder, a hard hat and a news cruiser," recalls Curwood. "Can you imagine driving into a riot zone in a big old station wagon with 'WEEI' on the side and a revolving light on top? This was a serious riot. The crowd kinda rolled by and I stuck the microphone out and I got the hell out of there!" But the news bug that bit him years ago was back.
<P>
Steve took an internship at the "Bay State Banner", the "Boston Globe's" weekly newspaper for the African-American community, where he went from reporter to managing editor in short order. "I suppose some would say 'how could this be an authentic voice for the black community with the white folks downtown paying the tab?'," says Curwood. "But I got opportunities I never would have had at a white operation" , such as covering the 1972 Democratic Convention for the Banner. And it put Curwood, who, although born in Roxbury, says he "never really grew up in black America," right in the heart of Boston's black ghetto.
<P>
His mentors downtown noticed him, and in 1973 he joined the Globe's Spotlight investigative team to cover Boston's desegregation battles. "The school suit filed in 1970 had boiled over by that time," he says, "so I was in the thick of a very sad, hard time for the city." In his view, both blacks and working-class whites were the victims of a cynical racial shell game , played by affluent whites in the suburbs, whose children didn't have to be bused, and by members of the city's School Committee who profited financially from the turmoil. "The School Committee was usually obstructionist about everything to do with desegregation, until a Federal judge told them they had to do it," Curwood recalls. "Then one day the actual school busing contract came up, the 'instrument of social death,' as they called it. And they approved it without so much as a cough or a sniffle." The clerk, who Curwood could usually count on to tell him what was happening, "wouldn't tell me what time it was that day. Turns out there was a bid-rigging scheme going on, and eventually some of the members wound up in jail." Curwood shakes his head. "It's one thing for people to stand up for a position they truly believe in, even if it's horrible and wrong, but to learn that these people were so deeply cynical that they were manipulating the voters with race-baiting just to line their own pockets . . ." His voice trails off. "I'd had enough of the school system before long."
<P>
Steve's work earned him a share of a Pulitzer Prize for the Globe's coverage of Boston's desegregation crisis. The paper's owners wanted him in management, but Curwood said no. Not long after, he was recruited by Boston's public television station, WGBH, to report for their new "10 O'Clock News." He also narrated some episodes of Nova and worked on the station's minority show "Say Brother." Then the offer came to produce for "The Advocates", hosted by Michael Dukakis.
<P>
"The premise of 'The Advocates' was that you had an idea that you put on trial," he explains. "It had to be a real idea that somebody could take action on, like the Equal Rights Amendment. Each side had an advocate, a lawyer, arguing for it, who would call witnesses. It was a totally eye-opening experience, a great show , and it ran out of money." Curwood later tried to produce a radio version of the show, and hasn't given up the idea yet.
<P>
But his immediate problem was being out of a job. "Somebody told me they were hiring at National Public Radio," he says, and shortly thereafter the Curwoods moved to Washington. Steve worked as a Capitol Hill reporter, and covered the State Department and the White House too. But he'd heard rumors the network was starting a morning version of the popular evening flagship show "All Things Considered." "So I went down there with the idea of trying to get the anchor job. They hired some guy named Bob Edwards instead," he says wryly. NPR put him to work anchoring the weekend version of "All Things Considered" with Liane Hansen and others, following Noah Adams' departure. "I had a ball," he says. "But my family didn't like it that my weekends were Mondays and Tuesdays."
<P>
The Globe welcomed him back, this time as a business reporter, a columnist, and eventually back on the education beat , this time, the state's public higher education system, which had become "a cesspool." Curwood's investigation of questionable campaign contributions by some of Massachusetts' state college administrators led to the downfall of at least two college presidents. Another investigation, this one of a case in which a woman abducted and hid her child from the husband she alleged had sexually abused the child, led Curwood to write a still-unpublished manuscript , and to want out of daily journalism.
<P>
"I came to the end of that process wanting to do deeper journalism," he says. "My kid James said, 'Dad, you've got to do something about the environment!' Well, I thought, who's going to buy a book by Steve Curwood about global warming , what's my expertise on that? But James was right. So I said to my book agent, 'I think I could do a very limited radio series to publicize the book.' Well," he smiles, "the book isn't done." He wrote up a proposal for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in the fall of 1989. "They said 'No way. This will never work.' But I was really bitten by then, so I went to some local businesses and came up with enough dough to make four pilots for Earth Day." By that time, Curwood had engaged the attention of some of "Living on Earth's" future staffers: coordinating producer George Homsy and marketing director Deborah Stavro.
<P>
"The shows that we had for that Earth Day [1990] were pretty awful," he observes. "They were interesting , we did a debate on the new light-water nuclear reactors, we talked to Jesse Jackson about the environmental justice movement. But the production values were fairly weak. Still," he says, "there was a spark there. By the next year, I had raised enough to go on a weekly basis and get a hundred stations to carry it." Sadly, Curwood's mother died just six months before the show actually premiered.
<P>
Even the grammatical form of the name had significance. "I used the gerund 'Living,'" says Curwood, "instead of 'Life on Earth' or something like 'Earth Times' to signify that it is today , it's what each of us is doing, it's not static." Basing the format on the highly-successful "All Things Considered" let the show range from serious reports, analysis and commentary to light-hearted features.
<P>
"I always believed that when we got into it, the stories would start presenting themselves," says Curwood. "That vision was clear from day one. I was scared, though. When the Persian Gulf War came along right before we first went on, I thought, will people care about the environment in the middle of a war? And then the Gulf War became an environmental story. The next year the Soviet Union imploded, and I thought, surely this will bump us off the map. But in fact part of the USSR's unraveling related to its horrible environmental problems."
<P>
The show has changed from those early days, Curwood says. "I think we're doing better, more mature reporting," he observes. "We're looking more at the process of people dealing with environmental change, and we're doing less of the 'here's something really horrible' stories. We still do major investigations, but we're doing a better job of putting them in a context. "I really want us to be the 'program of record' on environmental change. I think the broader community of people who are concerned about that change probably aren't aware of what we're doing, and I hope we'll begin tapping that audience. My mission here is to be sure that "Living On Earth" is a place where people really do hear something that provokes them to think, and to act.
<P>
"There's a story about John Woolman, who was a Friend in America's colonial days. Woolman would show up at Meetings all over the Eastern Seaboard, arguing against slavery; it was very disturbing for the Friends. One time he showed up for a Meeting and no one else was there. He sat down, and when the spirit moved him he stood up and talked just as if it were a full house. As he was leaving, he heard a noise, and looked around to find a man who had been hiding in the foyer the whole time. 'Thee has convinced me,' the man told Woolman." Curwood smiles. "So he never knew who he was talking to and what effect it would have. But the seed of change had been planted. And you never know, when you do a story, what seed you may have planted."

<H2>Attack of the Goby Fish</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of December 27, 1996 (Original Air Date: January 5,
1996)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: For almost a decade, people who live around the Great
Lakes have been complaining about a foreigner, a non-native species
of shellfish called the zebra mussel. The zebra mussel has multiplied
so rapidly that it has changed the region's ecology, and clogged the
intake pipes of water systems and industrial plants all around the
Great Lakes. Now, another non-native species has been found in the
lakes, a fish that eats zebra mussels. Could this be an ironic
writing of an ecological imbalance? Well, not really. Bob Carty
explains.</P>

<P>(A foghorn sounds)</P>

<P>CARTY: On the Detroit River just a couple of miles above the
canyon of Detroit's skyscrapers, Patricia and Gord cast their lines
into the muddy water a couple of times a week. Pat and Gord fish for
fun; that's something there seems to be less of every day. Fishermen
around here have to wear heavy boots so their feet aren't cut up by
the shells of millions of zebra mussels that carpet the shoreline.
And if zebra mussels weren't enough, anglers like Pat and Gord now
have to put up with annoying tugs on their bait.</P>

<P>What are you fishing for?</P>

<P>PAT: Perch. Not catchin' any. (Laughs)</P>

<P>CARTY: What do you usually catch?</P>

<P>PAT: Gobys.</P>

<P>CARTY: Gobys?</P>

<P>PAT: That's new in the water. It's a small little fish that looks
like it has a suction cup on its stomach and it comes from Europe.
</P>

<P>GORD: They come out of the ships, ballast water I guess, and they
dump it in the lake and that's how they got started I guess.</P>

<P>PAT: My brother in law thinks they're going to take over the
water, because they multiply real fast.</P>

<P>CARTY: Real fast indeed. The goby fish was first discovered near
here just 5 years ago. By this summer, the goby had spread to all 5
Great Lakes, from Lake Superior to Lake Ontario.</P>

<P>JUDE: When you look at other alien species that have come into the
Great Lakes, like the alewife and the sea lamprey, it took them up to
20 years sometimes to make it through all 5 of the Great Lakes. This
species is doing it different, and we've really not had that kind of
a transfer of alien species before.</P>

<P>CARTY: David Jude is a researcher at the University of Michigan's
Center for the Great Lakes and Aquatic Sciences. He is also the owner
of a Michigan license plate that reads GOBY-1. That's because in
1990, David Jude was the first person who found a goby a long, long
way from home.</P>

<P>JUDE: Gobys are members of the second largest fish family in the
world, and include a lot of cave fishes. In other words, they can
feed at night complete darkness, and that may have also been one of
the traits that allowed them to get over here in the first place
because they were in the ballast water of a ship in the k.</P>

<P>CARTY: Where are they from?</P>

<P>JUDE: They're from the Black and Caspian Seas in former Russia.
</P>

<P>CORKUM: This is our lab freezer, and in here I have everything
from frozen gobys to frozen adult insects.</P>

<P>CARTY: At the University of Windsor, on the Canadian side of the
Detroit River, biologist Linda Corkum shows off the contents of some
plastic bags in her freezer.</P>

<P>(Plastic bags crinkle)</P>

<P>CORKUM: And here's a goby. When you open the gut of a round goby
you find all sorts of prey items, and in this one you can see that
there are actually zebra mussels intact in the gut of the fish. It's
quite amazing.</P>

<P>CARTY: And for a time, at least, quite promising. Here is a fish
that loved to eat the little emigre from Russia. It devoured zebra
mussels by the dozen. Now this was good news around the Great Lakes.
After all, zebra mussels were becoming so numerous that they were
sinking navigational buoys by their combined weight. Throughout the
Great Lakes it has cost an estimated three quarters of a billion
dollars up to now to protect water intakes from zebra mussels. So the
goby was the great brown hope. But a false hope it proved. Aquatic
scientist David Jude.</P>

<P>JUDE: There's lots more zebra mussels than there ever will be
gobys. They do eat a lot of zebra mussels, but I don't think they're
going to exert any big control on zebra mussels; they're certainly no
silver bullet for controlling zebra mussels. But they're another
factor that will help control the zebra mussel population.</P>

<P>CARTY: The goby's appetite for zebra mussels may in fact be a
serious problem. It's a matter of the food chain according to Dr.
Linda Corkum. The problem is that after eating zebra mussels, the
gobys are eaten by bigger fish.</P>

<P>CORKUM: Zebra mussels are associated with the bottom, and
accumulate contaminants: PCBs, industrial byproducts, pesticides, a
whole suite of organochlorines. And gobys will be able to transfer
these contaminants to predatory fish. Such as the sport fish such as
small mouth bass or various species of trout.</P>

<P>CARTY: If this food chain concentration of toxin occurs as
scientists predict, anglers might have to stop eating some of their
favorite sport fish. Part of the commercial fishery might even be
threatened. And that's not all. Gobys can out-compete other fish for
food. They're more aggressive. They can feed in dark waters. They
spawn 6 times a year. And because they can eat zebra mussels, gobys
have an unlimited food supply unavailable to other fish. David Jude
has already seen the impact, particularly on a once abundant native
species.</P>

<P>JUDE: A species of benthic, which is a bottom dwelling fish,
called the model sculpin, has been almost totally eliminated or
displaced by the round goby. To find this is really an astounding
discovery; I've heard these reports from scuba divers, and it's also
been reported from the Grand Calumet River. The other interesting
part of that is that the Grand Calumet River connects with the
Mississippi River at Chicago, in that area. So now they have got an
access into the Mississippi River, too.</P>

<P>CARTY: The goby is just the latest example of how disruptive
non-native species can be. Earlier, the lamprey eel nearly destroyed
lake trout. More recently the zebra mussel turned Lake Erie from
murky to clear by eating most of the lake's algae. And now the goby
is changing the balance of biodiversity. On the bright side, in the
future there may be fewer cases of non-native species hitching a ride
into North America. Both the US and Canada have taken measures to get
ships to exchange their bilge waters at sea before entering inland
waterways. But David Jude laments that short of serving up gobys on
our dinner tables, like they do in Russia, there's really nothing to
be done about the non-native species already here.</P>

<P>JUDE: Exotic species are forever. They get into these lakes and
they take over and they're here for the duration, and we're just
going to have to live with them.</P>

<P>CARTY: For Living on Earth, I'm Bob Carty in Detroit.</P>

<H2>Oil Spill Threatens Japan Coast</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of January 10, 1997</P>

<P>An oil spill from a Russian tanker may ruin one of Japan's richest
marine  environments. A spokesman for Japan's fisheries disaster task
force says the spill will spoil the area's seaweed crop for years and
hurt birds that roost in the area. Earlier this month a tanker
carrying 19,000 tons of heavy fuel oil, broke in two and started
leaking oil in the Sea of Japan. So far more than 60 miles of
coastline have been fouled by the spills, one of the worst ever to
hit Japan. In 1995, more than 150,000 tons of fish, shellfish, crab,
shrimp, squid and other marine produce were harvested in the
now-threatened area.</P>

<P>There is more evidence linking pesticides to health problems in
Florida alligators. Researchers studying the declining alligator
population in Florida's Lake Apopka say that  residual DDT and a
pesticide called dicofol are responsible for abnormalities in the
alligator's reproductive system. DDT was banned in the United States
for most uses more than 20 years ago. Dicofol is used to kill mites. 
The study was published  in the journal Environmental Health
Perspectives. </P>

<H2>Yellowstone Bison Rounded Up for Slaughter</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of January 10, 1997</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No

</P>

<P>Nearly 40 bison have been rounded up for slaughter in Yellowstone
National Park. The new National Park Service plan calls for the
capture of all bison encroaching on adjacent private  cattle-grazing
land. Some of the bison carry brucellosis and Montana officials fear
the disease will spread  to cattle. Brucellosis causes cattle to
abort their calves and can sicken humans if left uncontrolled. 
Animal rights activists say there has never been a documented case of
wild bison transmitting the disease to cattle. Yellowstone has 3,500
bison, the largest remaining free-ranging herd  in the US.</P>

<H2>Oregon Mudslides Linked to Overzealous Logging</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of December 13, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No

</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Mudslides have wreaked havoc in Oregon. A number of people
have been killed, homes have been destroyed, cars buried and roads
covered over. Many people in the Pacific Northwest blame overzealous
logging for creating a situation conducive to the destructive slides.
Alan Siporin covered logging issues for nearly a decade. He joins us
now from the studios of KLCC in Eugene, Oregon, where he's a
commentator. Alan, how severe is the situation?</P>

<P>SIPORIN: I don't recall any deaths from mudslides in the last 20
years and we've had 5 in just one incident a few weeks ago, and
several other deaths since then as well. A survivor who managed to
get out of his home described how the slide actually ripped his home
off the foundation and pushed it downhill before burying it under
tons of rock and mud and debris. The deaths are the most tragic part
of this story but certainly not the end of it. Many homes have been
destroyed or severely damaged.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Many environmental activists have tried to link these
slides directly to logging. How strong do you think that connection
is?</P>

<P>SIPORIN: There have been a couple studies, one by the Forest
Service and another by environmentalists. The Forest Service study
was done on its lands after the mudslides we experienced last winter;
that was actually in February. That study showed a much higher
incidence of landslides in clear-cuts than in areas that had not been
logged. Some environmentalists also conducted their own study. There
data indicates that mudslides are more prevalent and of greater
magnitude on hillsides where logging has occurred in the past 20
years, and that's not just clearcuts but logging in general. What's
really disturbing, though, is the direct link to the mudslides that
cost several people their lives. Ten years ago a state forester said
logging a unit above that home where the mudslides actually occurred
and people died posed a risk because of unstable soils. The state
agency, however, didn't have the authority to halt the logging,
because it was done on private land. Now, I think one thing that
needs to be added here is that common sense tells you that roots hold
soil in place and prevent erosion, and what may be less obvious to
people, if you think about it, this is going to be rather clear,
though, is that trees suck up a huge amount of water. If you
eliminate those trees when the runoff comes, then the earth just
can't hold that much, and what you have is severe erosion and
eventually mudslides.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Now there are some, some of these slides happen in areas
where there has not been logging, and my understanding is that some
of the private landowners and some of the timber industry folks are
saying you see? They happen even where there are trees. What is the
timber industry saying about these slides and their part, if any, in
the presence of slides?</P>

<P>SIPORIN: Well, I think the timber industry says, you know,
mudslides happen, and they are right. Mudslides always have happened.
It's part of -- you know, you've got steep hillsides and it's a rainy
climate and so you are going to have erosion and mudslides. And
timber people say they are happening more frequently because it's
been a wetter year, the wettest year in recorded history. Now I
haven't heard this argument directly from timber people, but as
someone who's also covered forest fires I've noticed that we have
more problems with people, because more people are living in these
rural areas. This is part of what's happening now. There are more
people in the path of the mudslides, just as there are more people in
the path of the fires.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Are people calling for more logging regulations now as a
result of these slides?</P>

<P>SIPORIN: Well certainly environmentalists are, yes. You know, the
thing is that people long before the slides were calling for various
numbers of reasons for an end to clear-cuts, and we thought with the
Clinton forest plan that we would see the winding down of really the
logging of old growth. As I think most people who follow this issue
know, the salvage rider opened this whole controversy back up again
for timber people to be back</P>

<P>in there logging some areas, some logging sales. The argument
certainly could be made that in an area that's already been
devastated by fire become even more susceptible for causing
mudslides, if any of those areas are in steep hillsides.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Now as you said, under current law most of the logging now
taking place is governed by the salvage logging rider, and of course
that's set to expire at the end of the year. How big a role do you
think these mudslides are going to have in the reauthorization of the
salvage logging rider?</P>

<P>SIPORIN: That's hard to say at this point. But I think that when
you've got people trying to protect something like the spotted owl,
although environmentalists have always argued that it's not the
spotted owl as much as the owl being an indicator species, you have
something where you end up pitting the working person who's losing
their job against a bird. I mean, that's the argument you hear from
the timber side of the equation. With the mudslides you actually have
people dying, not birds but people. And now you've got people pitted
against people in terms of the negative effects, the consequences of
this, of the logging. Now, one might argue, those who see these
mudslides as a disaster in that they're caused by timber practices,
might see a silver lining in these mudslides in that this may be the
amount of evidence that will tip the scales in the favor of really
halting this kind of logging forever.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Alan Siporin is a commentator who joins us from the
studios of KLCC in Eugene, Oregon. Thanks for joining us, Alan.</P>

<P>SIPORIN: Thank you.</P>

<P>FIRST HALF HOUR</P>

<P>HOST: Steve Curwood</P>

<P>NEWSCASTER: Jan Nunley</P>

<P>REPORTERS: Jyl Hoyt, Rob Schober</P>

<P>STORYTELLERS: Judith Black, Guy Peartree, Dovie Thomason</P>

<P>GUESTS: Donna Fernandes, Stan Strickland</P>

<P>(Theme music intro)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: From National Public Radio, this is Living on Earth.</P>

<P>(Music up and under)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I'm Steve Curwood.</P>

<P>The winter solstice is upon us and we mark the event with fiction,
fantasy, and fable on the creation of the season.</P>

<P>BLACK: Persephone. Mother Demeter! Persephone!</P>

<P>PEARTREE: And so that day, Kutora , the lord of the winds, pulled
back the winds. He had been appeased. And his people were saved.</P>

<P>BLACK: A very funny thing happens. Whenever you tell these
stories, children always say, "Is this a story, or is this what
really happened?" And you're faced with the idea of, what's the
difference between science and folklore? I'm not sure.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Storytellers Judith Black and Guy Peartree spin tales of
the natural world and the way it came to be. Living on Earth's third
annual celebration of storytelling is just ahead, right after this.

<H3><A NAME="emf"></A>Study Finds EMF - Alzheimer Link</H3>

<P>NUNLEY: From Living on Earth, I'm Jan Nunley. Alzheimer's disease
is unusually common among people exposed to a lot of electromagnetic
radiation on the job. A study published in the journal Neurology
indicates that workers with high exposure to electromagnetic fields
have 3 to 5 times the normal risk of Alzheimer's. The study's author
cautions that the preliminary findings need to be reproduced by other
researchers. The study says the greatest risk is to people who
operate sewing machines because they work close to electrical motors.
Also at higher risk are carpenters and others who use electrically
powered tools close to the body. In October the National Academy of
Sciences concluded there were no clear links between residential
electromagnetic fields and cancer.</P>

<H3><A NAME="river"></A>Upper Columbia River Basin is Unhealthy</H3>

<P>The Northwest's Upper Columbia River Basin ecosystem is
dangerously unhealthy. That's the conclusion of a new wide-ranging
study by state and Federal officials. From KBSU in Boise, Idaho, Jyl
Hoyt reports.</P>

<P>HOYT: This largest ever study of an ecosystem was conducted in 7
western states on a quarter million square miles. It concludes that
if logging, road building, fire suppression, and grazing continue
unchecked, the ecosystem's health will go from bad to worse. Sediment
from logging is pouring into streams and preventing trout from
spawning. But scientists do say there is enough good habitat left to
recover endangered salmon runs but only with immediate action.
Scientists suggest paring down logging roads, controlling weeds, and
doing prescribed burns as ways to bring the system back into balance.
History shows that devastating burns occur on 20% of a forest, but
forest in the Upper Columbia River Basin are so unhealthy, 50% of
them have had catastrophic fires. For Living on Earth, I'm Jyl Hoyt
in Boise.</P>

<H3><A NAME="bhopal"></A>Bhopal Disaster Still Causing Illnesses
</H3>

<P>NUNLEY: Some illnesses caused by 1984's Bhopal toxic gas leak are
only now emerging. Initially, doctors linked the gas to respiratory
and eye problems only, but after analyzing a 1994 study of nearly 500
people in Bhopal, members of an independent medical commission
determined the gas could be causing neurological and psychological
damage as well. Researchers say cancers and other ailments with
incubation periods of a decade or more may begin showing up in the
next few years. More than 15,000 people died as a result of the
Bhopal accident on December 3, 1984, when a cloud of toxic gas leaked
from a fertilizer plant owned by a subsidiary of Union Carbide.</P>

<H3><A NAME="bee"></A>Tiny Bee Might Save New Zealand's Mistletoe
</H3>

<P>A tiny bee may help save New Zealand's indigenous mistletoe. The
mistletoe had developed a close relationship with honey eater birds,
which use their strong beaks to twist and break open its tightly
closed flowers and spread the plant's pollen. But honey eaters are
becoming scarce and now the lightweight bees have learned to wrestle
open the flowers of the mistletoe, which cannot open by themselves.
Scientists writing in the journal Nature say even though the bee is
not as efficient in spreading the mistletoe pollen, they could end up
saving the mistletoe.</P>

<H3><A NAME="tree"></A>Univ. of Illinois Painting Trees To Curb
Poachers / Schober</H3>

<P>Horticulturalists at the University of Illinois are painting the
school's evergreens orange in an effort to thwart tree poachers who
are cutting them down for Christmas decorations. The Great Lakes
Radio Consortium's Rob Schober reports.</P>

<P>SCHOBER: University horticuturalists say it's a more common
problem that you think, one that universities, golf courses, and even
homeowners have to deal with every Christmas time. For several years
the school sprayed trees the deer repellent. If a tree was cut down
and taken inside, the repellent, which is based on egg whites, got
warm and began to smell terrible. But people kept stealing trees, so
now they paint an orange stripe down the evergreens to make them too
ugly to steal. University horticulturalist Bill Hoffman says they
came up with these solutions because they simply didn't know what
else to do.</P>

<P>HOFFMAN: We just came up with how are we going to handle this?
We're losing 20-some trees a year and at $400 to $500 a tree, you
know, to plant and install and maintain it, that adds up.</P>

<P>SCHOBER: Hoffman says people will chop down 20- or even 30-foot
trees only to lop off the top 6 feet for their tree. He thinks the
paint is working, though, because they've only lost a few trees in
the last couple of years. In the end, he says, it's ironic that
people gather with their family and friends to celebrate Christmas in
front of a stolen tree. I'm Rob Schober in Urbana, Illinois.</P>

<H3><A NAME="gum"></A>China Declares Chewing Gum An Environmental
Hazard</H3>

<P>NUNLEY: China has declared chewing gum a serious environmental
hazard. The announcement in the newspaper China Daily came after a
group of high school students found domestically made gum couldn't be
eroded by strong acids, like sulfuric acid or liquid ammonia. The
students said the gum could only be destroyed by burning. In their
quest to point out the potential hazards of the chewing habit, the
students also buried soggy samples, finding them unchanged in color
and flexibility after a month underground. Although they admitted
their findings require authoritative confirmation, the students still
lashed out at the vile habit, and called for government regulation.

<P>BLACK: Hi, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Persephone and Demeter is one of those "Why-Things-Are"
stories: in this case, why there is a winter. From Judith Black, now,
Persephone and Demeter.</P>

<P>BLACK: Demeter. The Goddess of all that grew. Had hair as thick
and dark as the earth. Eyes like pools of water. Skin as soft as the
silk that grew at the top of the corn. And when Zeus, the lord of
all, saw her, hutcha hutcha hutcha! And to put it Biblically -- he
knew her. And the fruit of their union was Persephone, the apple of
her mother's eye. For as Demeter's hair was like the earth,
Persephone's was as black as the night. And if Demeter's skin was as
soft as the top of the corn, Persephone's was as soft as a windless
day. And if her mother's eyes were like pools of water, Persephone's
were like coals that grew for thousands of years in that earth, and
how the mother loved the daughter and she never allowed her out of
her sight. And as Persephone grew, her beauty lighted the afternoon
and -- chh! -- broke through the crust of the Earth. So that Hades,
the lord of the dead, one day perceived that light.</P>

<P>"Oh. Oh! If if if -- if she can bring light here, imagine what
she's like in the flesh! This one I gotta have."</P>

<P>But when Hades looked carefully, he saw that the mother never took
her eyes off the daughter. And so he waited and waited for his
moment.</P>

<P>"Now, today, my daughter, you have learned how to sing out the
sun. You have learned how to bring the riches from the Earth. Now
that it is fall and the corn is at its highest, I will teach you the
dance to bring on the fall rain. But not here among the corn. Well,
child, go to the open field."</P>

<P>And when Demeter turned, Hades saw his chance. And he got into his
chariot with 6 coal-black steeds, flame rushing from their nostrils
they cracked through the surface of the Earth and opened. He came, he
grabbed Persephone in his hairy arms, and back through that crust
which -- chhhhh! -- closed over them. So that a moment later, when
the mother turned around to look for her: "Persephone? Persephone!
Sun, where is she?"</P>

<P>"I was looking the other way."</P>

<P>"Wind? Where is my daughter?"</P>

<P>"I was blowing towards the north."</P>

<P>"Earth!"</P>

<P>"I was looking towards you, Demeter."</P>

<P>"Persephone."</P>

<P>And meanwhile, beneath the crust of the Earth in the world of the
dead:</P>

<P>"You will bring light to my world. You, you, this shall be your
kingdom, Persephone."</P>

<P>"My kingdom, are you kidding? You call this a color pattern?
Black, white, black, white, a few grays? I wanna go back to my
mother!"</P>

<P>"You will be queen of this kingdom. Here! Have a pomegranate."
</P>

<P>"Are you kidding? You call that brunch?"</P>

<P>Now I don't know if she knew or if it was just instinct, but if
you eat of the fruit of the dead, you become as the dead.</P>

<P>"I'm not eatin' a thing."</P>

<P>And she stayed beneath that earth. But Demeter, the mother, began
to search for her daughter.</P>

<P>"Persephone!"</P>

<P>And she had no heart to call the sun to warm the earth. And she
had no desire to sing out the warmth. And her feet felt too heavy to
do the dance of the fall rain. And the earth grew dry and cold, and
it gave no nourishment. And the human beings began to die and they
called out to the lord of all, Zeus. "Give the mother back her
daughter!"</P>

<P>"Oh, come on, now, you know, Hades is just a boy. Boys will be
boys, let him have Perse -- "</P>

<P>"We will all die! Give the mother back her daughter!"</P>

<P>"Now, now -- "</P>

<P>"Zeus! What is the lord of all without those to worship him? Just
a statue."</P>

<P>"Uh, well, since you put it that way. Hmm -- Hades! Hades!"</P>

<P>"Yes? Zeus?"</P>

<P>"Hades, you must return the girl to her mother."</P>

<P>"I don't wanna."</P>

<P>"You must."</P>

<P>"Oh come on, who do you think you are, my big brother?"</P>

<P>"Yes."</P>

<P>"Oh, you always pull rank on me this way."</P>

<P>"Return her!"</P>

<P>"If I must. "</P>

<P>"And thank goodness, I couldn't have stayed here another minute."
</P>

<P>"Well, you must be hungry."</P>

<P>And in this moment of joy, Hades offered Persephone a pomegranate.
And without thinking, the girl grabbed it and took a bite. And after
she'd swallowed the meat from around the seeds -- ppt! ppt! ppt! ppt!
-- 4 came from her mouth into the palm of Hades.</P>

<P>"Four. Four! That means you will come back to me for 4 months out
of every year."</P>

<P>"Oh, darn!"</P>

<P>"Now, let us go back to your mother!"</P>

<P>And he grabbed her, put her in the chariot. They cracked through
the crust of the earth. He set her down, and went back beneath that
place. And with the girl on one side of the globe and the mother on
her other, they called to each other.</P>

<P>"Persephone."</P>

<P>"Mother, Demeter!"</P>

<P>"Persephone!"</P>

<P>"Demeter!"</P>

<P>And as they ran across the face of the Earth, in their wake the
planet warmed and grew fertile and sun came out in the sky and rains
came from the heavens. Until they embraced.</P>

<P>"My daughter."</P>

<P>"Mother!"</P>

<P>And summer came to our planet again. But every year, for those 4
months when Persephone must return to the world of the dead, her
mother still wanders. And that's when cold covers this place like a
blanket of death.</P>

<P>(Applause. Music up and under)</P>

<P>PEARTREE: That's correct. Yes, they hired me to tell stories from
the 1830s.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So who do you play?</P>

<P>PEARTREE: One of the characters is Peter Clark, and the other
character is William Brown from Providence. He's well known because
he wrote an autobiography detailing how his master had slaves, sold
slaves. His name was Moses Brown. And that Moses Brown became an
abolitionist. He converted.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: He converted.</P>

<P>PEARTREE: Yes.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: But it's not the slavery of people we're talking about
right now. It's going to be the slavery of winter time.</P>

<P>PEARTREE: The slavery of winter.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Under all that wind and snow.</P>

<P>PEARTREE: Cold grips.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And you have a story for us, right?</P>

<P>PEARTREE: Yes. It's called Kutora , Lord of the Winds, from the
nomadic tribe the Ninets of Siberia.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, well let's hear it then.</P>

<P>PEARTREE: All right. Kutora , Lord of the Winds. The cold north
winds blew across the tundra, their freezing winds bit into the land.
Ooooohhhhh! The old man sat in his hut, and he realized that Kutora ,
Lord of the Wind was angry. He realized that if the lord of the wind
was not appeased, his people would perish. And so he looked at his
elder daughter and said, "Daughter, you must go to Kutora and marry
him. That's the only way to appease the winds."</P>

<P>"But father, how will I find him?"</P>

<P>"Follow my instructions. Take your sled into the north wind. Go
all the way up to the top of a hill. A little bird will come and
perch itself on your shoulder. Stroke that bird gently. Take your
sled all the way down to the bottom, where Kutora lives, enter the
tent, and wait for him to come in, and follow his instructions
exactly."</P>

<P>Well, the girl went out into the wind. She took her sled all the
way up to the top of a hill. A little bird came to perch on her
shoulder but she shooed the bird away. Then she took her sled all the
way down to where Kutora lives. She went inside. But she didn't wait.
She ate the meat and lay down and slept.</P>

<P>Kutora entered, a very strong, handsome man he was. "What are you
doing here?"</P>

<P>She woke up. "I -- I have been sent by my father so -- so that you
-- you will bring back the winds, and -- and I will marry you."</P>

<P>"Well, follow my instructions exactly. Take this meat to the old
woman who lives in the snow, then bring back her gift. Then I will
have hides here waiting, and you will sew them and make them into a
coat and boots for me."</P>

<P>Well, the girl went out into the snow, but she had no idea where
the old woman lived. So she threw the meat to the side, and then she
returned with an empty dish. She sat down immediately to sew the coat
and to make the boots. But when Kutora came back, nothing was done to
his specification. The boots were not done, the coat's not done. And
so he got angry and he blew her into the wind. Whoooooh! And she
landed in the snow. The howling winds continued over the Ninet's
camp, and the father knew that his eldest daughter had not succeeded.
So he said to his second daughter, "I want you to go and do what my
first daughter has not been able to do. I want you to marry the Lord
of the Wind. And I want him to bring back the winds.</P>

<P>So the second daughter, as well, went out into the snow. But she
did not heed her father's words, and she shooed the bird away. And
when she got down to the very bottom of the hill she went into the
tent of Kutora and she ate the meat and fell asleep. And likewise,
she didn't follow his instructions. She went and took the meat and
threw it into the snow, and came back, and did a very unpleasant job
with the hides. And so Kutora was angry again and he blew her into
the snow.</P>

<P>And again, the old man realized that his second daughter had not
succeeded. So he went to the third daughter and he said, "My third
daughter, please listen. It is up to you to save our people. Go and
marry Kutora , follow my instructions exactly."</P>

<P>So the third daughter went out into the wind. She rode her sled up
to the top of a hill. The little bird came, perched itself on her
shoulder, and she stroked it gently. "Cooo." Off she went down the
hill. She came to the big tent and she went inside and she waited
patiently. Kutora entered and he said, "I see you have come here to
marry me, haven't you?"</P>

<P>"Yes, I have."</P>

<P>"Well. Well, I want you to take this meat to the old woman who
lives in the snow and bring it back with a gift inside. And then you
will sew this coat that I want you to sew for me and these boots that
I want you to sew for me with the hides that I have prepared here. I
will come back at midnight."</P>

<P>So the girl went out into the snow. She took the meat. Now, she
didn't know where to find the old woman, but the little bird came and
showed her the way. She found herself in front of the old woman's
hut, and she knocked on the door. (Knock, knock, knock) Out the old
woman came. "What do you want?"</P>

<P>"Kutora has sent me. He has some meat for you."</P>

<P>"All right, dear." She took the meat inside and she put something
on the plate and gave it to her. The little bird showed her how to
get back to Kutora 's tent. When she arrived at the tent, Kutora
smiled and said, "You're going to need those things. Those are the
sewing tools for the coat and boots that I told you to make for me. I
will be back at midnight."</P>

<P>The girl set to work. She was working very hard. She knew it was
going to be impossible to make a coat and boots by midnight. But that
old woman came in and she said, "Dear, look, there's something in my
eye. Will you please get it out for me?"</P>

<P>She went over to the old woman and she got the thing out of the
old woman's eye. And the old woman said, "Dear, would you look into
my ear? There's something in there that you should see." And to her
surprise, there was a maiden in there. "Take her hand, dear, and
bring her out." The girl took the maiden's hand and she came out of
the old woman's ear. And another girl came out, and another, and
another. Altogether there were 4 young maidens, and they set about
making the coat and boots for Kutora . They worked very, very easily,
and they made a perfect coat and boots for Kutora , Lord of the Wind.
They jumped back into her ear, and the old woman, she slowly went out
of the tent saying, "You're a very nice girl. A very wise and gentle
girl."</P>

<P>Kutora came back and saw that his coat and his boots were made to
perfection, and he laughed, and he smiled, and he said, "Now we will
be married." And so that day, Kutora the Lord of the Winds pulled
back the winds. The old man came out of his tent. He looked up at the
sky and he smiled because he knew his third daughter had succeeded.
Kutora had taken back the winds. He had been appeased. And his people
were saved.</P>

<P>(Music; applause)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Thank you. That's Guy Peartree with Kutora , Lord of the
Wind. Now, both you and Judith Black told us very different stories,
but I wonder if you see any parallels between them.</P>

<P>BLACK: You should always subcontract your leather work.</P>

<P>(Audience laughs)</P>

<P>PEARTREE: We should always have maidens inside our ears. Yes,
well, I think there is a gentle relationship, in that the fact that
women are both part of the story, young women, whose beauty or their
effectiveness is related to an element of nature. So on the surface,
yes, there is a relationship between the two stories.</P>

<P>BLACK: Well, and that both women represent fertility. I mean, the
old woman who lived in, you know, the old woman of the woods, however
she was referred, and Demeter, are both what give us life. And also
the need for some kind of sacrifice, you know, or knowledge of the
deity, in order to negotiate your relationship. But obviously, where
they're both placed determines an enormous amount about the folklore
around them, you know, that the cold is the determining factor in
Siberia so that people relate to the wind. And then, the loss of the
fertility in Greece is what the story developed around because that's
what caused them wonder and terror.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And the lesson here for us is we have to redeem ourselves
to escape winter.</P>

<P>PEARTREE: Well, I think you should respect nature, whether it's in
the form of Demeter or the form of Kutora . Things have to be done so
that nature receives her due, or his due, depending on who you are.
</P>

<P>BLACK: Right. And given that, to know that there will be a full
cycle.</P>

<P>PEARTREE: Yes.</P>

<P>BLACK: A very funny thing happens. Whenever you tell these
stories, children always say, "Is this a story, or is this what
really happened?" And you're faced with the idea of, what's the
difference between science and folklore? I'm not sure.</P>

<P>(Music up and under)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: In the northern hemisphere, the winter solstice is, of
course, the shortest day of the year. Do you know why? Because the
southern hemisphere is stealing all our light. Yes! While there are
only 9 hours of daylight here in Boston, there are 13 hours of sun in
Rio de Janeiro. Actually, what causes the difference in the length of
the day is the earth's tilt toward the sun. The earth leans slightly
on its axis like a spinning top frozen in one off-kilter position.
Astronomers have even pinpointed the precise angle of the tilt; it's
23 degrees and 27 minutes off the perpendicular to the plane of or
bit. As the Earth orbits the sun, the northern hemisphere goes from
being angled towards the sun at the summer solstice to being angled
away from the sun at the winter solstice. Because of this, we have a
planet full of climate with their varying amounts of sunlight.
Despite the cold we feel here in the northern hemisphere in December,
the Earth is actually nearer to the sun now than it is in June, by 3
million miles.</P>

</TABLE></P>

<P>THOMASON : It was a story told to me by my Kaiwa Apache
grandmother, but she would borrow stories from Nova Scotia or the
Yukon. To me it's just grandma's story.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well, let's hear it, then.</P>

<P>THOMASON : In the beginning times the Earth was not as we know it
today, for it was an Earth of darkness. Dark and cold covered this
earth in all directions, and it was a difficult Earth for the animals
who lived upon her. In the darkness they could not see each other. So
it was those animals with eyes that could see in the dark, those
animals who were sharp of tooth and claw who did well on this earth,
and the others? They were the hunted. That was their place. They were
the meat. And they were afraid in this dark world. They hid, they
ran, but they could not spend their lives hiding and running. They
wanted something else. They wanted a difference in this earth. But
they could imagine nothing but the darkness that was their world.
There were other problems. In this world of darkness the animals
crashed into each other, stepped on each other, tangled with each
other -- oop! Augh! Ow! Ooh! Who's on my paw? Who's that antler, get
that antler -- who did that? That hurt! Ow! Ooh! Ow! Soon, they were
arguing. There was trouble with the planet. There were troubles with
the animals who lived in this place. They fought, who was doing what
to who? Whose sharp toe? Whose claw was that? And there was trouble,
trouble, in this dark place. There had to be another way. But they
could not conceive of it.</P>

<P>So they went to the maker of this place. They went to the maker
and asked that he could rethink this creation. Something was missing.
They wanted something, they did not know what. The maker looked at
them. "You cannot imagine. There is something else. You cannot
imagine it. It is called light. It will bring warmth. You will be
able to see." Oh, to some of the animals, this sounded so good. The
birds having wings knew that they -- they could do something with
them if they could but see. This world of light, it sounded good to
them. But then the great animals, the hunters, stood. It was bear who
spoke for them. "I want no light. I want the dark. I like the night."
</P>

<P>And now the animals began arguing again. The birds spoke out for
light. "We want to fly! We want this light. We want the light," but
other birds turned on their own. "We don't want it. We like the
dark." It was owl and nighthawk, those hunters of the night. They
were happy with the Earth as it was, and soon all of the creatures of
this Earth were arguing before their very maker.</P>

<P>He raised his hands. "There must be a solution. An Earth of light.
An Earth of dark."</P>

<P>And suddenly a little voice spoke out before him. It was Ant.
"Could -- could there not be dark and light? I can almost imagine
color. Color. We would see in light. There would be goodness in both
dark and light. Could we not have both?"</P>

<P>Bear looked down at her. "I don't want it! I don't like it! I
don't want to see it. I like dark!"</P>

<P>And before the argument could erupt again the Maker raised his
hands and said, "This must be settled fairly. We will settle this as
many things have been settled, with a dance contest." (Audience
laughter) "There will be dancing and the winner, the one who creates
the greatest, strongest, dance, the one who stands at the end of the
dance, that is the way it will be. Bear, you will dance for dark."
And Bear pulled himself up tall. "And I see none who truly want an
Earth of only light." And they did not. They could not imagine this.
What if they changed for something much worse? "And Ant, will you
dance for dark and light?" And she agreed.</P>

<P>And so all the animals began to prepare for this great contest.
They prepared the food, for each contest is ended with feasting,
where all hard feeling is lost in the joy of the feast. And Bear
prepared to dance as he prepares to do everything: he ate. And ate.
And ate. He ate so much the animals preparing for the feast thought
there would be none left for the feast. And he ate, and ate. While
Ant prepared in a different way. She sat and folded her hands. She
prayed. She fasted. She sipped only of pure water.</P>

<P>Bear had eaten enough. He was ready to dance. He stood. The
animals looked up at him. He was big. He was strong. He took his
first step. "I am Bear! I dance for Night! I want the dark, I want no
light! I am Bear, I dance for Night!" And his dance was strong. The
animals watched and thought ooh, we are going to live in darkness.
(Audience laughter) And then it was Ant's turn. She stood, they
looked at her. Tiny before them, she pulled her belt tight, and she
began to dance. She danced for dark. She danced for light. She danced
for day, she danced for night. She danced for peace among all people,
and that everyone would get what they need. And then she sat and the
animals thought: that was -- different. But it was strong. It was
beautiful. It was graceful, but -- then Bear stood up, he had been
eating all this time, and he was huge! "I am Bear!" And Earth shook
under his feet and the animals shook, thinking of the darkness that
would be their home forever. "I dance for Night! I want the dark, I
want no light! I am Bear, I dance for Night!"</P>

<P>Ant had been fasting. Ant had been praying. She stood, she was
lightheaded and dizzy. She tightened her belt against her hunger. And
she danced. She danced for dark, she danced for light, she danced for
day, she danced for night. She danced for peace among all people, and
that everyone would get what they need. And the people smiled. It was
good, this dance, it was strong, this dance. Perhaps it could be as
she was dancing, as she was praying, but then Bear stood. He'd been
eating still more. His belly was like a boulder in front of him. "I
am Bear! Uuhhh..." (Audience laughter)</P>

<P>And he fell forward with a great crash! And soon was snoring. The
animals cheered. The Earth was going to change. Ant had won. She
didn't need to dance again, but she did. She danced for dark, she
danced for light, she danced for day, she danced for night. She
danced for peace among all people and that everyone would get what
they need. Now, when we see the ants today, the ones I grew up with,
their bodies are black and red, the color of the night, and the
colors we can only see in light. And we all notice their tiny waists.
</P>

<P>(Applause; music)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Dovie Thomason , the story you just told us, Ant Dances
for Light, this just isn't about how day and night were divided, is
it? But it's a lesson on moderation?</P>

<P>THOMASON : The lessons for the stories I've been told are what we
each take away from them. For me, it's a story about the power of
small things and that each of us have our own needs, and that somehow
we have to accommodate those and respect them.</P>

<H3><A NAME="donna"></A>How Animals Prepare for Winter</H3>

<P>CURWOOD: Well, thank you. And now, let's welcome Donna Fernandes,
who's the associate curator at the Wildlife Conservation Society in
New York (audience applause). Donna, you're a zoologist. Tell me: do
ants and bears really dance?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, I must admit, ants and bears aren't known for
their dancing abilities as much as some other species. Honeybees
dance to communicate food to other members of their hive, and there
are very elaborate courtship dances in a number of bird species and
even scorpions do somewhat of a waltz during mating. So there are
species who are better dancers than bears and ants.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: But they do get ready for the cold, dark winter.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Oh, absolutely.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What happens?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, in response to decreasing day length or
shortening days and colder temperatures, animals in this area adopt
one of 3 strategies. They can migrate, just leave the area
completely; hibernate; or they can develop certain characteristics
that make them to resist the cold much better.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Mm, let's start with hibernation. I want to try that
right now. In fact, I really wished I could have stayed in bed this
morning. I want to sleep longer. So in honor of our bear, maybe we
could talk about that.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Right. In the winter, I think all of us hate getting
out of bed. It's often still dark out. That cold floor to put your
feet on in the morning isn't very comfortable. We may sleep a little
longer, but bears really sleep the whole winter away. They spend
about 100 days in their den without eating anything, in a sort of
semi-sleeping state. And not only do they not eat, but they lower
their body temperature by several degrees, and their metabolic rate
decreases to about half the normal rate.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Wow. So why do this? I mean, what's the advantage of such
changes?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, by lowering your body temperature and your
metabolic rate, you can get by with a lot fewer calories, so they can
burn up that stored fat much more slowly. And this is the only way
they can survive without eating, because there really isn't much to
eat for a bear during the winter months.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh. It's a diet plan in other words.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Sort of, yeah. (Audience laughter)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: But, I mean, are they really hibernating? I mean, you're
not supposed to go near a hibernating bear, right?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Right. They are still capable of a certain amount of
coordinated body movements. So if you do disturb a sleeping bear,
they will wake up and they can retreat or attack. There are other
animals which are what are called true hibernators or deep
hibernators, and they go into a completely comatose state. Things
like a lot of our rodents from around here, ground squirrels,
chipmunks, prairie dogs, those kinds of things. They'll lower their
body temperature to just a few degrees above freezing. So if you find
one it will be very cold to the touch. And their metabolic rate is
about 10% of normal rate. Something like the Arctic ground squirrel,
the heart rate goes from about 100 to 200 beats per minute to 10 to
20 beats per minute, and breathing goes from about 100 breaths per
minute down to 4 breaths per minute. So they're in a very
slumber-like, slow, frozen state.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Of course, now, this time of year I do like to sleep
late, but I even prefer to go, like, south, you know, Florida,
Caribbean, you know, something like that. It's even better, right?
</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, migration's a very common strategy, particularly
among our birds. In this part of the world, in the United States and
Canada, fully two thirds of the birds that breed here migrate south
for the winter, either to our southern states, Mexico, or Central or
South America. And probably some of the most remarkable things are
the distances that they travel.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: For example?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, the Arctic tern is the most famous. They breed in
the Arctic Circle during the summer months, and then when winter
approaches they fly all the way down to Antarctica and then back
again in the spring. It's a round trip of 22,000 miles. By doing this
they actually spend about 9 months of their time in perpetual light.
So they're probably the one animal that would have argued on the case
of light in that previous story. They like a lot of light. But even
things as small as the monarch butterfly, which weighs about 1/100th
of an ounce, they've been tagged in Canada and found to fly all the
way down to Mexico for the wintering site, a distance of about 2,000
miles.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now aside from the birds and these butterflies, who else
likes to migrate in the animal kingdom?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, certain bats will migrate, and some of our larger
mammals like caribou or reindeer. And in the past we had huge herds
of bison or American buffalo, and they used to migrate great
distances. And probably a very well known group is whales, who will
migrate from north to south in the winter.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, you mention that some animals, I mean, those who
don't sleep or those who don't catch a jet south, develop some sort
of resistance.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Right. Things like fish that live in ponds really can't
migrate, or a lot of small aquatic invertebrates or toads and things.
They have -- the biggest problem they face is how to avoid freezing,
since they really can't go anywhere. They produce a certain chemical
in their blood called glycerol, which is much like antifreeze. And
what it does is it lowers the freezing temperature of their body
tissues, which is composed primarily of water. And by having
antifreeze or this glycerol in their body, their cells won't burst.
Much like you put antifreeze in your car radiator so your radiator
fluid doesn't freeze over.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And finally, like so many of us, I guess that the animals
really do pack it on in the winter. They don't have the diet plan of
the bear, though.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Right. Another strategy is better insulation. You can
do that through a thicker fur coat, which a lot of mammals do get a
thicker winter coat. Or you can do it by a thicker layer of fat,
which provides insulation and so aquatic mammals, which don't have
much fur, get that layer of blubber. I think in humans, though, we
gain weight not because we want greater insulation as we're trying to
-- we're escaping the release of having to look good in a bathing
suit. So I think we allow ourselves to get a little heavier in the
winter because we don't have to look so good any more.</P>

<H3><A NAME="stan"></A>Music for the Animals</H3>

<P>CURWOOD: Thank you. Donna Fernandes is associate curator for the
Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City. Donna, I want you to
stick around while we talk to Stan Strickland, who's been making the
music here for us today. And he's also been trying to spread his
message to the animal kingdom, I mean literally. Now you used to work
at Boston's Franklin Park Zoo. You're not allowed to feed the animals
there but I understand, Stan, you have been playing to the animals.
How did that gig come about?</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Colleen Kelley, who works with the zoo, had this idea
that the animals needed to have a little entertainment, something to
break up the boredom from looking at all these silly people.
(Audience laughter) So she started a series of music performances and
I was asked to do one.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Hmm. So, how did the animals respond to all this?</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Well, it's kind of interesting. You know, you don't
really know what an animal is thinking. You have to kind of project.
I played for 3 different animals. The first was zebras.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Can you show me what you played for the zebras?</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Well, I had my trusty soprano saxophone. And in the
very beginning it was a photo shoot to sort of give some publicity.
So we just pretended to play -- I was blowing air sort of like (sound
of air escaping). And just to make sure they wouldn't get too spooked
out. But they seemed to not mind our being there, so we started
playing a little bit, a little bit like... (sax and drum beats) Then
we went over to and met Koby. You must know about Koby.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh, the gorilla. I've met him, and Kiki, too, there.</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: And Kiki. Koby is really pretty cool. At first, Koby
was back somewhere, we couldn't see him. And Kiki was out sort of
bathing in the sun. So I gave out a big call on the saxophone to see
if I could get his attention, like: (tremolo on sax) And Koby kind of
walks out like Yo, what's up man? (Audience laughter) Really.
(grunts) And one thing I learned, though, about at least the gorillas
is that one of their ways of communicating is by throwing things,
right? (Audience laughter) And they throw whatever is around, so
there are 2 areas of the Franklin Park Zoo for the gorillas. The
outside area, there's some branches and some things, and occasionally
Koby would throw some branches. But when we went inside, the other
male gorilla, what's his name?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Vip.</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Vip.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yeah.</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Vip looks like of mean to me.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yeah, he'll throw something else. (Audience laughter)
</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Yeah. So I was there the 2 times with musician friends
Bob Moses, a drummer, and the second time with Wesley Wirth. So
Wesley and I had seen Koby throw stuff. So when we went inside, Vip?
</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Vip.</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Vip was like standing there and he reached down to
grab something to throw, and Wes and I knew it was coming, so we kind
of like, kind of ducked a little bit. And unfortunately some of the
other people in the audience didn't quite know what was happening,
and as Vip sort of tossed little gorilla poop out (audience laughter)
it kind of splattered on a little girl's leg, and that was kind of
yucky (audience laughter).</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Sort of a sour note, huh?</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Yeah, yeah.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Is there a tune that they seem to like?</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Oh yeah, so, we kind of played something like this for
Koby: (lively sax and percussion)</P>

<P>(Audience applause)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: That was a great concert for them. Donna, is there any
way to tell whether the animals really liked the music that Stan was
playing?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, I think probably the most positive sign is that
the animals generally approached the exhibit barriers to try to get
as close to the musicians as possible. It's still hard to decide
whether that's just a novel situation or a novel noise and they're
curious, or whether they actually like it. But if the musicians
continue to come and the novelty wears off, yet they still approach
the barriers, I think it suggests that they really do enjoy the
music.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well thanks for playing what you did for the animals,
Stan. I'm wondering if you could play something for us, now? I think
it would be appropriate for us to honor the winter spirits and call
for the return of the sun, huh?</P>

<P>STRICKLAND: Okay. For you human animals, we're going to do an
African, a West African welcoming song. And this song is to help us
welcome the sun back. So we want everyone to sing with us, okay? It's
called Afunga Alafia... (drum beats) Afunga alafia, ashay ashay.
Afunga alafia, ashay ashay... and a wa wa wa wa wa wa wa, and a wa wa
wa wa wa wa wa... Afunga alafia, ashay ashay... (etc.) A ya ya yo!
(audience repeats) A ya ya yo! ... Ha! ayay (audience repeats) (etc.)
</P>

<H2>Aftermath: The Remnants of War</H2>

<P><BR>

CURWOOD: On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh
month, four years after it began, World War I came to an end. Here in
the US, the day is called Armistice Day, although few of us can
recall why. North Americans have largely forgotten about this war
that killed more than 5 million military personnel, injured nearly 13
million more, and left an estimated 8 million civilians dead. But the
nations in which World War I was fought have very real reminders.
Shells from the so-called "war to end all wars" still accidentally
explode and kill people to this day. In his book Aftermath, writer
Donovan Webster traveled the world documenting the damage that all of
this century's major wars have done to the landscape and its people.
His tour began in France, where artillery shells left over from World
War I are a common sight and a small corps of men called demineurs
have the job of cleaning up this military pollution.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: We were driving along the Chemin de Dam which is the site
of 2 large battles, and we were trying to get to this little town
called Chevre Rival, and it took us a while to get there because we
were having to keep stopping to pick up shells that were just
incidentally laid along the roadside. We would drive down the road a
little farther and a farmer named Corvitz, we have to go see. And he
comes charging out of his house. He's got his boots on, he's been
waiting for us all morning, he's waving his fists in the air and he's
like, "I've got some shells and grenades over here!" So we go over
across the road to his barn, and up against his barn is a pile of
rags. And he lifts this, some of the rags off this pile and there are
a couple of shells and a couple grenades and they lift them up. We
start taking them to the car and he says, "Look, I've got an orchard
in here, do you want to go collect there, too? I hate it because I've
got to mow up there and I'm always afraid children are going to be
playing in the pile I have of shells and, you know, dud shells,
they're unexploded artillery shells. And that they may have moved
one, my mower will hit it and I'll blow up. And we said well sure,
we're here. We drive up into his orchard and he stops and he points.
And it looked like a refuse pile at a construction site. I mean, he's
got a mound as high as your thighs of unexploded shells. These guys
are just, they're just shaking their heads,they're like... and we
finally, Remy Delouse, who's the co-leader of this group, turns to me
and says, "Now, you see what I'm talking about?"</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, on the cover of your book, there's a man, he's got
thick rubber gloves and he has, looks like old shells just covered
with dirt and barnacles and slime. There's no face on this person.
But he's holding these, this unexploded ordnance almost lovingly.
</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yeah, it's remarkably low tech. They go out in the mud
and they pick them up and they carry them back to a truck and then
they put them in the back of the truck and they take them to a depot,
and then one week out of every month they blow up what they've
collected. They dig a pit so that all the blast is directed upward,
and then they blow them up. So they know they're all gone, for good.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now it's been -- what, 50 years since there last was a
battle fought in France? It's been, what -- 80 years since the end of
World War I. Now, how many people die from leftover munitions from
those wars?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Roughly 90 people a year, on average, are killed or
injured by these, and this is just in France. This isn't in Holland
or, you know, Denmark or anything like that. But France had the
biggest problem because they really had the static war. I mean, they
had 2 armies just throwing shells at each other for 4 years.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So 90 people a year you figure in France, that's probably
more people than are killed, say, in aircraft every year there.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Likely, yeah. I mean, that's as many people as --
Americans killed in the Gulf War, you know.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: From which war do they get most of their stuff?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Oh, by far, 80%, 90% from the first World War. There were
just that many more shells fired. The detonators didn't work as well.
There was 15% detonator failure, they estimate. And there were days
when they'd shoot 11 million shells, in a day, from one place.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Eleven million shells?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: At the Chemin de Dam. You know, they're littering the
soil there, and that's why they've had to close off those forests.
But World War I by far has the most shells. I mean, they clean 800,
900 tons of shells a year. They could clean a lot more. And that's a
number that never changes.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And the government has what? 100, 125 people doing this.
</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Their hiring practices are sort of quiet. It's not an
equal opportunity kind of a thing. You get tapped to come in by
people who do it. And so, yeah, the year I was there, there were 123.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And how many die each year?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Average 18.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So, in other words, 5 years is a long time to keep this
job alive.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: It's a young man's job. The guy who I interviewed at the
beginning is, was in late 40s when I interviewed him. And that year
we're sitting at lunch and he says, "This has been a really good
year." It's the end of September. "We've only lost 11 men." Three
weeks later he lifted up an artillery shell that appeared to have
some poison gas in it. He put on his gas mask, he put on his gloves.
He lifted it up. Gas escaped, got under his mask, and gravely wounded
him. He's back at work now, finally, you know, 3 years later, and he
still -- it's, you know, he's not fully at work.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: How much land have the French cleared of their unexploded
munitions, do you think?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: They estimate 2 million acres, although it's not really
clear. You know, we would drive through places that have been okayed
for farming again, and every mile or 2 there's still a shell that the
farmer's found in his field and drags to the side of the road.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Let me try to get this right. How long would it take for
France to get rid of all these unexploded munitions on their
territory at the present rate they're going?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: They wouldn't tell me. They have no -- I expect they have
no idea. They estimate, still, though, there are 10 million
unexploded and buried shells around Verdun alone.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: You mean you talked about how a -- what, how many tons of
ordinance would fall on one square meter?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yeah.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And -- I mean, how do they even find bodies after
something like that?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Perhaps -- early on the thing that affected me the most
was at Verdun, where more than a million men were lost in that siege.
And only 290,000 identifiable bodies remained. And these were just --
I mean, these were bodies they could tell were bodies. The 710,000
others were, you know, rough and change, they wrote off. They said
well, explosions took them, the mud swallowed them. Of the 290,000
bodies they recovered, they could only identify 130,000 -- or 160,000
of them; the other 130 were merely parts. And they took those parts
and put them in a big building that is just as sobering as any place
on earth. I mean, 130,000 men, and they've got -- it's really rough,
it's amazing.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Go ahead.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: You just, you go there and it's a very, it looks like a
piece of French bread, sort of. And it's maybe a quarter mile long.
It's just a block house but it's beautifully done. They've got little
windows in the bottom. They originally took the bodies, they put them
all in a provisional warehouse and then forgot about them. I mean,
all the places I went pretty much part of it is about active
forgetting. You know, no one wants to really remember these places.
Ultimately, they had to clean up the landscape and everybody from the
Red Cross to the Boy Scouts helped them clean it up. Just they felt
out of respect both to the dead and to the war, they had to do this,
not to mention to clean up France. Well, they finally built this
amazing building through international funds and the French spent a
lot of money on it and the Church spent a lot of money, the Catholic
Church. And along the bottom, base, they put all these men in there.
Along the base of the building where you can see inside, where they
put them in, it's just bones as far as you can see.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Wow.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yeah.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, what about the rest of the world? If 90 people a
year die in France from this, how many people die around the world
from the stuff that's left over from wars?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: There's never been a number calculated for that. I mean,
our State Department generates that 26 to 28,000 people a year are
killed by land mines alone.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Twenty-six to twenty-eight thousand people.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yes, and that's down from a high of -- have killed or
injured as many as 100,000. That's just 3 years ago. So it's, the
situation is stabilizing.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And that's just from land mines? Or that's from --</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yes.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Just from land mines.</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yeah. And there are between, depending on who you ask, 85
million and 300 million of these in the ground. Forty percent of the
people who are killed by them after the war ends are civilians:
women, children, collecting wood, going to get the water, you know,
especially in the African nations where, you know, fighting for civil
wars and things. They use them to ring water holes. They use them to
turn civilian populations into refugee populations. It's -- it's
chilling.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Is there anything positive that comes out of this
detritus of war?</P>

<P>WEBSTER: Yes. You go to a place like Vietnam, and you fly into Noy
Vey Airport, Hanoi, which was once a huge airfield in the war. And as
you fly in you see bomb craters as far as you can see that are still
in the ground, you know, have been left there for 25 years. The
Vietnamese have taken these craters, they've knit them together with
dikes. They are always at want for protein as a nation, and they're
fish farming in them. And you know, the idea that they have pulled
life, you know, turned war inside out and pulled life out of it,
that's one of the things I want to do in this book is have people
stare at the reality of this and say okay, how can we make it, turn
this around? And the Vietnamese have done it all over, you know. In
the DMZ, this is one of their favorite stories, they collect all the
scrap. They grade it, you know, different grades of scrap metal,
steel. They send it to a series of 10 different rolling mills, steel
mills, in which case they may turn it into I-beams or wiring conduit.
You know, they're building skyscrapers really like crazy now, or else
they turn it into ingots, sell it to the Japanese, the Japanese turn
it into cars which they sell back to us, and the Vietnamese think
that is the funniest thing in the world.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I want to thank you for taking this time with us today.
</P>

<P>WEBSTER: It's been my pleasure. Thank you very much, I love the
show.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Donovan Webster's book is called Aftermath: The Remnants
of War. Thank you, sir.</P>

<H2>The Lost Gospel of the Earth</H2>

<P><BR>

NUNLEY: As religious communities work to retrieve the environmental
roots of their faith, at least one politician is engaging the
question as well. Tom Hayden, a California State Senator and
long-time environmental advocate, has written The Lost Gospel of the
Earth, published by Sierra Club Books. The book speaks to a mysticism
about nature, which Mr. Hayden believes is at the core of all
religions. He says we must reclaim a reverence for the Earth in order
to cope with what he calls the planetary crises of population
explosion and resource loss. Tom Hayden joined us recently to discuss
his book, and I asked him how this gospel of respect for the earth
was lost in the first place.</P>

<P>HAYDEN: In the original search in our western tradition for a
single god, there was also a search to unify the state or the kingdom
out of all the various tribal communities that worshipped many gods.
And so as a consequence of that, there came to be an emphasis on an
overarching god that was above the earth, that we said our prayers to
pointing upwards. And anyone that dissented was seen as what we know
today as a pagan and was persecuted for worshipping in sacred groves
and so on, and so it became an almost extreme division between grace
and nature. And as a senator in Sacramento, I chair the environmental
committee, the natural resources committee. And I have noticed over
the past decade that in all of our environmental debates there never
has been a clergy voice. They may come to testify on homelessness
issues, or abortion issues, or what have you. But for the most part,
the environment is considered outside the scope of expertise of
organized religion. Now that's changing, there is a national
partnership on religion and the environment and I would hope that
this book accelerates the change.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Now, one of the things that you mentioned was a need to
rethink various tenets of religions, and in western monotheism you
talk about rethinking the idea of a creator who's external to the
creation, the notion that humans are really the only beings who have
moral agency and the idea of an afterlife. Is it really those ideas
where the trouble lies, or is it with people who use those concepts
to justify their own self-interested decisions?</P>

<P>HAYDEN: I think you could make the argument either way. It depends
on your attachment to a tradition. If you're attached to a tradition,
I would say recover the lost part of it. But I think one can believe
in a single god, for example, or monotheism, and incorporate the
Earth as also sacred. I'm not choosing, I'm not choosing from the
menu of religious experience here. I think it's extremely important
that this notion of reverence for the Earth as sacred be revived in
whatever tradition we find ourselves.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: But there's a little bit of self-interest involved here,
too. If we don't take care of the Earth, the Earth won't take care of
us.</P>

<P>HAYDEN: Exactly. Although I don't know that the Golden Rule will
get us through. I think you have to have some sense of reverence. And
I know in a secular political realm, that's difficult to come by.
What I mean by that is -- is that if we believe that the environment
has a price tag, that it's subject to utilitarian ethics, it will
always be traded away in the clutch. But if we believe that the
environment has a sacred dimension that doesn't have a price tag to
it, that there is a certain value in a salmon and in the mind of a
salmon and in the heritage of a salmon that can't be calculated, and
that the loss of a salmon is the loss of our own imagination, the
diminishment of our own capacity to be creative, then I think the
environment would be treated altogether differently than it is now.
</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Now, let's talk about politics and some of the changes in
policymaking you'd like to see. You've said that the nature of the
state must be harmonized with the state of nature. Now what do you
mean by that?</P>

<P>HAYDEN: Well, it's out of whack. If you take the west, where I'm
from, you find that all the rivers have been dammed. It's costing
billions, perhaps trillions of dollars over time. It's all kind of an
engineered Leviathan state from Los Angeles to the Colorado River.
And the premise there is that not only are we entitled to mastery but
that we can achieve it. And this is the real problem with being a
little lord of the universe: this belief that there is a scientific,
technological fix for everything. In my view, the -- the nature of
the state now has to be made more harmonious with the state of
nature. What would that mean in a practical sense? In Los Angeles it
would mean, instead of building higher and higher walls for $500
million in the old Los Angeles River and calling it a drainage
project, which is what we're doing now with taxpayer dollars, which
will only shoot the cascades and floods of water faster towards Long
Beach, we ought to be recreating the Los Angeles River and building
our society and our economy alongside of it.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Do you have any churches that are involved in this issue?
Synagogues, anybody?</P>

<P>HAYDEN: Yes. The -- one of my observations in the Senate has been
that the clergy have been absent from the environment debate. So we
organized in Los Angeles and around the state a network called Clergy
for All Creation. And they've gotten involved in issues like the Los
Angeles River. They've testified in Sacramento that on the basis of
Genesis, on the basis of our western tradition, all of creation is
meant to be sacred, and therefore the Endangered Species Act has an
ethical and spiritual justification. That is a very powerful argument
when you add to it the economic, the ecological and the legal
arguments. I find that that's very -- that engages people.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Does it surprise some legislators to see people showing
up?</P>

<P>HAYDEN: It did. It did. One of my colleagues who previously
thought that he had the lock on Christian discussion found himself in
a very animated debate with these ministers and rabbis over the true
meaning of Genesis. And I don't know that it changed his mind
immediately. But it certainly engaged him in a way that's fruitful,
and he continues to think about it and talk about it. And I think
that's extremely healthy.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: My guest has been Tom Hayden, the author of The Lost
Gospel of the Earth:</P>

<P>A Call for Renewing Nature's Spirit in Politics. Thank you so much
for being here.</P>

<P>HAYDEN: Thank you.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. As a college
student in the 1970s, Michael Ray Taylor started crawling into dark
holes. It wasn't shyness that took him there. It was curiosity. In
the decades since, caving has been his passion. He has joined
expeditions in the caves of Mexico, Jamaica, China, and of course the
United States, as a writer and explorer. Mr. Taylor says that in the
Earth beneath our feet lies a vast wilderness, a hidden realm of
delicate beauty that deserves our understanding and protection. The
quote is from his new book called Cave Passages: Roaming the
Underground Wilderness. In sharing some of his caving experiences
with us, Michael Ray Taylor began by telling us that cave passages
come in all shapes and sizes.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: There are all kinds of passages. There are passages with
whitewater rivers rushing through them. There are enormous rooms that
would swallow baseball stadiums. There are tiny crawl ways that are
challenging and sinuous and interesting to pass through. It's so
different from what you experience on the surface. You know, mountain
climbers like to say they climb mountains because it's there. Cavers
go caving because they don't know what's there.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And for us non-cavers, I mean let's face it, going down
into a dark, dank hole in the ground, it could tumble down on top of
you, you know, cave in. There are a lot of tight spots. I mean one
reason these places are unexplored is that us humans don't feel very
comfortable down there.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Well, the strange thing about us humans, I think, is that
anything that frightens us becomes sooner or later irresistible. If,
you know, certainly throughout history caves have been where seers
and philosophers would go to reflect, to escape the world that was
known and come back changed. And there's some of that primal draw in
the cave, the same thing that brought the Neanderthals into the caves
in France is certainly acting on me when I go into a dark, scary
place. But then of course with experience, the other thing is you
find out that caves may be dark, but in fact with the proper training
and equipment they're really not so very scary. The danger of a
cave-in, for instance, that's something you worry about in mines,
which are manmade structures, and caves have been stabilized over
thousands of years by the natural forces that shape them. And in
fact, if I could pick one place to be in the midst of a strong
earthquake, I think I'd pick a cave.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, you go ahead and try that. (Laughs) I'm not sure
I'm ready for that. Who else lives down there, aside from visiting
humans?</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Aside from visiting humans, there are bats, there are
in-cave lakes and streams, all sorts of fish, sometimes there are
surface fish that get washed in and manage to survive in the caves.
Other times they are blind whitefish that have evolved and live in
the cave all the time. There are various small insects, such as
crickets and centipedes. And really not much else. Now, there's a
whole new class of life that we're just finding out about down in the
caves, some very rare microbes that a few scientists have been
studying, that apparently live in cave walls and survive off of the
nutrients in the rock itself. They've excited some people at NASA who
are looking for similar microbes on the planet Mars.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So NASA is excited about these. Is there anything special
for those of us on Earth?</P>

<P>TAYLOR: There's one particular cave, which I describe in Cave
Passages, called Litchegia. It's in New Mexico. It's near Carlsbad
Caverns National Park. And it is a sort of a proving ground for
scientists studying these microbes. It had been sealed for many
centuries. And so, the microbes, which have been discovered in this
cave, have been living there without any connection to the surface
for a very long time, and one of the guys who was studying them
because of the Mars implications has got a major grant to study them
as cancer treatment. There is a certain enzyme they secrete which
seems to do better against cancer cells than any other known natural
substance.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Hmm. My guest is Michael Ray Taylor. His new book is
called Cave Passages: Roaming the Underground Wilderness. And we've
been talking about this cave in New Mexico. And what does Litchegia
mean?</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Well, it's the name of a plant that grows near the
entrance to the cave. It's kind of a spiky member of the aloe family,
I believe. And it pokes everyone on their way hiking to the entrance,
and so you can't help but notice it, and hence cavers who discovered
the cave decided to give it that name.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, this is a pretty amazing cave for some of the things
that you can see inside of it.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Right. It's unusual geologically. Scientists believe that
this cave was formed not by water flowing in from the surface, as
most caves and limestone are formed, but by water that percolated up
from below, through mineral hot springs, and the sulfur that these
springs carried helped to carve out the passages in the limestone so
that Litchegia Cave, which so far there's 89 miles of passage cavers
have found from the single entrance --</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Eighty-nine miles?</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Eighty-nine miles and still growing every time anyone goes
in there to map. And all of it bristles with very gorgeous and
stunning formations, things like gypsum chandeliers that hang down
from the ceiling and, you know, rooms that are pure white like
Superman's house in the movies. And then you also have very delicate
latticeworks of aragonite and other types of crystals. And also many
formations which have been seen just nowhere else on Earth.
Formations for instance called sub-aquaceous halactites, which look
like strange fingers or strands of spaghetti that reach across pools.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now what happens when people go in there? These
formations are pretty delicate; don't people pose a problem?</P>

<P>TAYLOR: They're extremely delicate, and actually, you know, it's
always a big philosophical question when you're a caver and you
discover a place where no human footstep has been, you know you're
going to change that room forever when you step across it. And the
question is, how do you protect it and its pristine state? Some of
the things Litchegia cavers have done is whenever they discover a new
room, they will carefully lay a path with plastic survey tape. And
everyone who walks through the room stays in the same place so that
after a few crossings that path is very well worn. Yet 2 feet off of
the path the floor looks exactly as it has for centuries. And beyond
that, one of the things cavers have done in Litchegia is simply limit
the amount of exposure the cave has. Right now, after 10 years of
exploration, the cave is in the midst of a 1-year shutdown to just
give it a little rest from the hundreds of eager explorers who have
been finding those 89 miles of passage over the last decade. And a
couple of science teams are going in to try to determine just how
much impact do we cavers have on such a pristine and wonderful place.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: In the back of your book there's a picture of you wearing
a helmet with a light on it and you've got on gloves and glasses. And
your body is, like, squished between these 2 rocks.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Right.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Seems to me that a lot of caves must have some difficult
spots. And I'm wondering if you could tell us of a story of a place
where you faced a tight challenge, maybe even tighter than that
chimney, and pushed the limits of your nerves.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Well, Steve, I'll bet you're talking about the Devil's
Pinch, which I describe in the book as the tightest single cave
passage I've ever been in. It's in West Virginia and it connects to
otherwise unconnected and once thought of as separate caves called
Bone and Norman. And the Devil's Pinch is nasty, because not only is
it tight but it has a thin knife ridge of hard rock running down the
center of it.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh boy.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: So it's just barely tall enough or a person to crawl
through and you've got this blade of knife digging at your chest
trying to cut it open as you move through. And I went into that cave
a few years back with a group of friends. We went through the cave
from one direction to another and decided to call our trip a little
bit early, and rather than going out the other entrance, which was
still some distance away, we came back through Devil's Pinch. And I
somehow got myself stuck coming back.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Couldn't go forward, couldn't go back.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Couldn't go forward, couldn't go back. I knew that I'd
been through it, I knew I could go through it again. So what I did
was just try to relax and exhale, and when I exhaled I could scoot
forward an inch or two. And then I'd inhale and I'd feel the roof and
the floor compressing my chest. And, you know, I started thinking
well what if I squeezed myself in to where I can't inhale at all? And
so I backed out and took off my coveralls, which gave me just a
little bit more clearance. And so in my underwear I lay down in this
passage, I threw my coveralls and my pack ahead to the guy who'd been
through the passage ahead of me, and exhaled completely, slid
forward, and sure enough I was stuck again. Couldn't inhale, but I
knew I was nearly past the really nasty part, and so my friend Lee
grabbed my arm and yanked me, and with 2 inches I could breathe
again, and then I scooted forward and a little bruised and scraped
but none the worse for wear. I was out of the pinch. But it's all
part of caving. If you want to see the truly wild places, then you
just have to work yourself through those tight spots one way or
another.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: My guest has been Michael Ray Taylor. His book is called
Cave Passages: Roaming the Underground Wilderness. And he teaches at
Henderson State University in Arkansas. Thank you, Sir.</P>

(Whale songs)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: These are songs of Beluga whales recorded on Canada's St.
Lawrence River.</P>

<P>(Whale songs continue)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: As whales go, your average Beluga is small, even though
it weighs in at about a ton and is 15 feet long. Beluga's have
several easily identifiable traits: they're white, they have a large
bulb on the top of their heads. They're very inquisitive. And they
have a wonderful smile. A hundred years ago there were between 5,000
and 10,000 Beluga whales living in what's now called the St. Lawrence
Seaway. Today only about 500 survive. We know a lot about Beluga's
largely because of the work of Pierre Beland. A senior research
scientist at the St. Lawrence National Institution of Ecotoxicology,
Mr. Beland has been studying the mammals for more than 15 years. In
his new book Beluga: A Farewell to Whales, Mr. Beland explains that
the Canadian government had a direct hand in the decline of the
Beluga population. Earlier in this century, the fishing industry
blamed whales for declines in fish stocks, and so, he says, the
government actually declared war on the Belugas.</P>

<P>BELAND: Well it was, it was a war, because the first thing the
government did was to give a bounty to anybody who would bring back
the flukes of a Beluga whale, he would get $15. But that was not
enough, and then someone had a very good idea, to convince the
government that the way to go about killing Belugas was to bomb them
from the air.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Bomb Belugas from the air?</P>

<P>BELAND: Bomb the whales from the air. And so this person convinced
the government to give him money so he could fly with airplanes, and
they would manufacture their own bombs. It was really amazing. They
would have canisters, they would load dynamite in the canisters, and
put a fuse, a kind of mesh that would extend that and light that in
the last minute and drop it o a pod of Belugas.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Ohhh. And so how many Belugas survived all of this?</P>

<P>BELAND: It's hard to tell how many were killed. During the year of
the bounties, they paid bounties and the, for the equivalent of about
25,000 whales. Obviously they were not all killed at the same time.
They were killed over a number of years at the rate of sometimes up
to 700 a year. But the total number of whales that you could find in
the river in a year was estimated to be, at the turn of the century,
5,000 to 10,000. And it's from that stock of whales that bounties
were collected. But it turned out that by 1980 or so, when we started
working on the Beluga whales, we could only estimate that there were
500 animals left. So something happened in between. Obviously the
bounty and the bombing and all that reduced the population. But
something else must have happened also after the second World War.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Let's talk about what has happened to the whales after
the second World War. They've been the subject of a lot of research
involving industrial chemicals and pollution. Correct?</P>

<P>BELAND: Exactly. And that stems from exactly this first
observation we made back in 1982. Daniel Marcineau and I, when we
were called to that first carcass of a Beluga by the shore of the St.
Lawrence, we collected tissues from the animal at the time. We sent
those to the lab, and the results came back showing that the animal
was loaded with chemicals. Pesticides like DDT, for example, and
industrial chemicals like PCBs. Very high levels. Now, these
chemicals did not exist in the 1920s. These chemicals were introduced
in the late 30s, and DDT, for example, was introduced into Canada and
the St. Lawrence in 1948. So the accumulation of what we were finding
in 1982 must have started after the second World War. And those
chemicals are known for their effects on health and their effects on
reproduction. So our hypothesis was that those chemicals were
responsible for the second wave of drastic reduction in the Beluga
population in the St. Lawrence.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, how does the health of the Belugas in the St.
Lawrence compare to Belugas elsewhere in the world?</P>

<P>BELAND: If you look at cancer, the Beluga whale of the St.
Lawrence has the highest rate of cancer of any animal that lives on
this planet, even higher a rate of cancer than in humans.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Wow, what's that rate?</P>

<P>BELAND: One third of the dead Belugas that we have autopsied have
a tumor, and the majority of those tumors are cancer. And if you look
at all the whales autopsied by various researchers around the world,
from all the oceans, from all countries, about one half of all the
cancers identified come from those 85 Belugas we've looked at. So out
of hundreds and hundreds of whales, half of the cancers come from the
Belugas. So it's a very, very striking result.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I'm wondering, what's being done to clean up the St.
Lawrence?</P>

<P>BELAND: Many efforts have been started some years ago. You have to
understand that the St. Lawrence is the exit for the Great Lakes, and
most of the chemicals that we found in our whales came from the Great
Lakes. In 1972 Canada and the US signed an agreement, the Great Lakes
Water Quality Agreement. This was a major effort at cleaning up the
Great Lakes, getting rid of toxic chemicals, and this has improved
the whole basin. First the Great Lakes and then the St. Lawrence. And
later on there was another equivalent program started up for the St.
Lawrence itself. And presently the levels of chemicals, like PCBs,
DDT and other toxic chemicals in the fish, in the birds and all the
biota in the lakes, and in the river, has decreased compared to what
it was in the 60s. And we -- the only thing we can hope is that the
same decrease will occur in Beluga whales in time.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Do you think it will come soon enough? Your book is
called Beluga: A Farewell to Whales. It seems that you don't think
they'll be around.</P>

<P>BELAND: The meaning of that title is, there are several meanings
to it. One of them is that I think Belugas in the St. Lawrence will
survive me. I will die before the last one disappears unless, you
know, something really drastic occurs. But I'm thinking of this
problem in terms of wildlife in general, of large animals trying to
exist as wildlife on this planet. While the human population is
increasing, while our main preoccupation is about ourselves, is about
finding jobs, is about developing resources, is about cutting down
forests, exploiting mines, without really thinking about what will
happen to all this wildlife. So in that sense I think if we do not
change our way of doing things on the long term, large animals on
this planet do not have much of a future.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Pierre Beland is a senior research scientist at the St.
Lawrence National Institution of Ecotoxicology in Montreal. His book
is called Beluga: A Farewell to Whales.</P>

<H2>The Eden Alternative</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No
portion of this transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted
without the written authority of World Media Foundation.</FONT></P>

<P>CURWOOD: For most of us, the mere thought of a nursing home draws
a shiver. Many doctors hate working in them. They're trained to cure
diseases and if one thinks of old age as a disease then treating it
is a frustrating losing battle. Most of the more than 2 million
residents of America's nursing homes hate them, too. They're stuck in
sterile places with little stimulation, and where the only living
creatures are medical staff and other elderly people in poor health.
To cut down on restlessness and complaints, many residents are
drugged.</P>

<P>But it doesn't have to be that way. Outside of nursing homes in
the natural world, humans are surrounded by all kinds of life:
plants, birds, mammals and people of different ages. So why not,
thought Dr. William Thomas a few years ago, create an inviting human
habitat for our ailing seniors? Dr. Thomas ran the Chase Memorial
Nursing Home in New Berlin, New York. In 1991 he started bringing
birds, dogs, and cats, plants and even children into his workplace.
Many of the staff quit. But those who have stayed have witnessed an
amazing turnaround.</P>

<P>Dr. Thomas called his approach the Eden Alternative, and he's
written about it in his new book <I>A Life Worth Living: How Someone
You Love Can Still Enjoy Life in a Nursing Home</I>. He says his
dream is to change every nursing home in America from a place that
merely treats patients into a haven for elderly human beings.</P>

<P>THOMAS: Really, there's 3 plagues, I call them, that rage in every
nursing home. And they're the plagues of loneliness, helplessness,
and boredom. And it's kind of interesting from a doctor's point of
view, there just is no medical treatment for loneliness,
helplessness, and boredom. Those problems can only be addressed in an
environmental or an ecological way. I can only treat loneliness by
providing companionship. When I first started out I looked at the
possibility of hiring a person to be a companion for every nursing
home resident.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Hmm.</P>

<P>THOMAS: And I -- well, I did a budget up. It was going to cost $7
million a year.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Ho, ho, I guess so.</P>

<P>THOMAS: And that just wasn't feasible. The next step was, we just
stopped and said you know, people get all kinds of terrific
companionship from animals. So that's where the idea of creating a
human habitat inside the nursing home started to take shape.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Human habitat. What do you mean?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Well, I came to realize that if I took a polar bear and
dropped him off in the Amazon jungle, he would die. If I took a song
bird from the Amazon jungle and dropped him off at the North Pole,
could never survive. When I think about taking a sick, old, frail
person and putting them in a nursing home, I'm putting that person
into an environment or a habitat that's not good for them. So the
answer is not prescribing more drugs or giving more treatments or
doing more surgery. The answer is in re-inventing the nursing home
and making it into a habitat that nourishes and supports the people
who live there and work there.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What does it look like when you come into a patient's
room where you have the Eden Alternative?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Well, I think you can go through it by the senses. The
sight is of a rich array of green growing plants placed around the
room, and they make a very dramatic presence there. The smell can
often come from flowers or herbs that are part of that green plant
life in the room. The sound often will come from the parakeets, often
up to 4 parakeets living in a single room chirping and reacting to
each other and to the people who live there. The sound might also
include the sound of kids tumbling into the room for a visit.
Edenizing nursing homes really focus on having on-site child care,
after-school programs, summer camps for kids. Anything you can do to
have kids there in the nursing home regularly.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So you're saying the present model for a nursing home is
really like a desert, an emotional and a spiritual desert?</P>

<P>THOMAS: [Sighs] It makes a desert, it makes a desert look great.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: [Laughs] Really.</P>

<P>THOMAS: [Laughs] Oh yes. I mean, if you were to go into a nursing
home and do sort of an ecological survey, it would be an ecological
disaster area. You've got one species running rampant, homo sapiens.
And maybe you've got a dead chrysanthemum over in the corner and
that's it. It's the most unnatural environment we could almost
possibly create. And that's what's the irony in this. You're creating
a universe. For the people who live there, that nursing home is their
entire world. And to choose to create an entire world for someone
that is as sterile, stark, medically oriented, unnatural -- it's a
tragedy.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: The prescription for loneliness, helplessness, and
boredom --</P>

<P>THOMAS: Yes.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: -- is your approach. And you found that by incorporating
animals and kids and plants into nursing homes, you solve these
problems?</P>

<P>THOMAS: That's right.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What happens?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Well, we get people to connect with the living things
around them and participate in the care of those living things. So
people become not just recipients of care, but caregivers as well.
That's one of the problems that conventional nursing homes is so
terrible, is you're saying to people, "You're not connected any more.
You don't belong any more. You're going to be here and we're going to
treat your diseases and we're going to do everything for you." That's
terribly, terribly unnatural and very damaging to the spirits of the
people who live there.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Can you give me an example of how this helps an
individual?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Well, I mean, I'm going to tell you a story about a
parakeet that saved a woman's life. You know, we got started with the
Eden Alternative, and there was a woman who I was taking care of at
the time who'd had a stroke and wasn't able to speak. And she was
kind of withdrawn and not doing well from a number of</P>

<P>perspectives medically. But she agreed to take on the care of a
small parakeet in her room. And she really started to enjoy that and
it became a really important part of her daily work. Her daily life
became to include the well-being of this parakeet. Well one day, I
was making rounds and I was called down to see her; she was not
feeling well, had a high fever, terrible pain in her abdomen. We sent
her out to the hospital. She was evaluated by the surgeon and taken
to the operating room and had really a major operation. When she came
back to the hospital floor she got very agitated and was trying to
communicate something to the nurses and they couldn't figure out what
it was. Finally a family member came in to see her and could sort of
figure out, it's her bird, it's her bird. She wants to know who's
taking care of her bird. And we had a flurry of phone calls between
the hospital and the nursing home where we began to, we reassured her
oh yes, we'll make sure that your Tweety is taken care of. And
absolutely, she'll be safe, we'll watch over him for you while you're
gone. And she settled right down. She recovered really very quickly
from the operation and came back to the nursing home, and immediately
her very number one concern was checking in on Tweety and making sure
that he was okay and he had been properly cared for in her absence. I
think that bird saved that person's life because her love for that
animal gave her a reason to fight through a terrible illness and come
back and recover and be stronger than she ever was. I could never
have given her a drug that would have caused that reaction; it had to
come from her heart.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, you've been talking about these wonderful beneficial
effects of the Eden Alternative. Can you quantify some results?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Yeah. You know, we did a research project where we looked
at a couple of factors that I think are really important.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay.</P>

<P>THOMAS: We looked first at use of drugs in the nursing home, or
medication use. And we compared ourselves to a control nursing home
that was same size and matched to us statistically speaking. Over the
Eden Alternative period the controlled nursing home drug costs
continued to rise like they are in nursing homes all across America.
In the Eden home the utilization of drugs dropped sharply. By the end
of the study the nursing home that did the initial Eden project was
saving $75,000 a year on drug costs, and I'll tell you that's a lot
of bird seed.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And that's out of how big a budget? [Laughs] That is a
lot of bird seed.</P>

<P>THOMAS: Yes. The drug costs had been cut in half. The second thing
we looked at was the infection rate. Our hypothesis or idea was that
people who have a reason to live are going to be more resistant to
infection. And again we compared ourselves to a control, and we found
that the infection rate dropped 50%.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Medications in half and infections in half?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Yes, that's true. And as a physician let me tell you,
there's no way -- even if I went to that nursing home every single
day and saw every patient every day, I could not get that kind of
preventive impact with regular medical treatment. It came from the
human habitat. And the last thing, and I think probably the most
important, is that we looked at the death rate. In the first year of
the Eden Alternative the death rate dropped 15% and in the second
year of the Eden Alternative it dropped 25% compared to control. You
have to imagine sort of walking through this nursing home and
realizing that given the size of the nursing home, at the end of that
year there were 8 people alive who would have been dead in a
conventional nursing home. And if I had been tinkering in my basement
and had come up with a drug that could do that, it would be
unbelievable. It would be front page news in the New York Times. But
it's not a drug. It's a taste of the natural world brought back to
the lives of people who really need this.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now you've gotten this started in upstate New York. Is
the idea spreading?</P>

<P>THOMAS: Our latest count is that there are over 100 homes around
the country that are in the act of Edenizing process.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: A hundred homes.</P>

<P>THOMAS: And one of the exciting things is, nearly every day now we
get word from another home that is starting up on the process and
wants more information from us or wants some advice. And it is
absolutely delightful.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Thank you so much for joining us.</P>

<P>THOMAS: You're welcome.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: My guest has been Dr. Bill Thomas, author of Life Worth
Living: How Someone You Love Can Still Enjoy Life in a Nursing Home.
Thanks for taking the time with us.</P>

<P>THOMAS: You betcha.</P>

<P>
CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  In the far north of Canada, north of Hudson's Bay, lies Baffin Island.  The area is home to hundreds of Inuit, but it was largely untouched by modern society until shortly after World War II, when a young artist, Jim Houston, became so intrigued with the area that he hitched his way into the back country on a Medivac plane and decided to stay.  His story of life in Canada's north country from 1948 to 1962 is told in his new book Confessions of an Igloo Dweller.  He recounts how he began the worldwide trade in Inuit art by collecting their carvings and helping them form an artists' cooperative, which continues to thrive under local control.  He also became a government administrator for the region.  Jim Houston started his journey into the northern wildlands after he got out of the Canadian army, by packing up his sketch pads and sleeping duffel, and taking a train to the end of the line at the southern tip of James Bay.  It was a tiny town called Moose Factory.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  There were no roads, no nothing out there.  So I stayed and made drawings of Swampy Creek for about 3 weeks and stayed around with them and so on.  And I came to know a bush pilot and a doctor, and so they -- one day the bush pilot came into my room quickly and he said, "Say, how'd you like to fly up north?"  I said, "You bet."  I didn't quite know what he meant or how far.  He said, "I've got to take the doctor in on a medical emergency right now; it's never happened, we're going to a strange place.  And if you promise that you'll help woggle the gas and, you know, push the aircraft into the shore when we need to --
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Woggle the gas?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  And jump in the water --
<BR>

<BR>
 CURWOOD: Woggle the gas?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Woggle the gas.  Yeah, we used to put a pump down there and push, make it go back and forth like a cistern pump, and it would pump the gas up out of the barrel and into the airplane.  So he said if I'd promise to do that I could go free.  That was the principal word.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Free.  Now how far north did you go?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Well, I was already a thousand miles or more north of anywhere, and I went another thousand miles north.  I was in wonderful Inuit country.  So I was surrounded by laughing, short, brown people; after a summer their skin was like mahogany and they were dressed in skin clothing.  I thought my goodness, this is my own country and look at these people; I had no idea they existed, I didn't know anything about them.  By the way, I didn't tell you that a mother had been sitting in a tent, and she heard the dogs in the front of the tent grabbing meat.  And so the mother went out to drive the dogs out of the tent and she had to bend over and the dogs grabbed the baby out of the hood and started to eat it.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Oh!
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  And the mother wrestled the dogs away, getting bitten badly and she got hold of it.  And that was the reason for our going.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Oh -- such a dreadful story!
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Sure it is.  It's all right; the little girl in the hood is a grandmother.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: So you went there to rescue her with the doctor.  And you stayed behind.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Yes, because I had a sketch book.  I started drawing madly, because that was the purpose.  He said he was going to stay 4 days, but he got a hold of the baby and the mother behind him and he said, "We're leaving right this minute; I don't know how this baby's alive."  So they jumped in the plane and I said, "Well, I'm not going.  I'm staying.  I'll never get into a place like this again in my life," which I'm sure was right.  He said, "What will your mother say?  When she hears that I've left you up here?"  I said, "She won't mind; I've been away in the war for 5 years.  She's used to it."  Well, it turned out my mother wasn't used to it and she gave him hell for leaving me up there.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: But of course you got back and thrived --
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Yes --
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD:  And how did you get involved with collecting the carvings of these people?  This is what you're so famous for.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Well, on the very first day, I think that's honest to say, or the second day if it was not the very first -- this is 49 years ago -- I made a drawing of a man, and I made a drawing his sister.  It took me years to know that it was his sister; I didn't know a single word of Inuititut.  I knew "kayak" and "igloo," those are the only 2 words I knew like everyone else down here.  So I made the drawing of him and of his sister, and he went away to his tent and he returned and he opened his hand.  Well, first of all he held out his clenched fist, and I thought he was going to probably punch me in the nose, but they're not that kind of people at all.  So he opened his hand and he had a small caribou, I think -- it could have been a bear, but I think it was a small stone caribou.  So he gave it to me.  I thought my goodness, this is a museum piece.  This is something that he's giving me that his great grandfather carved or some early person.  I was so excited; I got 2 more that were like it.  And on the following day, after I had 3 of them, I hurried so to the Hudson's Bay post, which was some distance to the south.  When we got there, I went into the Hudson's Bay Post Manager, whose name was Norman Ross, a Scot from the north of Scotland, and I opened my hand as the Eskimo had and I said, "Look at that."  He looked at it and I said, "How old do you think that is?"  He said, "I think it was probably carved last night or this morning."  I said, "You're kidding; I mean you can't mean that."  I thought wow, you mean these people are able, this man is able to do that right now.  This isn't something from the past.  This is right now.  So that excited me enormously, much more than if they'd been old pieces.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: I'm looking in fact at your book, and some sketches that you've made of some of these carvings.  They're exquisite, absolutely exquisite.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Thank you.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: And I'm wondering, do the carvers think of their work as art?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  No they don't.  They don't have a word for art. 
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Really.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Shnoonwak.  Shnoonwak is the closest they come, which means something you do with your hands, which would cover a harpoon head or a little toggle for a kayak or anything.  It's hard to stretch it to mean art; you cannot do it.  Of course, Inuit are butchers, like anatomists.  They take a seal or walrus, a bear.  They cut it up and so they understand it.  They understand the sheaths of muscle and the bone and the - how the bear rolls when he runs, the big weight of walrus and the flight of birds.  They have examined those.  Those are life's blood to them.  So they are able to portray those things in ways we can't.  We make awkward conceptions of animals because we don't know the animals any more.  We've given up on the animals.  These people are part of it.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: You've come to believe that the Inuit understanding of art is living in harmony with nature.  What do you mean by that?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Well, I -- there's many ways that I might explain that.  If you shoot a tarmagan, you draw the tail feathers out of the tarmagan and you plant it in the snow, so another tarmagan will grow.  Because you took -- the tarmagan gave you his flesh.  The tarmagan did not give you his inua -- his soul -- he kept his soul, and he was able to carry on with that, either in a visible form, the same form, he may have changed it or she may have changed it.  But that being, that soul, continues.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Over and over in this book, you have these stories that -- have you just completely amazed at how your Inuit friends could read the land.  Could you tell us about that?  I mean, how did these hunters know where they were going?  You can't use a compass this close to the North Pole, can you?  I'm sure they didn't have them.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  They didn't have them, and if you have one you're very best off to stick it in the bottom of your kit or throw it away, because you'll only confuse the whole picture and perhaps kill yourself by having these things.  Most would agree with that.  But quite apart from that, these are nomadic people.  They do not -- excuse me, I should call them semi-nomadic people.  They don't go off into just nowhere without knowing where they're going.  That's piu sionituk -- they say that's not the custom.  You can't do that, it's too dangerous.  They follow the routes of their grandfathers and their great grandfathers.  And when the grandfathers made those routes, they tell their sons and others in the camp exactly the marks that they should follow, and it's just as clear as going along Fifth Avenue and saying 52nd Street and such and such.  It may be clearer, actually, to me.  We went out in a helicopter once, and we were left off in the middle of a huge, the Fox Peninsula.  And he said to me, if you wanted to get home now -- this was an Inuit, and the 2 of us, unlike dog team traveling we were just standing there on the land, having been left for a little while at our request.  He said if you wanted to get home again -- it was gray and overcast, no sun, nothing to help, how would you go?  I said, "Gosh, I don't know."  I really didn't know.  He said, "Well let's walk around and look for a minute, a little while."  So we walked around a while; he said, "I know how to get home.  I can get home right now.  I know how."  I said, "How?"  Everything looked bleak and a little tundra and some rocks and so on.  And he said, "Well see that rock over there?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Well, what do you see about it?"  I said, "Well, it's a black rock, it's good sized like a barrel.  But there's a great white patch on it."  "What made it white?" he said.  I said, "I don't know."  He said, "Dog teams have been urinating against that rock for 100 years or something, and they've worn all the lichen off.  So many dog teams, many men have passed this way, hunters have passed this way.  Now all we have to do is go to the next rock with the urine and we've set up our whole sight line to go back to that particular camp."
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: I'm wondering, you spent all this time with these people and their sense of belief in the land and in their connection to the animals.  Did you acquire some of that belief?  Did you get those connections to the animals?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  I think so.  I hope so.  I don't own a dog or a cat, and I used to have 42 sheep but I don't have them any more.  Because I think things should have a wildness.  I think things should have the right to have a wildness about them.  I'm not sure that animal husbandry appeals to me, any more than it appeals to Inuit.  I think that you should have, try to have a kind of connection with free, wild, free animals if you can, and I've had the luck to do that, and I think it works out wonderfully.  I've never said that to anybody before in my life.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Well thank you for telling us about that.  And what I'd like to do now is to move from spiritual matters to commerce.  Your work after you got up to the Arctic was to really collect these carvings, this art, and bring it to the outside world, help create a market for the Inuit for this.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Right.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: And at first you'd offer them goods in exchange for their work.  And later you offered them money.  But what do you think money did to the Inuit?  You brought them plenty of money.
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Right.  Well, one could be concerned.  There are 2 ways to think of it.  I mean, one is to think of them in a primordial way, the gorgeous way that they had lived and died before and had been so connected with the land.  But on the other hand they're not museum pieces, and they don't want to be museum pieces.  I mean, look how quickly we turned in the horse and cart for an automobile, the minute we saw it; we couldn't wait to have an automobile.  The minute Inuit started to see a snowmobile, they couldn't wait to get rid of the dog teams and get the snowmobile.  And suddenly, when that changed, money started to come into the picture.  An unknown thing to them.  And it was just, it just happened at the right minute by a piece of luck, because all of a sudden they had the snowmobile and they needed to buy a gallon of gasoline, which can cost as much as $4.25 a gallon even at that time, because it usually had to be flown in or dog teamed in and all kinds of things.  So money almost magically seemed to replace the need of gathering meat.  Walrus that we fed the dogs at all times, the walrus were almost running out.  The whalers had been at them, everybody had been at the walrus to use as dog food and human food.  And they were becoming very short.  Now I go into the Arctic 40 years later and there's a heck of a lot of walrus; they're burgeoning.  Because the Inuit aren't after them any more.  They're after a gallon of gas.
<BR>

<BR>
 CURWOOD: You entitle your book Confessions of an Igloo Dweller.  Why is it confessions?  Do you feel guilty about something?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Perhaps a little.  I mean, it's -- some people like to say I had more to do with the Arctic changing than anyone else.  That's widely said in Canada.  And I can't totally disagree with that, although maybe I would wish to.  But I don't -- I'm a mixture of being extraordinarily proud and somewhat nervous about -- after all, I helped to develop an art and get it going 49 years ago, and it's working more, much more strongly now than when I got that started and lived with it for the 14-year period.  You know, non-objective art hasn't lasted that long.  Lots of art forms have not.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: And what would you change, then, if -- if you could, about your --
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  What would I change now?
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD:  Yeah.  What might you have done different, so that you wouldn't feel you had to write your confessions?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  People are -- the Arctic has changed.  Was that inevitable?  It changed in Alaska, it changed in Greenland, and I had nothing to do with those changes.  But the juggernaut of civilization was moving towards them, and the minute World War II ended, change was I think inevitable.  I just pushed it a little further and my job was to be interested in them in every conceivable way that I could be interested in them, and to help them if I could.  I thought of myself as a civil servant, and I tried to act in that way.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD:  Well thank you.  Jim Houston's book is called Confessions of an Igloo Dweller: Memoirs of the Old Arctic.  And thank you --
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Thank you very much.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: And how do you say goodbye in Inuit?
<BR>

<BR>
HOUSTON:  Tgbowsiel alunasee.  You know, that's for your whole audience.  For you, Tbowdik acshuala.  Farewell for now.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Farewell for now.

<H2>Steve talks with Rolf Peterson</H2>

<P>
CURWOOD: America's Isle Royale National Park is a forested gem set far north in Lake Superior, just 20 miles from the Canadian shore.  At the turn of the century, moose arrived on Isle Royale, probably by swimming from the mainland.  They had no natural predators until about 50 years later, when a single pair of gray wolves apparently walked to the island across an ice bridge.  And so began a simple arrangement.  It's a perfect place to study nature's balancing act.  Dr. Rolf Peterson is a wildlife biologist and accomplished photographer who studied wolf-moose dynamics on Isle Royale for 25 years.  He's trying to find out just how many moose and wolves the island can sustain.  He's captured the wonder of the place in a new book from Willow Creek Press.  It's called The Wolves of Isle Royale: A Broken Balance.  Dr. Peterson, on the cover of your book, there's a picture of a wolf howling at the moon.  Is that a photograph you took?
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: It's a painting, but of a real wolf.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: The wolf's name was?
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: Well, we called him Murphy, just because he got, everything seemed to go wrong for this wolf, and he ended up the last 4 years of his life living as a lone wolf who didn't do real well, but he got by.  But never succeeded in breeding, and got chased -- he could kill moose by himself but he usually got chased off these kills by territorial packs.  So he suffered a rather obscure end and died of starvation.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: And what did he sound like?  I see he's got his head tossed back, you know his throat is open.
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: Well, I'm not sure this particular wolf ever howled, because lone wolves typically try and remain as hidden as possible.  Just getting by, basically.  But the normal wolf howl is a pretty deep, throaty sound with a lot of variability.  And they can communicate pretty complex messages.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Think back to a situation where you heard a wolf howling, and give me that howl, and tell me the context of it after we hear it.
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: Let's see if I can imitate it first.  (Howls)  That's a pretty pathetic howl, but it's one that we actually observed.  A male and female dominant, alpha individuals in a pack, and the mother and father in other words of most of the other wolves in the pack.  And it was summer time, and they came home to where their pups were parked in the woods, near a den site, and found everybody gone.  And so they sat down and immediately the male started out howling, and then the female came in at a higher pitch, and they howled for 2, 3 minutes.  And then we could just barely pick out with our own ears a response several miles away, where the pups had been moved by some babysitters.  So the wolves had their information and they up and left, and we never saw them again at that site.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Now the balance of wolves and moose on this island is constantly changing.  Can you tell me a bit about the various booms and busts that we've seen over the decades?
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: Of course the first major one was moose, when there were no wolves present.  There was a big food crash in the 30s.  And then once wolves were in place in the 1950s the amplitude of changes in moose numbers hasn't been smoothed out by wolf predation.  And in a very real sense the wolves protect the food base of moose and help perpetuate it, because moose have the capacity to destroy their own food base.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: We need to talk about the basic ecology here.  If wolves eat the moose, the moose eat --
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: They eat trees and shrubs and aquatic plants in summer time.  But it's the winter browse, the plants that they eat in winter, that is most limiting.  And in recent years there have been so many moose that very little of that forage is available even by midwinter.  So a lot of malnutrition has set in, and of course this winter was a winter to set records in terms weather and snow depth, and a lot of moose simply didn't make it.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: So it was a pretty good winter, actually, if you were a wolf.
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: Oh certainly, yeah.  A banner year for the wolves.  They didn't have to work as hard because they often found moose that had starved to death, or many moose simply fell off cliffs while they were looking for something to eat.  Literally, food was falling out of the skies.  For the first year in almost a decade, all 3 packs had at least 1 pup survive until winter.  Their numbers have been low for most of the last 15 years, and there's a sub-quest, we might say, we've been searching for the reason for their problems.  Because they really have been on the edge of extinction.  They reached the world's highest density of wolves in the wild in 1980 with 50 wolves present on this relatively small island, and 2 years later there was simply, there were just 14 left. 
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Wow.
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: So over 4 dozen wolves had died in that 2-year period.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: What caused that, do you think?
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: Well initially we attributed it to the shortage of food, because they had pretty much cleaned out of the moose population the animals that were vulnerable to predation.  But now we look back and realize there were some disease events coming through the Midwestern states, and Isle Royale specifically.  Canine piro-virus probably led to that big crash in 1980 to '82.  This is an exotic virus, a new mutant virus that people probably brought to the island inadvertently.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: But things have turned around recently.
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: In 1996 there are 22 wolves present, so they're up out of the real danger zone.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: So do you think this means that the system is now righting itself, that the wolves will survive?
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: They have a good chance at survival.  I'm not sure I would call them completely recovered because they do have a genetic heritage now that could certainly put them at risk if theory is right.  It looks like all the wolves have descended from a single female, probably a founder of the population in the 1940s, and they're all essentially related like brothers and sisters and they've lost significant genetic variability.  And we'll see if they can get around the theoretical risks of genetic decay that we seem to be preoccupied with in endangered species management
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Rolf Peterson is a wildlife ecologist at the Michigan Technological University.  His new book is called The Wolves of Isle Royale: A Broken Balance.  Thank you, sir.
<BR>

<BR>
PETERSON: You bet.  Thank you.

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living On Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. It is hard to
imagine life thriving on the world's coldest continent. Antarctica is
covered with ice and holds the world record for the lowest
temperature ever recorded: 129 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.</P>

<P>But untouched by humans for millions of years, parts of Antarctica
are home to a fragile ecosystem. And in the past few years, it's
become one of the world's most important outposts to study the
far-reaching effects of human civilization. And the ozone hole,
climate change--even tourism--are all taking a toll on Antarctica's
web of life.</P>

<P>This week we begin a four-part series of special reports by Living
on Earth's Terry FitzPatrick, who visited Antarctica early this year.
</P>

<P>(Walking on snow, ice axes probe snow)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Traveling to the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf is like
traveling to the ends of the earth. This is the southernmost stretch
of ocean in the world, so close to the frigid South Pole that much of
the sea is draped by a floating blanket of ice.</P>

<P>(ice probe)</P>

<P>ROBINSON: As far as the ice edge, don't go too close because the
water comes and it wears it out underneath so it's like a ledge and
it looks solid but it's only a couple inches thick.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Navy pilot Greg Robinson probes for weak spots with a
mountaineering ice ax...and I carefully follow his footsteps.</P>

<P>(Probing ice)</P>

<P>We're headed to see one of Antarctica's most magnificent
residents: the killer whale.</P>

<P>(Waves lapping against the ice edge)</P>

<P>ROBINSON: You just kind of make some noise. (tape ice ax) They're
curious animals, they'll come over and check it out.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The scenery here is breathtaking. Huge icebergs
floating in the open water. A snow-covered volcano on the
horizon--with steam rising from its summit. In a matter of minutes,
our noise-making works.</P>

<P>(whale breath)</P>

<P>Four killer whales. So close we can hear them breathe. One whale
pokes its head above water just ten feet away.</P>

<P>ROBINSON They're just out here cruising around these different
slots here looking for something to eat and they hear noise. They
want to see what it is.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK:: They're not afraid of people though?</P>

<P>ROBINSON: No not at all. (edit) Just about everything down here
has no fear of man at all.</P>

<P>(whale breath)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Whales and seals were once close to extinction here,
hunted throughout the oceans that encircle the Antarctic mainland.
But international treaties have transformed the entire continent into
the world's largest wildlife sanctuary. It's a unique laboratory to
study how life survives in such hostile conditions.</P>

<P>(scuba gear equipment rustling)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Most of Antarctica's wildlife lives at sea, not on
land. So marine biologists must sometimes dive beneath the ice.</P>

<P>(Air tank)</P>

<P>Rikk Kvitek, from the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory in
California, is preparing to videotape giant sponges and worms that
thrive on the sea floor.</P>

      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Is it dark down there?</P>

<P>KVITEK: The light is muted because you've got--what--ten feet of
ice with snow over the top of it and so not a lot of light is getting
down through the ice, but your eyes adjust to it. It's sort of
like--if you could imagine floating over a desert with a full
moon--(edit) the sponges are sticking up kind of like cactus. And the
ice overhead is sort of like clouds. And the hole is sort of like the
moon. The hole is sort of a spotlight shining down on you.</P>

<P>(zipping suit, squeaky gloves)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Gearing-up for an Antarctic dive is a bit like
preparing for a spacewalk. A heavy rubber suit will keep Dr. Kvitek
warm. It's just 28 degrees down below--the freezing point for salt
water. Ropes will tether him to the surface. A special mask will
allow him to speak throughout the dive.</P>

<P>(Testing the mask "okay.")</P>

<P>These researchers are investigating what happens when six months
of winter darkness give way to round-the-clock sunshine during
summer. Kathy Conlan is with the Canadian Museum of Nature.</P>

<P>(water splashing)</P>

<P>CONLAN: That period when it comes on to 24-hour sunlight is a huge
boom time and it lasts for a couple of months and then it goes down
to a bust for the rest of the year. And that's when the animals out
there are reproducing like mad. They're eating like mad, and their
offspring are getting as big as possible before it goes down to bust
conditions again.</P>

<P>(Dive-in splash, breathing in regulators)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Two divers will spend half an hour at a depth of 100
feet.</P>

<P>(bubbles)</P>

<P>Through his underwater mask, Dr. Kvitek reports his progress.
KVITEK (on mask): We can see the under-ice now. Big pockets of air,
some of them are big enough you can stick your head up into and
breathe. When the divers reach bottom they'll encounter a vibrant
jungle of shapes and colors.</P>

<P>CONLAN: There's quite an elevation difference because the large
sponges can be several feet tall. And then the tunicates are bright
orange and they look rather like big pumpkins with two vase openings
which they will close in when you get close to them. And then there's
soft corals. The large soft corals look like trees, they're orange.
And then there's smaller ones that look like little snowflakes that
dot the bottom.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: As Dr. Kvitek begins his underwater photography, he's
joined by creatures who're attracted to the lights.</P>

<P>KVITEK (on mask): Bright yellow, bright white. Pink stars, purple
worms. The color is really amazing down here when you put a little
bit of light on it.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The videotapes will allow Dr. Kvitek to analyze the
sea-floor even after his dive is over. He'll also collect specimens
to examine in the lab.</P>

<P>(Lab door opens, lab background noise, crowd in lab)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: This is McMurdo Station--America's research
headquarters. With more than a hundred buildings and a thousand
personnel, it's the largest outpost on the continent.</P>

<P>(lab door slams, burgling aquarium)</P>

<P>Inside the lab, pumps bring sea water into the McMurdo aquarium.
</P>

<P>MANAHAN: Have you put your hand in there yet? Try it out.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: No.</P>

<P>MANAHAN: Okay.</P>

<P>(Water splash sweetening)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: That's pretty cold.</P>

<P>MANAHAN: You betcha.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Donal Manahan, from the University of Southern
California, is studying ingenious adaptations life develops to
survive and reproduce in water this cold. Fish, for example, have
organic anti-freeze in their blood. Bacteria have found ways to
sustain biochemical reactions at lower temperatures than normal.</P>

<P>MANAHAN: You put your hand in that water and you wonder how
anything can live in it. It is so painful to a human hand to put it
into Antarctic sea water. And yet when you look under the ice here,
it is one of the most abundant environments on earth.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: However, fish and wildlife now encounter conditions
that nature never intended. Global warming is causing ice sheets to
crumble and lake levels to rise--which alters habitat for a wide
range of species. As well, the entire continent is subjected each
spring to the ozone hole.</P>

<P>(Lab ambience shift)</P>

<P>KARENZ: Okay, there they are. They're swimming around. And they
look very happy. (laughs)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Deneb Karenz from the University of San Francisco is
measuring how baby sea urchins are coping with the effects of ozone
depletion. The earth's ozone layer normally blocks the sun's deadly
ultraviolet rays. But industrial pollution now creates a huge ozone
hole each year above Antarctica. As a result, U-V exposure jumps by
50 to 100 percent. Millions of microscopic plants and animals are
exposed to a potentially lethal sunburn.</P>

<P>(buzz of microscope, crinkling plastic bag with urchins inside)
</P>

<P>Beneath the microscope, you can see why baby sea urchins are
vulnerable. They're nearly transparent, like jellyfish.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK (In the lab): They're incredible. It's really
interesting to watch life this new.</P>

<P>(Lab ambience)</P>

<P>The D-N-A in organisms like these is poorly protected and can
easily be damaged by ultraviolet radiation. Baby sea urchins aren't
the only victims. Worst hit are phytoplankton, the tiny plants that
comprise the base of the food chain. Scientists have detected a
15-percent drop in photosynthesis when plankton cells are hit by
increased U-V light. Researchers like Dr. Karenz don't know exactly
what the consequences of this may be. The ozone hole is a relatively
new phenomenon, first discovered in 1985.</P>

<P>KARENZ: We have no baseline data. There's no UV work done here
prior to the ozone hole. We come down after the ozone hole has
already been around for a decade, and so what we're looking at now is
already an altered system. And so it's very difficult to make any
kind of assessment.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: However, a decrease in plankton could create a food
shortage that might ripple up the food chain to larger species--like
penguins.</P>

<P>(Penguin outburst)</P>

<P>The rocky beach of Cape Byrd is home to more than 50-thousand
Adelie penguins. There's never a dull moment here. Chicks
relentlessly chirp for a meal of regurgitated seafood.</P>

<P>(Chick sounds)</P>

<P>Adelie penguins are characters. Kerry Barton of New Zealand's
Antarctic Research Program never knows how they'll react.</P>

<P>(wide ambience of colony)</P>

<P>BARTON: Some of them are quite aggressive and they rush up and
flip and bash you around the legs. Other ones just ignore you or come
up and gently wave their arms backwards and forwards at you trying to
identify what you are. And other ones take off, terrified, and rush
around in circles for a while and then decide you're all right and
give up.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: In the past two years, penguins have been the subject
of disturbing news. Australian researchers discovered the mass
starvation of Adelie chicks in three separate regions of Antarctica
last year. Their parents were unable to find any food within 100
miles of shore.</P>

<P>Now--says New Zealand researcher Brian Karl--some chicks are
struggling to survive here at Cape Byrd.</P>

<P>KARL: This year they're not doing too well at all, seemingly.
They're late, the chicks are not at the same stage as what they have
been at previous years.</P>

<P>(netting bird sound, rookery background sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: To find out why--New Zealand researchers are netting
80 penguins for an unusual scientific procedure.</P>

<P>(Squalking penguin)</P>

<P>They're draining the food from penguin stomachs to see exactly
what the birds are eating. A plastic tube is slipped down the
penguin's throat and researchers massage its belly as they turn the
bird upside down.</P>

<P>KARL: And we wait for the bird to sick up into the bucket.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The ordeal is disorienting for the penguin...but it's
certainly better than killing the bird, which is what researchers
used to do to examine stomach contents. Now the penguin is back to
normal within an hour.</P>

<P>(Penguin released, jostling the jars with the stomach samples,
rookery background sounds)</P>

<P>The stomach samples suggest this colony may be suffering from
inadequate nutrition.</P>

<P>(jostling jars)</P>

<P>Instead of feasting on krill--a shrimp-like organism that's the
mainstay of the penguin diet--the birds are relying mostly on fish.
</P>

<P>KERRY: Would you like to try some?</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: I'd like to smell it. (smells) whoof! The contents
are heavily-digested which indicates the penguins are swimming a long
way to find dinner and are burning it up before getting home to
regurgitate a meal for their chicks.</P>

<P>(More jostling of jars)</P>

<P>Most alarming--says Kerry Barton--are specimens showing some
penguins with nearly nothing inside their stomachs after a week at
sea.</P>

<P>BARTON: And this is the entire sample the bird had in its stomach.
It's probably only about two tablespoons of food. (edit) And this
bird's been out doing serious fishing and that's all it's managed to
come back with.</P>

<P>(Penguin ambience)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The decline in penguin food supply raises serious
questions. Is the ozone hole to blame? Is ultraviolet light damaging
the marine food web? Or is global warming sweeping the food supply
away by disrupting ocean currents? Or have commercial fishing fleets
been too greedy in the southern oceans? Scientists just don't know.
Die-offs might well be part of a natural cycle. It may be decades
before they're sure.</P>

<P>(People milling sounds)</P>

<P>Researchers have identified a different threat to Antarctic
wildlife, however, that people definitely can control.</P>

<P>KENNEDY: Okay, well welcome everyone to McMurdo station...(speech

<P>FITZPATRICK: It's opening day of tourist season. 100 passengers
from a cruise ship have arrived at the U.S. base.</P>

<P>KENNEDY: Today as your guides, you will have some civilian station
personnel and some military personnel that will give you a tour of
our station. (speech under)</P>

<P>(People milling sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK:Tourism has exploded here in the past 15 years.
Eight-thousand people now visit Antarctica's scientific bases and
wildlife colonies every summer. For adventure travelers like Keri
Gouge of Australia, it's a thrill they'll never forget.</P>

<P>GOUGE: We have seen penguins--more than you'd ever want to see in
a lifetime, and seals, and some whales and obviously lots of birds as
well. It's just been an amazing trip.</P>

<P>(People milling soundS)</P>

<P>KENNEDY: Group A, Group A, Nadine...</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Tourist groups have gotten so large that keeping them
moving is like marshaling a parade.</P>

<P>KENNEDY: Let Group A know that we need them back down here by
10:30. Roger. It's like herding sheep (laughs).</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Nadine Kennedy is with the National Science
Foundation--which runs the U.S. Antarctic program. She's happy to
show tourists how American tax dollars are spent.</P>

<P>KENNEDY: We think of these people as Antarctic ambassadors. If we
can just share a little bit of what we do down here, then they go
back and they tell their friends about it.</P>

<P>(People milling sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Experts are concerned, though, that waves of tourists
might overwhelm Antarctica's fragile environment. Even small groups
of people can cause penguins to panic and abandon their young. And
even the most careful tourist can trample delicate lichens and moss.
That's why scientists fear the growing popularity of Antarctic
expeditions. Colin Harris is with the International Committee for
Antarctic Information and Research. He's investigating the cumulative
impact of tourist visits.</P>

<P>HARRIS: Because there's a limited number of very suitable sites
where landings can be made and there's good wildlife to be seen, the
tourist ships often visit the same site as the previous one and the
previous one to that. So some sites are actually getting two or three
tourist ships a week.</P>

<P>(More milling tourist sound)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Tourism is responsible for the two worst disasters in
Antarctic history. In 1979 a sight-seeing jet crashed, killing 257
passengers. Then, in 1989, a ship spilled 150,000 gallons of fuel
when it ran aground and sank while carrying tourists in a scenic bay.
Since then, tour companies have taken steps to improve safety and
minimize environmental damage. Dick Walker of Adventure Network
International, says tourists don't mind the restrictions.</P>

<P>WALKER: I think most of the clients are very environmentally aware
and probably wouldn't come if they thought there was going to be a
huge negative impact.</P>

<P>(Tourist milling sound and ocean ambience)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Tourists are now prohibited from visiting some sites
in Antarctica--and rules are being developed to make tour companies
liable for the costs of cleaning up any damage they cause. It's part
of an international treaty that also bans mining and oil production
here for the next 50 years. Despite the threats to Antarctica's
penguins and whales--and even its microscopic plankton--this is still
the least-spoiled place on the planet.There are fewer people on this
vast continent than you'd find on a single block in Manhattan. It'll
remain that way for the foreseeable future--because it's incredibly
expensive to get here and even more costly to stay alive once you've
arrived. Environmentalists point to the progress in regulating
tourists and banning oil production as proof that the world
recognizes the value of preserving this striking landscape. That
makes Antarctica one of the world's great environmental success
stories. The earth's most isolated continent will remain a place of
natural wonder.</P>

</TABLE></P>

<P>CURWOOD: Congressional hearings are underway to ratify an
international treaty to protect the environment of Antarctica. The
pact bans mining and oil production on the continent for the next 50
years. It will also require scientists to remove their garbage. For
decades research expeditions have dumped tons of waste throughout
Antarctica. Even today, millions of gallons of raw sewage pour into
pristine waters near science bases. The US has been one of the worst
polluters, but is now working to clean up its operations. As part of
his series from Antarctica, Living on Earth's Terry FitzPatrick
reports on the progress so far, and on the work that remain to be
done.</P>

<P>(Sound of shoveling and digging)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Steve Zebrowski is digging into Antarctica's past.
With hand drills and shovels he's excavating a site in the MacGregor
Valley, a region of immense glaciers and towering peaks.</P>

<P>(Digging continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Mr. Zebrowski is not conducting scientific research.
He's cleaning up a research camp abandoned by scientists nearly 20
years ago.</P>

<P>ZABROWSKI: The last great unexplored open spot in the world, and
it's just... garbage.</P>

<P>(Digging continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Uncovering this camp is a bit like an archaeological
dig. Beneath 6 feet of snow, workers find canvas tents and wooden
sleds, even an old kitchen with a jar of mustard frozen hard as a
rock.</P>

<P>ZABROWSKI: Basically, everything was left here: the sleeping gear,
some clothing, everything they used to live here, except all they
took out was their rock samples and their personal bags. Everything
else was left.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: In all, 30 tons of survival gear was abandoned, along
with (raps on a drum) 10,000 gallons of fuel.</P>

<P>MAN: A barrel!</P>

<P>ZABROWSKI: Yeah, it's full. (Raps on drum)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Antarctica is littered with hundreds of sites like
this: relics of an era when protecting the environment was not a
priority. In many places, international expeditions have left a heavy
footprint. The French, for instance, destroyed several bird colonies
in the 1980s while building an aircraft landing strip. Argentina let
sled dogs run wild through penguin rookeries, killing thousands of
birds. And the US irradiated thousands of tons of soil in the 1960s
while testing a nuclear power reactor. The most visible problem,
though, is garbage. To clean-up worker David Zastro, it's evidence of
a short-sighted attitude researchers had about Antarctica.</P>

<P>ZASTRO: The place is so huge it can just absorb it all, and it
just doesn't matter, but after a while it does. And it's what's
starting to happen now. There's so much junk down there it's at least
-- the way we feel, it's getting to be a little too much.</P>

<P>(Hauling and trucking sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Antarctic exploration generates staggering amounts of
waste. Nowhere is that more evident than McMurdo Station, the
sprawling US logistics base on the shores of the Ross Sea.</P>

<P>(Truck engines)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: McMurdo is a bustling facility with the gritty feel
of the old Wild West.</P>

<P>(A door slams, creaks)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Five million pounds of waste is generated here every
year. More than a ton of trash per person.</P>

<P>(Slamming continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: For decades, says Rick Kvitek of the Moss Landing
Marine Laboratory, garbage here was dumped on hills and beaches, or
on the ice pack that covers the sea each winter.</P>

<P>KVITEK: They had a policy for many years of just putting the
season's garbage out on the sea ice with the expectation and hope
that when the sea ice broke out it would carry it away. And as often
as not the sea ice would just melt in place and the stuff would just
go to the bottom.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The ocean floor is now strewn with debris.</P>

<P>(Water bubbling, possibly through scuba gear)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Underwater videos shot by Dr. Kvitek depict an
astonishing scene.</P>

<P>KVITEK: There's hundreds of 55-gallon drums on the bottom and
there's tractors and there's jeeps and there's track vehicles and
there's airplanes all over the sea floor. It's a dump underwater in
some places.</P>

<P>(Water bubbling continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: No one's sure what's inside the submerged chemical
barrels. But the level of hydrocarbons and PCBs in sediment here is
comparable to big city harbors inside the United States. Scientists
are debating whether they should conduct a clean-up. The pollution
seems to be contained to the harbor at McMurdo Base. Disturbing the
rusty barrels might cause it to spread.</P>

<P>(Trucks driving)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: When it comes to managing the waste dumped on land,
however, the US has undertaken a major clean-up. Mountains of debris
have been shipped to Seattle for proper disposal, and newly-created
trash is immediately packaged for transport back to the US.</P>

<P>(Horns blare)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: This initiative began 5 years ago, funded by a $43
million appropriation from Congress. Eric Juergins directs the
effort.</P>

<P>JUERGINS: The US program, several years ago I think, pretty much
had the reputation of being pretty slovenly, where a huge operation,
you've seen through town that we look to be somewhat of a crude
industrial complex. And in the past we behaved that way. Now I think,
if you talk to the international community that has Antarc programs,
they'll all tell you that the US has really set the tone for how to
do things properly. Our reputation has changed significantly.</P>

<P>(Breaking brick or glass sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The environmental initiative includes aggressive
recycling. Buildings have a dozen different bins for people to
segregate their trash; more than 60% of it is recycled.</P>

<P>TOMASI: My name's Paul Tomasi and I'm with Waste Management...
</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: To ensure people obey the rules, everyone must attend
a 30-minute waste management lecture when they arrive on the
continent.</P>

<P>TOMASI: We do recycle glass here on Antarctica. We recycle
unbroken, clear, green and brown jars and glasses. We ask that...
</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: To Eric Juergins, this new emphasis is a natural step
in the evolution of Antarctic exploration.</P>

<P>JUERGINS: Early on it was sort of an expeditionary mentality, and
survival was number one. Then we went to a phase where we weren't
sure how long we would be here, sort of a colonial type of a
mentality, if you will, and that's where McMurdo grew up. It was only
until we decided that we were going to have a permanent presence here
in Antarctica, where we've got to the community sense, and lived up
to our stewardship of Antarctica.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: However, this stewardship came as a result of
pressure from environmental groups. In the 1980s, as international
negotiators were discussing whether mining should be allowed in
Antarctica, Greenpeace launched several investigative expeditions.
The result: shocking photographs of garbage burning in huge open
pits. According to Paul Bogart who directed the campaign, these
photos demonstrated the need for strict environmental oversight of
scientists.</P>

<P>BOGART: You can't hold these folks, take these folks necessarily
at their word when they're talking about having the environment's
best interests at heart. And so bringing that home to people really
increased the pressure on countries to do something.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: What the 26 nations that conduct Antarctic research
did was approve a sweeping set of environmental guidelines in 1991.
The Madrid Protocol bans mining for 50 years and requires a pack it
in, pack it out approach for trash. The protocol is now up for
ratification in Congress. Environmentalists say it's weak in many
areas and they'd like Congress to augment the treaty by extending US
environmental laws to American activities in Antarctica. But they're
supporting the protocol because the agency in charge of research, the
National Science Foundation or the NSF, is showing a commitment to
environmental protection.</P>

<P>Beth Marks heads a coalition called the Antarctica Project.</P>

<P>MARKS: In getting the US to finally agree on a bill which has just
been introduced, we all had to concede that NSF has done a much
better job recently in cleaning up the bases and in setting good
environmental policy. And we have to just hope that these policies
will continue even with a bill that is not as strident as we would
have preferred.</P>

<P>(More trucking sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Although there's been progress in managing waste,
several environmental problems remains. One of the most serious is
oil.</P>

<P>(A motor revs up)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Nearly 200,000 gallons of aircraft fuel, known as
JP8, has been spilled at McMurdo Station over the years.</P>

<P>(Motor sounds continue)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Research teams are now drilling holes to evaluate the
extent of soil contamination.</P>

<P>(Motor sounds continue)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: John Holbrook is from the University of Alaska in
Fairbanks.</P>

<P>(A shovel digs)</P>

<P>HOLBROOK: One way to test the presence of JP8 is just to stick
your nose close by and smell it. I don't detect very much, maybe a
little bit.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: I smell a little something.</P>

<P>HOLBROOK: Yeah, there's a little something there. But that is by
no means strong. We've dug up soil samples and taken a whiff and it
-- it almost reeks of the stuff in certain places.</P>

<P>(A high, whining sound)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The samples are analyzed in the McMurdo labs by Mark
Tumio from the University of Alaska.</P>

<P>(High, whining sound continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The tests reveal several hot spots around the
station. There's good news, though: the contamination hasn't spread
very far.</P>

<P>TUMIO: It's not like they threw fuel on the ground. Fuel's a
commodity here and you don't waste it, so, you know, spills were
always accidental and they were controlled quickly. There's not much
soil here, so there's not much depth to the soil. So that means what
was spilled soaked up relatively, in a very small area, and tends to
stay there. We don't get lots of rain to push stuff around; you don't
have a lot of migration. So where it's spilled it's dirty, and not
too far away it's still clean.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Still, more than 700 drums of soil await
decontamination. Dr. Tumio is experimenting with oil eating bacteria
to see if there's a natural way to conduct the clean-up. As those
tests continue, researchers are also evaluating Antarctica's biggest
ongoing source of pollution.</P>

<P>(A toilet flushes)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: McMurdo Station discharges 66,000 gallons of raw
sewage into the ocean every day. The prospect of building a $3
million sewage treatment plant is sparking debate. Some officials
contend the sewage is quickly diluted in the ocean and treatment is
unnecessary. But others point out that sewage is altering the natural
mix of marine life. Clams and starfish have disappeared near the
sewage outfall, replaced instead by worms and other organisms that
tolerate human waste. In a small beachfront laboratory, Cathy Conlin
from the Canadian Museum of Nature is examining tissue samples to see
if sewage affects organisms beyond the McMurdo vicinity. It's a high
tech procedure based on a simple truth: we are what we eat.</P>

<P>CONLIN: We all contain different isotopes of carbon and nitrogen
and sulfur. And these proportions will differ according to what we
eat. So if we eat all vegetables we'll have a certain proportion; if
we eat all meat it will be a different proportion. Sewage has been
demonstrated to have a certain, what you call, signature, a certain
proportion. And if an organism is eating sewage, it will take up that
proportion so it will register that signal.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Dr. Conlin hasn't collected enough samples to reach a
conclusion yet. In fact, officials would not allow her to dive for
specimens this year near the sewage outfall, because of dangerous
levels of bacteria. In effect, it was Antarctica's first beach
closure.</P>

<P>(Water lapping on shore)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: The situation illustrates the choices officials must
make when weighing the costs and benefits of working in a sensitive
ecosystem. Eric Juergins, the environmental manager for McMurdo,
maintains that some degree of ecological disruption is unavoidable.
</P>

<P>JUERGINS: I have my doubts that man can go anywhere without
leaving some impact. that being true, then, what you've got to do is
try to consciously decide what impact you're going to leave, and try
to measure that impact and determine whether the impact is worth what
you're doing there.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Scientists and environmentalists agree on one thing:
researchers here are learning how the Earth works. And that is worth
some measure of environmental impact. And even though a few
researchers complain the environmental protections go too far,
overall there's been a major change in attitude. Cornelius Sullivan
is Director of Polar Programs for the National Science Foundation.
</P>

<P>SULLIVAN: We've changed human behavior in Antarctica to comply
with good environmental practice, almost to the point that McMurdo,
which otherwise looks like a mining town, is a place you'd have a
hard time finding a cigarette butt or a scrap of paper. Kind of like
going to Disneyland and seeing people sweep things up. Here they
don't have to sweep them up; they never put them on the ground and if
they find one they pick it up. That's remarkable to me: human
behavior being changed because the people believe in what we're doing
here in an environmental sense is remarkable.</P>

<P>(Wind whipping)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: When you travel just a few minutes away from even the
biggest of Antarctic bases now, you're hard pressed to detect any
trace that people are nearby. The goal is to keep it that way. For
Living on Earth this is Terry FitzPatrick reporting.</P>

<P>(Music up and under)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Our series from Antarctica continues next week with a
look at the Great Antarctic Ice Sheets, and whether global warming is
causing them to melt.</P>

<H2>Is Global Warming Affecting Polar Ice Shelves?</H2>

<P>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the written
authority of World Media Foundation.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. The dramatic
blizzards, droughts, heat waves and hurricanes we've had in recent
years have focused attention on some of the potential affects of
global warming. There's another consequence of climate change,
though, that in the long run could cause even greater problems
worldwide. If a lot of polar ice melts in Antarctica, global sea
level could rise dramatically, forcing millions of people to flee
their homes. For the past 50 years, sections of Antarctica have been
melting, but researchers aren't sure if it's part of a natural cycle
or the result of greenhouse gas pollution from humans. Either way,
the future of the ice cap is in question, as Living on Earth's Terry
FitzPatrick discovered while accompanying research teams to
Antarctica earlier this year.</P>

<P>(Winds whipping)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: No place on Earth is as cold and forbidding as the
windswept interior of Antarctica, a region one and a half times the
size of the United States that is draped by glaciers up to 3 miles
thick.</P>

<P>(Wind continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: This frigid landscape makes a lasting impression on
people who come here, even seasoned researchers like Kerry
Peterson.<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=1

         <P><FONT SIZE=2>At the remote Taylor Valley Field Camp,
         scientists from the University of Maine are studying how
         periods of global warming affected the polar ice cap
         millions of years ago, in an effort to more fully understand
         the consequences of global warming today.</FONT>
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>PETERSON: It's just you and the raw force of nature. There's the
sky and there's the snow and that's it. And the horizon is just so
broad, you can almost see the curvature of the Earth. I like it
because you have the sense that you're really on a planet hurtling
through space.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: A fragile planet, which Antarctica keeps livable.
Think of Antarctica as a giant ice cube in a glass of water, cooling
the world's oceans. As well, Antarctica's vast expanse of snow
reflects sunlight back into space, cooling the Earth's surface. The
snow fields and glaciers are also like a giant reservoir, locking up
70% of the world's fresh water and keeping global sea level in check.
</P>

<P>(A clang; a motor runs)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Because Antarctica plays a crucial role in shaping
the world's environment, researchers are eager to learn if global
warming could cause the ice cap to melt. To find out, they're
drilling to the very bottom of the ice to look for clues.</P>

<P>PETERSON: We got -- oh, yes! Yes!</P>

<P>MAN: That's nice.</P>

<P>PETERSON: All right.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Ms. Peterson and her colleagues from the California
Institute of Technology are pulling up an ice core.</P>

<P>PETERSON: Oh, beautiful.</P>

<P>MAN: That's perfect.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Three feet long and 3 inches around, this core
contains a unique kind of ice formed by intense pressure inside the
ice cap. The core starts to crackle as air bubbles begin to escape.
</P>

<P>(Crackling sounds, feet on snow)</P>

<P>PETERSON: Oh, look at the clear ice! God, it's beautiful.</P>

<P>ENGLEHART: This whole thing is one single crystal. Huge single
crystals.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Researcher Erman Englehardt hopes these crystals can
explain why parts of the ice cap are breaking loose from Antarctica's
bedrock and surging toward the ocean at the rate of 4 feet per day.
Known as fast flowing streams, several of these massive rivers of ice
have been discovered in western Antarctica. They have the potential
to drain the entire West Antarctic ice sheet into the sea.</P>

<P>ENGLEHARDT: The ice streams can carry away large quantities of ice
in a relatively short time. And if their movement changes, for
instance, if they widen or they speed up, they can change the balance
of the ice sheet dramatically. So we need to understand what controls
the speed of these ice streams.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: This is where global warming might be involved. It
might change how rapidly the streams empty into the ocean. Right now,
the streams are kept in check by floating ice shelves that line the
Antarctic coast. The floating shelves act like giant dams, holding
back the streams. If global warming causes the ice shelves to melt,
the ice streams would be free to race unchecked into the sea. The
West Antarctic ice sheet could collapse.</P>

<P>ENGLEHARdT: And that could happen in a short time span like 50,
100 years, maybe 500 years. This we don't know exactly.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: In the past 50 years, 5 minor ice shelves have
disappeared, the result of a 5-degree rise in temperature along the
Antarctic coast. But the most important ice shelves seem stable for
now. It's unclear how warm it must get before they could be in danger
of melting.</P>

<P>(Indoor fans running)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: To find out if the West Antarctic ice sheet is likely
to collapse in the future, researchers are trying to determine how
it's responded to warming in the past.</P>

<P>(The fan continues, now with cellophane crackling)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: In a refrigerated lab, Richard Alley of Penn State
University examines Antarctic ice cores beneath a microscope.</P>

<P>(Crackling continues)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Just as rings in a tree reveal its age, the layers of
an ice core are a window to the past.</P>

<P>ALLEY: And so you can say well, 10,000 years ago it snowed this
much, and someone else will measure the dust and somebody will
measure the composition of the gas bubbles that are trapped in the
air. And we pretty soon start to draw a picture of the past climate.
And so we're working very hard on reading that: what happened in the
world's climate, what did that do to the ice sheets?</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Dr. Alley says the West Antarctic ice sheet has
probably collapsed before and could collapse again. If it does, the
massive melting of ice would raise global sea level by 20 feet.
Twenty feet might not sound like much, but it's enough to inundate
several small islands in the Pacific, and low-lying coastal regions
in Southeast Asia, western Africa, the Middle East, and southeastern
US. More than 200 million people could be forced to move. Millions of
acres of farmland would be lost. Some communities would have to build
extensive sea walls to protect against hurricanes and storms.
However, it's not time to sell the beach house yet.</P>

<P>ALLEY: I wish to emphasize that this is not a prediction, this is
the worst thing that could happen. And we have not yet been able to
prove that it can't happen.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Actually, there is one worse scenario which involves
the eastern part of Antarctica melting along with the west. The east
contains the bulk of Antarctica's ice, and if it goes, sea level
could rise more than 200 feet. That would be a flood of Biblical
proportions.</P>

<P>ALLEY: It would not be Water World, there would still be land
sticking out. But the coastline would look enough different that you
wouldn't immediately recognize it. You'd look for that finger of
Florida pointing down there and it wouldn't be there.</P>

<P>(A helicopter chops)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: From the air, Eastern Antarctica looks just as frozen
and desolate as the west. But there are major differences, which have
sparked a scientific debate about whether it's possible for this part
of the continent to melt. The eastern ice sheet is firmly fixed on
high ground, and it's been that way, according to some researchers,
for 15 million years. If these researchers are right, the eastern ice
cap has survived several periods of global warming.</P>

<P>(Digging sounds)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Other scientists, though, have uncovered evidence
that East Antarctica has melted as recently as 3 million years ago.
</P>

<P>HARWOOD: I'm trying to dig down as far as I can and see what's
been accumulating here.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: David Harwood from the University of Nebraska has
discovered plankton, leaves, and twigs in the Trans-Antarctic
Mountains, one of the few ice-free regions of the continent. The only
way they could get here, contends Dr. Harwood, is for the eastern ice
to have melted, raising sea level and turning much of inland
Antarctica into a beach.</P>

<P>HARWOOD: And the evidence that we're debating now would suggest
that once those ice sheets formed, that they didn't stay, that they
came and went and came and went.</P>

<P>(Digging sounds continue)</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: Some researchers think Dr. Harwood is wrong. They
believe the plankton and leaves were blown here by the wind. The
debate has touched off a feud between rival camps of geologists over
whose version of Antarctic history is correct. But the critical
question is whether East Antarctica might melt in the future. On that
point, Dr. Harwood isn't sure.</P>

<P>HARWOOD: The East Antarctic ice sheet in the past has been a key
player. Whether or not future warming will, you know, bring Eastern
Antarctica back into the game, I don't know.</P>

<P>FITZPATRICK: This uncertainty underscores how difficult it is to
predict the future of the Antarctic ice cap. Various research panels
have published widely differing views about what's likely to happen
here in the next 100 years. Some scientists even think global warming
could cause the ice to grow, by increasing snowfall throughout the
continent. However, researchers do agree on this: Antarctica is
isolated from the rest of the world but it's not immune to global
environmental change. And just as importantly, we're not immune from
what happens at the bottom of the Earth. For Living on Earth, this is
Terry FitzPatrick reporting.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: For the past few weeks, Living on Earth's Terry
FitzPatrick has been telling us about the glaciers and wildlife of
Antarctica. But some of the most fascinating stories from his 2-week
journey involve the sometimes wild lives of people who ventured to
the world's most hostile continent to conduct scientific research.
This week, Terry concludes his special series of reports with a slice
of life at the bottom of the earth.</P>

         territory that is to be used only for peaceful scientific
         purposes.</FONT>
      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></P>

<P>(Music up and under: "Like sitting on pins and needles, things
fall apart. It's scientific. Check it in, and check it out....")</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Despite its romantic appeal, Antarctica can be an
exhausting place. People here work flat out, cramming as much
research as possible into the short polar summer. So it's little
wonder that at the end of the season, folks let loose.</P>

<P>(People going, "Whoo!" Music in the background)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: These researchers have used their engineering
expertise to convert an ice drilling rig into a hot tub.</P>

<P>(People: "Whoo! It's hot!")</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: The wind chill is 15 degrees below zero. But that's
nothing a warm soak and a little vodka can't conquer. People invited
me to strip and join them.</P>

<P>(Voices: "Yeah!" "Are you serious about the Antarctic experience?"
"You've got to live it." "Hey, take it off, Terry, take it off!"
Laughter. "Terry. Terry...")</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: I wanted to hop in, but I was sick. And I was about
to catch a plane to begin my trip back home. I tried to explain but
folks didn't buy it.</P>

<P>(Voices: "Terry, you wimp! It's because you're a radio reporter;
if you did television you'd have been in here!")</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: And so there I stood with bronchitis, bundled in my
fur-trimmed parka, recording the revelry of a dozen nude Antarctic
explorers.</P>

<P>(Voices: "Waterloo!" Singing along with a radio.)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: I thought I'd seen everything but the best was yet
to come.</P>

<P>(A motor runs)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: As my plane arrived 2 plumes of steam came racing my
way from the vicinity of the hot tub. A woman, naked, on a
snowmobile, towing a man, naked, on skis. They circled the plane,
hugged the pilot, and headed back to the party.</P>

<P>(The motor continues to run)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: The hot tub drove home the work hard, play hard
atmosphere in Antarctica. Research on the stability of the ice cap or
the effects of the ozone hole can be stressful, involving difficult
journeys to remote field locations. Wildly unpredictable weather can
also make this a dangerous place. Fifty-six people have died on
American expeditions since World War II. The dangers are emphasized
the moment you arrive. Everyone who goes into the field must attend 2
days of survival training.</P>

<P>(Chains clank)</P>

<P>McCARTHY: All right! So everyone's got a harness, okay. Now the
first thing you need, you're going to do, is...</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Our teacher is back country guide Forrest McCarthy.
He demonstrates the use of climbing harnesses and ropes, essential
equipment for travel on the ice cap where crevasses can open up and
swallow a person without warning.</P>

<P>McCARTHY: You've got to double back you harness. Now, see how I
take this trap, and I double back through that buckle. Now people
have died because they didn't do that.</P>

<P>(Chains clanking, footfalls on ice)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Roped up and underway on our first Antarctic day
hike, we skirt the lip of an impressive crevasse.</P>

<P>(More footfalls)</P>

<P>McCARTHY: How are you doing?</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: All right.</P>

<P>McCARTHY: Good.</P>

<P>(Wind whips)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Then we're lowered into the crevasse one by one, as
fellow students practice the teamwork required for a rescue.</P>

<P>McCORMICK: The trick to surviving down here has a lot to do with
attitude.</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Instructor Bill McCormick says survival school is
designed to instill a healthy regard for the elements.</P>

<P>McCORMICK: There is a lot of specific things to this environment.
You have to start developing an eye for and a respect for -- the
weather is, you know, maybe the major feature and most people don't
have a sense of how ferocious it can be and how rapidly it can
change.</P>

<P>(Metal against metal and/or ice)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Sometimes the only way to escape life-threatening
winds is to build an igloo, or dig an emergency trench. So Mr.
McCormick shows us how.</P>

<P>McCORMICK: Basically it's like digging a grave for yourself, but
this is the grave that saves; I just made that up right now. Never
used that line before.</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Is that true?</P>

<P>McCORMICK: It's true. (Laughs)</P>

<P>(Sawing continues)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: After a difficult day of training, I slept 4 miles
from base camp in a shelter made of snow. Because nature can be so
ferocious, people are required to stick close to camp when they're
not conducting research. As a result there's always a touch of cabin
fever in the air.</P>

<P>(People milling)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: That's especially true at America's main research
complex, McMurdo Station, where 1,200 people crowd into the cafeteria
every day.</P>

<P>(More milling)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: McMurdo is more like a town than a camp, and its
personality is shaped by a curious blend of 3 distinct cultures.
Scientists make it feel like a college campus. Pilots make it feel
like a Navy base. Cooks, mechanics, and other support personnel make
it feel like a frontier town.</P>

<P>(More milling)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: The 3 groups rarely mix and sit apart during meals.
About the only time they do sit together is in church. That's where
assistant chaplain Simon Eckleton conducts Catholic mass beneath a
stained glass image of a penguin. Father Eckleton says the peculiar
conditions make McMurdo a difficult place to live.</P>

<P>ECKLETON: People have to have outlets, and there aren't the normal
outlets that there would be back home. And the family from which so
much stability grows is entirely lacking. There are no children here.
There are no elderly people here. There are no sick people here. So
we may call ourselves a community and a town, McMurdo, but the fact
is it's a very strange environment, and the harshness of the climate
really is reflected in the harshness of life within the community.
</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: You can see this harshness in McMurdo's 2 taverns.
Especially for the support personnel, this is a hard drinking town.
The most popular entertainment is karaoke night in a dimly lit bar
called The Southern Exposure.</P>

<P>(A man sings Elvis: "I hear the train a'comin. It's rollin' round
the bend. And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when. I'm
stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on...")</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: The National Science Foundation, which runs the US
Antarctic Program, is trying to curb the use of alcohol. Eric Chiang,
the senior US official here, has closed a number of bars in town.
</P>

<P>CHIANG: Not only were there 5 formal bars or clubs, you could find
bars in all of the work centers. You know, under the excuse that you
needed, that you might get trapped in a facility during a major
storm. Alcohol was the recreational outlet, you know, years past.
</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Officials now promote other forms of recreation,
including cross-country skiing, aerobics, even bowling.</P>

<P>(A bowling ball careens down a lane and hits pins. People go,
"Oh!" and cheer.)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: McMurdo is home to the world's southernmost bowling
alley. Two lanes, with a manual pin setting. The bowling alley is
where I met Shana Muldoon, a heavy equipment driver. Ms. Muldoon
commends officials for trying to make McMurdo more livable.</P>

<P>MULDOON: When I first came down 3 years ago I thought about the
basics. I was thinking, we're going to have only the basics and
that's going to be it. I was shocked when we had VCRs and televisions
and stuff like that. I was like, wow, I mean I was pleasantly
surprised.</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: However, Ms. Muldoon did point out a different
problem: the lack of women. There are 3 men here for every woman,
which Ms. Muldoon told me can result in unwelcome come-ons.</P>

<P>MULDOON: Well, you just go into the bar and you're surrounded.
Which like I said, it can be flattering, but then at other times it
can be -- you don't trust them any more. You know that you're one of
the few women so of course they're going to flatter you whether it's
true or not.</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: Officials are trying to recruit more women, and in
general are striving to transform McMurdo's social environment. With
weekly movies, a coffee house, and satellite telephone service back
to the States. Officials say healthy morale improves productivity and
makes the base attractive enough for experienced personnel to want to
return.</P>

<P>(Fans run)</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: The improvements go beyond creature comforts. The
laboratories here are as good as you'd find at many American
universities. Marine biologist Donald Manahan from the University of
Southern California appreciates how the infrastructure allows him to
focus on his work.</P>

<P>MANAHAN: It's one of the few towns on the planet Earth where
science comes first. Not only that, it's multi-disciplinary. When you
sit down at dinner here, one day you're sitting beside a biologist,
the next day you're sitting by somebody studying the ozone hole, the
next day it's a geologist. So this is a very interesting area for
collaborative interdisciplinary science, which is really an important
thing for future environmental studies is to put together the
different disciplines.</P>

<P>FITZ PATRICK: These different kinds of scientists come to
Antarctica because it's the most isolated and least studied continent
on Earth. And despite efforts to make this place a bit more like
home, the rugged conditions give it a special appeal for a certain
type of individual. It instills a frontier spirit that's difficult to
shake. That's evident in the saying support personnel have about
Antarctica: the first year you come for the adventure; the second
year you come for the money, and the third year you come because you
don't fit in anyplace else. For Living on Earth, this is Terry
FitzPatrick reporting.</P>

<H2>Supermarkets Go Natural</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of December 6, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No
portion of this transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted
without the written authority of World Media Foundation.</FONT><BR>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Organic produce, juice-sweetened sodas, and free-range
chickens. Once found only in small health food stores and coops,
these items are getting easier to find all the time. The reason:
natural foods supermarkets are sprouting up across the country at an
unprecedented rate. Two of them just opened in the Boston area. We
sent Living on Earth's Kim Motylewski to visit the new stores, and
find out what the trend means for shoppers and grocers.</P>

<P>MAN1: Need to sign off on hatch, need to get name badges and
aprons if you're on the counter. If you're in the kitchen, you're all
set.</P>

<P>MAN 2: Tomorrow's the day.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: It's the eve of the grand opening at Nature's
Heartland, a natural food supermarket in the affluent Boston suburb
of Bedford, Massachusetts. Workers are busy building colorful
pyramids of produce and stocking shelves with jars of vitamins.</P>

<P>(Sound of bottles being placed on shelves)</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: The smell of baking bread wafts across the big stylish
store, and carpenters are making some last-minute changes.</P>

<P>(A drill runs)</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Nature's Heartland looks like a typical full-service
supermarket, but what sets it apart is a strict set of standards for
the food it sells. No artificial additives, preservatives, or
sweeteners. No bleached flour, no MSG, no hydrogenated oils. The list
goes on. Nature's Heartland is riding the crest of a new wave in the
retail grocery industry, one that could change the inventories of
most supermarkets.</P>

<P>EISOLD: This is the most exciting thing that I've seen in a long
time...</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Brad Eisold is the main grocery buyer for Nature's
Heartland. He's been in the natural foods business for 25 years.
Eisold says the growing popularity of natural foods isn't just a fad.
He says it's a consumer rejection of the chemical-intensive approach
to food that developed after World War II.</P>

<P>EISOLD: So this is a natural evolution, coming back, eating clean,
pure, wholesome food. Being concerned with the nutritional value and
the flavor value as opposed to how long they can keep it sitting on
the shelves. We're not hoping to have food on our shelves very long.
</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Market analysts say consumer demands for freshness,
convenience, and quality are helping move that food off the shelves.
They also note that about 52% of the population wants to buy products
that go easy on the Earth. Meanwhile, a growing number of shoppers
are concerned about environmental health hazards.</P>

<P>WOMAN: We're sick of eating chemicals everywhere you go. Breathing
them, eating them, living them. And I look for things that are
organically grown. So I'm pregnant with twins, and so I'm also
wanting to take good care of myself and my toddler.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: What's brought you in?</P>

<P>MAN: Because they grind up my cheese for me.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: It looks delicious.</P>

<P>MAN: It's not pre-ground. I bought the cheese and then I watched
it being ground.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: And what do you like about that?</P>

<P>MAN: Fresher. I know it's fresh.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: And it tastes better.</P>

<P>MAN: Well, it's all in your mind but so much is. You know, it's
like romance is in your mind, too, isn't it? Don't you find that
true?</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: The romance of natural foods and supplements has
driven up sales nationally, more than 20% for the second year in a
row. That's enormous growth given the conventional grocery business
is inching up at about 3% a year. Toss in the higher profit margins
on natural foods and you begin to understand why big health food
stores are popping up left and right. It's where the money is.
National grocery chains like Stop and Shop and Safeway are committing
more and more shelf space to natural foods. Some estimates show 60 to
80% of them tapping into the market. In New England, the grocery
giant Star Market has launched a whole new chain of natural food
stores. Star Market Chairman Henry Nasella says the time is ripe.
</P>

<P>NASELLA: Given all the resources that we can put behind it as a
big company, we can be very successful and also at the same time do
the right thing in expanding, if you will, this whole natural food
industry to more and more people that otherwise wouldn't have been
exposed to it.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Mr. Nasella has added a new twist to the natural foods
concept. He's created a hybrid store called Wild Harvest.</P>

<P>(Music on a PA system)</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Wild Harvest is less flashy than competitors like
Nature's Heartland, or the natural foods leader, Whole Foods. Mr.
Nasella has located his flagship store in the working class community
of Medford. While most of the store's floor space is devoted to
natural foods, Wild Harvest also stocks some conventional groceries
in a separate section of the store. So under one roof you can pick up
your sugar frosted flakes and the organic soy milk to pour over them.
The reason, says Henry Nasella, is convenience. This is what he's
heard from customers.</P>

<P>NASELLA: I like the quality, I like the ambiance of some of those
stores, but I really have to shop more than one place and it's not
convenient. You know, I like a Diet Coke or I want a Ben and Jerry's
Ice Cream or I want whatever. But if in fact they were going to go to
a second store anyway and going to buy those products, why not save
them time? I mean, time is the currency of the year 2000.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Mr. Nasella says he's planning to open 6 more Wild
Harvest stores in the next year, and hopes to have 30 stores all over
New England within 5 years. As it passes the $9 billion a year sales
mark and successful little companies become big public ones, natural
foods is becoming big business. Investment analysts say the changes
we're seeing in the industry mirror those that transformed the
conventional grocery business over the last 50 years. Matthew Patsky
is with Adams, Harkness, and Hill.</P>

<P>PATSKY: You know, on the retail side we're seeing tremendous
consolidation. We've seen consolidation going on among distributors.
We're starting to see the beginnings of it in among manufacturers,
and ultimately lower price points. So the consumer ultimately will
benefit from the efficiencies.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Mr. Patsky predicts that over the next 20 years,
prices for natural foods will come down closer to prices of
conventional groceries. And in the long run, he says most independent
retailers and small food coops will disappear. It's a trade-off. A
national market and more healthy food for more people, but at the
price of the pioneers.</P>

<P>(A scoop gathers food)</P>

<P>HIGGINS: Well of course, there was always this kind of joke, you
know, in the coop milieu in the, you know, in the 70s, that what are
we going to do with ourselves if this mission is accomplished?</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: John Higgins is general manager of Harvest Coop
Supermarket in Cambridge. He admits that some consolidation is
inevitable. But he argues there will always be a place for the
well-run small natural foods business.</P>

<P>HIGGINS: The bigger the big boys are, the more incompetent they
become at certain things that happen on a more local, more human
level. Because there can be a level of service and a level of sort of
comfort in the store. You don't have to be overwhelmed by a 40,000
square foot store. And there's more of a personal touch.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Mr. Higgins says he doesn't want to overstate this
local advantage, but at least one shopper I spoke to noticed the
corporate atmosphere at one of these new natural foods superstores.
She called to tell me about it.</P>

<P>POWERS: Hello, Kim, this is Pamela Bailey Powers. You interviewed
me this morning at Nature's Heartland. I actually am a poet, and I
had sat (laughs) watching the opening of Nature's Heartland, and I
penned a quick poem, and I thought maybe you'd be interested. It's
called Media Event. Free range chickens at grand opening of Nature's
Heartland. The photographer in rain covers her Nikon with a plastic
grocery bag. Managers strut in red blazers. A suede-heeled PR lady
hangs a wreath mid-ribbon between hitching posts. Everyone grins. Off
comes plastic. Flash, flash. A mother in white hugs her baby in
white. A father lifts his child upon shoulders. Ribbon cut. Electric
doors like slaughterhouse blade are timed perfectly as into the
heartland they go.</P>

<P>MOTYLEWSKI: Pamela Bailey Powers lives in Lexington,
Massachusetts, and shops at Nature's Heartland. For Living on Earth,
I'm Kim Motylewski.</P>

<H2>What's Wrong With Organic Grains?</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of December 6, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: If demand for organic foods is up, this should be good
news for organic farming, right? It's not necessarily so, says Fred
Kirschenmann, president of Farm Verified Organic. Mr. Kirschenmann,
who serves on the National Organic Standards Board, runs a 3,100 acre
farm in North Dakota. He says increased profits for organic farmers
only tell part of the story.</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: Some of us worry there's a down side to this as
well.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What do you mean, a down side?</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: Well, it seems that as the industry begins to take
organic seriously and to include more organic products in their line,
what they want to do is put a certified organic product alongside
every conventional product. And if they do that, then it means that
they're going to create a demand for the same narrow band of crops
that are currently used in the conventional market, which is
primarily corn, wheat, soybeans, and rice. So if you're going to
create a demand for that very narrow band of crops, it's going to
make it very difficult for organic farmers to maintain the kind of
diversity of crops that they need in order to make that system work
on their farms.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, to your average consumer, looks like we have a
fairly diverse food supply. I mean, you walk into the supermarket any
day of the week, any time of the year, and you can get all kinds of
produce.</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: Sure. You know, we visit, consumers have come to
believe that what variety and food means is being able to buy kiwi
fruit from New Zealand in North Dakota in January. But that's only
one way of thinking about variety. You know, if you really look at
the major foods which are made available in the average supermarket
today, there's actually very little choice. You know, you've got 3
different brands of labels or names for the same product. About the
only place you have real choice is in the fresh produce area, and
there again, the choice is based upon foods that's traveled thousands
of miles, rather than looking at it in terms of variety, in terms of
different kinds of foods which could be grown on a seasonal basis
within that community. You know, that's another way to think about
variety. But that doesn't make profit for the large food industries,
and so consumers haven't had an opportunity to look at variety in
terms of what they can produce locally.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What's the danger that you're concerned about here?</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: We have been in the last 50 years dramatically
specializing agriculture all over the world. Agriculture
traditionally used to rely on 80,000 different plants. Today we're
relying on 15 to 20 plants for all of the calories of the food that's
grown on this planet. That makes the system very vulnerable. It makes
it vulnerable to pests, it makes it vulnerable to diseases. Now, at
the same time that we're doing that, we're now dramatically
increasing our global trade. And the global trade is going to
inevitably bring alien pests into environments that are very
specialized and very vulnerable, and it's a prescription for
disaster.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So, what do you propose we do?</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: Well, it's really very difficult. You know, in the
ideal world, what we would like to see is for the manufacturers and
processors of organic foods to recognize this problem and to begin to
diversify their food lines. When you have a diversified system, you
rely upon the system itself. On our farm, for example, we have 8
different crops which we grow in various rotations. We grow a legume,
which fixes the nitrogen. We grow a cool season cereal grain which is
shallow rooted, which takes nutrients primarily from the top portions
of the soil. We grow warm season broad-leaf crops, which are
deep-rooted, which take fertility from deeper in the soil profile.
And so it's those kinds of diverse elements that you have to fit
together into a growing system to make it work without fertilizers
and pesticides.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What are your 8 crops?</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: The 8 crops which we grow are wheat, sunflowers,
buckwheat, millet, rye, barley, lentils, and flax.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: There's a problem, though. I mean, the market isn't
asking for these products. I mean, how can you get this to be
economically viable.</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: Yeah, that's exactly the dilemma. And unless we all
work at this together, you know, in my view, nutritionists need to
get into the act, and help consumers understand that there are some
really good, healthy food that can be produced from things like
millet. And to begin to create a demand for that kind of food. But
that's a long-term process and I realize it's a big problem.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I know you think that this system of agriculture really
can't be market-driven. But as consumers, what can we do to encourage
farmers to rotate and diversify their crops?</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: One of the really hopeful aspects of the food
industry today is what's happening in many communities now, where
farmers and consumers are actually sitting down together and saying
okay, you know, let's, we'd like to have you, Mr. Farmer, produce our
vegetables and our chickens and our eggs for us. And they actually
contract with the farmer. So they learn what the farmer can do and
can't do within that local community, and the farmer learns what the
consumers would really like to have on their tables and makes every
effort to try and produce that. That's still a very, very small part
of the food system in this country, but it's growing very rapidly.
Ten years ago there were only 2 of those kinds of arrangements in
North America; today there are over 500. I think consumers do want
this kind of food, and increasingly as the word gets out that's
possible to do, that will increase.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Fred Kirschenmann is president of Farm Verified Organic,
Incorporated. Thanks for joining us.</P>

<P>KIRSCHENMANN: It's my pleasure.</P>

<P>CURWOOD:  This is Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood. </P>



<P>		 "America's Dairyland"&emdash;  those are the words on  the
license plates of cars from Wisconsin, and with good reason. The
state is the number-one producer of dairy products in the US.  A
million-and-a-half  cows in Wisconsin produce 16 percent of the
country's milk.  </P>



<P>(Sound of milking machine in operation)</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  Dairying is one of Wisconsin's biggest  businesses.  But
it's also got big problems.  High operating costs and low milk prices
are driving thousands of farmers out of business.  Row cropping to
grow feed for cows is leading to serious soil erosion.  And runoff
from farms, particularly from  manure and farm chemicals,  is
contaminating local water supplies.  In fact,  nutrient and pesticide
runoff from farms is one of the biggest sources of water pollution in
the country.  But here in Wisconsin there's also hope for solving
these problems &emdash;hope embodied in a new approach to dairy
farming that combines modern science and technology with
old-fashioned grazing.  It's called "rotational grazing,"  and it's
bringing new life to some old dairy farms.  </P>



<P>(Sound of wind through grass)</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  You can see a bright blue wedge of Lake Michigan from
the Saxon Homestead Farm in Cleveland, Wisconsin.   The wind from the
lake whips around the top of a ridge, and from here you can also see
most of the farm &emdash; a  rambling  assortment of sheds,  a
massive wooden barn, several silos &emdash; one of them stone,  and
towering new ones of steel and blue enamel,  and stretching to the
furthest corners, luxuriant  fields in many shades of green.   650
acres support 155 cows, and the cows produce more than 1,000 gallons
of milk a day.  This dairy farm is run by  the Klessig and Heimerl
families, led by Ed Klessig.  In the 1850's, Ed's great-grandfather
came over to this country from German Saxony to buy 160 acres of
forest to clear into a farm.   </P>



<P>KLESSIG:  This is my great-grandfather and my great grandmother. 
He died in 1900 and he had six sons.  And three of them had moved
west to Minnesota and Dakotas and homesteaded land there.  And this
is my grandfather, Otto, about 1871 that was taken.  Isn't that
something?  By golly. They were big, strong men. (Fade under) </P>



<P>CURWOOD:     In the early years of the farm, these men and their
families produced wheat, like pretty much everyone else in Wisconsin.
 Ed Klessig's great-grandfather grew wheat for the Union Army.  His
son-in-law is Jerry Heimerl.</P>



<P>HEIMERL: My wife has uncovered here just recently where they were
getting $2.50 a bushel of wheat in 1858,  1860,  just at the war time
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: That's the price of wheat today! </P>

<P>HEIMERL: You got that right and they were having yields, two
hundred bushels per acre on this virgin timber soil. No fertilizer
additives, no input cost except  human labor and the extraction. And
this process was very profitable.</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  But before long the soil gave out, so the Saxon Farm
turned its wheatland into pastures, for dairy cows.   Dozens of
Holsteins grazed the fields for decades;  then, shortly after the
Second World War, the Saxon Farm jumped on the trend that was
sweeping farms across the country &emdash;  they pulled their cows
out of the pastures and kept them in barns.  And they converted the
pastures to fields, to grow corn and other row crops, which they fed
to the cows.   Milk production soared.  But the machinery and
chemicals needed to maintain this new kind of farming also cost a lot
more.  And Ed Klessig says he and other farmers have been
increasingly squeezed between high costs and low prices.  </P>



<P>KLESSIG: It's really lousy prices &emdash; low milk prices
&emdash; farmers sell everything wholesale and buy retail, is sort of
a short way of summarizing the plight of farmers today.</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  The Klessig family has had to remortgage the farm again
and again.  Today, Ed's son-in-law Jerry Heimerl fears the numbers
might never add up, that his generation might become the first never
to own outright  the farm and its fine brick homestead.</P>



<P>HEIMERL:  What's interesting is that that house was built on
grass.  That wasn't built on corn.  Edward's father built that just
in 1930, during the Depression. But he built and paid for that in
three years, which is remarkable.  His father bought and paid for the
farm in 1870, I believe it was, again in a three-year period.  But we
get to this fourth and fifth generation,  and we don't think we're
ever finished paying for the farm. One of the things we run into with
the dairy operation is, we need tractors, big horsepower tractors. 
We need a lot of equipment to make the crops and get 'em to the
barns, into the silos, into where the cows are confined.   And to
quote a fellow, his name is Alan Nation, he said, "The last time I
looked, I saw the grass standing still and the cows moving.  Why is
it we're trying to make the cows stand still and move the grass to
them"?   And that really puts it in a nutshell.   </P>

<P> </P>

<P>CURWOOD: That simple question has led the Klessigs and the
Heimerls to join a sort of counter-revolution in dairy farming that's
come to the States via New Zealand.  The method is called  pasturing,
or rotational grazing.  It's letting the cows out of the barns to
graze on grass pastures.  In a way, it's a throwback to ages-old
practices, but with a couple of distinctly modern improvements,
improvements that greatly improve bovine nutrition.  Robert Klessig
manages the grazing on the Saxon Homestead Farm:   </P>



<P>R. KLESSIG:  What we'll do now is we're going open the gate up on
the paddock the heifers are contained in,  and we're going to bring
them onto fresh grass.  It'll probably take us less than two or three
minutes.  Tending these heifers in the barn might take a total of two
hours per day.  (pause) These girls are all waiting </P>

<P>to be moved.  They know we're coming to give them new grass so
they're all standing there at attention  for us.</P>

<P>CURWOOD:  This looks like an ad for Merrill Lynch.  (laughter)
</P>

<P>R. KLESSIG:  What we're going to do is open up this polywire, this
portable fence here, and let them come through here into the new
paddock. </P>



<P>CURWOOD: The lightweight electric fencing is a key to rotational
grazing.  Made in New Zealand, it allows Robert Klessig to quickly
change the size and location of his pastures, depending on the
condition of the grasses  and the size of the herd.  The paddocks run
between two and four acres  and sometimes the cows have to be moved
twice in a single day.  The key is to closely monitor  the growth of
the different grasses and legumes in each field, and move the cows
onto a section just as the forage is hitting its nutritional peak.  
</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  They're pretty good size for youngsters.</P>

<P>R. KLESSIG:  Yeah.  We've found that we're putting an average
daily gain of about two pounds per head per day on these animals. 
And we find that the only input cost that we have is the minerals
that they consume out here and we figure that to be about six cents
per day per animal.  All right.  We'll open the gate.  Why don't we
all stand &emdash; well, everybody just follow me here, ok?  (Robert
calls to the cows;  sound of herd mooing ) There's no chasing
involved.  It's just like the pied piper, follow the leader. Wherever
I go, these animals will go.  Now I'll close the gate and the move is
made.  What we are going to do, though, is we're going to put 'em on
a different paddock from here.  And you'll see how that'll take
place. It's really a low input system that requires very little
labor.  All you really need to have to make milk or meat is animals
and grass.  </P>



<P>CURWOOD: And, perhaps, a little water, which is pumped to each
paddock.  </P>

<P>	</P>

<P>		The Klessigs are gradually converting to rotational grazing,
so some of the herd is still in conventional confinement barns. But
for the areas where they've returned to grazing, gone is the need for
tractors to till the soil and harvest  corn and other feed crops from
these fields,  and the fuel to power all these machines.  Gone in
large part also is the need for chemicals to keep the soil
productive.  Some of the forage in the rotating pastures fixes its
own nitrogen into the soil.  Other nutrients are provided by manure,
spread naturally  by the cows themselves.  And when the cows leave
their waste in the fields, where it's an asset, it's kept out of the
barnyard, where it can be a real problem.  Each Holstein produces 85
pounds of manure a day.  When it piles up, rain can turn it into raw
sewage, flowing into nearby streams and Lake Michigan.  And hauling
it from the barnyard back to the fields uses a lot of equipment and
gasoline.  And, according to Jerry Heimerl's brother-in-law Robert
Klessig, getting the cows out of confined pens and away from piles of
their own manure has other benefits as well.   </P>



<P>R. KLESSIG:  How do your feet feel when you stand on concrete for
12 hours after a hard day of work?  Your joints hurt.  Your knees
hurt. Your ankles hurt.  Now put 1500 pounds on the same surface area
as your two feet, and then tell me how you'd feel.</P>

<P>CURWOOD:  If I had to stand in poop.</P>

<P>KLESSIG:  That's right.   Their feet are always moist with urine
and manure, and consequently, we run into a tremendous amount of hoof
problems, sore joints.  That's probably one of the leading causes of
ending a cow's career on our farm is foot problems, foot and leg
problems.</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  Three years is the average life of a cow on a
conventional, confinement dairy farm.  Under the rotational grazing
system the Klessig and Heimerl families expect  cows to live twice as
long, or more.</P>



<P>(Sound of footsteps in high grass)</P>



<P>CURWOOD :  In a nearby pasture, some other bovines are also
grazing,  a herd of American bison, or buffalo.   </P>

<P> </P>

<P>R. KLESSIG: This is where the buffalo were. Everything is removed,
looks like you went over it with a lawnmower. They were in this
pasture for five days, okay, now I rotated them on another pasture
across the creek over here. This pasture to the east of us here, they
were also on for five days but it's been resting now for ten days,
okay.  You can see how it's re-growing. </P>

<P>CURWOOD:  It's twice as high, and it's completely lush.</P>

<P>R. KLESSIG:  That's right and that's what we're after.  As the
seasons go on and as the years go on, the pastures actually get
better and better and better and better, and we know that on a
productive pasture we can produce more forage than any cultivated
crop, or any alfalfa crop and we never have to worry about it all
dying out or freezing out in the wintertime, it's always there, it's
the multispecies thing &emdash; something might have problems during
the winter but there's going to be 6 or 8 other grasses that are
gonna come through anyway. So I just wanted to point that out for
you. What we can do now is go  take a look at the buffalo. </P>



<P>(Sound of pickup truck, fade under)</P>



<P>CURWOOD:  Even with the lower costs of rotational grazing, the
economics of dairy farming are uncertain.  So the Klessigs and
Heimerls are diversifying their farm.  They're looking to turn some
of their milk into gourmet cheese, from which they hope they can 
make more money, and they've developed a small maple sugaring
operation.  And they're trying their hand at raising  bison  because
their meat  can be much more profitable to family farmers than cow's
milk.  Like the Holsteins, the buffalo, too, seem to thrive by
munching on grass in the open air. </P>



<P>KLESSIG:  Kind of interesting, in a natural environment, a buffalo
will  reproduce up into their 30's and early 40's.  Sounds kind of 
strange for a farmer to hear of an animal that can give you a calf
every year for thirty years.   We're used to shipping them out when
they're three and four. See they don't break down physically like a
dairy cow does.  I don't think we put the demands on them that we do.
They just kinda eat and relax, eat and relax. </P>



<P>CURWOOD:   But it's not just the domesticated animals which seem
to like the Saxon Farm's new approach.  With the turn to rotational
grazing, the cows and buffalo have attracted flies and other insects
to the fields,  and the insects have brought birds.  Lots of birds. 
</P>



<P>R. KLESSIG:  In the morning I'll have 40 or 50 swallows hovering
in and about these animals.  And they'll eat two times their body
weight in insects every day. Here in Wisconsin, we have 26 species of
songbirds that are critically short of habitat.  Primarily nesting
habitat.  With an intense row crop type of farming that most of us
practice, we destroy that habitat. In the 50's and early 60's when we
pulled our cows off of pasture, we began to use a lot of chemicals on
our row crops, which pollutes the soil, the insects that the birds
eat, the plant matter that the birds eat.   And consequently, what
happens is, they have unsuccessful nests and we wonder why we don't
have any songbirds left.  With a rotational grazing system, there's
more wild areas that are allowed to stay wild on a farm operation and
consequently, the bird numbers increase.  And on our grazing
operation, I'm dumbfounded as to the amount of wildlife that I see.  
</P>

<P> </P>

<P>(Sound of footsteps through high grass)</P>



<P>CURWOOD: The birds attracted by the cows and buffalo;  the cows
and buffalo attracted by the grasses in the fields &emdash; it all
comes back down to the soil, and what it's able to provide.  And the
Klessigs and Heimerls look at the soil as an integral part of their
new approach to dairy farming.  Jerry Heimerl says he doesn't want to
repeat the mistakes of his family's ancestors on this farm, whose
profitable wheat operation succumbed to poor land management.    
</P>



<P>HEIMERL: It was a shortlived phenomenon because they took the
nutrients that were there in the soil and they used them up and led
into the dairy operations because they depleted the soils and allowed
the insects and the diseases to come in behind it and ruin that
fabulous money-making scheme. </P>



<P>CURWOOD: By growing grasses instead of row crops, and by letting
the manure drop into the fields, the farm is constantly returning
nutrients to the soil.  And they're rotating the crops that they
still do have to grow to be sure they don't deplete the soil. And
there's always something growing on every inch of land.  Everywhere
you look here on the Saxon Farm, there's row upon row of grasses or
crops, all waving in the wind, a sea of green.   Jerry Heimerl
intends to keep it that way:  no plowed or open land is exposed and
left to erode.  </P>



<P>HEIMERL:   When that rain came last night, we got a half inch in
about 30 minutes, nothing washed down.  It didn't wash in from our
soil.  It didn't wash into Lake Michigan.  It stayed here.  The
topsoil is what produces crops.   And if we lose that it's gone.  We
can lose an inch in a short period of time, but they say it takes
about 10,000 years of active sod to produce an inch of topsoil. </P>

<P>CURWOOD:  Do you think farmers who stick with the conventional way
of running a dairy farm, lots of chemical inputs, can they survive,
both ecologically and economically in the years ahead or are they
doomed?</P>

<P>HEIMERL:  In the short run they're not doomed,  and I don't know
that I would say that in the long run they're doomed.  And in
Wisconsin, we're losing about, if I'm not mistaken, it's one to two
thousand farmers a year, dairy farmers that is, from not having a
profitable operation, mostly.   To start a farm, like a 50-cow
operation, which would be a single-family operation, 200 acres, would
take in this area, and it would take roughly a half million dollars
of land and equipment to start that system.  Which may return $20,000
to $25,000 income, if run well, to that family.  Nobody's, few, few
people want to start farming right now.  But I think, and I sincerely
believe, that grazing is going to show that this is an opportunity
for young farmers to get into a system that's not going to tax their
lifestyle completely and be tied to a cow's tail and all of  the
other things that come with it.  And it'll show 'em, hey, that
agriculture does have some hope.  </P>



<P>CURWOOD:  For Jerry Heimerl and his family, agriculture here in
Wisconsin does have new hope.  Seven years ago, his father-in-law, Ed
Klessig wanted to sell off the herds of cows and give up dairy
farming for good.  But a tearful wife and daughter reminded him that
their souls were invested in this farm.  And how could they sell
what's taken so long to create?  Ed decided to stick with it.  Now,
with the move to rotational grazing, Ed say that family members who
had shown little interest in the farm five years ago are also
deciding to stick around.  Today, they feel they are doing what
farming is all about:  working with nature and the earth positively
instead of just making payments.     Jerry Heimerl thinks that
satisfaction is immense and profound to all the members of the
Klessig family.   </P>



<P>HEIMERL:   We have to go out and manage in a different system and
that management is challenging and that's fun.  That new challenge is
fun.  The other thing is that you get out and you walk your soil. 
You walk your land.  The other day I was down there with Robert.  And
here's a kingfisher.  Boy, I haven't seen a kingfisher in a couple of
years on this farm  and earlier we saw a couple of blue herons. 
These are things that are very important to me.  But we see those
things as very beneficial to our mental attitude towards life, our
psychological well-being, I think.   </P>



<P>(Sound of birds calling)</P>

<P> </P>

<P>CURWOOD:  For Jerry Heimerl, it's the soil, the wildlife, the
challenge of making the farm work that keeps him here.  For his
father-in-law,  it's insuring that the farm survives for the coming
generations.  Ed Klessig has a glimmer in his eyes as he talks about
having his grown children back home, farming the land, raising what
he hopes will be the sixth generation to take over the Saxon
Homestead Farm he's fighting so hard to preserve and to protect. 
</P>



<P>KLESSIG:  That land, all this land that's lost, isn't just our
land, it's everybody's land and to lose, needlessly lose good farm
land, which is probably the world's most valuable resource, we'll
realize that as food becomes scarcer and the population continues to
explode. Yah, it is.  Farmlands are the most valuable resource the
world has and we treat it like dirt, that's the tragedy, yah. </P>

<H2>Brothers. . .  But Not Siblings In Growing Style</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living on Earth, I'm Steve Curwood. </P>



<P>		Out in the Great Central Valley of California, there are two
brothers who farm side by side in the tiny town of Hilmar, growing
almonds.  One brother cultivates his nuts the way most almond farmers
do, with synthetic chemical fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides and
herbicides.  Just across the road his brother farms organically,
without chemicals.  And as you can imagine, there have been spirited
debates. A few years ago, a researcher at the University of
California at Davis found out about this sibling rivalry, and now the
results of a five year study of the two farms are in.  Matt Binder
has our story.</P>



<P>BINDER:  This is Glenn Anderson, using a long fiberglass pole to
harvest almonds in his 20-acre organic orchard.  Anderson is a
vigorous 59-year old native of this area, but he's also explored the
world, spending 15 years in Hawaii and Samoa.  In 1980, he and his
family returned to the farm his grandparents started 70 years ago. 
Anderson is proud of what he's accomplished as the area's first
organic almond grower.  He says the farm is a safer place to live
now, and the land itself has been improved for posterity.</P>



<P>GLENN: The soil is nothing like it was when I first moved here:
the color, the texture, the biology. Everything about it is different
today than it was 13 years ago.  There weren't earthworms on this
farm when I moved here, now they're abundant.  As soon as I irrigate
this it will be instant earthworms throughout this orchard when I put
on my final irrigation.</P>



<P>BINDER:  Just across the road from Glenn Anderson's farm is a much
larger, 95-acre almond orchard run by his older brother, Ron.  Ron
Anderson has never wanted to live anywhere else.  The only time he
left the Hilmar area for more than a vacation was when he was in the
military in World War Two.  Ron is big, strong, and wears bib
overalls.  He farms using conventional chemical methods.</P>



<P>RON: I see no reason for going organic. I know that our finished
product is just as healthy as anything you can buy in a health food
store.</P>



<P>BINDER:  Despite their inevitable disagreements, Ron and Glenn
seem to enjoy getting together to debate farming methods.</P>



<P>GLENN:  This isn't just a business, this is a biological system
that I'm working with and I'm producing food that goes into other
people's bodies, and we want it to be of the highest quality, we want
the earth to be preserved, we want the biology of these farms to be
very diverse and complex and as balanced as possible.</P>

<P>RON:  We're not creating a habitat just for earthworms; it's just
a coincidence that they're there.</P>

<P>GLENN:  The agribusiness mindset that we were all taught at the
university has pretty much impermeated [sic] agriculture in the
United States.</P>

<P>RON:  He's always been something of a rebel.  He's always been
trying to preserve the world, you know. Like he went into the moped
business in Hawaii because he was gonna save the world from all this
exhaust fumes.</P>



<P>BINDER:  They often come here to debate, to a sort of family
battle field: a 20-acre plot of almonds owned by their sister,
Shirley, but farmed by Ron.  Three years ago Shirley decided she
wanted to try organic farming, and Ron, the traditional farmer,
agreed to stop spraying her portion of the orchard, as an experiment.
 But the transition to organic farming on Shirley's land hasn't been
a success.  This spring many of the almond flower buds were killed by
fungi, the remaining nuts are small, and the orchard floor is covered
with pigweed, which, Ron says, continually clogs up the harvesting
machine.</P>



<P>RON: My sister inherited this when my mother passed away, so she's
been listening to this goofy brother of mine, and has been convinced
that she wants to go organic.  So we can't use any Roundup or
Paraquat or any of the commercial herbicides that I can on the rest
of my fields.  It makes it a nuisance to prepare the orchard floor
for harvest.</P>

<P>GLENN:  I used to have pigweed like you wouldn't believe, and I
harvested through the stuff.  So what happens over time is that these
weed species will change &emdash; guaranteed!</P>



<P>BINDER:  Glenn says he eliminated pigweed in his orchard through
cover cropping, and a carefully controlled system of mowing and
mulching.  He says there's an organic way around every problem and
every pest in an almond orchard, and the University of California
study seems to bear that out.  The author of the study, Lonnie
Hendricks, walked through Glenn Anderson's orchard, showing me all
the different species of spiders and beneficial insects that live
there, and prey on almond pests</P>



<P>HENDRICKS:  What we're seeing here, Matt, that's different is in
Glenn's orchard, he has really encouraged his cover crop, he plants a
vetch cover crop, and along with good sanitation and proper
management of the cover crop he has been able to encourage enough
beneficials that his pest problems are really quite minimal, and
equal to conventional culture.</P>



<P>BINDER:  Hendricks' study showed that nut production and quality
were essentially the same in Ron and Glenn's orchards, with the cost
of production also virtually even.  The extra labor costs in Glenn's
organic orchard were about equal to the extra chemical costs in
Ron's.  With the price of organic nuts 25 percent higher than regular
almonds, Glenn Anderson is actually making a higher profit than Ron,
per acre of trees.</P>



<P>	Back across the road, the Hendricks study has convinced even
Ron Anderson to try out some of his brother's methods, but Ron is
still holding fast to the chemical option.  And Ron is passing on his
way of farming and his place in the family debate to his son, Arnie,
who will take over management of his father's orchards when Ron
retires later this year.</P>



<P>ARNIE ANDERSON:  It can be risky to farm organically, because
nature has its ways of taking its course.  And if man goes ahead and
takes his course, he can get a consistent crop every year.</P>

<P>GLENN:  I think that remains to be seen, just how that's going to
work out.  We're still a little bit young with organic.  I think over
the long pull, if everything works out as we expect that it will,
with building your soil year to year, that the organic system should
eventually buffer itself and perhaps more sustainable than a chemical
system.</P>



<P>BINDER:  So the debate goes on in the Anderson family, into
another generation now.  Lonnie Hendricks' study suggests that the
differences between conventional and organic almond growing have
begun to narrow, and the Andersons may soon have less and less to
argue about.  For Living on Earth, I'm Matt Binder in Hilmar,
California.</P>

<H2>Taking Care Of The Land. . .  The Old Way</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living On Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. It's easy to
see the Amish as oddities. Dressed in plain clothes, shunning modern
conveniences, and riding in horse-drawn buggies. But from their
perspective, it's the English, the non-Amish, who are the oddities,
pursuing what the Amish see as disrespectful use of land and natural
resources. Self-sufficiency on their land became crucial when the
Amish fled to the countryside to avoid religious persecution in 16th
century Switzerland, and the Amish brought this discipline with them
to the tolerant colony of Pennsylvania in the 1700s. Today, about
140,000 Amish live in tightly-knit communities in 22 states. And
their strong tradition of stewardship has been handed down through
the generations. To the Amish, the land is more than a source of
food. It's part of God's creation, which they are called to tend and
preserve. David Kline's family tends to 175 acres of creation in
central Ohio. Reporter John Gregory recently visited the Kline farm
to explore the unique Amish bond with the land. He found that while
Kline's Amish community rejects some modern inventions, their view of
technology is complex and sophisticated. And they adopt new tools
only on their own terms.</P>

<P>(Sound of walking among tall grasses and dried husks)</P>

<P>GREGORY: On a cold fall afternoon, Amish farmer David Kline wades
through his corn field, pushing aside the 7-foot stalks to clear a
path. In the middle of the patch, Kline stops, kneels down, and grabs
a handful of dirt.</P>

<P>KLINE: Smell that. Doesn't that smell earthy and rich?</P>

<P>GREGORY: Kline rolls the dirt through his thick, weathered hands
and lets it trickle to the ground. At 49, his hair is brown with
threads of gray and it wraps around the bald spot on his head and
across the line of his lower jaw in the traditional Amish beard.
Looking out on the modest white frame house where he was born and now
lives with his wife and 5 children, Kline strokes his beard and
explains the intricacies of Amish agriculture.</P>

<P>KLINE: We farm as America would have farmed 40, 50 years ago, you
know, the smaller farms. The diversity in livestock. And we have
maintained that largely because we stuck with the horse.</P>

<P>GREGORY: Kline's 120-acre farm has been in his family since 1918.
He works 70 acres of this gently rolling Ohio land using only draft
horses to plow, plant, and harvest. To bale hay, spread manure, and
gather wood.</P>

<P>KLINE: It would happen in church that the bishop would point to
the Scripture and say, okay, this is exactly the reason why we don't
farm with tractors, because the Bible says thou shalt not use a
motor-driven instrument in the field. (Laughs) No, no it's not at
all. I would think it's horse farming, this goes so well with family
life.</P>

<P>GREGORY: Kline says using horses keeps farms to a scale that a
family can manage. And besides, they don't compact the soil like
tractors do. They're much cheaper to operate. And they create their
own fertilizer. Another staple of Amish agriculture is crop rotation:
planting fields in clover or alfalfa, then corn, then oats, and
finally wheat in a continuous 4-year cycle. This, says Kline,
maintains soil fertility and saves money on chemical pesticides and
fertilizers.</P>

<P>KLINE: So often, the agricultural colleges look at Amish farmers
as oh &emdash; oh, they say, that way of farming. We left that 30, 40
years ago; we don't want to go back. That's a false impression
because we &emdash; even though we farm with horses, we still have
modern technology right at our fingertips. You know, we can use
modern technology; we just try to limit it.</P>

<P>GREGORY: In fact, groups of Amish are sometimes defined by the
technology they use. The most conservative Amish use no tractors,
indoor plumbing, or electricity, while more liberal groups, of which
Kline is a member, may have plumbing or use electric generators and
tractors for some activities.</P>

<P>(Tractor engine)</P>

<P>GREGORY: Kline uses a big green John Deere tractor to help grind
corn in his barn. He also employs a small Honda generator to charge
the batteries that power his electric fence, and to drive the
machinery that helps him milk his 30 dairy cows.</P>

<P>(Milking pumps)</P>

<P>GREGORY: You name your cows?</P>

<P>KLINE: Mm hmm. The first one is Glow, and then Petunia. Doris.
Joy. Ethel...</P>

<P>GREGORY: Although this selective use of technology seems random,
even eccentric, to some outsiders, it's based on the Amish belief
that machines should make work easier and not disrupt family life or
tempt one to expand the size of one's farm. By not using expensive
machinery, the Amish rely more on family and neighbors to help with
farm chores, like baling hay and threshing wheat.</P>

<P>KLINE: It's a &emdash; and of course, to love they neighbor as
thyself. You know, if you love your neighbor you don't want his land.
Because then you wouldn't have a neighbor.</P>

<P>GREGORY: And contrary to popular belief, small farms still can be
financially viable. Kline recounts the story of one local Amish
couple who paid off a $100,000 farm in 6 years. On his own farm,
Kline says his milk revenues, along with some grain and vegetable
sales, supports his family.</P>

<P>KLINE: One might have a gross sale of $60,000 on the farm, and
half of that is probably net. It's not, doesn't compare with Lee
Iacocca, but you know, it's a good life. Or with these baseball
players. (Laughs) But I have fewer worries, I'm sure. See, I'll never
have to go on strike, and I'll never be out of work. And we'll always
have food to eat.</P>

<P>(Traffic sounds)</P>

<P>GREGORY: Mount Hope, Ohio, is a thriving community of about 300
people, mostly Amish. It looks like many small towns with its
hardware store, bank, grocery, and other businesses. But you're as
likely to see an Amish horse and buggy drive down the main street as
you are a car.</P>

<P>(Horse and buggy on the road)</P>

<P>GREGORY: This is where David Kline's family comes to shop, catch
up on the local news, and occasionally enjoy a cone of chocolate
frozen yogurt. Kline explains that the stability of Mount Hope and
other small Amish towns reflects the dedication of the Amish to their
communities and the quality of their land.</P>

<P>KLINE: Our community is only as good as its soil. If the soil is
good and people are working that soil and then you'll have services.
You'll have the fire department, you'll have hospitals, you'll have
doctors. You'll have all the professions. Because after all, it all
comes from that surrounding soil. If the soil is no good, or if the
soil is poor, then it doesn't support people on the land and there
won't be people there that will require those services.</P>

<P>GREGORY: Kline says that Amish farmers struggle with the same
problems that all small farmers face these days. Low market prices,
high land costs, and a trend towards factory farming operations that
make farmers more dependent on distant corporations than on local
communities. To supplement their incomes, Kline says some local Amish
families will begin growing vegetables for produce wholesalers next
year, while others may get jobs at the small wood and metal working
shops in the area.</P>

<P>KLINE: The Amish have always been an agrarian people, and that's
why I worry. We have only, like, 37% of our people are living on
farms in this community. And as the shift is away from agriculture, I
think we'll have to sacrifice so much.</P>

<P>(Door sliding on hinges, water being poured)</P>

<P>GREGORY: At the end of the day, after the cows are milked and the
hogs are watered, Kline retreats to an old log cabin he rebuilt next
to his house. The cabin is a place where Kline reads and works on his
nature column for the local newspaper. Here again, the ironies of
Amish life are present. In the glow of a gas lamp, Kline writes with
a small word processor powered by a modified car battery. Resting on
an old couch, he reflects on his younger days when he almost left the
community. But now, Kline says he accepts the traditions that bind
him to the Amish culture because of the satisfactions of living a
Christian life that is ecologically sound.</P>

<P>KLINE: Then you know, when we say our evening prayers, it always
comes across thankful for this free country we live in and thankful
for the good land we have to work with. This land has been good to
us, that it supports us, and that we care for it and we'll support
future generations. Just from the soil on this farm.</P>

<P>GREGORY: Amish farmer David Kline lives with his family near Mount
Hope, Ohio. For Living On Earth, I'm John Gregory.</P>

<H2>Community Supported Agriculture: Saving The Family Farm</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. The family
farm is an endangered enterprise. Squeezed by agribusiness growers
and ignored by giant supermarket chains, in the 1980s more than
300,000 US farmers were driven off the land. But a few family farms
have found a unique way of making a go of it, by blending the
traditional values of organic and local food production with
unconventional approaches to marketing, and to satisfying the need
for a sense of place in today's alienated society. It's called
community supported agriculture, and it's designed to preserve small
farms while reconnecting them with their local communities and
regional economies. In a community-supported farm, local residents
essentially buy a membership that entitles them to a season's worth
of produce. The farmer foregoes the chance to make a killing in a
great year in exchange for the security of a guaranteed income every
year. Caretaker Farm in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is one of about
500 community-supported farms in North America. Sam and Elizabeth
Smith made the switch 4 years ago, after going it alone as organic
farmers for 20 years. We'll be checking in with them and their farm's
members from time to time over the coming growing season. Right now,
the Smiths have come in from the fields to join us on the line.
Hello.</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: Hello.</P>

<P>SAM SMITH: Greetings, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What do members get when they join your farm?</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: It produces food for them. Beginning on June 1st,
we'll have our first distribution. And it will mostly be greens such
as lettuces and spinach, and the quantity of food then begins to
increase as more things come into production, until by the end of
June and the beginning of July it's strawberries and peas and
&emdash;</P>

<P>SAM SMITH: Broccoli &emdash;</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: Broccoli and beets and carrots. And moves right
on through the summer, through corn, through the squashes, into the
more winter crops. These are things that are stored in the root
cellar and people then help themselves from the root cellar during
the winter months.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And what do people get aside from food?</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: It offers them all the benefits of having a farm
in a community: social, ecological, educational.</P>

<P>SAM SMITH: The most important benefits they get is a sense of
community. A visitor who's returning after 30 years in India, and it
just so happened that her visit was in late June and coincided with a
distribution, so there was around many families here at the farm that
day. And she walked in and she said, later on she said to us, "This
was the first experience that I've had in the whole month of being
back in the United States when I've seen a group of Americans with
smiles on their faces." And she said, "You must be a great
personality or something." And I said, "No, it's not that. It's not
us. It's their being present and part of this farm. There's this
diversity of people coming together."</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Let's talk about what the farmers get from this. Is there
a financial advantage?</P>

<P>SAM SMITH: There's no immediate sort of bonanza. The interesting,
and the powerful, financial aspect of this is for us, is that that
income is secure now. You don't have the constant worry that if we
have a crop failure or something goes wrong, or even if I or
Elizabeth should have an accident and break a leg or something and
we're incapacitated, now the community says we're loyal and we're
going to support this farm, and the community assumes of course that
Sam and Elizabeth and our apprentices will do our best to always
&emdash;</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: I would say that the biggest pleasure for me is
that I don't feel isolated from the community. For many years, we saw
lots of people at our farm stand who were mostly summer people, who
had the time and the leisure to come to our farm and pick up a few
vegetables. But we didn't really see very many people from our
immediate community.</P>

<P>SAM SMITH: I share that same feeling with Elizabeth. Another thing
that comes to my mind, though, I feel liberated. Liberated to do my
work as well as I possibly can. And before that, one felt kind of
bonded to this anonymous market; you had to decide what crops you
were going to grow, not on what was good for the land or what you
liked to do. But what the market demanded. And also, the marketplace
demanded that you put a lot of energy into the whole business of
marketing, which takes up so much energy.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well I'm looking forward to seeing all of this. We're
going to come out for a visit in a few weeks. What have you got
planned for that day?</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: You will be coming to our open house where we
invite members of the community, whether they are members of our farm
or not, to join us in the great potato saga. Everyone plants
potatoes. Children and grandparents and parents and everyone gets
down in the dirt and puts the potatoes in the soil.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well I'm looking forward to seeing you. Sam and Elizabeth
Smith, the proprietors of Caretaker Farm in Williamstown,
Massachusetts. Thanks for spending this time with us.</P>

<P>ELIZABETH SMITH: Thank you.</P>

<P>SAM SMITH: Thank you very much.</P>

<H2>Steve talks with Elizabeth and Sam Smith, of Caretaker Farm</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: In a community-supported farm, members pay up front for a
share of the season's produce and the option to work at and enjoy the
farm. We've been visiting this year with the owners and members of
Caretaker Farm in Williamstown, Massachusetts. Elizabeth and Sam
Smith turned their commercial organic operation into a
community-supported one a few years ago, in an effort to ensure a
steady income and build a closer relationship with their community.
They're with us on the line. Thanks for joining us one last time.
</P>

<P>E. SMITH: Welcome, Steve.</P>

<P>S. SMITH: Greetings.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well tell me, how did it go this year? Did all the crops
come in the way you wanted?</P>

<P>S. SMITH: Yes, Steve. It was one of the best years we've had.
Practically every crop came in, almost as well as you could possibly
wish.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: You've had a hard frost at Caretaker Farm, but of course
you're still eating. What do you still have to distribute to your
members?</P>

<P>E. SMITH: From the gardens, we still have beautiful kale and some
Brussels sprouts still out there. They get better with the frost:
sweeter and even more tender. And then, from the root cellar, from
crops that have already been harvested and have been stored away for
the winter, leeks and parsnips and rutabagas and carrots and potatoes
and onions.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well it sounds pretty good. How long will all this last?
When will your root cellar be &emdash; run on empty?</P>

<P>E. SMITH: Probably, last year we still had potatoes and onions
into March.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now tell me about the money this year, Sam. The crop was
good. How were the finances? You had a budget of about $75,000 as I
recall.</P>

<P>S. SMITH: It was slightly under that. We had a budget of $68,500.
We came in maybe a few thousand dollars below that, and the community
voluntarily will kick in the difference, which will amount to no more
probably than about $5 per adult in the community.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So you have a bit of a shortfall this year. Are you going
to change how you do things next year as a result?</P>

<P>S. SMITH: Yeah. The reason for the slight shortfall was, is that
every member could pledge support in a range, and if it was a 2-adult
household, then the range would have been anywheres from $490 to
$630, with the hope that the average pledge to the farm was about
$585. Next year, we're going to eliminate the range, so we won't have
that kind of a problem.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Do you want to share with us now some of the lessons of
the past year?</P>

<P>E. SMITH: I would like to have more participation from the members
of the community. Perhaps some kind of a work requirement from
everyone. Say, 2 hours a year or something like that. I'd like to see
them get down into the dirt a little bit. Not that we need their help
as much as I think that they would enjoy doing it.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well, listen. Thank you both for taking this time with us
throughout the whole growing season, having Living On Earth come out
to visit you in Williamstown at Caretaker Farm. And the time that you
spent with us on the telephone. Sam and Elizabeth Smith, thank you
both very much.</P>

<P>E. SMITH: Thank you.</P>

<P>S. SMITH: Thank you, Steve. It's been wonderful.</P>

<H2>Organics in Cuba</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. When Cuba was
still a bright star in the orbit of the Soviet Union, the
island-nation was able to get a great price for its sugar from its
vast plantations. And with that sugar money from the Soviet Bloc,
Cuba bought food from abroad along with oil, fertilizer, and
pesticides. But as the Berlin Wall fell, so did the artificial price
for Cuban sugar. And the Castro government was suddenly faced with
having to feed its own population, without enough foreign exchange to
buy food or the petrochemicals needed in modern agriculture. So, in a
bold and desperate experiment, Cuba is trying to feed itself with
organic farming. From Havana, Bruce Gellerman has our story.</P>

<P>(Ocean waves washing up on the beach)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: The shores of Havana are quiet. Gone for now are the
desperate scenes of Cubans casting themselves adrift onto the sea,
hoping their pathetic rafts made of oil drums and inner tubes would
catch the current that would take them to Florida. The refugee crisis
of last summer is over, but the domestic crisis which prompted it is
not. Food is scarce in Cuba; there are shortages of everything, and
everything is rationed.</P>

<P>(Sound of a motorized tram)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Meat is almost never available. On a street in Havana,
a medical doctor asks for money to buy milk for his infant. It's
supposed to be available for children, but a liter costs nearly an
average month's salary. The situation here is sad and bleak.</P>

<P>(Music at a restaurant)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: A band in a Havana restaurant plays "Midnight in
Moscow." Peter Rosset, an agricultural expert from the United States,
says the song is a fitting metaphor for why Cuba is unable to feed
its people. Cuba was heavily dependent upon the East Bloc for food
and agricultural products, and the demise of the Soviet Union 4 years
ago plunged Cuba into a deep food crisis.</P>

<P>ROSSET: Cuba's lost ground. Some estimates say that there's been
as much as a 30% drop in average consumption of food by the
population since the collapse of trade relations.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Since 1990, Cuba has effectively lost 80% of its farm
inputs: pesticides and fertilizers and half the petroleum it had used
for agriculture. Yet Rosset believes urgent necessity has created an
unprecedented opportunity for a new era in food production, with
possibly profound consequences for Cuba, and perhaps the world.</P>

<P>ROSSET: First step forward out of the crisis is finding ways to
produce food without relying on the inputs that were imported in the
past.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Rosset is the director of the California-based
Institute for Food and Development Policy, or Food First. He's a
frequent visitor to Cuba and the author of the book The Greening of
the Revolution: Cuba's Experiment with Organic Farming. He says that
faced with mass starvation and the loss of farm imports, Cuba had no
other choice but to discard the classical model of modern
agriculture, the so-called Green Revolution with its intensive use of
chemicals and machinery, and try a high-risk gamble.</P>

<P>ROSSET: What we have right now in Cuba is the cut-off of the
availability of chemical fertilizers and pesticides for agriculture.
The most widespread conversion, therefore, to alternative agriculture
that we've ever seen in any country in the world &emdash; whoever
would have expected that Fidel Castro would export the organic
farming revolution?</P>

<P>(Harvesting: crops being shorn)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Castro has ordered that all new farm projects in Cuba
follow the alternative agricultural method. No other nation has ever
made such an ambitious effort to replace chemical-intensive
agriculture with low-input sustainable technologies.</P>

<P>(Farmer giving instructions [in Spanish]; sound of plows being
pulled)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: On cooperative farms across the island-nation,
campesinos use teams of oxen to pull single-blade plows through their
fields while Soviet-made tractors sit idly by. To conserve precious
fuel, Fidel Castro has ordered that hundreds of thousands of oxen be
bred to do field work. Using animals instead of tractors is
labor-intensive, back-breaking work, but it has distinct advantages
that were lost when Cuba, and most of the rest of the world, made the
switch to industrial agriculture. Dr. Miguel Altieri is visiting Cuba
from the University of California at Berkeley, where he teaches
alternative agricultural methods. He says besides saving fuel, oxen
don't compact and compress the soil the way heavy machines do. And
after the rainy season the oxen can be used in the field weeks before
tractors can. The animal manure helps fertilize the soil. Altieri
says it's part of an approach he calls agro-ecology.</P>

<P>ALTIERI: The principles of agro-ecology are basically that we need
to develop systems that somehow emulate what nature does. So what we
do is we set up systems of agriculture that are based on principles
like diversification, crop rotations and polycultures, that is mixing
of crops, and integration of animals.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: It sounds a lot like what agriculture was before the
Green Revolution.</P>

<P>ALTIERI: Yeah. Well, actually, agro-ecology is based on the
principles that farmers for thousands of years have used in the Third
World.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization
has brought Altieri and Peter Rosset to Cuba to help the country make
the transition to agro-ecological methods. Rosset says in many ways,
the conversion to organic farming in Cuba means going back to the
future, recovering and building upon much of the wisdom of an earlier
age.</P>

<P>ROSSET: It's only since World War II that chemical fertilizers and
chemical pesticides have come into widespread use. Before that, crops
were produced and pests were controlled with various kinds of
techniques that today we call alternative, but in the past were
actually normal.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Before the Green Revolution and the intensive use of
petroleum-based chemicals, farmers used biological methods to control
insects and plant diseases. They used natural pesticides like soaps
and predatory bugs to control pests, planted different kinds of crops
together to keep down weeds, and carefully monitored their land for
pest infestations. Today, across Cuba, farmers and researchers are
reviving practices like these, but with a very modern twist.</P>

<P>(Voices in the open, clanking metal, birdsong)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Just outside of Havana is a state-of-the-art
biotechnology factory, but it certainly doesn't look it. In a
converted wooden shed, faded posters of revolutionary Che Guevara and
an out of date calendar hang on the walls above steel tables
containing a microscope, a heat sterilizer, and devices to measure
humidity, temperature, and pH. At this rural biotechnology
laboratory, peasant farm workers are growing fungi, bacteria, and
viruses to control crop pests. Over the past 4 years Cuba has engaged
in a crash program to construct and equip more than 200 rural biotech
centers like this one. Dr. Nilda Perez is head of the Department of
Entomology at Havana University, where the workers are trained.</P>

<P>PEREZ: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: Look. Come over here, look. The growing room here has
all the requirements any growing room should have under normal
conditions. The room still has everything needed for production.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Despite the modest surrounding and the paltry
collection of equipment, Peter Rosett calls this one of the most
impressive aspects of Cuba's transition to organic farming.</P>

<P>ROSETT: What's happening is, because pesticides are no longer
available, Cubans are taking what we would consider to be
cutting-edge biological technology or biotechnology, what they call
bio-pesticides, which are microbes that are diseases of insect pests
but are non-toxic for human beings and for the environment. In Cuba
it's being produced in a sort of an artisanal production technique,
on peasant cooperatives, by people who are actually from the area.
</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Most of the technical work here is done by the sons and
daughters of local campesinos, using materials that would ordinarily
be considered waste.</P>

<P>ROSSET: They take the residue from processing rice, the chaff.
They sterilize it in the autoclave. And then they inoculate it with a
small amount of fungal spores, and this fungus is a disease of key
insect pests in the area, but it's not a disease of anything else so
it's non-toxic. They put it in a sealed jar with the sterilized rice
chaff and they leave it for a couple of weeks until the fungus has
grown all over that rice. Then they take it out, they mix it with
water, and they strain it and they get a solution of water with
fungal spores. And they take that and they spray it on the crop, and
those fungal spores make the insect pests sick and make them die
without having to use pesticides.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Again, Dr. Nilda Perez.</P>

<P>PEREZ: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: Among the organisms produced in these centers is the
fungus bioveria basiana , which is utilized in the control of black
insects on plantains and the tetuan weevil that infects sweet
potatoes. And we are also growing bacteria to control the sugar bore.
</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Biological pest controls like these are being used
across Cuba today in place of the chemical pesticides that had to be
imported from the Soviet Bloc.</P>

<P>ROSSET: The most common pesticide that was used in Cuba before was
methyl parathion, which is one of the most acutely toxic pesticides
in the world. Now they can no longer obtain it, because they no
longer have those trade relations. So actually, they've gone from one
of the most toxic, acutely toxic insecticides to a completely
non-toxic alternative biological pesticide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: But there are problems. Dr. Perez says there's a
national shortage of glass jars needed to grow the fungal spores. So
sometimes they have to use metal trays instead. Dr. Perez says the
Achilles Heel of Cuba's biotech revolution is quality control in
production and also in application. Educating campesinos in how to
switch from rapid-acting chemical pesticides to slower-acting
biological ones, she says, can be difficult.</P>

<P>PEREZ: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: If farmers don't keep in mind what they've been told
about the doses, the temperature, or the humidity, there's a risk of
making an ineffective application. If a person sees that it's not
effective, next time he will not apply it. You have to convince the
farmer that this is in reality an effective method that will have
better results than chemical control despite the fact that he won't
see immediate results.</P>

<P>(Water sprinklers)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Among the farms where results are being seen is the
Iberto Leon Cooperative Farm south of Havana. Modeled on the Soviet
system of agriculture, it's typical of the large mechanized
operations found throughout Cuba. And not unlike the industrial farms
you might find in California. Here, scarce gasoline is used only for
things for which there are no substitutes, like irrigation pumps.
</P>

<P>CANTERO: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: There we see a good system for irrigation. It's very
important to irrigate in our climate.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Pedro Luis Cantero is the Co-op's agricultural
engineer. He's responsible for the farm's transition to
agro-ecological practices. The Co-op mass-releases wasps and flies to
kill sweet potato and cassava bugs, and 3 years ago it began using
organic pesticides produced at the local peasant laboratory. Cantero
is especially proud of his plantains. The plantains are now totally
organic: no chemical pesticides or fertilizers are used. Cantero says
the fruit now tastes better, and workers no longer get sick from
working with chemicals.</P>

<P>CANTERO: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: Friends of ours have been affected as a result of
applying chemicals. Our co-workers that are fumigators must have
monthly check-ups because the toxicity can ruin your health. But now
it has been more than 2 or 3 years since we have had such cases. Why?
Because the amount of chemicals has diminished. We have replaced
chemical combat with a biological war.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Instead of chemical herbicides, workers enter crop
plantains with rows of tubers, root crops to control weeds, and plant
legumes that put nitrogen into the soil. The farmers also spray
biofertilizers, mass-produced bacteria, which in the soil make
phosphorus needed by plants. Agro-ecological principles are taking
root here, but Cantero's cooperative farm hasn't completely done away
with conventional inputs. They still use chemicals to control pests
on some sweet potato fields.</P>

<P>(Sound of motors)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: And because this is a large farm, they sometimes use
tractors, but increasingly they are employing oxen to do the work.
Three years ago they had just a few of the animals; now they've got
28 and plan to raise more.</P>

<P>FARMER:... dos.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: So you have an ox instead of a tractor; an animal
instead of a tractor.</P>

<P>FARMER: Si. Si, si.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: If you had your choice &emdash; if you had your choice,
would you rather do farming this way, or the old way, with tractors
and with herbicides and pesticides?</P>

<P>FARMER: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: This is better. The organic method is better because
the technology, that's called modern, conventional technology, is
based upon the high consumption of inputs.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: It's taken several years, but yields on the Iberto Leon
Cooperative, which declined following the cut-off of Soviet aid, have
rebounded. In fact, production is now actually higher than it was
before. Statistics are notoriously unreliable in Cuba, but Peter
Rosset of Food First says higher yields seem to be the experience at
cooperative farms across Cuba. The way he reads the statistics,
conversion is starting to show results.</P>

<P>ROSSET: The principle reason for the food shortages now isn't that
the alternative agriculture system isn't producing as much as before;
actually, they're now producing more food than they produced earlier.
So the incredible thing is that they've been able to withstand an 80%
drop in pesticide and fertilizer imports and a 50% drop in the
availability of petroleum for agriculture, and still maintain
production levels of food crops. So their agricultural conversion
process has actually been fairly successful, but not enough to
compensate for the drop in food imports.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Cuba's organic farming revolution is still in its
infancy, and even with all the technology in place, it can take 3 to
5 years to get yields using organic practices where they were with
conventional methods. Somehow, Cuba has to bridge this gap. It also
has to make up for the substantial portion of its food supply that it
used to import from the East Bloc. And as the summer's refugee crisis
made abundantly clear, Cubans are getting impatient. But, says Peter
Rosset, 35 years of social revolution have put Cuba in a better
position than most developing countries to speed up the transition.
</P>

<P>ROSSET: The advantage that Cuba has is that they're trying to
implement knowledge-intensive technologies to replace the
capital-intensive technologies they no longer have in order to
shorten that time period. They can do that because while Cuba alone
only has 2% of the population of Latin America, has 11% of the
scientists of Latin America. So they have tremendous human resources
that were developed by the social investment of the Revolution. All
of these minds are being put to work right now, trying to develop as
quickly as possible different kinds of organic farming technologies.
</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: But this is only a partial solution. Cuba won't survive
its food crisis if its agricultural revolution is limited to
technology alone. And Cubans all the way up to Fidel Castro himself
know it. What's needed is a whole new way of thinking about farming,
about the island's economy, about the organization of Cuban society
itself.</P>

<P>(Voices echoing in a room)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: The training school at the National Association of
Small Farmers is part of the effort to transform Cuban society.
Cubans come here for month-long courses in farm administration taught
by fellow Cubans and visitors like Peter Rosset. And to learn the
latest advances in agricultural production. Jose Nance is the
school's director.</P>

<P>NANCE: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: One of the functions of the school here is to train
people who are just starting out in agriculture. In Cuba, just like
everywhere else in the world, we have had this exodus of people from
the countryside to the city. But now we have incentives to encourage
people to return to the countryside and enter agricultural
production. And so an important function of this school is to provide
them with training.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: The incentives for Cubans to return to the farm include
patriotic persuasion as well as an appeal to more selfish interests.
Those who move to the countryside are promised higher wages, more
time off, better housing and food, and a more democratic work place.
Organic farming requires that campesinos have more independence and
autonomy in the daily running of the farm. So Cuban agriculture is
moving away from the Communist top-down management style to one that
requires greater participation. And the incentives are beginning to
work their way into fundamental economic policy. Partly to support
the new approach and spur production, the Cuban government is now
letting farmers on state farms and cooperatives sell some of their
crops on the open market and keep the profits, with prices set by
supply and demand. But even in a country which appears eager for
change, there is resistance to this agricultural revolution.
Agro-ecologist Miguel Altieri says it can be tough to get people to
think about things differently.</P>

<P>ALTIERI: Basically, what we're talking about is replacing one kind
of mentality for another. The agro-ecological mentality requires a
fundamental review of the way we look at nature and we look at our
agriculture. But I think that there's &emdash; I would say about 50%
of the researchers and professors are already ready to make the
change, and another 50% are not. So it's kind of a mixed bag at this
point.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: The Castro government says the switch to organic
agriculture is permanent, not merely a strategy for getting through
the so-called special period. Still, there's an ongoing debate over
whether the nation should return to conventional farming after the
special period ends, and conventional inputs are available again.
Robert Garcia Trujillo, President of the Cuban Association of Organic
Farming.</P>

<P>TRUJILLO: (Speaks in Spanish)</P>

<P>TRANSLATOR: Right now we still can't say that should a whole bunch
of inputs suddenly show up tomorrow that people wouldn't want to use
them. So we have to explain to people that even if foreign exchange
should suddenly appear, it would be much better used for other
things. Because here in Cuba, we can meet our agricultural needs
without having to rely on foreign inputs.</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: For much of its history, Cuba has not been in control
of its own destiny. And today the fate of its national experiment
with organic agriculture is at least partly in the hands of the
United States. There's pressure in the US to bear down on the
weakened Castro and force him from power, and on the other hand
there's pressure to lift the trade embargo as an inducement to
change. Some activists think that whatever the course the US pursues
in regard to Cuba's Communist Revolution, it would be a mistake to
undermine its new agricultural revolution. For 3 decades the US has
isolated Cuba and refused to talk to Castro. Peter Rosset believes
now may be the time to listen and to learn.</P>

<P>ROSSET: We have exactly the same problems in the United States. In
the US we're suffering the declining productivity of modern
agriculture. We now use 3 times as much fertilizer, in many cases to
obtain the same yield increase that we got with a third as much 30
years ago. We now use 5 or 10 times as much pesticide to control
pests at the same level that 1 or 2 applications achieved 30 years
ago. In other words, all of these techniques, all of these modern
agricultural techniques are gradually losing their effectiveness.
Fertilizers don't work as well as soils are compacted and organic
matter is lost. Pesticides don't work as well as pests become
resistant to them. So all of us are searching for alternatives.
What's interesting is that Cuba is the only case in the world right
now where this is taking place on a wide scale. The special period,
or the economic crisis in Cuba has forced them to make changes now
that the rest of us will eventually have to make anyway. So this is
our opportunity to see what this kind of change would be like before
we have to do it ourselves: what will work, what won't work. What
solutions may come up along the way.</P>

<P>(Water washing on-shore)</P>

<P>GELLERMAN: Hungry Cubans are no longer casting themselves into the
sea. Political discussions have put an end to that. But the long-term
solution to Cuba's food crisis likely depends on the success of its
national experiment in organic farming. And if the United States
should end its embargo of Cuba one day, we might want to consider
ways to preserve the benefits of its agricultural revolution. For
Cuba's well-being, and ours. For Living on Earth, this is Bruce
Gellerman.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: It's Living on Earth. I'm Jan Nunley. When gray wolves
were transplanted to Yellowstone National Park in the central Idaho
wilderness during the past 2 winters, most Americans supported the
program. But surveys also showed that many ranchers and hunters,
especially in Idaho, opposed bringing back wolves. Now a small but
significant change is taking place. Some of those most vehemently
opposed to the reintroduction are finding that wolves bring some
unexpected benefits to the region. From member station KBSU in Boise,
Jyl Hoyt explains.</P>

<P>(Flowing water)</P>

<P>HOYT: An icy creek threads across a mountain meadow full of
thigh-high grasses that wave in the afternoon breeze. Lush meadows
like this one lace Idaho's Frank Church River of no return wilderness
where outfitter Travis Bullock has spent much of his 27 years.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: Probably one of my number one loves is to be back here in
this wilderness area, and I love it to death.</P>

<P>(A horse snorts)</P>

<P>HOYT: Every fall Mr. Bullock guides hunters looking for elk and
bighorn sheep through the pine forests that border these meadows.
Now, for the first time, this swarthy outfitter with a handlebar
mustache is leading tourists who hope to spot some of the 35 gray
wolves the US Fish and Wildlife Service transplanted here. It's a big
change for him. He used to be a vocal opponent of wolf
reintroduction. As he saddles his horse, Travis Bullock admits
watching wolves doesn't exactly fit his character.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: I'm a redneck, and I'm proud of it. I got a lot of
friends that tease me about that, and that's just fine. I consider
myself a cowboy sometimes. But at the same time I also consider
myself a public person, a public servant, and I really enjoy doing
that.</P>

<P>(To tourists: "Heads up. Let's go." The horse snorts.)</P>

<P>CONNINGTON: My name's Mike Connington and I'm from Bergenfield,
New Jersey, which is about 10 miles outside New York City. I sponsor
wolves and that's why I'm out here today.</P>

<P>ZIMMERMAN: My name is Margaret Zimmerman. I think a lot of people
on the East Coast have the same feeling that Mike and I do. That it's
important to conserve and to protect our environment, and part of
that is bringing the wolf back.</P>

<P>(The horse snorts)</P>

<P>HOYT: Ms. Zimmerman and Mr. Connington are among 8 people that
Travis Bullock has outfitted on mules and horses for this 5-day trip.
He has a lot more trips planned.</P>

<P>(The horse snorts)</P>

<P>HOYT: The trips came about because of an encounter with his former
nemesis, Suzanne Laverty of the Boise-based Wolf Education and
Research Center. Ms. Laverty suggested to the outfitter that if he
were smart he'd capitalize on the wolf's popularity. Despite their
different feelings about wolves the 2 now work together leading
trips.</P>

<P>(A woman laughs)</P>

<P>LAVERTY: I guess I, I kinda like him. [Laughs]</P>

<P>BULLOCK: Half of Suzanne's body is covered in hair, she likes
wolves so much.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: [Laughs] Shut up, Travis. [Laughs]</P>

<P>BULLOCK: I think she's half wolf herself.</P>

<P>(A crackling fire)</P>

<P>HOYT: As they chow down huge steaks and Idaho spuds in front of
the campfire, the 2 laugh together like old friends. It wasn't always
this way, says Suzanne Laverty, opening her journal.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: And somewhere in here, Travis Bullock. The word butthead
I know was around here somewhere, because I remember sitting here
thinking golly, he was so stubborn. Last summer when I was at the
Western Idaho Fair, he came into the booth and he -- [pitches voice
to tenor] I like wildlife but I think this wolf project is just for
the birds. No, it shouldn't be happening in my state. [Voice back to
normal] You know, it's like, well, why?</P>

<P>HOYT: Mr. Bullock worried wolves would eat too many bighorn sheep
and other wildlife, which could hurt his outfitting business. But Ms.
Laverty convinced him that there was something in it for him.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: Business money. And I should -- I shouldn't sound so
selfish in that way. I wanted to get into this.</P>

<P>HOYT: Mr. Bullock hopes that guiding tourists who are anxious to
see and hear wolves will eventually generate half his income.</P>

<P>(Campfire. Fade to radio being tuned over static)</P>

<P>HOYT: The next day, along a ridge, Ms. Laverty scans various
frequencies on telemetry equipment, trying to locate wolves that were
fitted with radio collars during their reintroduction. She needs to
count exactly how many new pups were born this year.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Maybe 8 litters in the entire state of Idaho in one year.
The reintroduction's been very successful.</P>

<P>HOYT: But it still faces a lot of local opposition. Ms. Laverty
was shot at once. Her organization still gets lots of hate mail. Mr.
Bullock expects to get some grief, too.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: Yeah, when I first started I was afraid that I would take
some flack, and there's a good chance I still will. There's still a
lot of sentiment against wolves in Idaho.</P>

<P>(Paper being unfolded)</P>

<P>HOYT: By the third day the group has seen herds of elk and deer as
well as moose and bear. But still no wolves.</P>

<P>(Unfolding continues)</P>

<P>HOYT: Travis Bullock unfolds a map and plans the next day's ride.
</P>

<P>BULLOCK: We'll come up here and come to the west.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Okay.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: Up one of these 2 drainages.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Okay. Right there will be a great spot to do some
tracking. Awesome.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: It's gonna be fun.</P>

<P>(Laverty laughs)</P>

<P>HOYT: After a few days in the wilderness tracking wolves, Mr.
Bullock is starting to see more than dollar signs.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Yeah. More than one. Yeah, there's more than one down
there.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: You serious?</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Yeah. Yeah.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: This is cool.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: This is cool. [Laughs] Let's go.</P>

<P>HOYT: On the fourth day, the group finally hears wolves howling in
the distance. Too far away for a microphone to pick up. Suzanne
Laverty wears a big grin.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Sounds like we got some high ones and some low ones
together, so adults and maybe pups with them. Yeah, I think we're
onto something today.</P>

<P>(Footfalls)</P>

<P>HOYT: The group heads down the ridge, trying to get closer to the
wolf pack. Teacher Denise DeClaire talks excitedly about how she'll
share her experience with her sixth grade class in Gainesville,
Florida.</P>

<P>DeCLAIRE: Margaret and Mike and myself are indicative of people on
the East Coast who feel the lure of going to Montana or Wyoming or
Idaho, you know, we dream about it like some westward movement.</P>

<P>HOYT: Ms. DeClaire is not alone. Tourism is Idaho's third largest
economy. Two recent studies found wolf tourism could bring up to $20
million a year to the region.</P>

<P>(Campfire)</P>

<P>HOYT: Back at camp, Suzanne Laverty sits quietly on the meadow's
edge, thinking about the role her new friend, Travis Bullock, plays
in the changing American west.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: What Travis is doing is answering the question that's
been really hard to answer to rural citizens who have been opposed to
having wolves come back. And that is, what good are wolves? Travis
can answer now, they're helping me make a living. And that's
something that the people he lives with can relate to. And all of a
sudden they have a way of actually valuing wolves, which will help
the wolves survive in the long run.</P>

<P>(Campfire. Fade to wolf howls -- by humans)</P>

<P>HOYT: Throughout the trip the group has imitated wolves howling,
hoping the predators will respond.</P>

<P>(Howls continue)</P>

<P>HOYT: At the last campfire, Travis Bullock, for the first time,
joins in. After 5 days in the wild his conversion may be nearly
complete.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Travis, we've never heard you howl so low before.</P>

<P>BULLOCK: Sorry.</P>

<P>LAVERTY: Come on. Come on, this is the time.</P>

<P>(The group urges him on)</P>

<P>BULLOCK: All I do is one pitch because I'm afraid I'm going to
throw a vocal cord out if I do anything else.</P>

<P>(Human howling continues)</P>

<H2>Still Hoping To Find The Ivory Billed Woodpecker</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of August 23, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: For most ornithologists the book is closed on the
ivory-billed woodpecker. The last of North America's largest
woodpeckers are thought to have disappeared from the United States
and Cuba during the 1980s, and this year the conservation group The
Nature Conservancy declared the bird extinct. But the ivory bill
specter haunts hundreds of professional and amateur bird watchers.
They refuse to give up hope that an isolated population of the
pterodactyl-like birds with 3-foot wing spans might be hanging onto
life deep in some Southern swamp. Driven by her own fascination with
the woodpecker, producer Brenda Tremblay traveled to Mississippi's
Delta National Forest to search for the ivory bill, and to explore
the culture of those who've made it their holy grail.</P>

<P>(Water trickling. Cellos and double basses play, then a bird
call.)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: I hardly know where to begin this story, a story that's
part fable, part science lesson, and part obsession. I suppose it
began when I first saw a picture of a bird in a book. The picture got
into my head. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I even dreamed about
it. Months went by and I was still fixed by its image. Finally, I
decided to drive to Mississippi to look for it.</P>

<P>ALEXANDER: Pelicans. Were there any pelicans in Mississippi?</P>

<P>HEYEN: I cannot find my daily bread for sale in this beribboned
mall thronged with the polymer sound of generic birds on plastic
limbs in plastic trees. I need to fathom what I'll need to buy.</P>

<P>JAMES: Like all other groups of birds that are endangered and
becoming extinct, it's always the largest one that's most endangered
like the whooping crane, the largest crane; the trumpeter swan, the
largest swan the ivory-billed woodpecker, the largest woodpecker.
</P>

<P>BUDNEY: The ivory billed woodpecker was probably not a bird that
was following such a narrow path that it was doomed to extinction. In
all likelihood it has to do with human manipulation of the habitat.
</P>

<P>TURCOTT: Well, you know what the Holy Grail is, don't you? It's
when you go out seeking something that's maybe not possible or not
there, but you still go out to see if it's possible (laughs).</P>

<P>(Music continues, followed by the whoosh of traffic)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Highway 82 passes by the fast food joints, cheap motels,
and corrugated metal buildings of Greenville, Mississippi, and
through the fertile cotton and soybean fields of the Mississippi
Delta. It's another 20 miles to the Delta National Forest. Here I met
Jerry Jackson, a professor of biological sciences at Mississippi
State University. For years, Jackson has been searching the
southeastern United States for what he and others call the Lord God
bird.</P>

<P>JACKSON: And it's the Lord God bird I'm sure, because when people
would see the woodpecker they would say, "Lord God, what a
woodpecker!" And it's referring to its size; it's an incredibly large
bird. It's a woodpecker with a 3-foot wingspan, the size of a crow or
slightly larger.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: The ivory-billed woodpecker is, or perhaps was, a
magnificent bird. But not in the same way that a large hawk or eagle
is magnificent. The ivory bill has a prehistoric aspect. It's
pterodactyl shaped, otherworldly, with a stark color combination of
red, black and white and light colored eyes. It is an unforgettable
image that keeps people searching despite the odds.</P>

<P>JACKSON: There are some real fanatics out there that are really
so, so anxious to find an ivory-billed woodpecker. There is a young
doctor who is now stationed in Hawaii who came to my office and spent
some time with me, who has all of the literature on ivory-billed
woodpeckers, who knows everything there is to know about them, and
who's continually looking for them. There's a lawyer in Texas who put
up a bounty of $1,000 and plastered placards advertising his
willingness to pay $1,000 for evidence that there are ivory-billed
woodpeckers. There are people out there who are very serious in their
intent to find ivory bills and who are very serious when they say
that they think that they exist.</P>

<P>ALEXANDER: Okay, let's start the tally. Now what I'm going to do,
I'm going to call out the species, and if the people in Mississippi
saw the bird, I'm going to write it down. If we have some birds that
were seen in Arkansas and not in Mississippi I would like to put an
asterisk by the species.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: The Mississippi Ornithological Society meets every few
months to look for birds and commune over catfish dinner. The
ivory-billed woodpecker was crossed off their lists a long time ago,
but there are some old timers in the group who remember the days of
rare sightings, and still tell stories of tantalizing encounters.
Bill Turcott used to work for the Fish and Wildlife Service.</P>

<P>(A room full of people talking)</P>

<P>TURCOTT: The place was teeming with woodpeckers, a lot of
pileateds in there. Of course we never saw anything we considered an
ivory bill. But on the last day of the second trip that we made up
there, I pulled out off of this road that borders the lower part of
the bluff, at a little overlook, overlooking the swamp out there, and
I got out and played the ivory bill tape one more time. Well I was
sitting there, you know, with my feet on the ground and the car door
open, and Al was up behind me up here, and I swear I heard twice the
ivory bill call. Twice, just as plain as day. Then I stood up and
looked back and hear this barn owl that I called out of this big
cottonwood there on the bluff, and across there were 3 bluejays
behind it. A bluejay can imitate just about anything he wants to
imitate, and I heard what I consider to be bluejays making that call,
because there was no possibility for an ivory bill on the other side.
Because at the top of the bluff it was open pasture.</P>

<P>(A man's intro: "Ivory-billed woodpecker, Cornell catalogue, cut
one." The ivory-billed woodpecker's call follows, on a scratchy tape
recording.)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: There is only one recording of the ivory-billed
woodpecker, made in the 1930s. It was made in the Singer tract, an
80,000-acre tract of hardwood forest in north central Louisiana. Greg
Budney is the curator of the Library of Natural Sounds at Cornell
University's Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York.</P>

<P>BUDNEY: They realized in 1935 that the ivory-billed woodpecker was
likely to become extinct. That the numbers of birds were very low and
they wanted to make sure that its voice was documented. It was a
joint expedition between Cornell and the American Museum, and I
believe it was funded by the National Geographic Society.</P>

<P>(The bird call continues)</P>

<P>BUDNEY: I would just say how lucky they were that Arthur Allen,
James Tanner, Peter Paul Kellogg had the foresight to record this
animal, to go to the lengths that they went to, to record the
ivory-billed woodpecker. What a great thing to be able to hear. For
me, nothing like sound takes you back to a place or time. It's
essentially unreduced in dimension; we're listening to what they
listened to, and that's exciting and helps communicate to us what the
loss of a creature like an ivory-billed woodpecker is, as we sit and
listen to that recording and think that if we walk through the swamps
of the South, we're not going to hear that again in all likelihood.
</P>

<P>(The bird call continues, followed by a locomotive engine)</P>

<P>BUDNEY: Following the Civil War, much of the lands of the
Southeast reverted to Federal ownership, simply because the people of
the South were so poor that they couldn't afford to pay the taxes on
the lands. And by the late 1870s, early 1880s, this had grown to
crisis proportions and Southern senators and representatives were
lobbying in Congress trying to get those Federal lands sold so the
lands could go back on the tax base. So the lands were sold, and they
went to the lumber companies of the North. Special railroads were
built going out of Chicago, coming to the South to bring land buyers
to the South. And the virgin pine forests of the Southeast sold for a
dollar and a quarter an acre.</P>

<P>(Locomotive engine continues)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Nobody knows all the reasons why the bird has
disappeared. By the time scientists began to study causes of its
decline, there were hardly enough birds left to research.</P>

<P>(March music plays)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: In 1935, ornithologist James Tanner began a study of the
few ivory bills left in the Singer tract.</P>

<P>BUDNY: But then World War II broke out, and during the war, if
something is being done in our national interest then it has to be
okay. And we needed timber. we needed wood for pallets to put the
shells on that were being shipped overseas. And the Singer tract in
Louisiana, owned by the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company, was a tract
of forest that as far as those lumber men were concerned needed to be
cut for the war effort. It was the patriotic thing to do.
Unfortunately, that was where the last of the ivory-billed
woodpeckers lived. But we couldn't be concerned about them; there was
a war going on.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: For more than 30 years after the war, people searched
for and fantasized about finding the ivory-billed woodpecker in the
remote swamps of the United States. In 1969, 2 amateur naturalists
claimed to have seen ivory bills in central Florida. Ornithologists
who investigated their claim found nothing. On March 14, 1971, a
member of the Audubon Society played the tape recording of
ivory-billed woodpeckers and heard a response in the Santee Swamp of
South Carolina. No one saw the bird there, either. Six months later,
Dr. George Lowry, Jr., a well-respected ornithologist, reported that
a bird watcher in Louisiana had photographed ivory-billed woodpeckers
in May of 1971. Lowry believed the photographs were authentic, but no
birds were ever found. The latest sightings were reported in the
1980s in Cuba. Lured by the possibility of photographing the last
ivory-bills left, the National Geographic Society hired Jerry Jackson
to lead an expedition there.</P>

<P>JACKSON: Well I can tell you the minute. It was 9:32 AM on the
morning of March 4th, 1988. How's that for being excited about it. I
had spotted this place on the first day that I was there, that I
could overlook and see some dead trees that looked like they had
woodpecker work, and that's where we're going to see them. And I went
back to that spot. That was about 3 weeks later. I was sitting there
early in the morning, and this woodpecker -- I had my 400 millimeter
lens focused on the dead trees about 300 feet in front of me, and
this woodpecker, or what I believe was the ivory bill flew past 30
feet in front of me. And it was zip, right by. It was gone.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Jerry Jackson may well have been one of the last people
to see an ivory-billed woodpecker, but he didn't get a picture.
Intense surveys of Cuban forests in 1991 and 1993 proved fruitless. A
few years ago, the US Fish and Wildlife Service called a meeting of 3
ornithologists: Lester Short, James Tanner, and Jerry Jackson. They
sought their endorsement of the Service's decision to declare the
ivory-billed woodpecker extinct.</P>

<P>JACKSON: I don't really know why, except that I think they just
wanted to be able to cross it off their list and not have to worry
about it any more. I guess I was the fly in the ointment of the Fish
and Wildlife Service, and in response they decided that yeah, they
really might look bad if they declared it extinct and someone found
the birds. And so the Fish and Wildlife Service funded a one-year
study to examine those areas in the Southeast that offered the best
hope for there still being ivory-bills. And I was given the contract
to spend a year looking for ivory-bills. Well, I stretched that
amount of money; I got no more money but I stretched it into 2 years.
And actually it's been many years, because I've continued to go back
and go back and go bck.</P>

<P>(The ivory bill call plays)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Jackson plays the same tape made in the Singer tract in
the 1930s, hoping for a response and hearing only echoes, mimics, and
phantoms.</P>

<P>(The call continues. The tape is turned off. A woman and child
speak to Jackson. )</P>

<P>WOMAN: So then you would wait?</P>

<P>JACKSON: Yeah, we play it for -- that's a red belly responding to
the red belly on the tape. See, the birds do respond. There's another
red belly. (Speaking to Tremblay) We were in an area, in fact not
very far from here. It's only about 5 miles from here. And we had
been doing surveys, transects, through the forest, playing this
recording of an ivory-billed woodpecker for 45 seconds and listening
for 3 minutes and then moving 15 minutes and doing it again. And I
came to a place where the trees were incredibly large. And I played
the tape; I told my graduate student, "This is by far the best
habitat I've seen anywhere." And no response. And so we started to
move on, and my graduate student says, "Wait, there it is! There it
is!" And I said, "I don't hear anything." He said, "No, it's coming
closer. It's coming closer!" And we just stood there. And finally I
heard it, and it was a bird repeating what we had just played about 3
minutes before on the tape. And it kept coming closer and closer and
closer until it got about maybe 100 yards from us. And then it
stopped where it was, but it called repeatedly from there for several
minutes. And it wasn't coming closer, and so I said, "On three, we're
just going to have to rush toward it and hope we can get a photo."
And we did, we ran, and didn't see a thing.</P>

<P>(The bird call tape plays)</P>

<P>JACKSON: Everything in me that's a scientist says it's not at all
likely that there are any ivory-bills left. But as a human being and
as an individual that likes to think positive, I'd like to hope that
maybe, just maybe out there, there is a pocket of ivory-bills still
left.</P>

<P>SHORT: I think he's mistaken about it. I think he's an incurable
optimist, I'll say that about Jerry, which is great. But I'm too much
of a realist.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Lester Short is the Lamont Curator of Birds at the
American Museum of Natural History. He's one of the world's leading
experts on woodpeckers. Like Jackson, Short caught fleeting glimpses
of ivory bills in Cuba in the late 1980s, but he thinks the birds he
saw were part of a doomed population, and he's convinced there are
none left in the United States.</P>

<P>SHORT: When you think of the mobility of the bird watchers in the
United States and the terrific number of them, and the many people
who've become interested in birds, hunters and others who go into the
back country, and the fact that the birds need to have a place to
breed, if they produce young the young have to move away from the
parents. And these are big birds that are conspicuous. So I don't
think that any place, you know, that can be so remote from people
that they could be hanging on and not be seen over the years.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: But is the ivory-billed woodpecker really extinct? Could
there be an undscovered pair in some deep Southern swamp, in the
remote forests of South Carolina, or in the Florida panhandle?</P>

<P>JAMES: Hope springs eternal; sometimes you have to face reality.
(Laughs)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Douglas James is a professor of biology and
ornithologist at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, in the
upper regions of the ivory bill's former habitat. Though he believes
the ivory bill's demise was hastened by man's interference, James
says its extinction may have been fated from the very beginning.</P>

<P>JAMES: And like all other groups of birds that are endangered and
becoming extinct, it's always the largest one that's most endangered.
Like the whooping crane, the largest crane; the trumpeter swan, the
largest swan; the ivory-billed woodpecker, the largest woodpecker.
And this has been going on for millions of years since Pleistocene
age and geological age. I see it as sort of a continuation of a
process that's been going on for several million years.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Greg Budney of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology disagrees.
</P>

<P>BUDNEY: The ivory-billed woodpecker was probably not a bird that
was following such a narrow path that it was doomed to extinction. In
all likelihood it has to do with human manipulation of the habitat.
The loss of the ivory-billed woodpecker is an indication that
something has changed in a substantial way in the environment. So it
was an indicator, an indicator of the integrity of a habitat and when
you lose that, it's a signal, it's a sign that should direct our
attention to look at what impacts, what pressures are occurring in
this particular habitat to cause this animal to disappear.</P>

<P>(The ivory-billed woodpecker call on tape plays)</P>

<P>HEYEN: I don't know where I saw it first, maybe in a Petersons or
maybe in some other bird book, a picture of the ivory bill and it's a
sharp, vivid image in my mind, and of course representative of so
much now that we've lost.</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: William Heyen is a poet and professor at the State
University of New York in Brockport. In his collection of poems
Pterodactyl Rose, Heyen wrote about endangered and extinct species,
including the ivory-billed woodpecker.</P>

<P>HEYEN: But when I ate the dodo, I could not ingest its gentleness
and trust. Genes lost voyages ago, sometimes seem to snag in my human
heart. Eidolons of Easters past. But passenger pigeons' eggs wink in
a vanished series. And the ivory-billed cries in the vacuum of its
skies not at all.</P>

<P>(The bird call continues)</P>

<P>HEYEN: You know, I was brought up on Long Island, and in the
center of the island when my boyhood was all ponds and woods. And now
I return and I see what has happened to the places where I once had
my imagination and I had my being. And all of us have this story in
us; I mean this is an American story.</P>

<P>(Cello and double bass music continues)</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: We don't want the story to be true. Jerry Jackson and
the others who still search want this story to end differently.</P>

<P>JACKSON: Sometimes I'm looked at a little bit askance: hey, you're
crazy, fella. Or with a little bit of disbelief that, you believe
there might still be ivory-billed woodpeckers; how about the trolls
under the bridge, too?</P>

<P>TREMBLAY: Do you doubt yourself sometimes?</P>

<P>JACKSON: No. I guess that's part of being successful and part of
being a scientist. If I doubted myself I wouldn't be out here looking
for them, wading through the chiggers and the ticks and the snakes in
the water.</P>

<P>(Orchestral music continues)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: The search for the ivory-billed woodpecker was written
and produced by Brenda Tremblay. Technical producer was Dave
Sluberski. Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker are used with
the permission of the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology. And
thanks to member station WXXI in Rochester, New York.</P>

<H2>Trafficking In Exotic Pets</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. International
wildlife trafficking is big business. According to the World Wildlife
Fund, smuggling of endangered animals and animal parts generates more
than $5 billion a year worldwide. That's more than illegal weapons
and gemstones, and second only to drugs. And as with illegal drugs,
the United States is a leading consumer. One of the problems for both
consumers and law enforcement agencies is that the illegal wildlife
market is intermingled with a legal trade in exotic pets. I recently
visited a legitimate pet emporium to talk about the exotic pet trade
with our favorite zoologist, Donna Fernandes.</P>

<P>(Bird calls)</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Probably the biggest illegal trade is in birds,
lizards, some primates. But I think the biggest market currently is
birds as they become more and more popular.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So how do people smuggle these in?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, there's a variety of ways that have recently been
detected by wildlife officials and smuggling experts at airports. In
some cases they can bring in wild caught eggs in specially designed
vests to keep the eggs warm against their body, walk through onto an
airplane, get off, and then they'll transport those eggs to pet
dealers. And when the eggs hatch out they are sold as captive-reared.
Because consumers are aware that they -- they do want to buy
captive-reared birds, and yet this is one way to get around that.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Birds, is that the biggest part of this trade?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well certainly the last few years the biggest reports
from Miami and New York, where most of the smuggling operations seem
to come through, are macaws stuffed in plastic tubes trying to be
smuggled in. Snakes are another big thing. A lot of boa constrictors
are caught when they're very young. One individual was caught with
snakes, about 18 snakes in small nylon bags wrapped all over his, uh,
body. They caught him 'cause he sort of bulged funny and then when
they opened his suitcase he had another 35 snakes trying to get into
Miami Airport.</P>

<P>(A bird screeches)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh -- excuse me! We're in a pet store if you can't tell
from what's going on. How important is the cash raised by this exotic
animal trade to the countries that export them?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, it depends. Usually the individuals who collect
the animals only get, you know, probably ten cents on the dollar if
that. So in terms of local economies, it really is not making a lot
of money. It's a lot of money relative to them. But unfortunately
it's the middle men and the pet store owners who are making the huge
profits. And there can be really long-term negative consequences of
getting rid of your wildlife. For example, frogs are being collected
all the time for food in French restaurants, everyone eats frogs'
legs. Well, there's been such a collection, a massive collection of
frogs in -- in Asia, that they're now having problems with mosquitoes
because the frogs used to eat all the mosquitoes. So now they're
having to spend a lot of pesticides, and they're spending more money
on pesticides to correct the mosquito problem than revenues generated
from the collection of frogs. So it can have the same thing --
snakes, if you remove snakes you can get rodent problems. So
countries who think that they can market their wildlife find out that
they're disturbing whole ecosystems and the long-term costs outweigh
any short-term benefits.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Let's talk a bit about some of the laws regarding these
exotic species. Certain places you can own things, other places you
can't. It's -- it's kind of a mishmash right now.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Right. The import of all animals into this country is
governed by what's called CITES, the Convention of International
Trade in Endangered Species. And that regulates import of any kind of
endangered or threatened animals. But once they're into the United
States, individual states differ tremendously in laws regarding
having exotic pets. And some states allow you to have just about
anything; they have no laws whatsoever regarding. And others have
very strict laws. Massachusetts is one of -- do have certain animals
you're not allowed to have as pets.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Um, if about a third of the exotic pet trade is illegal,
smuggled, how can consumers be sure that they're getting a legal
animal when they go to the pet store?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, it's -- it's very important that you go to
reputable dealers, and it's nice if you can actually see baby animals
to be sure that they are being bred rather than just claimed to be
bred. And there are some things that you really don't know. Even zoos
can fall victim to dealing with animal traders who purport that
they're captive-bred, and then later when we further research into
it, it will actually be not the truth. In fact, recently, one of the
biggest smuggling operations that was blown open was an individual
who was very highly regarded in avaculture, bird breeding
communities. He had written several books on parrots and numerous
articles. It turns out he was the leader of the largest bird
smuggling ring in the country, and was in fact turned into
authorities by a drug smuggler who sidelined in illegal wildlife
trade. And that's not uncommon to find the same individuals involved
in both drug smuggling and animal smuggling. Because the source of
origin is very often South America, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil. And
they're coming into Miami for distribution to pet stores, or if
drugs, of course, distribution across the country. There's even been
such cases as wildlife officials noticed an illegal shipment of boa
constrictors, and one of them had this odd bulge in the side. The
x-rayed the boa constrictor and found that it had forced down into it
several condoms filled with cocaine.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's not a nice business.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: No, it's not a nice business. And I think we have to
recognize that in the United States we are the largest consumers of
illegal wildlife. And just as we complain about South American
countries not doing their bit to stop the drug trade, we are the
biggest consumers of drugs. Likewise, it's not only up to the
countries who are illegal exporting their endangered wildlife. We as
Americans have to stop it and not at all support illegal pets in this
country.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So tell me, Donna Fernandes -- I get the impression that
maybe you think we shouldn't have exotic pets at home.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Um -- I don't recommend it. I think there are plenty of
opportunities like zoological parks and aquariums to see exotic
animals. If you really want to have an exotic pet, please do read all
about it. Understand before you buy anything. Its longevity, its
dietary requirements, its space requirements, social needs. So that
you can be fully educated and decide are you willing to make that
long-term commitment to really care for that animal properly?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay then, thank you. Dr. Donna Fernandes is associate
curator at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York City, and
the former vice president for programs at Boston's Franklin Park Zoo.
Thanks for joining us, Donna.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Thank you very much.</P>

<H2>Keeping Exotic Pets</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of July 12, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. Once upon a time
your average American family might have been made up of a mom, a dad,
three or four children, a couple of cats and a dog.</P>

<P>Today the family's as likely to be a single parent, one kid, and a
boa constrictor or an iguana. Our choices of pets change with our
culture, and today exotic pets are hot. Chinchillas, ferrets,
hedgehogs, macaws. You name it and you can probably get it. Of
course, this demand for unusual pets can cause problems. The
populations of many endangered animals have been decimated by the
illegal wildlife trade. And even when exotic animals are legally
imported or bred, unprepared owners can be in for a rude awakening.
To find out which exotic animals can be bought legally and which make
the best pets, I headed out to the Pet Club in Dedham, Massachusetts,
with zoologist Donna Fernandes.</P>

<P>(Bird chirps up and under)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Dr. Fernandes led me first to a swarm of parakeets, a
long-time favorite.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: They are highly social. Parakeets do make excellent
pets. If you wanted to get a bird, parakeets would be a good choice
because they have been bred so long for pets that they are very used
to the kind of domestic situation that most households provide. That
would certainly be a bird that I would recommend.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay. Well, let's meet this fellow over here. Now a
moment ago he hopped, uh, right on our microphone. And this is a
macaw?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yes. And they're very popular, some of these parrots,
in that group. Macaws and cockatoos and things.</P>

<P>(Bird calls continue)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: These guys are quite the character. He has a neighbor
here and they're both watching us very carefully.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yeah. I can see in some ways why they would be
attractive, in that they do vocalize and they can mimic human voice.
So you can teach a lot of the members of the parrot family to talk,
as it were. Another thing to think about when you're considering a
macaw is how long-lived they are. They can live 75 years or so. So
you have to better be thinking about willing this to your children.
It's not something that you can just sort of have for a few years and
then it's going to pass away. It's a very long-term commitment. And
also a lot of work to keep them active and happy.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Any special consideration with the macaws? Do you have to
keep their wings clipped, or --</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Most people do clip their primary feathers, which are
their principal flight feathers. And that way they can move around
but they can't take off and fly. Another thing you often have to do
is cut their toenails. That can be a little stressful if you don't
know what you're doing [birds screech in the background] but because
they don't get the sort of natural activity and wear that they would
in the wild, they can get overgrown, and nails have to be clipped.
And even beaks have to be trimmed down. Again, they're not getting
the normal activities that would cause them. They typically don't
have to break down their food and crack nuts any more, so they don't
get the normal wear and tear. So you have to come in and trim their
beak down. So it's a lot of work, and you have to know what you're
doing, because they can get stressed out if you don't treat them
properly.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: This is quite a loud crowd over here.</P>

<P>(Birds screech)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I'm wondering what we have over here. Now these guys have
sort of -- well, they look like rabbits but their ears are a little
short and their tails are kinda long.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yeah, these are chinchillas. If you want to give a lot
of attention to a chinchilla they'll do okay as a pet. They're very
shy, so you can't just sort of jump in there and expect them to
respond to you. You have to really get them very used to you and
handle them very gently. And they have certain requirements; they
have to have a dust bath every day so you have to provide a cage
large enough to incorporate several features into their home.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: A dust bath?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yeah. They sort of clean themselves kicking up this
gray dust. It's what they do sort of with soil in nature and they
really need to do that.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So what kind of person really would like a chinchilla, do
you think?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Um, well, I think sort of a quiet person. A lot of
elderly now are getting chinchillas and rabbits because there is
scientific evidence that responding and touching mammals, small
animals, can lower your blood pressure and heart rate and has
positive health benefits. So that's why we are going into nursing
homes on our education programs with a lot of these types of animals.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Where are chinchillas from?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Chinchillas are from South America, but they are pretty
plentiful because they are captive bred. Techniques established of
course during the fur trade, so they are pretty much available.</P>

<P>(Birds screech)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, when I think of an exotic pet -- somebody having
something that somebody else doesn't have on the block, I think of --
reptiles, you know, snakes or iguanas or some kind of lizard. So tell
me about these, uh, these fellows here.</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, iguanas have increased in popularity tremendously
within the last 5 or 10 years. They also pose very -- interesting
problems you have to solve if you get an iguana. Their diet changes.
When they're young they eat insects. And then as they get older they
switch to fruits and vegetables, and I think a lot of people don't
realize that and their iguanas die during that growth period when
they switch over from their diet. They need very specific lighting
requirements, full spectrum lighting, in order to synthesize several
vitamins which they need. And people don't keep them under the
appropriate lighting. And also, with an iguana, you should very much
think about its</P>

<P>ultimate size. I wish pet stores would include a fully grown adult
specimen in their exhibitry, because I think if people saw a 5-foot
iguana they would think twice about getting, you know, 8-inch baby
iguana.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Five -- foot -- iguana?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Yes. They do get quite large, and -- and again, they
can be handled, even at that size, if you invest the time in working
with them, and if you want a pet iguana just understand you may have
to devote half of one of your rooms at home to its ultimate cage if
you really want to do right by the animal.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh. Now what do we have here? We have two snakes
together kind of in a snake dance</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Oh, this entire exhibit is filled with boas. Boas are
probably the most popular animal. I think about half of all reptiles
brought into this country are boas. Supposedly, you know, current
estimates are that about one million live reptiles come into the
international pet trade each year, and about 300 to 500,000 of those
end up in the United States, and they're often caught as small, young
animals, and then they get to be quite, quite big animals. And there
are requirements in some states, like Massachusetts, that if you have
a snake over 8 feet long you need a special permit. And usually we
get requests of finding a home for about a 7-foot, 8-foot snake. Just
as they're getting really big, people are tired of them and there are
some herpetological societies which will try</P>

<P>to find homes for these animals. But again, you should really
understand how long they live, how big they get. And also some of the
hazards they can pose. They won't necessarily recognize that your pet
rabbit is your pet rabbit and not food.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And how do you take care of a boa constrictor?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Well, they'll eat -- live prey. Mice when they're
younger, pinkies, which are baby mice, and then rats when they're
older. And that's, you know, that's a big economic consideration. You
have to every week go to the pet store, or some individuals then
decide they want to raise the mice, so then you've got a whole entire
colony of mice that you're keeping to feed your snake. So it can be
quite an economic consideration as well as time consuming to keep the
food available.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And in other words, it's just easier to go with a cat or
a dog, huh?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: A cat or a dog, or parakeets. Mice make actually nice
pets. Domesticated rabbits. There are a lot of animals that are used
to being handled, respond well to human contact, have very simple
husbandry, and are not super expensive to keep. And have, you know, a
life span of 8 to 10 years.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And are as much fun?</P>

<P>FERNANDES: Oh, equally as much fun. I mean I love my dog probably
more than my skink or my tarantula.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: [Laughs] Okay. Dr. Donna Fernandes is former vice
president for programs at Boston's Franklin Park Zoo, and she's
associate curator at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York
City. Thanks, Donna, for joining us.</P>

<H3>Excerpts from Steve's talk with Dr. Bill Wolverton</H3>

<P>The EPA has identified as many as 800 volatile organic chemicals
swirling inside buildings. They seep from walls and ceilings; they're
in our clothing, furniture, and carpets. But there's a simple and
cheap way to offset many of these toxic gases: common house plants.
Finding out which ones do the best job involves a good deal of
research, the kind of painstaking work done by Dr. Bill Wolverton, an
environmental scientist and retired senior researcher at NASA. He's
been studying the cleansing effects of indoor plants for about 25
years. Now, in our homes and offices, Dr. Wolverton, what are the
greatest threats to indoor air quality?</P>

<P>WOLVERTON: Well back about 15 years ago with the energy crisis, we
started to seal our homes and offices to make them more energy
efficient. And at about the same time, we started to change the
composition of materials in our homes</P>

<P>and offices. Practically everything now, the desks, the furniture
is made of synthetics. Also we started to use wall to wall carpeting
which makes it nice, but unfortunately it gives off certain
pollutants and particles. So what we've done over the years, in
sealing up our home, we've created an unhealthy gas chamber inside
our homes and offices.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now what can we do to counteract these effects and
improve our air quality?</P>

<P>WOLVERTON: Well, answer is, take nature's living air filters,
which are plants, design them in buildings or add them to buildings,
and they will literally suck out these pollutants, absorb them,
translocate them throughout the plant, break them down, or utilize
the root microbes that they culture to help break them down. So it's
a complicated process that the simple, innocent looking house plant
can do to help clean the air and hopefully save your health.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And the five best plants that are easy to grow are?</P>

<P>WOLVERTON: Well, the ones that I prefer based on working with them
for many, many years are the Peace lily, Areca palm, Lady palm, Ficus
alii and the Golden pothos. . . they're very easy to grow. They are
among the top in removing undesirable indoor air polluting
substances, such as formaldehyde. And, they have what we call a high
transpiration rate. In other words, they add healthy moisture to a
room, and that is especially important in the winter time up in your
part of the country where it's cold. The air gets dry and it makes
you more susceptible. So these plants, house plants, do a lot of good
things for us in creating healthy indoor environments.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Just how many plants do I have to have in order to clean
the air in my home or my office?</P>

<P>WOLVERTON: We recommend that you use maybe 2 or hopefully 3 nice
sized plants per 100 square feet.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Thanks for taking this time with us. My guest has been
former NASA scientist Dr. Bill Wolverton. He's the author of the
forthcoming book Eco-Friendly House Plants. That will be published by
Viking Penguin in the fall.</P>

<H2>Industrial Age Chemicals and Parkinson's Disease</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No

<P>Air date: Week of September 6, 1996</P>

<P>CURWOOD: One of the most touching moments of this summer's Olympic
Games came when Mohammed Ali's trembling hand lit the Olympic torch.
Many may have thought that the great boxing champion was shaking
because he'd taken too many blows to his head. But like US Attorney
General Janet Reno and hundreds of thousands of other Americans,
Mohammed Ali suffers from Parkinson's Disease. It's a progressive
brain disorder that causes violent tremors and the loss of the
ability to control one's limbs. Medicine can't say for certain what
causes Parkinson's, but as Living on Earth's Daniel Grossman
discovered, there is a growing consensus that at least some of the
blame lies with industrial age chemicals.</P>

<P>(Footfalls, water from a shower)</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: As you can see I have one of these special showers.
</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Fred Belliveau is a sick man. But thinking back he has
much to be thankful for. As an editor and author of medical books, he
was well paid and respected, and he raised a family. But sitting in a
darkened room overlooking Boston's Charles River, he says fate played
tricks on him.</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: I had a perfect kind of life, a good job, a nice
family, and a house in the country, very nice house. So everything
was kind of going my way. And then bam, right in the middle of
everything, comes the shocking news.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: He had Parkinson's Disease, an incurable brain disorder
his doctor said would slowly but surely deny him control over his own
body. Many sufferers walk with a shuffling gait, lose the ability to
make facial expressions, or move their limbs with the jerky motions
of a wind-up toy. Today, 17 years after he was diagnosed, Mr.
Belliveau keeps his symptoms in check with medication. But even so,
during this interview, his hands were in constant motion. His balding
head rolled from side to side. He says at other times the illness
becomes nearly unbearable.</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: I get just kinetic, which means I start shaking and --
more than tremor. I can't pick up a book, for example. It would just
-- I would shake violently and the book would go flying out of my
hand. Of course you can figure the ramifications of that if you
wanted to have dinner. You can't pick up a dish and have it go flying
and your food go flying. That has happened to me.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: About half a million mostly elderly Americans suffer
from Parkinson's, including about one of every 50 people over the age
of 60. Around the globe, millions are afflicted in a process well
understood by medical researchers.</P>

<P>STANDAERT: Parkinson's is a disease where a very specific
population of neurons have been lost.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Dr. David Standaert is a neurologist at Massachusetts
General Hospital.</P>

<P>STANDAERT: These are neurons which make dopamine. But only those
in the particular part of the brain which is involved in the control
of movement are affected. These are in an area called the substantia
nigra pars compacta, pars compacta meaning tightly packed. And what's
tightly packed there are a cluster of cells which make dopamine and
send projections up into the part of the brain known as the
neostriatum, which has a very critical role in the regulation of
movement.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Dr. Standaert says once scientists realized how the
illness works they came up with drugs to help the brain overcome the
loss of dopamine, the most effective being L-dopa. But science has
been less helpful explaining why the brain cells die in the first
place. That's left Fred Belliveau and others like him groping for
answers.</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: It's -- it's tough going. It is tough going. As much as
you want to be upbeat and you can't always do it, you simply can't --
and then I think all of us have a tendency to say why me?</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Mr. Belliveau's doctors have told him what doesn't cause
the disease. It's not a viral or bacterial infection and it doesn't
generally run in families. So far they're less certain what does
cause it. But Dr. William Langston, President of California's
Parkinson Institute, says he thinks the culprit may be a synthetic
chemical. A conjecture supported, he says, by the great works of
literature.</P>

<P>LANGSTON: Now, with many neurological diseases such as seizures
and stroke, you can find writings in the very early literature,
Biblical writings, the Greeks, where clearly that disease existed
centuries if not much longer ago than that. With Parkinson's the
first clear-cut, unequivocal description of that disease is actually
James Parkinson's description in 1817, and it raises the very
interesting question, because that's around the time of the
Industrial Revolution: could it be a true manmade disease? A disease
that was the result of something we introduced into our environment?
</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: The Industrial Revolution was fueled by coal, which
releases innumerable toxic byproducts when burned. Dr. Langston says
this and other staples of the machine age, like the neurotoxic metals
lead and mercury, are all suspect. The toxic compound theory got a
major boost in 1983 when Dr. Langston solved a bizarre medical
mystery. It began when a handful of young heroin addicts with unusual
symptoms appeared in California hospitals.</P>

<P>LANGSTON: And when they came into the emergency rooms here in
northern California, they looked for all the world like they had
developed instant Parkinson's Disease, yet they weren't old and this
had come on rapidly.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: A team of scientists led by Dr. Langston discovered the
drug users had all injected a designer drug made by underground
chemists intended to mimic the properties of heroin.</P>

<P>LANGSTON: And it turned out by accident instead of making a
heroin-like compound, they made probably one of the most selective
brain toxins ever, ever known.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: The toxin was called MPTP, a particularly nasty member
of the common pyridine class of industrial chemicals. Further
research confirmed the compound not only brought on the symptoms of
Parkinson's Disease but struck the same area of the brain. Today more
than a decade later, these addicts still suffer from the symptoms of
Parkinson's. Dr. Langston says it was a tragedy for the drug users
but a boon for medicine.</P>

<P>LANGSTON: And the immediate question everyone asked was my gosh,
if a simple chemical in this heroin can cause Parkinson's, could
there be something in the environment that also causes Parkinson's?
</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Researchers began searching for a previously undetected
source of exposure to the chemical or a close relative. They found 2
that were in common use: the pesticides rotenone and paraquat. But
neither could be linked to Parkinson's. Still, pesticides in general
remain a source of concern. Many are neurotoxic by design, and
exposure to them is widespread. Parkinson's sufferer Fred Belliveau
used to spray pesticides on a small orchard at his country home.</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: I'm sure that it was not good to do this, but I was not
knowledgeable enough to protect myself accordingly, and I frequently
would wear shorts and no shirt. And I would get up there with my
little tank and I would spray around on these trees. So I'd get this
solution on me and I did that many, many years, and of course I don't
know what effect that could possibly have had.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: But he does wonder if it played a role in his illness.
Researchers have tested scores of pesticides and other chemicals, so
far to no avail. Dr. Langston of the Parkinson's Institute now
believes he knows why the search has proved fruitless. He thinks the
disease may be caused by 2 or more separate factors operating
together; for instance, a toxic agent might only strike individuals
with the genetic inability to protect themselves. To overcome all
these complexities, researchers are turning to epidemiology, the
branch of science that tries to determine the cause of a disease from
who it strikes.</P>

<P>(Woman: "Okay. Sit in the chair here." Scraping sounds.)</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Kathy Taylor, a researcher at Boston University, sits
across a table from Stanley Wirthheimer, a tan, muscular man. He's
one of nearly 300 volunteers involved in an epidemiology study at
BU's Department of Neurology. Half of them suffer from Parkinson's
Disease. At 61, he's been living with the illness for about a decade.
</P>

<P>TAYLOR: So as I explained to you over the phone what this is about
is, it's a study designed to look at what might be causing
Parkinson's Disease.</P>

<P>WIRTHHEIMER: Yes.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: For more than hour, Kathy Taylor carefully notes down
the most minute details of the subject's medical history and that of
his family. She also asks him to list everywhere he's ever lived and
worked.</P>

<P>WIRTHHEIMER: I started working when I was 13, for my uncle, oh,
10, 15 hours a week. We made what are called solder rings.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Later this year a statistician will electronically
shuffle the thousands of facts Ms. Taylor has collected from Stanley
Wirthheimer and the other subjects.</P>

<P>WIRTHHEIMER: I made many millions of these.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: Mm hm.</P>

<P>WIRTHHEIMER: That's lead.</P>

<P>TAYLOR: And what -- lead, okay.</P>

<P>WIRTHHEIMER: Lead and tin.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Many other epidemiological studies have already drawn
relationships between Parkinson's Disease and exposure to industrial
or agricultural chemicals. For instance, research in the US and
Canada has uncovered 2 intriguing correlations. People who live in
agricultural regions where pesticides are used, or who drink water
from shallow wells which are often polluted with chemical runoff, are
more likely to be afflicted with the illness than city dwellers and
customers of cleaner public water supplies. Studies abroad like one
in China by Dr. Carolyn Tanner of the Parkinson's Institute also link
the disease to exposure to synthetic chemicals.</P>

<P>TANNER: People who had worked in settings where they had exposure
to chemicals, working in chemical plants or in industrial settings,
had a higher risk of getting Parkinson's Disease than people who did
not. And it was about, between a 2- and 3-fold increase.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Dr. Tanner says the evidence that some environmental
toxin or toxins play a role in causing Parkinson's is nearly
unassailable. It's a conclusion that doesn't surprise University of
Missouri biologist Fred Vom Saal. He's recently been involved in some
groundbreaking research studying the effects of chemicals on other
parts of the body and the brain.</P>

<P>VOM SAAL: We already know that there are environmental chemicals
that can damage brain development and lead to permanent changes in
the functioning of the brain systems that in fact are involved in
certain types of human diseases.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Dr. Vom Saal is referring to hormone disrupters.
Synthetic chemicals like dioxin and PCBs that can upset the
development and growth of humans and animals. Recent research
including a study of the children of women who consumed contaminated
fish from the Great Lakes show these chemicals can cause behavioral
abnormalities like reduced intelligence and increased aggression. Dr.
Vom Saal wonders if the same poisons might cause Parkinson's Disease
as well.</P>

<P>VOM SAAL: The interesting thing we know about these chemicals is
that they can interfere with thyroid hormone, which is a major
regulator of brain development. And one of the consequences of this
is you also have abnormal dopamine levels. Which is exactly what you
see later on in life in Parkinson's Disease.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Disrupting the thyroid is only one of many ways these
chemicals might be implicated in Parkinson's. Researchers at New York
State's Department of Public Health recently discovered that rats fed
certain PCBs exhibit dramatic dopamine reductions in the same part of
the brain, the substantia nigra, as people with Parkinson's. And Dr.
Richard Seegal, who directed the research, says recent other new
findings make him wonder if the effect is multiplied if more than one
chemical is involved. Scientists at Tulane University announced last
spring that a mixture of pesticides subjected to cells in the
laboratory are hundreds of times more toxic than any one acting
alone. Dr. Segal says the research is a call to arms. If a similar,
synergistic mechanism is at work in Parkinson's Disease, that may
explain why researchers who have been testing compounds one at a time
have been stymied for so long.</P>

<P>(Pills spilling)</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: Lots of pills in this business.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: Like most people, Fred Belliveau was exposed to many
synthetic chemicals in his life. Experts estimate about 70,000
different synthetic compounds are sold in the US. Sitting in his
Boston apartment holding a handful of tablets, he says he doubts
he'll live to learn which if any chemicals caused his ailment.</P>

<P>BELLIVEAU: I've been asked in the past on various surveys, were
you ever exposed to or around insecticides? Another question that was
asked is, did your drinking water come from a dug well, and ours did.
I mean there are so many exposures that one has in life, whether
those 2 things or other things played a part I simply don't know. I
don't know.</P>

<P>GROSSMAN: No matter what the answer, it's too late to make a
difference for George Belliveau. So he focuses on how to cope with
his condition, not what caused it. But if the research underway in
search of a specific pollutant or pollutants is successful, if the
quest for the cause of Parkinson's bears fruit, ways could be found
to prevent others from being stricken with this crippling illness.

<H2>Home Drinking Water Consumer Tips</H2>

<P>NUNLEY: It's Living on Earth. I'm Jan Nunley. Last month the
Environmental Protection Agency warned that Washington, DC's water
and sewer system is so decrepit that it may pose a risk to the health
of millions of residents. Meanwhile a Milwaukee study suggests that
low levels of biological contaminants could cause chronic
gastrointestinal problems. These are the latest in what sometimes
feels like a flood of alarming news about the water we drink. As a
society we're still grappling with how much protection of drinking
water we can afford. But till that's resolved, families and
individuals with a little money to spare can take steps now to
improve the quality of the water they drink. Jeffrey Martin is a
chemist for Consumer Reports who's studied drinking water and home
filtration systems. He says it's what you can't see that can hurt you
most.</P>

<P>MARTIN: If you have water that smells bad or tastes or looks bad,
that's clearly objectionable and you might want to do something about
it. But the ironic part is that the things which are probably more
harmful, things like lead which is a chronic hazard, won't get you in
the short run but eventually it could if it's high enough, and
immediate threats which can occur unpredictably like cryptosporidium
and bacterial contamination. Those are the things you can't taste or
see, and they're really more dangerous than the aesthetic problems.
</P>

<P>NUNLEY: How can you determine if something like that is in your
water?</P>

<P>MARTIN: Lead, for example, can be tested for. There's reliable
chemical tests that are quite sensitive for lead. But the usual
problem with other things, which are microbiological contaminations
which have been in the news lately -- cryptosporidium, for example,
which was a problem in Milwaukee about a year ago, and even in New
York City there have been periodic low levels of it -- those are very
hard to predict. They're hard to find and there's really nothing you
can do as far as testing your own water to prevent it. They can just
occur at a moment's notice. Although it's rare.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: If you're concerned about your water, what kind of filter
systems are available to use? And start with the simplest thing and
then we can go to the more complex systems.</P>

<P>MARTIN: Okay, well the simplest things are the ones that are
selling like hotcakes these days. Those are the carafe water
pitchers. Those are quite effective actually in improving the
aesthetic qualities of your water. And in some tests we recently did
at Consumer Reports we found actually that the carafe water pitchers
that you can buy are quite competent at removing lead as well as
organic chemicals from the water.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Okay, so the carafe, and then what?</P>

<P>MARTIN: Then you can go up to the filters, small filters which fit
on the end of your faucet. Then there are the ones which sit on your
counter top and connect to your faucet with a hose. Then you can go
to under sink models, where you actually plummet the water under your
sink through a filter and then it comes up sometimes to a separate
tap on the sink. Then there are even larger models which are intended
to process the water for your whole house.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Are there any scams to watch out for in the whole water
filtration business?</P>

<P>MARTIN: You betcha. If you're paying for a filter which is say
about a foot high and 4 or 5 inches in diameter, a cylinder about
that size, you shouldn't pay more than $100 or so for it. And for a
counter top or an under sink filter, one, two, $300 is usually enough
for one that has quite a large capacity.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: I'm assuming in the case of some of those bacterial
contaminants, it would be a good idea to change out that filter
fairly regularly.</P>

<P>MARTIN: As far as filtering goes, it's very hard to have a filter
which will effectively remove all those things and then stay clean.
If, say, a slug of bacteria or something gets into your filter,
carbon can be a very effective medium for them to grow on, and
there's lots of stuff in there, sludge and algae and everything. So
bacteria can grow on filters, and if you have one you need to replace
the filter at a regular interval.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Or you might end up with worse water than you had to begin
with.</P>

<P>MARTIN: You certainly can.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Isn't there also a recommendation that you use cold water
for certain applications, not hot water? Particularly if there's a
danger of lead contamination?</P>

<P>MARTIN: That's a very good rule. You should never use hot water,
the hot water tap, for any cooking or drinking purposes. It's, as you
say, has sat in the pipes for a long period of time. It's sat in the
water heater. Not that that produces any real problem, but if there's
lead in the lines it will have higher lead content than the cold
water.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: So better to run cold right out of the tap.</P>

<P>MARTIN: Right. And if you live in an area, say, in an inner city
or an older section of some of our older cities, especially in the
East, we found that it's not a bad idea to let your water run 30
seconds before you take the first cooking water in the morning.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: And it's not going to be that much in terms of wasting
water.</P>

<P>MARTIN: No, you can water your plants with it if you really want
to.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: All right, great. Jeffrey Martin is a chemist for Consumer
Reports. Thank you so much for being our guest, Jeffrey.</P>

<P>MARTIN: You're welcome.</P>

<H2>Steve talks with Dianne Dumanoski, co-author of Our Stolen Future</H2>

Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>CURWOOD: This is Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  For the last couple of years we've been bringing you reports about a disturbing new environmental concern: the suspected links between common chemicals such as pesticides, dioxin, and PCBs, and the disruption of the hormone or endocrine systems of animals and humans.  It was in 1992 that Dr. Theo Colborn, the leading scientist who has been developing the endocrine disruption hypothesis, edited the first scientific volume on the subject.  That book touched off a major buzz among scientists in industry, and slowly the general public has been hearing pieces of the story, especially the parts linking endocrine disrupters to declining human sperm counts.  Now, for the first time, all the science has been put into plain language, in a new book written by Dr. Colborn, zoologist J. Peterson Myers, and journalist Dianne Dumanoski.  It may become the most controversial environmental volume since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring first appeared 30 years ago.  

<P>

The book is called Our Stolen Future.  Even before its official publication date, it was the subject of a flurry of stories in major national newspapers and magazines, and of a blistering editorial in the conservative Washington Times.  The first printing of the book has already sold out in many bookstores.  Vice President Al Gore wrote a foreword to the book, in which he makes an urgent call for more research.  The Vice President adds that Our Stolen Future takes up where Rachel Carson left off.  I recently spoke with the book's co-author and Boston Globe reporter Dianne Dumanoski.  She was quick to agree.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   I think this book is a direct descendant of Silent Spring, and in fact it picks up a thread that is present in Silent Spring but never gets fully developed by Rachel Carson.

<P>

CURWOOD: Uh huh.  And that is?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   This is the thread of reproductive problems and sterility that's very much raised in the fable that opens Silent Spring.  And Carson at various points says things like these are no ordinary poisons and there's something strange going on.  But I think science wasn't developed sufficiently at that time for her to really completely explore that, and there was also the specter of cancer, which was very much on people's minds in this period.

<P>

CURWOOD: So in other words, Carson kind of got stuck at cancer, as it were.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Yes.  And Silent Spring helped set us off on a regulatory track that has regulated largely according to cancer risks.  And we've largely had the assumption that if we regulated for cancer we would cover everything, that that was really the toughest standard, and, you know, if you really scrutinize chemicals carefully for whether they could cause mutations or cause cancer we were really protecting ourselves.  And one of the messages of this book is that that's not true.  There are many chemicals that do not cause cancer, but do disrupt hormones, and they cause a whole series, or have the potential to cause a whole series of problems that are not cancer.  And may actually affect us more broadly across the population than cancer does.

<P>

CURWOOD: You mean more people being --

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   It may affect more people.

<P>

CURWOOD: Can you talk about some of the effects on fertility of people?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well, one of the most worrisome signals is our effects on male sperm count.  That would be an expected effect.  It's something that's been seen in the laboratory in rat pups who are exposed before birth to these endocrine disrupting chemicals.  Scientists had raised this question here in the US at roughly the same time that researchers on the other side of the Atlantic were actually believing that they were seeing dropping male sperm counts and beginning studies.  These studies, when they emerged in the British Medical Journal, reported a 50% drop in male sperm count based on an analysis of 40-some studies from the US, Europe, and other places in the world.  Shortly after that study appeared, 2 key male reproductive researchers in Europe put forward a hypothesis linking the drop in male sperm count and some other reproductive effects seen in males including undescended testicles, genital defects, and testicular cancer, to exposure before birth in the womb to elevated estrogen levels.  And since some of the chemicals in the environment can elevate estrogen levels, these chemicals have come under suspicion as playing a possible role in this.

<P>

CURWOOD: There's some controversy over this research, though.  I saw a study the other day, or a study reported, perhaps, the other day, that's still in progress, saying no, no, no, sperm counts aren't falling in this place and that place.  How do you respond to this controversy?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well there have been a number of studies. The initial study by Carlson and Skakkebaek, that sparked incredulity among some researchers and several follow up studies.  There were at least 3 studies that confirmed that there were dropping sperm counts, and some of them were done by researchers who'd been skeptics.  But there was also a report from Toulouse in France that did not report a fall in sperm counts.  So basically I think as the question is coming under closer scrutiny, you're seeing contradictory evidence coming from different geographical places, so it's not necessarily absolutely contradictory.  We may be just seeing a pattern of falling sperm count that is different in different places.

<P>

CURWOOD: Meaning?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Meaning people have had different exposures.  In some rural places, exposure might be greater or less than in an industrial center.

<P>

CURWOOD: So, how are we exposed to these chemicals?  It seems that there are all kinds of substances that people and animals would be exposed to having all kinds of results in the city, out in the countryside.  How do they get into our bodies?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well some of us, if we're young enough, have inherited them from our mothers, so that's the first way that they can get into your body.  Over a lifetime, a woman accumulates a store of persistent chemicals, and some of these are endocrine disrupting chemicals.  They're stored in her body fat, and during pregnancy these chemicals are released from the body fat; they cross the placenta and they can affect the developing fetus.  So -- and it's not just what the mother eats during pregnancy; it's basically a lifetime legacy, shall we say, that is passed down to the infant.  These chemicals can also be passed onto a baby through breast milk.  Human breast milk contains a large number of these chemicals, and in fact during breast feeding a baby is exposed to higher levels of some of these chemicals, such as dioxin, than he or she will ever encounter in their entire lifetime.  So breast feeding is potentially a large source.  Then we are exposed to them through our food.  The persistent members of this family, and not all of these chemicals are as persistent as others, are very attracted to fats.  And so they will ride up through the food chain on fats.  So in ice cream and in milk and in meat one can get exposed to many of these chemicals.  You can be exposed to them in the air.  We are discovering that some of these chemicals are leaching out of plastics, plastic containers, so one could possibly be exposed to some of these chemicals through food packaging.  The lining of cans has been tested; there are sort of plastic linings in metal cans that have been shown to leach endocrine disrupting chemicals into the foods in these cans.

<P>

CURWOOD: So Mom can give this to you at birth.  Or if Mom opens up a can of soup that has this substance in it, you could get it at the kitchen table from Mom.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Yeah.  So there are a lot of sources.

<P>

CURWOOD: Now, there are some critics that say that lots of these substances occur naturally.  In plants, for example, you'll find estrogens and soybeans and rice and wheat and all kinds of things.  And so that we really shouldn't be worried about synthetic things that imitate hormones.  Or should we?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well, there's an important difference between the naturally occurring phyto-estrogens --

<P>

CURWOOD: Phyto-estrogen means?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   It means plant estrogen.

<P>

CURWOOD: Okay.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   And some of these synthetic substances.  This has been a very important question because the body has protective mechanisms to keep estrogen levels from exposing a developing baby, for example, to too high a level during development.  And these natural protective substances seemed to protect us also from some of the plant estrogens, and this may be a result of our evolutionary experience with these plants.  But studies are now showing that at least some of the endocrine disrupting manmade chemicals can make an end run around this protective system.  So if one is being exposed to these chemicals, all of it will be biologically active.  The body will not be keeping most of it out of circulation.

<P>

CURWOOD: Are there ways that we can protect ourselves from exposure to synthetic hormone mimickers?  What are you doing to protect yourself?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well, I am buying organic produce, which I actually have always done.  One of the reasons to buy organic produce is not only because of the pesticides that are used, but because there are so called inert ingredients in pesticides, and what we've discovered in doing the book is that some of the so-called inert ingredients are actually endocrine disrupting chemicals.  I'm as worried about those inert ingredients as I am about the active ingredient.  I don't microwave in plastic because there's no way to know which plastic is safe and which isn't, and of course we don't believe that all plastic is necessarily going to be problematic, but there's no way for a consumer at the moment to know.  And there is evidence that heating plastic will tend to accelerate the emergence of chemicals into the food or whatever's in the container.  And I try to eat low on the food chain.  And the thing that's surprising is that the kind of diet that is recommended to protect your heart, to protect you against cancer, is the same kind of diet that will protect you against endocrine disrupters.  It's a low fat diet where you're eating low on the food chain and you're eating lots of fruits and vegetables and you're not eating a lot of red meat all the time or a lot of high fat cheeses.

<P>

CURWOOD: Dianne, let's talk more about some of the possible effects that the endocrine disrupters have.  In your book you talk about hormone-like chemicals possibly affecting human behavior, and our ability to cope with stress.  Can you tell me more about these findings?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Yes.  This has been one of the sleepers in the story, I think.  There's been so much emphasis to date on estrogen mimicking chemicals and possible effects on sperm counts.  That's been the hot story.  I think that there is a new story emerging, that has to do with thyroid hormones and the possible impact of thyroid disruption on the development of the brain and behavior.

<P>

CURWOOD: Okay.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   When Theo was first doing her work, she was quite taken by a study that was done in the early 80s by a couple called the Jacobsons, who studied the children of women who had eaten Lake Michigan fish.  And they found a distinct difference in the children of these women as compared to women who had not eaten fish.

<P>

CURWOOD: And the difference was?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   They found measurable motor differences.  They found that the children weighed less; they had smaller head circumference.  And basically their neurological and motor development was retarded.

<P>

CURWOOD: Are you saying they weren't as smart as kids?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   I don't think their study, it was one where you could talk about as smart, but they were definitely slower in developing.  And these were subtle effects.  This was not what you'd call profound retardation.  It was the kind of effect that would be visible to psychologists doing sensitive tests.  But it would be within the range of normal.  The suggestion was, however, that these children had in some way been slowed down.  That they had not, because of this exposure to the chemicals in the fish, become what they might have become.  Now this study was quite controversial.  It was difficult to do, there was a lot of criticism saying well they should have done this and they should have done that.  So more recently, a team at the State University of New York at Oswego decided to try to replicate this study and to do a parallel animal study.  So they have been looking both at humans and at rats who have been eating Great Lakes fish.  And they now have preliminary results that were reported last year, and they have found many of the same effects that were found in this earlier study.  They have found there is a difference in these children.  A lot of their reflexes are different; they're not as sharp; you know, they have delayed reflexes.  And they have done tests that are thought to have, to predict intelligence later.  And there does appear to be some diminishment of babies whose mothers have eaten the astonishingly small amount of 40 pounds of Lake Ontario salmon in their entire lifetime.  Now 40 pounds of fish is not a lot of fish if you're in a sport fishing family.

<P>

CURWOOD: And the result is a little less intelligence, perhaps.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Perhaps.  Another part that seems very worrisome to me is that these infants of mothers who had eaten fish did not seem to be able to cope with stress or negative stimuli, as the psychologists would call it.

<P>

CURWOOD:  Huh.  How do you measure that?

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   This is very interesting.  They will do something to startle a sleeping baby.  They will shine, the researcher would shine a light in the baby's eye or ring a bell, and the baby will startle awake.  And the normal response is for a baby to, after it's been disturbed 2 or 3 times, to start saying oh yeah, it's that guy shining the light in my face again.  And the baby gets less upset each time; it becomes habituated.  And what the researchers at SUNY-Oswego have found is that the children of women exposed to Great Lakes, to Lake Ontario fish, don't get used to it.  Some of them get more upset as they get disturbed.  And this obviously has implications for how easy you're going to get through life if you get more and more upset at unpleasant experiences, rather than becoming used to it and letting it roll off your back.

<P>

CURWOOD: This has enormous implications for society.  You're telling me that all those cranky cab drivers and other people in traffic that I'm having a hard time with, maybe they're victims of endocrine disruption and they're less tolerant of the stress of being --

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well that's certainly a theory that we ought to explore.  Helen Daly, a researcher working with this team, did parallel work on rats to see whether rats would be a good model for exploring these effects, and she found exactly the same result in her rats.  The rats basically did fine until life got a little bit unpleasant, and then they just sort of lost it.  She used to say they would go bonkers.  So you know, if you had the same response in your personal life it's going to be very difficult for you.

<P>

CURWOOD: Well wait a second.  You're saying that these chemicals are widely dispersed in the society, that they're in virtually all of our bodies --

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   At some level.

<P>

CURWOOD: At some level.  And that research shows that if you're exposed to these chemicals...

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   You're less robust and tolerant of stress.

<P>

CURWOOD: And cranky.  So you mean society could be breaking down in part because... 

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Well I wouldn't go so far as to say that, but I'd say that you're posing a question that we'd better start researching and exploring pretty quickly.  Because I think these behavioral implications are quite worrisome.

<P>

CURWOOD: I guess they are.  My guest has been Dianne Dumanoski.  Along with Theo Colborn and John Peterson Myers, she's author of Our Stolen Future.  Thank you.

<P>

DUMANOSKI:   Thanks, Steve.

<H2>Swimming in Bleach</H2>

<P>NUNLEY: Chlorine is a chemical that in most forms is considered
highly caustic and dangerous. It's been linked to an array of health
problems. Yet few of us think twice about diving into chlorinated
swimming pools or about allowing our children to splash around in
them. Many scientists say we're right not to worry, that the small
amounts and the type of chlorine used in pools pose no threat to
swimmers or the environment. But the concern about chlorine is
leading many health advocates and pool owners to search for
alternative sanitation systems. From Los Angeles Stephanie O'Neill
has our report.</P>

<P>(Splashing and voices calling at a pool)</P>

<P>O'NEILL: The smell of chlorine hangs heavy in the air around
southern California swimming pools, but there are few complaints from
the swimmers, most of whom consider pools and chlorine as inseparable
partners.</P>

<P>(Splashing and voices continue)</P>

<P>O'NEILL: But Paul Schwartz, national campaigns director for the
Clean Water Action Foundation, a Washington, DC-based environmental
group, disagrees, and says while chlorine played a vital public
health role at the turn of the century, we have since learned of its
dark side. For instance, he says, some studies associate drinking
chlorinated water with bladder and rectal cancer. It's also been
linked to disruption of our hormonal and neurological systems. The
time has come, Mr. Schwartz says, to consider chlorine alternatives.
</P>

<P>SCHWARTZ: There are very inexpensive or relatively inexpensive off
the shelf technologies that have been in use around the world and in
the United States for decades that we could be employing for our
drinking water systems and in our pools.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: Among them, pool and spa sanitation systems that use
ultraviolet light, ozone, or bromine as disinfectants. Paul Schwartz
cites as anecdotal evidence of chorine's hazards and the safety of
alternatives the experience of his colleague Mark Johnston, who is
coach for the national championship Brown University swim team.</P>

<P>SCHWARTZ: He made the observation that you could see a sheen of
chlorine gas across the top of the water's surface, and that 14 of
his swimmers had to use the asthma medicine. That after they switched
from chlorination to ozonation, that the number of</P>

<P>swimmers who had to do that dropped from 14 to 4.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: An alternative pool sanitation method called the
bromotron has proven more effective than chlorine for swimming pool
owner Vic Hill of Kissimee, Florida. Mr. Hill says both he and his
family liked the bromotron better.</P>

<P>HILL: The water stayed crystal clear all winter, and I literally
didn't even look at it. When we had the chlorine pools, their eyes
were red; in a month the swimsuits were all faded out. That kind of
stuff doesn't happen. We never have a smell. And the water is like,
it just -- it doesn't have a chemical feel when you get in like it
used to with chlorine.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: The bromotron system uses electrolysis and bromine to
disinfect the pool. It costs about $1,500 to install. But its makers
say within 2 years it pays itself off through saved chemical costs,
as bromine, a less volatile element than chlorine, stays in the
water.</P>

<P>HILL: You test your pool once a week. You basically have the
system running, as long as your electricity doesn't go off you're
sanitizing your pool.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: Mike Robinson is CEO and president of Orlando-based
Bromotron Water Systems.</P>

<P>ROBINSON: The great thing about bromine is it doesn't gas off. So
you recycle the bromine over and over again.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: And according to Paul Schwartz of Clean Water Action,
bromine does have another advantage over chlorine.</P>

<P>SCHWARTZ: Chlorine, although it's a great disinfectant for a lot
of the microbes or bugs that are in the water supply, doesn't kill
some of the new emerging deadly viruses and parasites like the
parasite cryptosporidium.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: In Milwaukee in 1993, an outbreak of cryptosporidium in
the drinking water supply caused 100 deaths and tens of thousands of
others to become ill with severe diarrhea and dehydration. One of the
first known outbreaks happened in the 1980s, in a</P>

<P>public swimming pool in Los Angeles. Pools are considered a major
transmitter of the parasite.</P>

<P>KEBAJIAN: Had a 100,000 gallon pool, and there was one fecal
accident.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: Richard Kebajian is head of the County of Los Angeles
Department of Health Services' Recreational Heath Program.</P>

<P>KEBAJIAN: There was about 70 people that came down with it, severe
diarrhea, and it was all attributed to that one case. So it is
possible to get quite a few people sick from one fecal accident.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: Mr. Kebajian says reported cases of cryptosporidium are
on the rise. However, he's quick to add that while cryptosporidium is
generally resistant to chlorine, it can be controlled by closing the
contaminated pool and shocking it with high doses of chlorine.
Further, he says, much of the concern about chlorine is overblown.
</P>

<P>KEBAJIAN: I think at this time the best economic, safe, and
effective method of taking care of pools, of disinfecting pools,
would be using chlorine. And I don't really see any problem with
chlorine if it's used properly, if it's used in a proper manner.</P>

<P>O'NEILL: Mr. Kebajian remains skeptical that any substitute, any
bromine, will take chlorine's place. But Paul Schwartz of the Clean
Water Action Foundation says ultimately the decision belongs to
consumers, whom he says shouldn't panic but should become educated
about chlorine.</P>

<P>SCHWARTZ: I really would encourage folks to consider the
alternatives and to take a careful look at what we've been doing, and
know that there are other means and mechanisms to take care of the
potential problems of infectious diseases being spread in</P>

<P>our pools.</P>

<P>(Pool splashes and voices calling)</P>

<P>O'NEILL: For Living on Earth, I'm Stephanie O'Neill in Los
Angeles.</P>

<H2>Bill Clinton for President</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of October 18, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

written authority of World Media Foundation.</FONT><BR>

</P>

<P>It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. Ask just about anybody
including a politician if he or she is for environmental protection
and you'll almost always hear the answer yes. But then if you ask
just how much one is willing to do to protect the environment, the
answers can be widely different. Take the President of the United
States, for example. Mr. Clinton has made the call for environmental
protection a key part of his campaign, but his actions during these
past 4 years have been scattered all the way across the ecological
spectrum from green to brown. Mr. Clinton recently moved to protect
parts of the Red Rock wilderness in southern Utah, and he has made
sweeping changes in how the government regulates risky chemicals,
including pesticides. On the other hand, he cut off a bid by his own
interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, to reform grazing on public lands,
and he has failed to reduce the nation's energy consumption. All in
all, the President's policies have left many people with mixed
feelings about his first term. John Rudolph has our report.</P>

<P>(Cheering and applause)</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: September 18th, a picture-perfect day at the Grand
Canyon. The colors of the canyon walls seem to vibrate in the
sunlight as President Clinton arrives to make what the White House
calls a major environmental announcement.</P>

<P>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United
States, accompanied by the Vice President.</P>

<P>(A band plays Hail to the Chief amidst more cheering and applause)
</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: The President tells the crowd gathered on the rim of the
canyon that he's using the powers of his office to create a $1.7
million acre national monument in nearby southern Utah.</P>

<P>CLINTON: Today we are keeping faith with the future. I am about to
sign a proclamation that will establish the Grand Staircase Escalante
National Monument.</P>

<P>(Cheering and applause)</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: The timing of this announcement was not accidental. It
came during a campaign swing through the west. By establishing the
national monument, Mr. Clinton put an end to plans for a huge
underground coal mine in the middle of a vast wilderness region. The
President said the Administration will work to find other land more
suitable for coal mining.</P>

<P>CLINTON: While the Grand Staircase Escalante will be open for many
activities, I am concerned about a large coal mine proposed for the
area. Mining jobs are good jobs and mining is important to our
national economy and to our national security. But we can't have
mines everywhere, and we shouldn't have mines that threaten our
national treasures.</P>

<P>(Applause and cheers)</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: Like many of President Clinton's actions on the
environment, his decision to create the national monument in southern
Utah was a compromise. Conservation groups want even more of the
region protected, while Utah's top elected officials strongly favor
developing the state's wilderness areas. Mr. Clinton's supporters say
the Utah announcement demonstrates his ability to transform
intractable controversies into positive gains for the environment.
They point to other examples as well. The recent deal to relocate a
proposed gold mine near Yellowstone National Park. The agreements
between logging interests and environmentalists over the future of
northwestern forests. And the Brownfields Initiative, intended to
speed the industrial redevelopment of lands where toxic pollution has
been cleaned up. But some voters are disappointed in the President.
Even voters who favor his re-election.</P>

<P>(Milling conversation)</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: John Sauter and Joy Mast were in the crowd at the Grand
Canyon when the President spoke.</P>

<P>SAUTER: I don't think that the President has had a real consistent
environmental policy or has been allowed to have one. If consistency
is trying to figure out politically what's feasible, then yes, this
is entirely consistent with it.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: How would you rank your feelings about the President's
environmental record? Are you happy with it? You disappointed? Are
you --</P>

<P>MAST: I had very high expectations and mostly I expected Gore to
help a little more,</P>

<P>and Bruce Babbitt. I thought with Gore and Babbitt they'd keep
Clinton on line a little more. And more environmental issues would
get passed. Certain environmental issues may have even gotten
strengthened. And I haven't really seen it.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: In response to these kinds of complaints the President's
defenders argue that when Bill Clinton took office, expectations for
his environmental policies were unrealistically high. After all, he
picked Al Gore as his vice presidential running mate.</P>

<P>As the author of the best-selling book Earth in the Balance, Mr.
Gore had impeccable environmental credentials. Another reason may
have been the ambitious environmental agenda that candidates Clinton
and Gore laid out during the '92 campaign. They promised to pursue a
broad range of goals, including reducing solid and toxic waste and
air and water pollution, preserving places of natural beauty and
ecological importance, exerting international leadership on global
environmental issues, shattering the choice between environmental
protection and economic growth, and improving energy efficiency.</P>

<P>CLINTON: Many of our environmental problems grow directly out of
our energy practices.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: Mr. Clinton, speaking shortly afteer he was elected, at
an economic conference he organized in Little Rock, Arkansas.</P>

<P>CLINTON: It seems to me we have a real opportunity to revitalize
major sectors of the American economy without throwing it into major
dislocation with a sustained, long-term commitment to a new energy
and environmental policy. One which recognizes that sustainable
economic growth and environmental protection are compatible and
indeed interlocked.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: It's been almost 4 years since President-Elect Bill
Clinton made those remarks. And today many environmental groups
wonder what happened. Dan Becker is with the Sierra Club in
Washington, DC. Becker says Mr. Clinton has done very little to
improve energy efficiency in one of the most critical areas: the auto
industry.</P>

<P>BECKER: There were a series of things that he did agree to that
were very damaging to the environment. One of them was helping the
auto industry kill off the electric car. Another was allowing,
signing the bill that raised speed limits, which will cause not only
more traffic deaths but also more pollution on the highways. He
agreed to allow the gas tax to go down if Congress got him the bill,
and fortunately they never did. And he agreed with the auto industry
not to raise the fuel economy standards for America's cars and trucks
because the auto industry opposed doing so.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: Becker gives Mr. Clinton slightly higher marks for his
approach to global warming. Becker notes that until very recently,
the Administration continued a policy established by President George
Bush. The policy advocated voluntary measures by countries to reduce
auto emissions and other so-called greenhouse gases that are believed
to cause global warming. This summer, however, the Clinton
Administration suggested for the first time that it would favor
binding targets and timetables for cutting gas emissions. It's a
position long advocated by environmental groups and many countries.
Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt argues that the
Administration is writing some important new chapters in
environmental history.</P>

<P>BABBITT: If you look at the EPA side, and that is of course air
and water pollution, toxics, that kind of thing, there's been a
tremendous move to tighten up standards and to find innovative ways
to, of bringing, giving industry some incentive by saying if you want
to get serious about meeting the requirements, we'll be flexible
about the methodologies that you use. We don't want to regulate you
unless that's a last resort. On the natural resource side, the
progression really began with the President's forest plan, which -- I
don't think it's commonly appreciated, the importance of that. We set
aside 7 million acres of old growth forest in reserves up in the
northwest. People think of the spotted owl, but that plan was really
about protecting salmon runs, about trying to find balance in an
entire ecosystem.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: But while the Administration has scored some
environmental victories, it has also been criticized for being too
timid. In the face of strong Congressional opposition, it backed off
a plan to reform laws governing grazing and mining on Federal lands
in the West. The Administration has also been faulted for not pushing
hard enough to win reauthorization of the Clean Water Act, the
Endangered Species Act, or the Superfund program for cleaning up
toxic pollution. All this occurred in the first 2 years of the
Clinton Administration, when members of the President's own party
still controlled the House and Senate. Ironically, it took the
election of a Republican majority in Congress to inject energy into
the Clinton environmental program. Again, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt.</P>

<P>BABBITT: There's no question that the election of a new Congress
in 1994 was a wake-up call to all of us. I mean, these people came
into town and said we're going to repeal the provisions of the Clean
Water Act, we're going to gut the Endangered Species Act, we're going
to slash the Interior Department budget, take away EPA's enforcement
power. You know, they were even proposing to close down national
parks. Well I've got to tell you, honestly, sure, that sent a lot of
us to the barricades to say okay, we've got to start explaining what
we're doing and reconnect with the American people.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: President Clinton has been widely praised by
environmental groups for vetoing Republican bills that would have
weakened environmental protection laws and cut funding for
environmental programs. But those same groups also criticized the
Administration for not pursuing its own initiatives. Again, Dan
Becker of the Sierra Club.</P>

<P>BECKER: When it came to environmental protection, the Clinton
Administration was very good with the shield, but somehow they forgot
about the sword.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: Many people are clearly disappointed in the President's
environmental record. In some cases they are truly angry at him.
Environmental groups are furious at Mr. Clinton for signing a bill
permitting what's known as salvage logging in national forests. The
measure won approval in the early days of the Republican-led
Congress. It permits the removal of dead and dying trees, but critics
say it's really an excuse to allow widespread logging on Federal
lands that previously had been considered off-limits. There's also
anger among conservative Republicans over the President's veto of
virtually all the environmental legislation in the Contract With
America. Some moderate Republicans express a different concern. They
say the environment is clearly not a priority for the Clinton
Administration. Congressman Wayne Gilchrist is a Republican from
Maryland.</P>

<P>GILCHRIST: The problem with just all this negative rhetoric about
how bad Republicans are and how we're going to stop environmental
catastrophe is that that's been going on now for too long. We need
people that are going to move forward and say we have a problem with
biological diversity and here's how scientifically sound judgment is
going to be included in finding solutions. Here's a problem with
persistent toxic chemicals that have a whole range of damaging
effects on people, and here's what we're going to do to resolve that.
If all we ever do is react, react, react, and then use the
environmental issues as a political sound board, then nothing is
solved. And I think this is Mr. Clinton's record.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: Finding people who wholeheartedly support the
Administration's record on the environment is difficult, but not
impossible. Charles Wilkinson is a law professor at the University of
Colorado at Boulder and an authority on land and water issues.
Wilkinson says that by appointing people with a strong land ethic and
an environmental ideology, the President has demonstrated his
leadership.</P>

<P>WILKINSON: I am an admirer of what has happened over the last 4
years not because you can necessarily point to great bold strokes,
and I personally wish there were more of them, but nonetheless I
honestly feel that this administration has sent good people out to
deal with those problems. They've dealt with them firmly and they
have made progress. And progress sometimes comes slow. We've got to
be incrementalists.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: Wilkinson believes that if the President is re-elected,
his second term will be marked by continued progress on environmental
issues. But others disagree. Bruce McMath heads the Arkansas chapter
of the Sierra Club. He's a long-time observer of Mr. Clinton's
environmental policies both as governor of Arkansas and as President.
</P>

<P>McMATH: He's had a real interest in economic issues. He's had a
real interest in education issues. But he's never, ever, evidenced a
sincere interest in dealing withserious environmental issues of the
day. Unless, somehow or another, the environmental community can move
this issue to the top of the agenda on the public's mind, in the
public's mind. If that were to happen, I think the politician in Bill
Clinton would come forth and the environment would become a major
issue for him. But absent that is not going to be.</P>

<P>RUDOLPH: In the environmental community today, there is a shared
sense of frustration over the President's environmental record. Even
so, many environmental groups support the President's re-election,
making it clear that despite their reservations, they prefer Mr.
Clinton over his main rival, Republican Bob Dole. For Living on
Earth, this is John Rudolph.</P>

<H2>Bob Dole for President</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of October 11, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  How would Bob
Dole manage our environment if he wins the White House in November? 
That's a question that so far Mr. Dole himself has been reluctant to
answer.  The environment rarely comes up in his campaign speeches,
and he's not been available for interviews on this topic.  His
supporters say a Dole Administration would diligently protect our
life support systems.  But his opponents say he was part of a major
attempt by Congressional Republicans to roll back many environmental
protections.  Once in the White House, critics fear, he would
continue on that path.  Living on Earth's Terry FitzPatrick has our
environmental profile of Bob Dole.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: In the Cascade foothills there is a town named for a
century-old showdown between settlers and Indians.  Battleground,
Washington.</P>



<P>(Chickens cackle)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Here you'll find the farm of Chuck Cushman.</P>



<P>(A door opens)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Armed with an arsenal of computers and phone lines,
Mr. Cushman is fighting a new war for the west, a battle involving
America's environmental laws and presidential candidate Bob Dole. 
</P>



<P>(A keyboard is punched, a modem connects)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK:  Mr. Cushman is faxing a nationwide alert to his
network of 18,000 supporters.</P>



<P>CUSHMAN: This is a scorecard on how members of Congress vote on
grazing, mining, timber, private property, endangered species,
wetlands issues, all across the United States.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Mr. Cushman's organization, the League of Private
Property Voters, believes people should be compensated when laws like
the Endangered Species Act prevent them from developing their land. 
And in the group's Congressional report, Bob Dole gets a perfect
score.  On every key vote during the 104th Congress, the League had
an ally in Senator Dole.  To return the favor, Mr. Cushman has used
his fax machines to spread the word about Dole campaign events.</P>



<P>CUSHMAN: There's no question that if you're a rancher, a miner, a
logger or are interested in private property, you're more apt to vote
for Dole.  Dole is much more on those people's side.  The Clinton
Administration has demonstrated that he's not.  His constituency are
the green advocacy groups and they're anti private property and anti
mining, timber, grazing, and so that's where it stands.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: America's ranchers, miners, and loggers are a small
constituency compared to organized labor or senior citizens.  But
it's a constituency Bob Dole has gone out of his way to court.</P>



<P>(Applause and cheers)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: In July he toured remote timber towns in California
to show solidarity with those who feel President Clinton's
environmental policies have gone too far.</P>



<P>DOLE: You have been abandoned by this administration, and I think
you and your families and your communities have suffered too much. 
When I'm President of the United States, we're not going to play
games with the timber industry.  I'm going to be on your side, the
workers, the families, the communities.  That's the pledge from Bob
Dole, your candidate for President of the United States, and when I'm
elected that will happen.</P>



<P>(Applause and cheers continue)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Mr. Dole hasn't disclosed many specifics about his
own environmental policies.  So far he's stressed only that his
approach would involve straightforward common sense.</P>



<P>DOLE: We're going to ask 3 questions about every policy that
relates to the environment and the people who make their living on
the land.  Number one: is it reasonable to all concerned?  Number
two: does it look at the long term?  Number three: have we listened
to the people who are closest to the problem?  That's  you.  Listen
to the people that are closest to the problem. And...</P>



<P>(Applause and cheers)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Many who have felt the heavy hand of environmental
laws feel this approach is balanced and fair.  But to leaders of the
nation's major environmental groups, the prospect of a Dole
presidency is alarming.  They fear that the centerpiece of his
campaign, a 15% tax reduction, would result in devastating cuts at
the Environmental Protection Agency. And they say his proposal to
transfer Federal authority to the states would turn back the clock
decades to a time when local officials did little to safeguard
America's air, water, wildlife, and public lands.  Greg Wetstone is
legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</P>



<P>WETSTONE: We have reason to fear that a Dole Administration would
be very bad for the nation's environment.  We'd be seeing proposals
that would really handcuff the enforcement agencies that turn our
environmental protection laws into something meaningful as opposed to
just paper.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Two bills that Senator Dole championed during the
104th Congress might have turned the nation's environmental agencies
into paper tigers.  Both measures died in the Senate, but they do
serve as a guide to Mr. Dole's philosophy.  The first would have
required payments to businesses or land-holders when regulations
lessened the value of their property.  Environmentalists viewed it as
a back door approach to weaken enforcement of Federal rules, since
agencies can't afford to pay people to obey the law.  The second
bill, which Senator Dole called regulatory reform, would have
required agencies to conduct extensive cost-benefit studies before
issuing new rules.  This measure would have made it tougher to
prevent pollution and protect endangered species, because the value
of clean air and spotted owls can't be measured simply in dollars.
</P>



<P>WETSTONE: What this bill would do is basically require us to start
over in environmental protection.  Instead of saying let's take the
gains we've got now, the system that has worked to improve our
quality of life in giving us cleaner air and cleaner water, and build
on that system, what this bill would have done is really torn it
down.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: The Regulatory Reform Bill generated criticism from
more than environmentalists.  Charles Lewis, executive director of a
watchdog group called The Center for Public Integrity, contends part
of the proposal seemed tailored to help a Dolecampaign contributor. 
At the time, Coke Industries was facing heavy fines from government
regulators.</P>



<P>LEWIS: The government charged that Coke had spilled 2.3 million
gallons of oil in 300 spills in 6 states since 1990, and one of their
favorite members of Congress, to whom they had given more than
$200,000 over his career, Bob Dole, introduced a bill that would make
it extremely difficult for the government to do anything against
them.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Mr. Dole's staff said the bill made economic sense
and would have helped hundreds of companies.  They deny it was a
special favor for a campaign contributor.  But it wasn't the only
time questions like this have surfaced.  When it looked like this
year's Federal Farm Bill would include a tax on sugar cane growers to
clean up the damage they've caused to the Florida Everglades, Senator
Dole intervened.  He brokered a deal to shift the costs away from
sugar producers, who are also campaign contributors, and onto the
general public.  Deborah Luderbeck investigated the incident for the
watchdog group Common Cause.</P>



<P>LUDERBECK: People all across the country, many of whom had never
even seen the Everglades, are going to help pay for it to be cleaned
up.  Meanwhile, the industry that was in large part responsible for
polluting the Everglades, is not going to pay anything extra.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Again, the Dole staff denies anything improper.  And
Mr. Dole has said it was unfair to saddle a single industry with the
costs of cleaning up the Everglades.  Still, Gregory Wetstone at the
Natural Resources Defense Council sees a pattern of behind the scenes
deals for Mr. Dole's friends in industry.</P>



<P>WETSTONE: The philosophy that is reflected is not that the
polluters should pay or that, you know, each company bears a
responsibility not to pollute the environment, but instead that the
taxpayer bears a responsibility for subsidizing the cost of
protecting the environment.  That is a very troubling philosophy;
it's really at odds with the very foundation of environmental
protection law in this country as it's evolved over the past 25
years.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Mr. Dole's corporate tilt has made him a favorite of
ranchers and industry.  But it also runs the risk of alienating the
vast majority of voters who think protecting the environment is an
important Federal responsibility.  So aides have been attempting to
soften Mr. Dole's image.  Campaign brochures suggest he's been at the
forefront of environmentalism throughout his 35 years in Congress. 
One handout boasts Mr. Dole has voted in favor of America's major
environmental laws.  A close look reveals a checkered voting record,
one that has earned him a lifetime score from the League of
Conservation Voters of just 20%.  Nevertheless, many Republicans
maintain Mr. Dole is indeed a moderate when it comes to the
environment.</P>



<P>BOEHLERT: Now, if he posed a threat in the area of the
environment, that would be big news, and that would require a good
deal of explanation, but he doesn't.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Congressman Sherwood Boehlert of New York has long
</P>

<P>been considered an ally by many environmentalists. </P>



<P>BOEHLERT: I think people feel comfortable with a guy like Bob
Dole, because they know he's not an extremist in any way, shape, or
manner.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Republicans learned, during the 104th Congress, that
extremism doesn't sit well with the public.  And those who've
counseled the Republican nominee say Mr. Dole understands this. 
Former EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus predicts as President,
Mr. Dole would seek consensus instead of conflict.</P>



<P>RUCKELSHAUS: Bob Dole is no more going to try to confront public
opinion on this issue than Richard Nixon or Ronald Reagan did
ultimately.  Both of these people in fact supported regulations,
supported much of the apparatus that is currently in existence at the
national level, not because they were charter members of the Sierra
Club, but because they knew public opinion would not permit a backing
away by the government in protecting the environment, and that they'd
get in deep trouble if they tried to do that.</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: Still, Mr. Dole is facing an uphill battle because of
the public perception that his party is willing to sacrifice the
environment to foster economic growth.  And so Mr. Dole must walk a
very fine line.  Even as he reaches out to ranchers and industry to
shore up support, he must avoid being seen by the general public as
beholden to these special interests.  It's a difficult challenge but
Mr. Dole seems willing to accept it.  In California, when he told
loggers he was on their side, he quickly tempered his remarks.</P>



<P>(Applause and cheers)</P>



<P>DOLE: And although some have suggested otherwise, I don't believe
we need to choose between a strong economy and a safe environment. 
It's a false choice; we can have both in America.  We can have both
right here in Reading.  We can have both in California.  We don't
need to put one against the other.  So...</P>



<P>(Applause and cheers)</P>



<P>FITZPATRICK: So far, Mr. Dole has done little to attract the
environmental vote to his side.  And with less than a month left in
the campaign there seems little chance he could do so before election
day.  Throughout his candidacy, he seems to have taken a strategy of
damage control, simply avoiding anything that would mobilize
environmental voters to actively work against him.  For Living on
Earth, this is Terry FitzPatrick reporting.</P>

<H2>The Youth Vote</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of October 18, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: This year marks the 25th anniversary of the 26th
Amendment to the US Constitution, which gave 18-year-olds the right
to vote. And according to a preliminary survey of voter registration
data, more people under the age of 25 are eligible to go to the polls
now than ever before. As Living on Earth's Liz Lempert explains, the
act of participation of the young electorate could have a significant
impact on the environmental vote.</P>

<P>(Rock music plays)</P>

<P>LEMPERT: They're often referred to disparagingly as slackers, or
Generation X: teens and 20-somethings with no identity and no ideals.
But in the parking lot of a concert pavilion on the outskirts of
Boston, these labels don't seem to fit, especially when it comes to
the environment.</P>

<P>SMITH: Hi, I'm Janet Smith from Marshfield. I think we're
basically, like, killing our own homes. And we need to, like, save
that because what's left after this? I mean we're not going to be
able to just magically transport ourselves to a new planet.</P>

<P>HICKEY: My name's Ron Hickey and I'm 23. All the big businesses,
if you don't watch them they're just going to love to throw all that
stuff in the rivers and whatnot, you know?</P>

<P>ANGELA: My name's Angela, I'm 16 and I'm from Newburyport,
Massachusetts. My parents don't recycle, so I have to try to do it
sometimes.</P>

<P>LEMPERT: Poll after poll suggests young Americans share a
deep-seated concern about pollution and over-use of the planet's
resources. One survey conducted by researchers at the University of
California at Los Angeles found that 84% of college freshmen think
the government is not doing enough to protect the environment.
According to pollster Jeffrey Pollack, although economic and personal
security are young peoples' top concerns...</P>

<P>POLLACK: On a second level, once we get past crime and the
economy, the environment is right up there. It's as important to
young people in many places as education, one of the most important
issues.</P>

<P>LEMPERT: This fact is not lost on environmental activists. In May
the Sierra Club commissioned a poll of young voters to find out
whether their green views translate into green votes. In the survey
18 to 24 year olds were questioned about a hypothetical candidate for
Congress. This candidate was a sort of environmental Neanderthal who
received money from oil and logging companies, voted to close
national parks, clear-cut national forests, and open up Alaska
wilderness to drilling. Over 75% of those polled expressed serious
doubts about the candidate. Adam Werbach is president of the Sierra
Club, and at age 24 a young voter himself.</P>

<P>WERBACH: What we found, which was surprising to us, was that the
environment has become such a norm with young voters, more than any
other age group, that if a representative actually votes against the
environment, that raises more character doubts in young voters' minds
than any other single issue. More than crime, more than the deficit,
more than the national debt.</P>

<P>LEMPERT: The problem is, whether it's due to cynicism, apathy, or
a combination of both, most young people don't vote. In 1992, only
43% of 18 to 24 year olds voted, far below voter turnout in the rest
of the electorate. Senior citizens in contrast voted at a rate of
70%. Therese Helitzer says she was once turned off by politics
herself.</P>

<P>HELITZER: When I was in college I didn't really respect the
democratic process because I felt, like, you know, oh, well my vote
really doesn't matter anyway, and look at all this money and how much
it costs to run for office. This democratic process seemed really on
another level and not really affecting my life.</P>

<P>LEMPERT: Then she realized that elected officials make decisions
that impact the issues she cares about. Now 25, Therese Helitzer is
president of Campus Green Vote, a national organization trying to
move students from the recycling bin to the ballot box. Campus Green
Vote is only one of several organizations hoping to increase youth
voter registration this year.</P>

<P>(A man shouts: "Register to vote! Rock the vote! Who would like to
rock with us today? You can do it right here...")</P>

<P>LEMPERT: A pioneer in the voting is cool campaign is MTV, the rock
video music channel. In a concrete plaza on campus, students at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst flock around MTV's choose or
lose bus, listening to rock music, watching music videos, and filing
out voter registration forms.</P>

<P>(Man: "Register to vote today, folks! Allow yourselves to have the
opportunity to go to the polls rockin'!")</P>

<P>LEMPERT: MTV, Campus Green Vote, and a coalition of other youth
groups have registered close to three quarters of a million young
people since January. This year's youth turnout could also be
influenced by a 1993 Federal law. Nicknamed "motor voter," it
requires states to offer voter registration to people when they apply
for driver's licenses. So far, it seems young people benefit the most
from easier registration. One recent poll reports that 40% of the 11
million people brought onto the rolls by the law have been under the
age of 29. If the efforts of MTV and Campus Green Vote succeed, and
if those people registering under motor voter turn up at the polls on
November 5th, young voters could have a dramatic effect on the
American political landscape. Richard Tao is executive director of
Third Millennium, a lobbying group for people in their 20s and 30s.
</P>

<P>TAO: Imagine if you woke up on November 6th, the day after the
election, and you saw that young people and senior citizens had voted
at the same rate. They both, let's say, voted at a rate of 70%.
Suddenly politicians would be tripping over each other to figure out
how to please young people. They'd be doing everything they could to
more aggressively protect the environment. Overnight you would
transform the political process.</P>

<P>(Rock music plays)</P>

<P>LEMPERT: The 43 million potential voters under age 30 and largely
uncommitted in their party affiliations could be a potential gold
mine for politicians and for the environmental movement. For Living
on Earth, this is Liz Lempert in Boston.</P>

<H2>Enviros Target GOP Freshmen in Washington State</H2>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. Two years ago
Washington State led the Republican Congressional sweep. Disgruntled
voters ousted more Democrats from office there than anywhere else in
the nation. The Republicans who took over promised less environmental
regulations and decreased governmental control. But it now appears
Washington voters don't like the results. Republican efforts to
weaken the nation's environmental laws apparently clash with a deep
Green ethic among many Northwest voters. And now the state's freshman
delegation is scrambling in the face of an assault from environmental
activists. From Seattle, Jennifer Schmidt of member station KPLU
reports.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: High in the Cascade Mountains, dozens of campers bundle
up in wool sweaters and stoke campfires to fight off the evening
chill. They're here for a weekend of grassroots organizing. After
settling in, the group gets down to business.</P>

<P>WOMAN: Do you want to be part of the legislative update? Stay in
this site here. And citizen monitoring of timber sales over that way.
</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: There are plenty of seasoned environmentalists at this
gathering and a few unexpected newcomers. Like Joanne Wood, a
grandmother from suburban Seattle. Wood has started volunteering with
her local Sierra Club chapter and says she also plans to make her
voice heard this year at the ballot box.</P>

<P>WOOD: Now I will be voting for candidates who are concerned about
our environment, definitely.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Do you typically vote Republican or Democrat?</P>

<P>WOOD: Republican. But I don't know if that's going to be the case.
We did enact laws for a reason, and I don't like to see my party
overturning the very laws that we put through with a great deal of
effort, and I'm not for that.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Neither is camper Peter Ilian with the group Christians
for Environmental Stewardship.</P>

<P>ILIAN: The environment's a paramount issue for me, and growing in
a paramount issue for a lot of my Christian friends. And the only
Christian response to environmental issues is one of stewardship. You
know, we're not against using resources. But when species go extinct,
you know, we're sinning.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Washington environmentalists are heartened by the
presence of moderate Republicans and Christian conservatives at their
gatherings. The Sierra Club's Julia Reitan says it shows that efforts
to educate state voters about Congress's environmental record are
paying off.</P>

<P>REITAN: Our sense is that the environment is consistently talked
about as an issue of grave concern to a lot of the public, and an
issue that will have an impact on this election.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: The Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters are
banking on a belief that environmental protection can be a vote
getter this year. These groups are pouring millions of dollars into
unprecedented ad campaigns aimed at unseating what they call
anti-environmental extremists in Congress. One of their targets in
Washington State is freshman Republican Randy Tate.</P>

<P>(Woman's voice-over with suspenseful music: "Congressman Tate
voted 4 times to limit your right to know about new toxic chemicals
released into our air and water." Man: "The Clean Water Act." Woman:
"And Tate voted to weaken the Clean Water Act</P>

<P>that protects Puget Sound from sewage and industrial pollution.")
</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: The ads seem to be striking a chord with voters, and have
put Randy Tate on the defensive.</P>

<P>(Music: "I Miss You Like Crazy." A knock on the door.)</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: As he canvasses his district, passing out campaign
literature, one resident challenges Tate on his environmental record.
</P>

<P>TATE: Mr. Schock.</P>

<P>SCHOCK: Yeah.</P>

<P>TATE: I'm Randy Tate.</P>

<P>SCHOCK: Oh, how about that, I voted for you.</P>

<P>TATE: Hey, well thank you very much.</P>

<P>SCHOCK: Yeah.</P>

<P>TATE: I wanted to drop off one of my flyers and let you know I'm
running, and that I need your help again. And the brochure covers a
bunch of different issues trying to cut taxes for working people, to
saving Medicare for senior citizens, to trying to clean up Congress
which has been corrupt.</P>

<P>SCHOCK: What about clean water?</P>

<P>TATE: I'm for clean water.</P>

<P>SCHOCK: Eh?</P>

<P>TATE: Yes, sir. Absolutely. In fact I -- as a lifelong --</P>

<P>SCHOCK: What about that negative advertisement I heard on the
radio? That said you voted against clean water.</P>

<P>TATE: No. A couple of points that I would make on that is, I'm
born and raised in this area. I live in Puolock. My daughter drinks
water every single day, I drink the water --</P>

<P>SCHOCK: ...we have good water around here.</P>

<P>TATE: Yeah.</P>

<P>SCHOCK: What about --</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Tate stands behind his votes to increase logging and
national forests and slash the budget of the Environmental Protection
Agency. He says he's taking a balanced approach.</P>

<P>TATE: I've tried to focus in on common sense environmental issues
that have broad support and take a reasonable, moderate stand on
environmental issues, stay away from the extremes, and try to do
things that really improve people's lives and their quality of life.
</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Tate isn't the only Republican Congressman on
environmentalists' hit list. They've also kept the heat on freshman
Rick White. White represents a fiscally conservative suburban Seattle
district with a strong environmental bent. Many of his constituents
work in the software industry, and typify a new breed of Washington
resident: people who say they've come to the northwest for the
quality of life and who spend their substantial discretionary income
on outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and sea kayaking. White
seems to have gotten the message. After towing the party line early
on, these days he's considered the most environmentally friendly of
the state's Republican delegation. He's even backing a $100 million
plan to tear down 2 Washington dams to restore salmon runs. During an
interview in his Olympic peninsula office, White dismisses those who
say he's recasting his environmental image for political gain.</P>

<P>WHITE: I just have to chuckle when I hear that. I mean, you know,
I've lived here all my life. I've climbed every single peak and you
can look out this window and see 7 of the 8 peaks that I've climbed
over the last 5 years. There's no way in the world I ever would have
done anything to jeopardize that, and it's something that I started
out with. Now, there may be some people in the party who have seen
the light here in recent months, but I started out knowing that we
needed to change these laws, but knowing that we had to change them
in a way that would improve the environment. And really what's
happened is, I've been making that argument in my party.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Just how important the environment is to voters is
unclear. Nationwide polls have found that support for environmental
protection is widespread. But in Washington State the environment may
not be the number one agenda. In fact, state polls suggest protecting
the environment ranks below such issues as taxes, education, crime,
and the deficit. In small Washington communities like Goldbar, once a
thriving timber town northeast of Seattle, anger over environmental
regulations still runs deep. Long time resident Stephanie Vaughan
says such regulations have devastated the local economy.</P>

<P>VAUGHAN: People have lost jobs. You know, states try to re -- you
know, to help with programs, setting them up. But it's pretty hard to
train 40-year-old men, retrain them and whatever, and it's devastated
families, it's -- I've seen families move away, divorce, I've lived
out here for 22 years so I -- it was definitely a timber community
and now it isn't.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: The stakes in this election are high. Republicans need
these seats to help maintain control of Congress. Environmentalists
are banking on their high visibility, high priced ad campaign to help
elect lawmakers more sympathetic to environmental protection. They're
looking at the northwest as a key testing ground for their new
strategy of attacking candidates directly rather than pouring funds
into challengers' campaigns. Washington pollster Stuart Elway says
it's hard to tell how effective the environmental attack will be, but
he says Washington State is a good place to find out.</P>

<P>ELWAY: We are historically an independent voting state. We split
the ticket all the time. So I think both of those things make
Washington a real good test case. And if an environmental group can't
sell an environmental message in Washington and Oregon, they're sure
as heck not going to sell them in Wyoming or New Jersey.</P>

<P>SCHMIDT: Environmental groups say they'll continue running their
ads up til the election. Meanwhile, conservative groups have started
counter-attacking with their own ads defending Washington State's
besieged Republican delegation. For Living on Earth, I'm Jennifer
Schmidt in Seattle.</P>

<H2>Perot for President</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of October 4, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

</P>

<P>In 1992 H. Ross Perot captured 19% of the popular vote. Some say
he spoiled the reelection bid of Republican President George Bush and
left Bill Clinton without a clear mandate. This time around the
pollsters say Mr. Perot is not getting the support he had before,
though he still could make the difference in closely-contested
states. What makes this Perot candidacy most important, perhaps, is
the Reform Party he has started. A respectable showing by him this
year will give the Reform Party Federal dollars no matter who its
candidate is in the year 2000. And what kind of environmental legacy
is being created for the Reform Party? We asked David Wright of
member station KQED in San Francisco to do a little digging into Mr.
Perot's views on the environment. Here's what he found.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Ross Perot has 2 minds when it comes to the environment.
The dichotomy's been apparent since the night in 1992 when he first
confessed his presidential ambitions to CNN's Larry King. On one
side, the part of Mr. Perot that's given to sweeping generalities and
lofty statements of principle makes a firm stand for the environment.
</P>

<P>PEROT: This is our home. The planet is our home. If we destroy the
planet we've destroyed our home. So it is fundamentally important.
</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Fundamentally important, except for those other priorities
that for Mr. Perot are apparently even more fundamentally important.
The other side of Ross Perot is a pragmatist, a man who deals with
first things first. And for him, the environment doesn't come first.
</P>

<P>PEROT: If we're broke, we can't fix the environment. We have got
to rebuild our industrial base. We've got to put our people back to
the work to have the flow of money to do this.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Ross Perot hasn't said much on the environment, but he's
said enough to raise some serious doubts in the minds of
environmental leaders.</P>

<P>POPE: Ross Perot unfortunately has shown himself in the last 4
years to be know nothing on the environment.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Carl Pope is the executive director of the National Sierra
Club.</P>

<P>POPE: When he entered the race in 1992, the Sierra Club and other
environmental groups tried to work with him. We went down to Texas,
we met with the staff, we prepared papers for him. We thought he
might demonstrate some real fiscal understanding of the fact that
environmental protection is both good for business and good for the
Federal budget. But since that time Perot has demonstrated a real
shallowness and a lack of seriousness about the issue.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Take for instance remarks Mr. Perot made last month to
members of the Commonwealth Club of California. The day was September
18th and President Clinton was at the Grand Canyon declaring
thousands of acres of Utah wilderness a national monument in order to
protect it from coal mining. Asked whether he supports the
President's action, Ross Perot didn't hesitate.</P>

<P>PEROT: I'd have to look at it, study it, and analyze it. I
haven't. And I will not jump into an empty swimming pool at night.
</P>

<P>WRIGHT: He then went on to volunteer his views on an environmental
controversy he's taken more of an interest in: the spotted owl in the
Pacific Northwest.</P>

<P>PEROT: I have looked at a few owls; I was up in Washington State
and the people were so worried about this huge area they wouldn't let
them do any timber cutting on because of these owls, and I finally
asked a relevant question. I said how many owls are there? They said
20. And I said okay, I suggest we send Air Force One out here,
transport them in absolutely first class comfort to the nearest
national park. Now the owls can live happily ever after in hundreds
of thousands of acres in some nearby park, and we can go back to work
here. Well shucks, we hadn't thought about that. I rest my case.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: It's not the first time Ross Perot has proposed a get
under the hood and fix it solution to sensitive issues such as
habitat conservation and biodiversity. In 1992 he outraged
environmentalists in Alaska when he told a Fairbanks talk radio host
that he'd like to see the US drill for oil in ANWAR, the Alaskan
National Wildlife Refuge.</P>

<P>PEROT: If we're really, really lucky, as a country, this could be
like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that could pay
off the national debt. Think about it.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: People who know Ross Perot attribute his apparent lack of
enthusiasm for environmental issues to his background.</P>

<P>POSNER: Part of the problem with Perot is he's so pro-business.
It's all about business. It screams business. He comes from that
business environment. And therefore if you had to put him on a
pro-development or pro-environment side that is at this conflict that
there is in Washington State and elsewhere and all over, I find, and
I would think Perot's more pro-development.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Gerald Posner conducted numerous interviews with the Texas
businessman for his recent biography Citizen Perot: His Life and
Times. Posner notes that many goals of the environmental movement
would seem to be in synch with Ross Perot's overall philosophy. But
he says Mr. Perot doesn't seem to recognize the connection between
environmental concerns and his desire not to squander American
resources and to preserve a legacy for our children. As a result,
Posner says, Mr. Perot is not ideologically opposed to environmental
protections. He just doesn't give it much thought.</P>

<P>POSNER: It's more an insensitivity, I think. I think he could care
about the environment, if he focused on it, but I don't think he
really cares right now because it's not an issue high on his agenda.
He thinks there are more pressing problems. The deficit finances
figures, money seems to him more important than some endangered
species.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: In fact, the times Ross Perot has taken a strong stand on
the environment have tended to be in the service of issues in which
he has a greater interest. For instance, he spoke out against the
likely environmental consequences of free trade, but it was just one
of several arguments he raised against the North American Free Trade
Agreement. He's called for a 50-cent-a-gallon gas tax, but primarily
as a way of weaning America from its dependence on foreign oil in the
wake of the Gulf War. For leaders of the environmental movement, like
the Sierra Club's Carl Pope, those isolated positions do not
constitute a coherent environmental policy.</P>

<P>POPE: If he appeared to understand that if we're going to leave a
world behind for our children we have to take care of our
environment, I would be much more impressed. I mean, it is the
shallowness of his approach. Most public officials, they may be good
on the environment, they may be bad on the environment. Most
candidates at least appear to want to talk about what their approach
is. Sometimes they lie. But he just kind of goes woof, you know, I'm
not going to chase that hamster. And it's -- it's disturbing.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: Beyond Ross Perot's words about the environment, he can
also be judged by his actions. On one hand, he gave the city of
Austin, Texas, a blank check to try to keep alive the city's ancient
treaty oak. Also, the various companies Mr. Perot has been involved
with over the years are not corporate polluters. But there are at
least 2 incidents that mar his record. One involved some Austin land
that a Perot affiliated company tried to develop even after concerns
were raised over habitat it contained for the golden cheeked warbler,
then listed as a threatened species. The other incident had to do
with a coral reef offshore from Mr. Perot's house in Bermuda. Again,
biographer Gerald Posner.</P>

<P>POSNER: Perot denies this and said no, it's not quite like this or
that. But evidently there was this coral reef which is getting in the
way of unfortunately getting his boat a little bit closer to the
house. The coral reef's no longer there, is my understanding; the
boat is docked right next to the house. So sometimes, you know,
things will be pushed aside. A billionaire can get his way. Nature
should not stand in the way.</P>

<P>WRIGHT: With his record as with his rhetoric, Mr. Perot seems to
be of 2 minds when it comes to the environment. It's fundamentally
important except when it gets in the way. For Living on Earth, I'm
David Wright in San Francisco.</P>

<H2>Hunting Initiative in Idaho</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of October 4, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: In November, voters in 9 states will decide on ballot
initiatives that concern hunting wildlife. Those opposed to such
measures accuse animal rights groups of trying to do away with
hunting altogether. Those who support them say they're just trying to
make hunting more ethical and sportsmanlike. From member station KPSU
in Boise, Idaho, Jyl Hoyt reports.</P>

<P>(Man: "That's good, okay." A dog barks. Man: "Go get your frisbee.
Go get your frisbee. Come on. Get your frisbee, let's play.")</P>

<P>HOYT: Retired postal worker Don Clower plays with his hunting dog
in his back yard, near Boise. Most of the time he's off in the woods
dressed in fatigues, hunting bear, deer, and birds.</P>

<P>CLOWER: I love to hunt. My wife said I'd hunt grasshoppers if they
had a season.</P>

<P>HOYT: Don Clower, a tall Texas native, heads a large coalition of
hunters fighting an Idaho ballot initiative that would restrict bear
hunting. Supporters of the measure say its purpose is to make hunting
more sportsmanlike, but Mr. Clower isn't so sure.</P>

<P>CLOWER: It's a hoax. If you read their, their literature, their
goal is to stop all sport hunting in the United States.</P>

<P>HOYT: Mr. Clower also questions who's behind the measure.</P>

<P>CLOWER: It's being perpetuated on the people of this state by
animal rights groups who are trying to impose their moral and ethical
values on the rest of the people.</P>

<P>HOYT: Stuart Churchwell, a leading advocate of the bear
initiative, says such accusations couldn't be more wrong, and points
to himself as living proof. He wears a jacket he crafted from an elk
he shot. Mr. Churchwell says advocates of the initiative include not
only animal rights groups like the Humane Society of the US, but also
hunters like himself. The bear initiative would not ban hunting, Mr.
Churchwell insists. It would simply restrict the most backward
practices, like hunting with dogs. Mr. Churchwell used to stalk bears
with dogs, but he doesn't any more.</P>

<P>(Sound of dogs barking during a hunt)</P>

<P>CHURCHWELL: It's a very cruel sport, and anyone who has ever
witnessed the screams of an animal being torn apart by a pack of
dogs, if you have any kind of compassion at all or love for wildlife
like I do, you just can't justify it, the activity.</P>

<P>HOYT: Supporters of the initiative are distributing a graphic
video showing the practices the measure's authors hope to stop.</P>

<P>(Barking continues. A gun shot. Barking continues. Man: "Hit 'em
again! Hit 'em again!")</P>

<P>HOYT: Besides banning hound hunting, the ballot question would
prevent sportsmen from shooting bears in the spring. Backers say bear
hunting should be limited to the fall when cubs are older. Bear
hunter Doug Clower chafes at that notion.</P>

<P>CLOWER: I really do enjoy eating bear meat, especially spring
bear. Spring bear is the absolute very best.</P>

<P>HOYT: The initiative would also stop bear baiting. Setting out
bacon grease or jelly donuts to attract the animals. Many of the
initiative's opponents say bear baiting is a useful tool for wildlife
management, because it allows hunters to see bears up close before
they shoot, permitting fish and game officials to control how many of
each sex are killed. But Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society of the
US says bear baiting is just a lazy way to hunt. And he says luring
the animals with human foods creates nuisance bears who raid
campsites, break into cabins, and harass hikers.</P>

<P>PACELLE: One of the principal reasons that bears do that is
because they are fed during legalized bear baiting seasons a variety
of foods with human scents all over them.</P>

<P>HOYT: To find out what effect the bear initiative might have in
Idaho, many are looking to Colorado, where voters passed a similar
measure in 1992. The 2 sides of this debate draw very different
lessons from the evidence. Opponents point out there are more problem
bears in Colorado since the initiative passed. Supporters acknowledge
this, but say the increase in bear incidents has more to do with
demographics than the new law. More than 300,000 people have moved to
Colorado the past 3 years. And many of them have built homes in bear
habitat. Wildlife biologists add that drought and difficult weather
are partly responsible for the growth in bear problems. Lynn
Fritchman says there's another thing. Colorado's experience shows
that restricting hunting practices can actually improve the sport.
</P>

<P>FRITCHMAN: The annual harvest of bears in Colorado now is not as
high as it was prior to the passage of the initiative, and this has
all been done in the fall season and it's being done without the use
of bait or hounds.</P>

<P>HOYT: Lynn Fritchman is a retired Army officer, and author of the
initiative. He's been a hunter most of his life.</P>

<P>(Zipper. Clicks of rifle parts)</P>

<P>HOYT: As he pulls out and examines his rifle, he says values are
changing here because many urban professionals are moving from
coastal states to the Rocky Mountain states. While his opponents call
his ballot initiative a threat to the hunter, Lynn Fritchman says
unless the hunting community becomes enlightened, more serious
restrictions could be in store.</P>

<P>FRITCHMAN: What will place hunting in jeopardy is most people's
perception that hunters are bunch of slobs, and these types of
hunting methods are what create that image in people's minds.</P>

<P>HOYT: Although no polls have been done this year, a 1994 Idaho
poll showed support for new hunting rules. One factor that makes it
difficult to predict the election results is that the environmental
community is split on the initiative. Because of a quirk in Idaho
law, the measure, if passed, would take bear management away from
state fish and game officials and give it to the legislature, a
possibility that worries some environmentalists. For Living on Earth,
I'm Jyl Hoyt in Boise, Idaho.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Idaho isn't the only state in which voters will decide if
new restrictions on hunting are needed.  Massachusetts, Michigan, and
Washington have initiatives that would ban bear baiting and hunting
with dogs.  Colorado, which passed such a measure 2 years ago, is
asking voters if stricter rules are needed by abolishing leg hold
trapping and wildlife poisoning.  An Alaska proposal would halt
spotting wolves from airplanes before hunting them.  But in Oregon,
where citizens voted to ban hunting and hounding 2 years ago, the
measure is now up for repeal.</P>

<H2>NYT's Timothy Egan on Politics and the Environment</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of September 20, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

written authority of World Media Foundation.</FONT><BR>

</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Last year President Clinton angered environmentalists when
he signed a budget bill containing the so-called Salvage Logging
Rider. The measure opened up vast tracts of ancient forest to
logging, mostly in the western states. Now Mr. Clinton appears to be
making amends. On September 18th in Seattle the President announced a
land swap deal with timber companies that he said would protect large
tracts of old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier in the
day with the Grand Canyon as a backdrop he designated nearly 2
million acres in Utah's Red Rock wilderness as a national monument.
The move will prevent mining companies from developing massive coal
reserves buried there. With us to discuss this development and an
array of environmental politics in the west is Timothy Egan, Seattle
Bureau Chief of the New York Times. He says the President's
announcement in Utah will go a long way to solidify environmentalist
support.</P>

<P>EGAN: Remember in, late in Jimmy Carter's term, he declared much
of the Alaska wilderness to be off limits to development. He did this
by Executive Order. Similarly, Clinton has been told that he could,
by Executive Order, declare some of the Red Rock country of Utah
that's now in play, there's a giant Dutch-owned coal mining company,
Andalax, that wants to build a big coal mine in the middle of the Red
Rock, Utah, wilderness. By declaring it a national monument he could
just usurp Congress and bingo, it would be protected under the same
protection that something that's in the National Park System has. So
the greens are saying you do this, you'll be back as a hero. Now,
he'll tick off a lot of rural westerners, but they feel like those
people are not in the majority anyway, and there's no traction for
Dole anywhere in the west, so they feel it's a political calculation
they can live with.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: So, what has Bob Dole been saying to western voters?</P>

<P>EGAN: The Dole campaign is really missing an opportunity. He's
been going around, in his rare visits to western areas -- for
example, he was in Billings, Montana, a few weeks ago. He was in Salt
Lake City, Utah, also a week or so ago. And he's been saying that the
Clinton Administration is waging a quote, "War on the west." Now,
this is a term that was used effectively by the Wise Use Movement 2
years ago --</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Right --</P>

<P>EGAN: -- to describe measures by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
to restrict grazing or to restrict mining, to protect wild lands or
endangered species. Well, war on the west is not being used this time
around, because it has no traction. It is hurting Republicans. Newt
Gingrich went around and told Republican candidates, "Don't use that
term." But apparently the message has not gotten through to the head
of the ticket yet.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Now, how many House seats are up for grabs in the western
states?</P>

<P>EGAN: Well let's look at the big picture first. Remember that the
Democrats need about a net gain of 20 seats in order to change the
House from Republican back to Democrat. They think they can get half
of those -- half of them -- in the west. Where do they get them? They
get 6 in California. They get at least 1 in Oregon. They think they
can get another 2 to 3 in Washington State. Washington State, by the
way, had the biggest swing 2 years ago from Democrat to Republican.
It went from an overwhelmingly Democratic delegation to an
overwhelmingly Republican delegation, so it's a big, you know, sort
of soccer mom suburban vote swing state. So they think they can pick
up 2 or 3 there. Then they go to Idaho, where there's a target they
really want to knock off; that's Helen Chenowith. Then you go down to
Arizona, where the Democrats think they can get at least 1 pickup.
And again, they expect to get one seat in Colorado as well. So
looking at just the western landscape, which putting aside California
and Oregon is traditionally thought to be big Republican territory,
the Dems, ironically, think they're going to make their biggest gains
in the west. And they're going to make them largely on the issue of
the environment.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: What are some of these House races in which environmental
issues are coming up?</P>

<P>EGAN: In the state of Washington you have a very interesting race
going on with Rick White. Now, Rick White started out a freshman
Republican and he voted initially against some environmental
measures. Then his second year, he voted strongly for them. He's one
of the few Republicans that has a semi-decent environmental record.
The League of Conservation Voters, for example, gave him a 30 rating,
and now there's a big internal dispute among the Sierra Club and the
League of Conservation Voters as to whether they should lay off on
Rick White because they do not want to be seen as just supporting all
the members of one party. White has also made a big issue now, and
this is really, I think, an incredible demonstration of how far the
issue's moved -- he's made a big deal of favoring tearing down a dam
on the Olympic Peninsula, a dam that's destroyed one of the great
salmon runs in North America -- it's called the Elwa Dam. It would
cost taxpayers about $100 million to tear the dam down, but
supposedly it would bring back this huge salmon run. Ten years ago
tearing down that dam was an issue for Earth First, the, you know,
the radical anti-environmental group.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Mm hm. One of their very first actions, I believe.</P>

<P>EGAN: Exactly. And now you have this freshman Republican, scion of
this great oil family, advocating what Earth First first advocated 10
years ago.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: And what about the Senate races? I've heard Senator Larry
Craig of Idaho is facing a pretty tough re-election battle.</P>

<P>EGAN: Idaho is probably the second most Republican state in the
nation right after Utah. Democrats there are almost an endangered
species. Clinton ran third in the 1992 election. Now, you have a
challenge there by a member of the Board of Directors of the
Wilderness Society, a person named Walt Minic. He's well-financed and
he's making a run at Craig. The latest polls show him within 10
points, which in itself is just astonishing. Idaho is one of those
states that's had a lot of newcomers. They come to the state
primarily for quality of life, and the environment is a huge issue
there. In fact, Minic is trying to make it the number one issue. The
other interesting thing there that's driving that race is a ballot
measure to keep nuclear waste out of the state if Idaho. The person
behind that is Bruce Willis, the actor, who happens to own most of a
small town south of Sun Valley. Now, Bruce Willis is a Republican.
But since he's moved his family to southern Idaho and he's raising
his kids there, he found out that he's living in a state that may
soon become a nuclear waste dump. So he helped to finance this ballot
measure to keep nuclear waste out of Idaho. But the Republican
establishment is against that ballot measure, that is, they're for
bringing nuclear waste into Idaho. And Minic is just driving this
thing all the way to November 5 in the Senate race.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Sounds like in some sense the environment has become the
fulcrum on which that '94 revolution has sort of gone flat.</P>

<P>EGAN: Yeah, I think that's fascinating, because House Speaker
Gingrich, I think, misread the mandate of the new western
Congresspeople. He let people like Helen Chenowith or J.D. Hayworth
of Arizona become very high profile, and they would go around, they'd
speak at the Wise Use property conferences and they'd say we're going
to destroy the Endangered Species Act. And they'd say we're going to
drive the environmentalists to the sea. And that just scared a lot of
people. So what happened was, they misread what came out of the west
in '94, and now it's coming around to haunt them. And I think it's
important to look at the historical shift in the west right now. You
haven't had the Democrats win the state of Arizona since 1948;
they're leading by 10 points down there. The Democrats may take every
western state except for Utah and Idaho, and that would be a shift of
truly historic dimensions saying that -- not saying necessarily that
the west is becoming more liberal, more Democrat, but simply saying
that the majority of people out here care about environmental issues,
and the party that goes against those does so at their peril.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: My guest has been Timothy Egan, Seattle Bureau Chief of
the New York Times. Thanks for being with us, Tim.</P>

<P>EGAN: Sure, it's been a pleasure.</P>

<H2>Oregon's Senate Race</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of September 20, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>NUNLEY: We focus now on one of the more closely contested races in
the west. It's in Oregon, where 5-term Republican Senator Mark
Hatfield is retiring, and Republicans have nominated State Senator
Gordon Smith to replace him. Now, Smith lost a close race to Democrat
Ron Wyden in a January special election that was held to replace Bob
Packwood. Political newcomer Tom Brugerre, a computer software
entrepreneur, is the Democratic challenger this time around. The
environment is always an issue in Oregon politics, but in this race
it may be the deciding factor. From Oregon Public Broadcasting, Ley
Garnett reports.</P>

<P>(Convention emcee: "This time, we all are pointed and we're going
to elect Gordon Smith and he's going to be the next United States
Senator and here he is." Applause and cheers.)</P>

<P>GARNETT: Gordon Smith gets a rousing reception from a convention
of Republican activists in Bend, Oregon. Mr. Smith needs a big
turnout in this region, because it's the state's only Republican
stronghold. Bend is located in central Oregon, just east of the
Cascade Mountains, which divide Oregon politically as well as
geographically. Most of the state's residents live in the western
half of the state, where support for the environment is strong. But
in eastern and central Oregon, where the government owns about two
thirds of the land, and where logging, ranching, and farming support
the economy, Federal environmental regulations are unpopular. Gordon
Smith's laissez faire message plays well here.</P>

<P>SMITH: The genius of America, its past and its future greatness,
is predicated not on big government, not on big bureaucracy, but on
allowing free people to pursue their dreams and engage in enterprise.
</P>

<P>GARNETT: Candidate Smith is vying for the senate seat long held by
political maverick Republican Mark Hatfield, whose coalition often
included a share of the green vote. Mr. Smith is a product of the
conservative right wing of the Oregon Republican Party, but he knows
he must offer himself as a moderate and cast his opponent as out of
step.</P>

<P>SMITH: Everywhere I go I see farmers and ranchers meeting with
local officials, environmental activists, coming up with voluntary
watershed programs. All over, in my district, in this area. And are
making enormous progress. But for some people like my opponent,
apparently that's not good enough. Apparently that's not good enough.
</P>

<P>GARNETT: But Mr. Smith's opponent, Tom Bruggere, says that's not
true. That he's not opposed to local involuntary solutions to
environmental problems when Federal regulations aren't needed. Mr.
Bruggere says Gordon Smith is a Newt Gingrich Republican masquerading
as a moderate.</P>

<P>(Ambient conversation backdrop)</P>

<P>BRUGGERE: One of the reasons I'm running is because I believe that
this movement on the part of the Republicans, the Conservatives in
this country, to weaken or do away with our environmental laws, leads
us to the kind of country that I wouldn't want my 7-year-old daughter
or my 5-year-old son to grow up in.</P>

<P>GARNETT: Tom Bruggere developed his environmental beliefs as a
child of the 60s in Berkeley, California. About 20 years ago he moved
to Oregon and founded the computer software company that made him a
multimillionaire. He's made the environment a central theme of his
campaign, but he suffered some bumps and bruises in the process.</P>

<P>BRUGGERE: My injury is much less significant than it looks. I
fractured my ankle slightly and tore up some of the muscles...</P>

<P>GARNETT: Bruggere stands on crutches as he opens a campaign office
in Salem. A few weeks earlier he hurt his foot during a
thousand-dollar-a-seat fundraiser on a river raft. Even though
Bruggere and Smith are reportedly worth around $20 million each, both
say they won't spend much of their personal fortunes on their
political campaigns, and both candidates say they oppose negative
campaign tactics. But that hasn't kept negative ads off the airwaves.
</P>

<P>(Dramatic music and a man's voice-over: "Gordon Smith. He's
back...")</P>

<P>GARNETT: This television spot, sponsored by the League of
Conservation Voters, is a blistering attack on Gordon Smith's voting
record in the Oregon legislature, and the environmental record of the
frozen food process plant he owns.</P>

<P>(Music and voice-over continue: "... Gordon Smith's factory was
cited twice last year for illegally polluting Oregon's water.
Violations at Smith's factory have continued now for more than a
decade...")</P>

<P>GARNETT: Environmentalists charge that as president of the State
Senate, Gordon Smith pushed through an unsuccessful bid to weaken
Oregon's land use and water quality laws. Exit polls suggested that
green voters were key to his narrow loss in his previous run for the
Senate last January, a weakness that the League hopes to exploit
again. The League's effort is part of a concerted drive by national
environmental groups to regain ground lost in the 1994 Congressional
elections. The League chose Mr. Smith for its so-called Dirty Dozen
list: the top 12 Congressional candidates it hopes to defeat in
November.</P>

<P>(Music and voice-over continue: "... Owners of companies who break
our laws shouldn't be allowed to make them. Don't send Mr. Smith to
Washington.")</P>

<P>GARNETT: The ad campaign has itself become an issue. Gordon Smith
has demanded that Tom Bruggere pull the ad, but Mr. Bruggere says
election laws bar him from telling the League what to do. At a recent
protest march, former Oregon Republican Governor Vic Ateyah attacked
the commercial. Mr. Ateyah says Republican Smith as fixed the
pollution problems at his food factory.</P>

<P>ATEYAH: Senator Smith stood up and said okay, it's a problem. Yes
I agree, let's go do something about it. So it's old stuff is what it
is, and they're rehashing it.</P>

<P>GARNETT: Gordon Smith defends himself by saying his plant's
environmental record is normal for the industry and that the state's
recent renewal of his sewage permit is proof. He says his opponents
have distorted his legacy in the State House, and since his last
Senate campaign he's also changed the color of his bumper stickers
from red to green. The main environmental issue dividing the
candidates is the Federal Salvage Logging Law. Passed in 1995
officially as a fire prevention remedy after the previous year's
forest fires, the law has promoted cutting dead and dying trees on
Federal land by limiting legal challenges to timber sales. But it has
also allowed clear-cut logging of healthy old growth trees. Though
the law expires at the end of this year, a pending bill would extend
some of its provisions for another decade. Gordon Smith says this
year's destructive fire season shows the salvage law is still needed.
</P>

<P>SMITH: Folks, we got too much fuel on the forest floor. All we are
doing by not allowing jobs to be created and wood products produced
is providing fodder for a huge, even larger catastrophic forest fire.
</P>

<P>GARNETT: But Democrat Tom Bruggere says the Salvage Logging Law
saves the forest from fires only to see it fall to the chainsaw. He
says he supports thinning dead trees, which puts him in the political
mainstream.</P>

<P>(Voices in the background)</P>

<P>BRUGGERE: I've been trying to run a campaign here that brings the
state together, and tries to talk about how we can have a healthy
environment and still good jobs in our timber industry, for example.
Or good jobs in our farm industry.</P>

<P>GARNETT: Neither candidate's efforts to portray the other as an
extremist seems to be working. Recent polls show Smith and Bruggere
in a dead heat, leading pundits to predict that other races on the
ballot may be key to victory. The Presidential campaign could sway
this senate race, as could an initiative barring livestock from
polluted streams, which is expected to boost turnout from ranching
interests as well as environmentalists. For Living on Earth, I'm Ley
Garnett in Portland, Oregon.</P>

<H2>Pascrell v. Martini</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of September 13, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: This is Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. Over the
sweep of this century, the major parties in the US have staked out
fairly similar territory on the environment. Both the elephants and
the donkeys have at various times been out front or lagged behind.
But today, the Republican-led assault in Congress on environmental
regulation has tagged the GOP as anti-environment, and handed the
green mantle to the Democrats almost by default. Today, as the
parties battle for control of Congress, many Republicans are trying
to push their party back toward the mainstream on environmental
issues. And nowhere is that more evident than in New Jersey, where
nominees of both parties are claiming to be the truest green in a
tight race for a House street. Paul Conlow of member station WHYY has
our report.</P>

<P>(Water flowing)</P>

<P>CONLOW: The Passaic River thunders over the great falls in the
heart of Paterson, New Jersey, about 20 miles west of Manhattan.
Meandering Passaic defies common notions about rivers. It flows north
for much of its length.</P>

<P>(Water gurgling)</P>

<P>CONLOW: The river is an appropriate symbol for this year's
election in the Eighth Congressional District, which lies within its
basin. In a hotly-contested race for the District's House seat,
nothing seems to follow normal patterns. And that goes for candidate
endorsements by New Jersey environmental groups. Democrat William
Pascrell, the mayor of Paterson and a 5-term state legislator, has
the support of New Jersey's largest grassroots environmental group.
Incumbent Republican William Martini has the backing of the League of
Conservation Voters and he's the only freshman House Republican to
earn the Sierra Club's endorsement. It's not clear how these
endorsements will affect the close race in this district, which is
equally divided between Democrat and Republican voters. But Ella
Fillipone of the Passaic River Coalition says issues of the
environment are important to the residents of the district's old
cities and suburbs.</P>

<P>FILLIPONE: You will find what is the best in this country and some
of its worst. You will find a diversity of people but they all have a
great concern for their environment, their back yard. They speak all
the languages of this planet.</P>

<P>(Salsa music plays)</P>

<P>CONLOW: Paterson's Puerto Rican Day Parade attracts a huge crowd,
and in this election season, both candidates. Bill Martini wades into
the crowd, leaving no hand unshaken.</P>

<P>(Martini: "What's your name?" Child: "Ernie." Martini: "Ernie?
Ernie, you've got a great hat and some great sunglasses.")</P>

<P>CONLOW: Martini is 49 years old, with boyish good looks. In 1994,
he became the first Republican to win the district in more than 30
years, but his margin of victory was less than 2,000 votes, and
Democrats believe he's vulnerable. As 1 of 73 freshman House
Republicans in the 104th Congress, Martini signed the Contact With
America. So Democrats are casting him as a radical follower of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. But Martini, who earned a 73% rating from the
Christian Coalition, casts himself as a moderate. He says he supports
the Republican agenda of lower taxes and less government, but not at
the expense of the environment.</P>

<P>MARTINI: I believe, frankly, that it would be immoral to have an
economically sound future for our children and grandchildren, which
we are achieving and we will get there, if we didn't also give them a
safe and clean world in which to live.</P>

<P>CONLOW: On environmental issues, Martini often broke ranks with
the Republican leadership. He voted against attempts to limit the
Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement powers. And he drew
praise from environmental groups for his efforts to preserve the
Sterling Forest, a critical watershed in the Passaic River Basin. Tim
Dillingham, President of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club,
says Martini's stand against the anti-environmental agenda in
Congress showed courage.</P>

<P>DILLINGHAM: If we have more and more advocates like him in office,
then the signal will get through that the agenda needs to change, and
there'll be a more even course, a return to the bipartisan support
for environmental protection, that this country's enjoyed for the
last 25 years.</P>

<P>(Salsa music continues)</P>

<P>CONLOW: Challenging Martini is Paterson mayor Bill Pascrell . He's
in his element leading the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Dressed in an
embroidered geyaberra, the traditional long shirt worn by Puerto
Rican men, Pascrell addresses the crowd and greets guests in his
city.</P>

<P>PASCRELL : You're always welcome to Paterson! Let's hear it for
the Puerto Rican community! Let's hear it! [Cheers]</P>

<P>CONLOW: Pascrell is known as a hands-on mayor, and in Paterson he
has his hands full. The city, once known for the production of silk
and locomotives, passed its prime long ago. Today, many of its old
industrial sites are vacant. Pascrell 's efforts to attract jobs to
Paterson has cost him in the environmental community. The Sierra
Club's Tim Dillingham says too often in recent years, Assemblyman
Pascrell has supported Republican Governor Christine Whitman's
business-friendly, deregulatory environmental agenda. Pascrell
responds with characteristic bluntness.</P>

<P>PASCRELL : The Sierra Club chose not to endorse me because they
don't understand what's going on in the industrial parts of this
state. They don't have a clue what's going on. They don't know how to
produce jobs, they don't know how to move ratables back onto the tax
rolls again.</P>

<P>CONLOW: Pascrell did oppose Governor Whitman's efforts to cut
hundreds of jobs in the state's Department of Environmental
Protection. And he has solid support from the state's business
community and labor groups. And while his recent record in the
legislature has dismayed some environmentalists, Pascrell has earned
the endorsement of the New Jersey Environmental Federation. Dolores
Philips of the Federation says Pascrell 's passionate leadership on
environmental issues, like his opposition to waste incinerators in
the late 1980s, outweighs his recent record in the Assembly.</P>

<P>PHILIPS: The telling difference between these 2 candidates is that
one has a long history of environmental activism. Personally, down in
the trenches. The other one simply has a moderate voting record in
Congress.</P>

<P>CONLOW: The outcome of the race may be in doubt, but one thing
seems certain: it will be expensive, with the combined tab expected
to exceed $2 million. Victory in the district is considered vital in
the neck-and-neck races for US Senate and President in New Jersey
this year. Neil Upmeyer of the Center for the Analysis of Public
Issues in Princeton notes that Democrats must turn out the votes in
cities like Paterson to win in New Jersey, where President Clinton
won by only 79,000 votes in 1992.</P>

<P>UPMEYER: It's very uncertain whether Clinton can duplicate what he
did 4 years ago. And the key to whether he can or not lies in places
like the Eighth District.</P>

<P>(Water flowing)</P>

<P>CONLOW: The past above, the future below, and the present pouring
down. That's how poet William Carlos Williams described Paterson's
great falls. For the present, political observers say the race in the
Eighth Congressional District is to close to call. Anything can
happen in a place where the rivers run north. For Living on Earth,
I'm Paul Conlow in Paterson, New Jersey.</P>

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Commentator Michael Silverstein has been wondering about
which of the 2 major party candidates for President would be best for
the environment. His thoughts have not been cheery.</P>

<P>SILVERSTEIN: Remember that guy or girl your mother always wanted
you to date, or even better, marry? Yeah, she was nice looking,
smart, courteous and caring, and guaranteed to say just the right
thing, always. Remember how awful it was when you actually dated this
person and had the worst Friday night of your life? Voters of an
environmental bent might keep this image in mind in November when
they help elect a president. Bill Clinton is the mother's choice in
this election. He articulates beautifully in Rose Garden
environmental ceremonies, grieves convincingly about the horrors of
pollution, and has introduced a record number of administrative
gimmicks into the Beltway regulatory apparatus. Unfortunately, these
well-meant efforts notwithstanding, he has been by any objective
measure the worst environmental chief executive in decades. Until
updated pesticide legislation was enacted this summer, not a single
new or revised environmental measure became law during Mr. Clinton's
first three and a half years in office. Worst of all, perhaps, this
nation's environmental movement, so filled with energy and creative
potential at the start of Mr. Clinton's first term, has slipped into
a kind of shocked catatonia, retreated into a state where politically
correct mumblings and fundraising hustles have replaced the vigorous
new thinking and dynamic organizing so evident during the early
1990s.</P>

<P>Will things get better, environmentally speaking, if Bob Dole were
elected president? Sure they would. No matter who wins the big prize
this November, some environmental reforms are now assured because the
American people themselves made their feelings clear on these matters
last year in the face of an environmentally lackadaisical Clinton
White House and a frothing anti-environmental Republican House of
Representatives.</P>

<P>The main environmental challenge for the next administration is
therefore not one of legislation but of animation, or rather,
re-animation. It is to see that once again, Americans sense a
meaningful, a visceral relationship, between environmental well-being
and their own prosperity, health, and their children's futres.
President Clinton had the opportunity to shape a vision in this realm
and failed. His chance to lead is past. Mr. Dole still could lead
here. Conservative presidents have been known to do stranger things.
Indeed, especially in harness with a Democratic Congress,
environmental innovation might make a perfect theme for a new
Dole-Kemp administration in an era of fiscal restraint and visionary
vacuums.</P>

<P>At the very least, a Dole Presidency would infuse, intentionally
or otherwise, new life into an environmental movement now
institutionally tethered to a Clinton White House that takes it for
granted, minipulates it for its own ends, and gives little or nothing
in return.</P>

<H2>CNN's Peter Dykstra on Politics and the Environment</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of September 6, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>The nearly year-long prelude is finally over, and from now till
November it's the real thing: the contest for the White House with
Bob Dole and Bill Clinton the main contenders. Pollsters have
predicted that environmental concerns will play a major part in this
year's elections and we'll be looking at how the debate evolves
throughout the fall. This week we turn to Peter Dykstra, who heads up
the environmental unit at CNN. He says that so far, both the Dole and
Clinton campaigns are steering clear of the tough environmental
issues.</P>

<P>DYKSTRA: There still is, according to the proverbial high place
sources, something of a gag order on Al Gore to make this a primary
issue. The consultants for the campaign going back 2 years or even 4
years ago didn't want to hear, we are told, much about issues such as
climate change and global warming. They felt it's the MEGO factor.
MEGO is an acronym for My Eyes Glaze Over. And they felt it wasn't a
sexy enough campaign issue and therefore shouldn't be discussed by
the Vice President or anyone in power.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So Clinton, in your view, is taking, is playing it pretty
safe. I mean a couple of weeks ago he said he was going to spend,
what? Two billion dollars to clean up some Superfund sites and
abandoned industrial sites, you know, the so-called brownfields. And
this is pretty non-controversial, you're saying.</P>

<P>DYKSTRA: There isn't really a huge lobby or a groundswell of
public opinion that wants to keep urban industrial sites dirty. And
it's not by the standards of the Federal budget a backbreaking sum of
money, either. That those comfortable issues are the ones where
you're likely to see more discussion.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: But you don't think we're going to see the President talk
about the tougher ones. There's of course global warming. But at home
there's the question</P>

<P>of, say, grazing rights or salvage logging, or protection of the
Red Rock wilderness in southern Utah. We won't see anything on that,
is that your prediction?</P>

<P>DYKSTRA: I don't think Bill Clinton is going to tell us all that
we need to change our driving habits. I don't think he's going to
tell us that we need to change our consumption habits. Nor is he
going to go out to a western timber town and tell people to stop
cutting trees. Certainly not between now and the November election.
And by the same token, Bob Dole spoke in midsummer in a timber mill
town in northern California and gave sort of a rip-snorting, almost
anti-environmental group speech, if you will. And that, I thought,
was very surprising, because the Republicans have been very, very
clearly backing off that hard line.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: In fact, some pollsters told them recently that attacks
on environmental protection weren't washing in the 104th Congress.
And that they needed to turn the image around. It doesn't seem that
Dole has heeded this advice.</P>

<P>DYKSTRA: Being behind in the Presidential poll as he has been
through the summer, I think he has to find where he can distinguish
himself from Bill Clinton, and this is clearly one of those issues.
Whether or not it will gain any ground for him, I don't know.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What about the Congressional races? Which ones are you
watching?</P>

<P>DYKSTRA: I'm really fascinated by the geographic split. If you
look at areas in the South or in the Western US, there are a lot of
races here in Georgia. Max Cleeland, a Democrat, and Sky Millner, a
Republican, they're both disowning to some extent environmental
values, and, if you will, trying to out-brown each other, whereas
Senator John Kerry and Governor Weld in Massachusetts, Congressman
Dick Zimmer and Congressman Torricelli in New Jersey running against
each other to replace Bill Bradley, are both looking to stake a claim
as someone the environmental organizations would like. The
northeastern part of the country, it's still a very strong issue to
run on to say you're pro-environment. In the rest of the country it's
hit or miss.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Peter Dykstra heads CNN's Environmental Unit. He spoke to
us from Atlanta. Talk to you again soon, Pete.</P>

<P>DYKSTRA: Thank you.</P>

<H2>Seastrand v. Capps</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of September 6, 1996</P>

</P>

<P>One of the places where the Democrats hope environmental issues
will be a hit is California's 22nd Congressional District.  In 1994
Conservative Republican Andrea Seastrand eked out a narrow victory in
the affluent district, which includes the city of Santa Barbara.  Now
the freshman rep is facing another tough fight against the man she
defeated 2 years ago, and in a district long concerned about
development and coastal pollution, the challenger is playing the
environment card.  Stephanie O'Neill has our story.</P>



<P>(Waves and surf)</P>



<P>O'NEILL: Some of the most picturesque stretches of California
coastline exist here in the 22nd Congressional district, a 160-mile
long slice of California paradise.  Overall it's a politically
conservative district that's been held by Republicans since the late
1940s.  But it's also one with strong concern for the environment,
dating back to a 1969 disaster at an offshore oil rig.  Al Wyner is a
professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who
specializes in California politics and the environment.</P>



<P>WYNER: This community has starting in 1969, had a series of
political issues revolving around oil development, growth, and water
resources, that has continued to keep environmental things at the
forefront.</P>



<P>O'NEILL: And that's a fact not lost on Democratic candidate for
Congress Walter Capps, a religious studies professor at UC Santa
Barbara.</P>



<P>CAPPS: And it's easy for politicians to kind of go walking along
the beach and get their pictures taken and saying well, you know, we
really love this environment.  But to be specific about that and to
vote for the kinds of precautions and restrictions and rules that
will protect the environment, you know, that's another matter.  And
there my opponent and I are worlds apart.</P>



<P>O'NEILL: Mr. Capps is staging a heated rematch of his 1994 race
against freshman Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand, a Newt Gingrich
loyalist and a political opposite to Capps on just about every issue.
 She supports cutting funding to the Environmental Protection Agency.
 He opposes it.  He supports more funding for the Mojave National
Preserve.  She opposes that.  She voted to weaken the Clean Water
Act. He says he wouldn't have.  Two years ago when the duo first
battled for the Congressional seat, Ms. Seastrand beat Mr. Capps by
only 1,500 votes.  But, Mr. Wyner says, this race won't be the same
after 2 years of a Congress controlled by the Republican party, with
its very clear agenda.</P>



<P>WYNER: It clearly has established a position for her on
environmental matters that will repel many voters in the district.
</P>



<P>O'NEILL: The target for the Democrat's campaign are potential
voters like 28-year-old Rory Strundon.  He says he's undecided about
the race, but he considers environmental protections vital.</P>



<P>STRUNDON: Especially the ocean.  And the mountains and keeping
things not as developed as -- I think there's too much development
here in Santa Barbara.  So whoever's going to keep it as low-key and
user-friendly as possible, I think that's why everybody lives here,
to enjoy it.</P>



<P>O'NEILL: The race has attracted significant national attention and
support for both sides.  A coalition of labor, environmental,
abortion, and consumer rights groups are running TV and radio spots
criticizing Congresswoman Seastrand.</P>



<P>(Commercial spot.  Man's voice-over against music background:
"It's our land.  And our water.  America's environment must be
protected, but in just 18 months Congresswoman Seastrand voted 11 out
of 11 times to weaken environmental protections.  July 31, 1995...")
</P>



<P>O'NEILL:  But if the anti-Seastrand forces hope to use the
environment to dislodge her, the Congresswoman and her backers are
doing their best to turn the focus elsewhere.  She isn't speaking
much about the environment on the stump, and her office declined
several requests to speak with Living on Earth about environmental
issues.  Ms. Seastrand's campaign is instead centered around
hard-core conservative themes.  Opposition to abortion and gay
rights, welfare reform, and a smaller, more accountable government.
</P>



<P>(Commercial spot.  Man's voice over against music background: "It
took Andrea Seastrand and the Republicans to force Congress to live
under the same laws we do."  Woman's voice: "That's only fair." 
Man's voice: "They also cut Congress's staff and the Congressional
budget." Woman: "And that will save us all some money."  Man's voice:
"They opened Congress's books...")</P>



<P>O'NEILL: Political pictures like this one resonate well with many
voters here, as do her conservative positions on the environment
according to Professor Wyner.</P>



<P> WYNER: The folks who live in the city of Santa Maria or in the
suburb called Orchid are city and suburban folks, but they're much
more conservative politically than in other parts of the district. 
And they're more inclined to be supportive of Seastrand's position on
environmental matters.  That's the focal point of her support there.
</P>



<P>O'NEILL: With the line between the candidates so clearly drawn,
the Capp-Seastrand race has in many ways become a referendum on the
current Congress and the Republican Contract With America.  And if
Ms. Seastrand's record and Mr. Capp's criticisms of her have
motivated the Congresswoman's opponents, Professor Wyner says they've
also worked to Ms. Seastrand's advantage.</P>



<P>WYNER: In parts of this district she has solidified her support,
and probably will cause some people who maybe didn't even vote in the
last election to come out in her favor.</P>



<P>O'NEILL: And it seems even some Republicans who don't support her
environmental position may be willing to give Ms. Seastrand another
try.  Among them Sherri Clark of Santa Maria.</P>



<P>CLARK: I would probably vote for the lady because she does some
good things.  Not all good things, but some good things.  But if they
don't go right I'll vote Democrat or something else.</P>



<P>O'NEILL: Keeping Republicans like Ms. Clark in the fold is
Congresswoman Seastrand's biggest challenge.  Professor Al Wyner says
Ms. Seastrand may face a little more difficulty this time around, and
in such a hotly contested race a little more difficulty may make all
the difference.  For Living on Earth, I'm Stephanie O'Neill in Santa
Barbara, California.</P>

<H2>Clean Water Initiative in Montana</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of September 6, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Montana is known as the treasure state, and for
generations the treasure was metals mined from the ground, especially
gold and silver. The state seal reads, "Oro y Plata."</P>

<P>(Running water)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: But for many in the state today their treasure is its
environment, especially its rivers and streams which draw thousands
of rafters and sport fishers. These 2 conflicting visions of
Montana's riches are behind a bitter referendum battle in the state
this fall. After being strengthened in the 1970s, Montana's water
quality laws were severely weakened last year, in part to help hard
rock mining companies. Now a ballot drive is underway to toughen some
of the standards again. Producer Mary Boyle explains.</P>

<P>BOYLE: In 1994, Montana voters put Republicans in charge of both
houses of the state legislature for the first time in 13 years. And
when the legislature convened in early 1995, it weakened the state's
water quality standards. In some cases by as much as 1,000 times,
allowing industry and agriculture to increase the amounts of toxins
and cancer-causing chemicals they disposed into state waterways.
Industry said the new standards were less onerous. Others saw it
differently.</P>

<P>BUCHANAN: I think the last legislature put Montana in a position
to be treated like a Third World country, and I think that's not in
the tradition of good Montana public policy.</P>

<P>BOYLE: That's Gary Buchanan, co-chair of Montanans for Clean
Water. A coalition of Democrats and Republicans, ranchers,
environmentalists, and business folks backing a ballot initiative to
repeal what they see as the worst of the 1995 reforms. Their efforts
specifically target hard rock mining operations which under the '95
law can now dump untreated wastewater into groundwater and rivers.
Mr. Buchanan says mining discharges some of the most toxic and
difficult pollutants to clean up. It threatens drinking water and
local fish populations.</P>

<P>BUCHANAN: Montana went from the top or near the top of water
quality requirements for the Rocky Mountain region, and then after
one session we ended up near the bottom on things like arsenic and
cyanide. And I am not a chemist but I've been around long enough to
know that arsenic and cyanide are not vitamins and can be quite
harmful and deadly if misused.</P>

<P>BOYLE: This fall's initiative would force all new and expanding
mines that use cyanide to treat and remove 80% of the pollution from
their wastewater. The measure would not affect existing mines, and it
does not make overall water quality laws any stricter. Backers say
it's a moderate approach. But the mining industry fiercely opposes
it. Jerome Anderson is a mining lobbyist and the campaign director
for Montanans for Common Sense Water Laws.</P>

<P>ANDERSON: It's the opinion of a substantial majority of people in
the mining industry that there probably is not technology available
to meet this initiative. And of course the result of that would be
that the development of those new projects that are in the mill today
and the expansion of any of the existing mines would also be in
jeopardy.</P>

<P>BOYLE: Specifically, the mining industry says 2 big projects could
be threatened. A proposed mine along the Blackfoot River and the
expansion of another in the northeastern part of the state. Jerome
Anderson says the current standards are sufficient to protect water
quality and that the initiative is a ploy to stop mining altogether.
</P>

<P>ANDERSON: If it's simply to deal with water issues, then why
didn't they file an initiative proposal that applies to all of the
water dischargers in Montana?</P>

<P>BOYLE: The answer, says Dan Fraser, former chief of Montana's
Water Quality Bureau and backer of the initiative, is that the
current law gives mining special exemptions. So the industry needs
special attention from the voters.</P>

<P>FRASER: The next industry that comes in and gets exclusions to
treatment requirements I think should be next. But right now these
treatment requirement exclusions are to benefit nobody other than the
mining industry.</P>

<P>BOYLE: But many argue that mining benefits the entire state by
providing well-paying jobs. Tammy Johnson directs a wise use group in
the town of Whitehall, outside Butte. Her husband works at a nearby
mine. Over a pop at a local pizza shop, she says a healthy
environment requires a healthy economy.</P>

<P>JOHNSON: When people are financially able to care for themselves
and their family, then they'll start thinking about what else they
can do in terms of their community, in terms of their environment, in
terms of their fellow human beings. But not until then. How do we
reach that point? I don't know, but I think that we need to have very
reasonable, scientifically-based laws and regulations that deal with
our environment.</P>

<P>BOYLE: But mining doesn't have the presence it once had in the
Treasure State, accounting today for about 2% of the economy.
Agriculture and tourism lead the way.</P>

<P>(A fishing line is reeled. Man: "Fifty, 70 yards of this stuff
takes a long time.")</P>

<P>BOYLE: At his sporting good shop in Gardner, on the edge of
Yellowstone Park, Richard Parks threads a fishing reel. He does not
oppose mining but his business depends on clean water. Mr. Parks
hopes the water initiative will send a message that polluters cannot
sacrifice water for short-term profits.</P>

<P>PARKS: Certainly there's an effort on the part of the polluters to
give the impression that there's a bandwagon out there for saying we
should trade today's pot of porridge and never mind that tomorrow
it's inedible. And I think people are watching, and they should be
watching. And when we win, that should say very clearly the day of
that policy is numbered.</P>

<P>BOYLE: The latest polls show that 67% of Montanans are in favor of
the initiative. However, the mining industry plans to spend millions
to block it. So far it's outspent supporters 10 to 1. As Mark Twain
said, whiskey's for drinking, water's for fighting. And in Montana,
this looks to be one heck of a fight. For Living on Earth, I'm Mary
Boyle.</P>

<H2>Ralph Nader and the Green Party</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No
portion of this transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted
without the written authority of World Media Foundation.</FONT></P>

<P>NUNLEY: This is Living on Earth. I'm Jan Nunley, in this week for
Steve Curwood. California is the key to President Clinton's hopes for
re-election in November. The state has the most votes in the
electoral college, and the President won big there in</P>

<P>1992. And the respected Field Poll now gives him a 16-point lead
in a 2-way race against Senator Bob Dole.</P>

<P>But Clinton's Golden State backers may have more to worry about
than just the GOP. Long time consumer activist Ralph Nader may be on
the ballot as the candidate of California's tiny Green Party. The
prospect of splitting the progressive vote has given</P>

<P>the Republicans reason to hope, but it's also sparked a debate
within the Green Party about how to handle Presidential politics.
From San Francisco William Drummond reports.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: Founded in 1991, the Green Party of California qualified
for the statewide ballot for the first time the following year. In
its brief existence the young party has begun slowly, fielding only 4
candidates for the 152 statewide races in the upcoming general
election in November. Instead, the Greens have focused on local,
nonpartisan contests such as mayoral races. The Greens also made no
endorsement in the '92 race</P>

<P>between George Bush and Bill Clinton, sticking to a tradition of
deliberately shying away from partisan races. A tradition which was
broken earlier this year.</P>

<P>Apparently, feeling their movement was in danger of becoming
irrelevant unless it made a bigger splash, some prominent Green Party
members approached nationally known consumer advocate Ralph Nader
about accepting their party's nomination for President. Greg Jan is
with the Draft Nader Committee.</P>

<P>JOHN: He's decided to do this to emphasize that government and
politicians shouldn't be bought off and shouldn't be beholden to the
wealthy interests, and no wonder, you know, the situation in our
country and the planet and the environment has gotten so bad,</P>

<P>because of the control of these wealthy interests as opposed to
the population and the environment at large.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: Nader agreed to the offer presented by the Greens, but
with one condition:</P>

<P>NADER: My campaign's a no money campaign. I'm not raising or
accepting any money. In contrast with the avaricious and indentured
2-party duopoly which is raising millions of dollars from corporate
special interests and expect a quid pro quo in return.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: In running for President, even under these self-imposed
limits, Nader has an opportunity to attract media attention to his
theme that both Democrats and Republicans are beholden to large
corporate interests. He says Clinton specifically has not lived up to
his promises.</P>

<P>NADER: He has been indifferent in defending environmental issues
such as the environmental ravages of the motor vehicle industry,
which he's kept very silent about. He hasn't advanced fuel efficiency
issue, he's done virtually nothing on lead contamination of inner
city ghetto kids. He's a lot of rhetoric, and it's up to President
Clinton to broaden his base. If he becomes a real, authentic
environmentalist, consumer advocate, democracy promoter here at home,
then any modest competition to him from this side would be
considerably diminished.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: Hearing that kind of anti-Clinton rhetoric, Democratic
party officials in California have been keeping tabs on the proposed
Nader candidacy. Bob Mulholland, a campaign adviser to the California
Democratic Party, says so far Nader is no cause for alarm.</P>

<P>MULHOLLAND: If you're not campaigning, it means you're not
serious. And if you get serious, with money, then that's another
factor. But looking at Nader and looking at Perot, maybe possibly
someone else, as a factor but not in California and not for us as
President Clinton, because of the job he's done for the people of
California.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: Nevertheless, some political observers think that the
California electorate is volatile, and they say President Clinton's
standing is not rock solid. The public opinion polls to date indicate
that Nader could attract 6 to 10% of the popular vote. The question
is whether most of those votes would come from Democrats or
Republicans. Bruce Cain, a political scientist at the University of
California at Berkeley, says, with some imagination, Nader can reach
beyond the Greens and successfully woo a good many disillusioned
Democrats.</P>

<P>CAIN: If he wants to make his candidacy target people that have
environmental concerns or consumer concerns, then he's going to have
to do one of two things. Either he's going to have to run a
conventional candidacy, which I doubt that he ever would, because
</P>

<P>the whole point of his running is to really make a statement about
that. Or he could do the Jerry Brown strategy, which is the free
media attention, the travel around the state in a beat-up car, that
kind of model of campaign where he's getting public attention and
he's bringing his message to voters but he's not spending a lot of
money.</P>

<P>(A woman's voice backdropped by music: "Live from Oakland,
California, it's We The People, with Jerry Brown." Brown: "Welcome to
another edition of We The People. This is the show that gets behind
the news...")</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: Six days before the California primary election in
March, Nader got a little bit of that free media attention from
former California Governor Jerry Brown, who hosts a daily talk radio
program broadcast over KPFA in Berkeley.</P>

<P>BROWN: Ralph, welcome to the show.</P>

<P>NADER: Thank you very much, Jerry.</P>

<P>BROWN: Okay, now just tell me. I guess today was a setback for you
in the Senate?</P>

<P>NADER: Well, it was the vote on the bill which would strip workers
and consumers who are injured by reckless corporations of their legal
protections to go to court and hold these corporations accountable...
</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: The sudden entry of the Green Party into presidential
politics, with Ralph Nader as its standard bearer, has not been
welcomed by some long-time members. They call Nader's candidacy a
distraction from the party's real mission: to build a grassroots,
locally based, environmental movement. One of the critics is Joe
Louis Hoffman, a county leader from Ukiah, north of San Francisco.
</P>

<P>HOFFMAN: I'm concerned that there are people who are looking for
some kind of magic lever that is going to make progressive politics
bloom. Running somebody for president with a, who's a household name,
is contrary to grassroots organizing. It feels a</P>

<P>little bit like a lot of people in the Green Party are sort of
falling for the hype of popular politics, and I don't think it's
going to pay off the way people are really hoping.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: That hope is that Nader's candidacy will give the Green
Party something that it sorely needs: the appearance of doing things
on a grand scale. Richard Winger, a San Franciscan who publishes a
newsletter about third parties in the United States,</P>

<P>says the Green Party's registration has fallen steadily over the
last 4 years, from 89,000 to around 83,000. Winger says the Greens
face extinction if they don't develop a higher profile.</P>

<P>WINGER: There's nothing worse for the welfare of the party than to
be seen as doing nothing. And they didn't have a candidate for
governor in '94, they didn't have a candidate for president in '92,
and I think a lot of the registrants want them to and expect them to.
And their registration has been declining, and I think that's partly
why. I don't really see any negatives for them at all, by doing this
presidential thing.</P>

<P>DRUMMOND: Five states besides California have Green Parties
qualified for the ballot: Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, New Mexico, and
Oregon. Nader backers hope to get his name on the ballot in New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island as well. But the Nader
candidacy in California is still anything but a done deal. For his
name to get on the ballot in November, the Green Party at its
convention in late June in Oakland must endorse him by an 80%
majority. If only a small number of county leaders remain opposed to
the plunge into presidential politics, Nader's candidacy could fizzle
before it ever leaves the ground. For Living on Earth, I'm William
Drummond in San Francisco.</P>

<H2>Interview with Jan Van Lohowzen, Republican Pollster</H2>
<H3>February 2, 1996</H3>

<P>
CURWOOD: There are some cold hard numbers to back up the sentiments of Republicans who feel that their party is ignoring the environment.  For example, in a recent report to the Superfund Reform Coalition, pollster Linda DiVall wrote that 55% of all Republicans do not trust their own party when it comes to protecting the environment.  The finding is significant given its source: a Republican pollster working for industry lobbyists who favor weakening Superfund liability laws.  The report was leaked to the press, and both Ms. DiVall and the Reform Coalition have declined to talk about it, saying it's for internal use only.  So we turned to another Republican pollster.  Jan Van Lohowzen analyzed voting trends for George Bush.  I asked Mr. Van Lohowzen if he was surprised to hear that more than half of all Republicans don't trust their party on the environment.

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: Yes it does.  But I'm not sure that when people walk into the polling booth this fall, that this is something they're going to be thinking about, rather than the flat tax or Medicare or their jobs or crime or -- you know, you pick the issue.  So I think if you ask are the Republicans doing a good job with the environment, then no is probably a fair answer.  But if you ask what is important to you right now, or what will it be next November, environment is very low on the totem pole.

<P>

CURWOOD: So what you're saying is Republicans aren't doing a good job on the environment, but that most voters don't care.

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: Most Republican voters.  I think there is a constituency for environmental issues out there, probably 10% to 15% of all votes cast.  But I think that that constituency is solidly Democratic and that the odds that any of that constituency will vote Republican this fall are so close to zero that Republicans don't have to worry about it.  What Republicans need to worry about when it comes to environmental issues is that that will be the issue rather than some other issue like the balanced budget or taxes or something like that.

<P>

CURWOOD: Now, in the 1992 election, the GOP won campaigning against government regulation, and those are themes that presidential hopefuls are continuing to use this year.  But again, to go back to Deval's poll, only 30% of Republican voters think that environmental laws have gone too far.  As Deval notes in her memo to the Superfund Coalition, quote, "The GOP is out of synch with mainstream public opinion."  Do you agree?

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: Yes and no.  I think there are huge differences by region in the attitudes toward environmental regulations.  I think that in the heartland and in the mountain states there is a tremendous amount of opposition to existing environmental law and a distinct perception that those have gone too far.  On the coast you have a generic sense that Federal rules are going too far.  When it comes to environment, the environmental rules specifically, I don't think that perception exists.  So if I were a Republican and I were looking at environmental issues and I were representing a district in Montana or Colorado or even rural Oregon or Washington, I would tend to ignore those poll results.  But if I were a Republican representing a district in New York or Massachusetts or urban California, I'd pay a great deal of attention to those results.

<P>

CURWOOD: How about if you were a Republican running for President of the United States?

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: I think that I would look at results that suggest that the environmental vote is so solidly Democratic that I'm simply not going to worry about it.

<P>

CURWOOD: There are 30 Republican House members that recently wrote to Speaker Newt Gingrich saying that they were worried, in fact, about the party's image on environmental issues, and let me quote from the letter here: "We cannot be seen using the budget crisis as an excuse to emasculate environmental protection."  These are Republicans now in the House, elected.

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: Yeah.  And I personally agree with their point of view.  I feel that the premise that if the Republicans are seen as the party that rolled back existing rules and the party that's responsible for increases in pollution and rolling back some of the successes we've had on clean air and clean water, I think that would be a disaster.  That's not my point.  My point is what are the odds that that will actually happen, that that is what we'll talk about?  And I think those odds are pretty low.

<P>

CURWOOD: Now it's clear of course that the Democrats will use the environment as a major campaign issue. President Clinton spent a good portion of his State of the Union address talking about the environment to some pretty sustained applause.  How do you think Republicans should respond?

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: I think Republicans need to focus on environmental policies that continue clean up of the environment, but try to do so at a lower cost.  And that they can satisfy their commitment to lower or reduced Federal regulations by refocusing the way we enforce environmental laws.  In today's environmental laws, we tend to stress both the goal of the policy, this is how clean we want the air, and how to achieve that goal.  And Republicans might argue that there are much cheaper ways of doing it.  That we could say let's establish a goal for a particular industry to meet, let's say a particular auto emissions level.  But let's let the car and oil companies figure out how to achieve that goal, and that might be a much cheaper way of achieving the same goal.  So I think there is a very sound Republican approach to environmental issues.

<P>

CURWOOD: And do you think that the Republican candidates are articulating that right now?

<P>

VAN LOHOWZEN: No.

<P>

CURWOOD: Republican pollster Jan Van Lohowzen worked on George Bush's presidential campaigns, and now runs Voter Consumer Research in Washington, DC.

<H2> Commentator Michael Silverstein on Third Party Candidates</H2>
<H3>February 2, 1996</H3>

<P>
CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  This November, American voters could be favored with more than the usual pair of Presidential choices.  Voter fascination with Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and distant rumblings from so-called radical center politicians, Bill Bradley, Paul Tsongas, and Lowell Weicker, suggest a third party candidate could still emerge.  And how should this candidate consider the environment?  Commentator Michael Silverstein has some advice.

<P>

SILVERSTEIN: Should a serious third party presidential candidate actually emerge in months to come, what might this person's environmental politics be like?  What might a true centrist contender choose to salvage from present Democratic and Republican environmental approaches on the way to creating a genuine, middle of the road political environmentalism?  The obvious element worth saving with respect to a liberal Clinton/Gore Administration's environmental efforts, of course, is wonkery, the realm of creative program development.  This administration has taken important steps to move the EPA toward a pollution prevention, rather than an end of pipe orientation.  After a slow start, it has given the export of American green technologies a solid boost.  It has also made serious efforts to simplify decades worth of stultifying environmental regulations.

<P>

Alas, these genuinely sensible and worthwhile environmental initiatives have been matched by an equal number of silly and distracting old liberal agenda spasms.  Things like efforts to create a green Gross Domestic Product and an endless prattle about something touchy-feely called environmental social justice. 

<P>

 The environmental approaches a centrist third party would salvage from a current Democratic administration, then, are sensible, down to earth initiatives that appeal to sensible down to earth Americans.  Not to just a few deconstructionists, academics, and some precious New Age campaign contributors.  The thing a New Centrist party might salvage from a conservative Republican Congress, when it comes to the environment, is passion, enthusiasm, a genuine righteous indignation.  Many of the Republican voices calling for dismemberment of the present regulatory system are real people crying out for redress from real threats to their economic future.  These voices, strident though they be, have proven more than a match for the screechy professional pleaders who over the years have become spokesmen for so many environmental causes.

<P>

A new centrist political party must bring a conservative Republican-like fire back to the environmental platform.  Must create a green populist rhetoric.  It must make environmentalism seem like the job and profit future of the many, not a head game or a charitable good work of the few. 

<P>

The American political system bears within itself the makings of one great environmental policy.  Unfortunately, these makings are equally divided between two hostile and ossified political blocks.  A third party that can extract the best green elements from each of these blocks and cast aside the encrusted ideological baggage carried by both might just create a very potent vote-getting mechanism indeed.

<P>

<H2>Making Winter Wreaths</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  The holidays
are upon us along with the frenzy of preparations.  We all know
shopping to buy mountains of presents can take the fun out of the
season, not to mention a chunk out of our bank accounts.  Many people
are rethinking this commercialization and are seeking calmer, more
intimate ways to celebrate the winter holidays.  Setting limits on
gift giving, and emphasizing time with family and friends.  Part of
this return to simplicity is the return of handcrafted gifts.  And
here today with gift ideas straight from the garden is our Green
Garden correspondent Evelyn Tully Costa.  Happy holidays, Evelyn.
</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Happy holidays, Steve.  Bet you thought you were
going to get off the gardening hook this time of the year.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: You mean I'm not?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: No.  I thought that we'd take you outside, bring you
back in, and have you make some holiday wreaths.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Ooh, that sounds great.  But you mean those really fancy
holiday wreaths you see in the stores for a lot of money, or
catalogues?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, yeah, but I'm not talking about buying them. 
I'm talking about making them.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Oh.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Last year, for instance, I went through some of those
catalogues, kind of gasped as the prices and decided, I can do this. 
I copied the wreaths.  I made my own.  It was incredibly inexpensive
and it was fun and they were gorgeous.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Hey, by the way, why are wreathes like something we do
this time of year?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Oh.  Well actually, we humans do it all times of the
year.  Circle symbolism is incredibly important to all cultures that
bother to watch the sun and the moon.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Which is how a lot of us mark the seasons.  So you
think about birth, regeneration, the cycles of life, death, mourning,
and you think about circles.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Ah, so it's the circle of the seasons.  It's really the
circle of life.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah, it's the circle of life.  And also, I mean,
just think of the ancient Greeks who bestowed laurel wreaths on their
best athletes, or the Roman emperors who wore wreaths and also gave
them to the pure Christians that they tortured and then threw to the
lions.  Everybody had 'em.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: (Laughs) Wait a second, that's not exactly appetizing. 
How about, you know, something that's a little closer to home?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, something a little nicer might be, of course,
the Hawaiian leis, which are bestowed upon people to signify welcome.
 And Native American dream catchers and medicine wheels.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: But now, in our culture here, we seem to be stuck on
evergreen.  I mean, we use the pine boughs.  But there's other things
that we can use, right?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, yeah.  And if you live in other parts of the
country where you don't have evergreens, you know, you can use a lot
of different things that bramble up and go into nice circles.  But
really the point here about wreaths is we're talking about a circle,
and we're talking about putting things on it.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: All right.  Now, I notice you brought some things here
today.  Let's bring them up here on the table.  What are these things
here?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay.  The first and the basic thing is the frame
that we're going to use to put the things onto, and this is a
honeysuckle bare branch wreath.  it's very thick and it's got plenty
of brambles that we can stick other things into it.  The other items
are, very simply, ferns that we're going to use to build up a little
base around the circle, and some very beautiful bittersweet, a shrubs
that bears very bright, beautiful berries with yellow hoods on them.
</P>



<P>CURWOOD: So this is a red and green, the Christmas colors, but
really different, huh?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah.  And it's natural, and it's really simple, and
you literally just insert the materials right into the brambles.  So
the more bramble you have, the easier it is to make these wreaths.  I
would also say get the kids involved in this, because they'll run
around outside and find all sorts of things that you can insert into
these wreaths.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Well you see all kinds of things at my house that would
be useful.  I do have grape vines out in the yard.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Perfect.  Perfect.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: And we have milkweed.  And we have some corn husks.  And
there are lots of dried flowers.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Well there's dried herbs you can use.  Even dried
fruits, gourds.  You can make bells.  Use old ribbons from last year
when you unwrap packages from birthdays across the year.  Just keep
the ribbons.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh.  You mean there's a use for all this junk?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah.  Don't throw it out.  Use it during the
holidays.  And also you can keep these wreaths.  If they're really
beautiful and you had fun putting them together with your kids, why
not just put them in a box and bring them out next year?</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Ah.  Okay.  One thing, though.  You know, a lot of folks
live in the city, and it's a little hard to find bittersweet down at
the park, or nearby, so what should they do?</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, probably what we did.  And that's go right down
to the corner florist and get what I think is a very beautiful
honeysuckle vine that was only about $7, and we bought some ferns for
about $3, and the bittersweet for about $4.  So we're talking about
something that was about $16.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Wow.  But in the store, or he catalogue, we would pay --
</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Oh, you'd probably pay about $50 or $60, $70 for
something like this.  Especially if you're New York.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: So it's a way to save money, get connected with family
and friends.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: And nature.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Of course.  And speaking of nature, of course it's your
nature to bring us some more information on this.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Ah, yes!</P>



<P>CURWOOD: You must have a book that you could tell us about.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: I have a wonderful book that I found, and it's called
The Natural Christmas by Tom Pritchard and Billy Jarecki, and it's
published by Clarkson Potter.  And it has a lot of holiday ideas,
including recycling.  Bring the outside in, and take some old things
you have around the house and turn them into wreaths.  And not spend
so much money.</P>



<P>CURWOOD: Thanks, Ev.</P>



<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah, so happy holidays and good luck, Steve.</P>

<H2>Bulbs</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: Summer's lush heat and long days are past. Night is slow
to leave and quicker to arrive each day with ever-chillier
temperatures. Like other mammals making ready for winter our bodies
slow down, telling us to eat and sleep more with the onset of longer
nights. Our gardens insist on following suit. They wither, they shed
their leaves, drop seeds and prepare for the deep freeze ahead. It
can be a melancholy time, but luckily, Evelyn Tully Costa, our Green
Garden correspondent, has some thoughts on turning the autumn blues
into spring color. Hi there again, Evelyn; how's the gardening
business in Brooklyn?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, actually this is a fabulous time of the year
for us. We are running around like giant squirrels trying to cram in
as many gardens as we can, and we're working up against kind of a
scary deadline of frost, snow, and the winter that's heading our way.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, now what should this big squirrel do?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, I never thought of you as binging on acorns,
Steve. But like any other self-respecting mammal, we spend this time
of the year getting ready for the spring. So I would recommend to all
of us who get sad and melancholy and depressed during the cold, long,
dark winter nights, that you plant bulbs, and lots of them.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Mm. Bulbs. You mean, like daffodils and tulips and
hyacinth?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: What about those chores you talked about? You know, that
squirrel rushing around?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right. Well, won't torture you with that here,
Stephen, because there's plenty of gardening books that we can get
our hands on that will tell us: clean the garden, prune it up, dig in
all that organic soil that we've -- I'm sure you've been working on
all summer long. But really the best and most fun thing to do this
time of year is put in bulbs. It's like an insurance policy. It's
like saying spring is going to come again. And it's a little cheaper,
I think, than sacrificing a maiden or a lamb.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: (Laughs) So I'll just go outside and plant some bulbs.
And I really do prefer outside, you know, because I'm allergic to
them for when they grow inside.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: All right, Steve, so go get those gardening
catalogues. They're more than happy to show you these sort of really
gaudy pictures of what spring's going to look like in 3 months if you
buy their bulbs. You could have beautiful snowdrops, for instance.
They're about 4 inches high, they look like miniature daffodils,
they're a little bit droopy, and they will come up in late February,
early March. They come up through the snow. So that's the most
positive sign of spring. You can have fertilaria, for those who like
unusual types of bulbs. They have petals that look like checkers.
They have checkerboard patterns on them. And other -- and other
types, too -- they're really a magnificent bulb. There are daffodils
of a zillion different types, and there are also tulips. I prefer the
classical varieties that have some of the ruffled edges. So really,
the choices are endless.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So I can just put any kind of bulb out in my back yard
and it'll go --</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Mm, well, no, actually, because you live in a
northern climate so you have to put hearty bulbs outside that need a
3-month dormancy or cold period to gather their strength and get
ready for the summer, the spring and the summer. People living in
Florida, for instance, don't have daffodils and tulips. If you can
imagine spring without that --</P>

<P>CURWOOD: No.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: No. We can't. But then we don't have amaryllis, which
is a very tender bulb that can only grow in warmer climates.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So how do I handle these hearty bulbs, then?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: All right. Well, once you've made your selection and
the bulbs have arrived, you go out in the back yard and you figure
out where you want to put them. And instead of poking them in one at
a time, which is kind of time consuming and it doesn't look as good,
dig out the entire area. The instructions will tell you how deep.
Generally speaking, the bigger the bulb the deeper the area, but
follow the instructions on the depth, that's important. Then you
place the bulbs right on the ground in a random pattern. This will
have a beautiful, natural clustered effect come spring. You can even
mix daffodils and tulips up, so this will be quite beautiful. Cover
it over, mulch it up, and then wait for spring.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And what about the littler bulbs, like the crocuses?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right. You can poke those in with your thumbs, in a
random pattern of course, and there's one more thing for people
living in cities. Squirrels, remember, are rodents and they will do
anything to get food in the fall as they're getting ready for the
winter, including eating up all your expensive tulips.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh, no!</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: So I would recommend heading over to an Agway or a
good garden shop and getting some predator urine, such as bobcat or
fox urine, and sprinkling that all over your garden, and that should
take care of not only the squirrels but you, your neighbors, your
cats -- you can look at your garden but you can't go in it. (Curwood
laughs.) And hopefully the squirrels will instinctively remember
that, you know, maybe a couple of hundred years ago they were being
hunted down by bobcat and fox.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, not everybody is allergic to these things, and so
what about people who want to have them inside to have a little bit
of spring flowers?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, then they can force them, that's easy enough.
You order your bulbs in time, you have to have a 3-month lead period.
Anybody in the country with a refrigerator can do this. You get your
bulbs, you put them in a sandy, kind of loose soil,</P>

<P>you bung them in the vegetable bin for about 3 months,and
hopefully you have backtimed this. So that come January or February
you take them out, you put them on warm window sill, and in 2 to 3
weeks, there you have it: beautiful bulbs.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And so when they're done I can just plant them outside?
</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah. But don't expect them to bloom again this year.
They will bloom the following year. So take good care of them, put
them in the ground at the proper depth, and the following year they
will come back for you.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Ah. Okay, so now what do I do next?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, what I would do is get my hands on a wonderful
new handbook that's just been put out by the Brooklyn Botanical
Gardens, called Bulbs For Indoors: Year-Round Window Sill Splendor.
So y'all can get the book but I got to go put some more bulbs and
bobcat urine out in gardens in Brooklyn. So, till next time --</P>

<P>bye!</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, Evelyn. I'll be reading, and thank you. Tips on
surviving the winter from our Green Garden correspondent Evelyn Tully

<H2>Preserving Summer's Bounty</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. It's harvest
time. Across the country, gardeners are gathering fruits and
vegetables into their larders. This year alone community gardens in
New York City grew over a million dollars worth of produce. And with
us now again from the wilds of Brooklyn is our Green Garden Spot
correspondent, Evelyn Tully Costa, with tips on stocking up for the
winter. Hello, Ev.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hi, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, I want to tell you. When I was a kid my mom would
spend this time of year boiling huge pots of grape juice and turning
it into delicious grape jelly. All year long we'd save all kinds of
little jars, it might be a mustard jar, it might be a pickle jar.
Because we'd need them come the fall for the grape jelly. And it
tasted great, and you know, now that I think about it, it must have
been an awful lot of work for somebody who was also full time in
graduate school.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Wow. I'm sure it was a lot of work. But I'm sure you
really appreciated getting a jar of homemade preserves and giving
them away, too. This is an interesting point because it says a lot
about modern culture and economics. You know, when we centralized our
farms in this country through industrialization, we made a really
significant cultural choice that does boil down to, in a way, a jar
of jam that's homemade versus Welch's off the assembly line jelly.
Now if you think about it, growing, harvesting, and stocking up on
some food items is a really great way to keep the freshness, quality,
and I think most importantly, self sufficiency going in our lives.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And a sense of place. Because one of the most wonderful
things about the jelly that we would make, some would come from
grapes right in our back yard. You'd smell them as they get ripe, but
all winter long we could have that wonderful smell of September on
our toast. The trouble was, you know, I didn't pay any attention
really to what mom did when she was making this stuff. So, um,
Evelyn, I need your help. I could use some lessons here. What do I do
first?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. Start off the best and the freshest.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay. So you don't take the stuff that maybe you don't
want to have that day and you put that by. You want --</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: No. The freshest. If you want to put the freshest
going in, it'll be the freshest coming out of the jar. And you should
start with the crop that you are most overwhelmed with if you have a
garden. And for your listeners without a garden but who really want
to stock up, they could try maybe striking a deal with a neighbor who
is overwhelmed. They could join a community garden, they could go to
a farmer's market, they could buy caseloads of fresh fruits and
vegetables, or they could even try harvesting their own from a nearby
farm that encourages this kind of do it yourself harvesting. Then you
have to choose your method of preserving. Now, there's freezing,
pickling, drying, canning, or you can just throw everything down into
the root cellar.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: (Laughs) Throw everything down into the root cellar, now
that sounds easy, except -- I've got to tell you something, Evelyn,
we've got a lot of basil and we've got a lot of tomatoes. I don't
think it's going to work if I throw these tomatoes down into the
cellar, that's just going to make a mess.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Uh, no, you don't want to do that, let's try the
freezing method. Now surprisingly enough, you can lay the tomatoes
out on a cookie tray and treat them like cookies, don't let them
touch. Put them in the freezer, let them freeze, and then put them
into the bag, and by the way during this process, the skins of the
tomatoes, they crack and peel a little bit, so that when you actually
take them out of the freezer and cook them, the skin peels away very
simply and very beautifully, okay? So, you know really, freezing is
as limitless as your freezer is deep, so I would just tell people to
go for it. This is the easiest way to keep your fruits and
vegetables.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh. Well now, how could I use that basement? I mean
you said I could just toss stuff down in the root cellar?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Root cellars, they've been around since we humans
have been looking for cool, humid places to hide all that gathered
stuff while we went off hunting. (Both laugh) Now, generally
speaking, just think of it, caves, right? People storing food in
caves. Or in urns that they put in the ground. Now generally
speaking, the concept behind this is you want to keep produce as cold
as possible without freezing it, so we're talking about, you know,
below 40 degrees and above 32 degrees. So you could try out the
cellar steps. You could try out in-ground containers, like a trash
can surrounded by dirt. You can even put things in styrofoam ice
chests. What most people do is they convert part of their basement by
putting up a dividing wall, and then they use an open window during
the winter to regulate the temperature. It's really easy but it's not
foolproof.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: You've got to keep close tabs on what the temperature is,
huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah, and the other thing, too, like I said before,
you really have to store top quality, unblemished produce. Try
apples, you could try cabbages, pears, parsnips, hardshelled
squashes. These are really good choices for cold storage. They also
seem to last forever. Keep an eye on them, remove anything that is
starting to go bad, and really think of your root cellar as a
humongous backup for the fridge.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So, Evelyn, you're really smart about all of this, but
you know, my memory isn't so great. So is there some place I can look
up tips on how to do this, a good book?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, there are a lot of great books on this, but I
would have to say Preserving Summer's Bounty gives you a really good
item by item list of what preserving methods each fruit and vegetable
can handle. There's also a lot of really great recipes like green
tomato chutney, dill pesto, garlic dill butter, rosemary pesto,
creamy raspberry dressing, and cranapple jelly. And I think these
recipes would convert any supermarket junkie into a master gardener.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I'm already getting hungry.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay, and I just wanted to mention, too, that from
what I could see this summer at some county fairs that I visited,
that this is not a dying art but a reviving one. I saw a lot of blue
ribbons on a lot of tasty jams and preserves. So I would just say
happy harvesting to all your listeners and good eating to everybody.
</P>

<H2>Saving Your Seeds</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth. I'm Steve Curwood. As nearly every
school kid knows these days, wild animals are in trouble. Extinction
is at an all-time high and creatures beloved and obscure are headed
for oblivion with unknown consequences for the Earth and its people.
But what not so many people realize is that plants are also in
trouble. Both wild plants and cultivated varieties, which have
provided food for humans for thousands of years and are part of the
genetic base for many of our current food crops. By one estimate
we're losing 27,000 plant species a year, 1,000 times the natural
rate. Much of this loss is by accident. Human communities are
squeezing out wild ones and new crop varieties more suited to current
conditions are replacing older ones. Some of the loss, though, is
actually by design. Companies that produce and sell seeds are
replacing common varieties of fruits, vegetables, and flowers which
can reproduce themselves with infertile hybrids, which of course
can't. And in some cases, with patented bioengineered versions. But
there's a movement around the world to preserve traditional or
heirloom plants, and Living on Earth's organic gardening expert,
Evelyn Tully Costa, says backyard gardeners can play a role by
preserving their own seeds from their favorite plants. Evelyn joins
us now from New York. Hi, Evelyn.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hi, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: How do we do this now, with my cherry tomatoes? I love
the sungold cherries. They're so delicious. How can I save their
seeds?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. What you want to do, Steve, is look at your
favorite plants, and you want to select them for certain traits. You
can look at them for their color, whether or not they're disease
resistant, their flavor, their size, how vigorous they are. You want
to make sure that their heirloom varieties, or non-hybrid types,
because heirlooms' offspring are identical to the parent plants. In
other words, when you plant the seed, you're going to get the parent
plant, which is unlike a hybrid. The flavor is oftentimes superior,
and over time the strain can actually be improved. That's why people
do this.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, so like I have about 6 of the sungolds. I should
pick the best one, the one that had the best output this summer.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Mm hm. Yep.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And save the seeds from that.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: How do I do this?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: The first thing you need to do is you need to know
when this plant has matured, okay? Now, I'm just going to give a
general overview of a lot of different plants that people can sort of
figure out when the plants have gone to seed. Ripe flowers of herbs,
ornamentals, and even some vegetables have exposed seeds emerging
from dried pods, which are off the buds. Now, sunflowers are a really
common example of this. You've got to pick these buds and lay them
out to dry. Now, seeds from the brasica family, like mustards,
cabbage, and broccoli, develop inside pods. Now, the key is to
harvest these seeds before those pods crack.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And I just put this into a jar, or what do I do?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: What you get to do is thresh, which is still done all
over the world by people that don't have industrialized agricultural
methods. This method is used for flowers, herbs, mints, onions,
berries, corn, grain, and even some beans. And basically what you're
doing is separating the chaff from the seed. This is done with a
series of screens and a 3 speed house fan which simulates the wind.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay. How do I do this, though, with tomatoes? I mean,
they're kind of, you know, gushy.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Ah, okay. Well that brings us then to the mushier
side of fruits and vegetables. We're talking here, like you said,
about tomatoes, melons, squash, cucumbers, eggplants, and even some
chilies. They need to rot. They need to ferment a little bit before
their seeds are screened, dried, and stored in that order, Steve.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay. And then how do I store these?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. Uh, this is the important part. I would
recommend that people use well-labeled jars. Store them in a cool,
clean, dry, and insect-proof area. Seeds should be as dry as possible
before going into storage, since heat and humidity can be damaging as
well as encourage bacteria and fungus.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Boy, I tell you, with a garden one is always busy.
There's canning and now there's seed saving. But I suppose this way I
get to make a connection between my favorite tomato plant and next
summer, huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right. And really what we're doing here is closing a
circle. You grow from seed and instead of buying seedlings or seed
packets you grow the plant directly from a seed that you have saved
and this leads you into the next growing season. It's also important
for your listeners to be aware once again of the big picture drama
each human on this planet takes part in every time we eat. From the
poorest peasant to the CEO of a multinational corporation, learning
about the seed gene pool, who owns it, and how food crop diversity is
being manipulated, it's critical to anyone who's interested in
eating. So I am now going off to enjoy my last heirloom Amish
Brandywine tomato and cucumber sandwich of the season.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Well, there's another mouthful from our own
Brooklyn-based gardening correspondent Evelyn Tully Costa. Thank you
so much.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay, Steve, thanks a lot.</P>

from your garden, or if you have any other questions for Evelyn, you

<H2>Cooling Down the Summer Garden</H2>

<P>Air Date: Week of August 23, 1996</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion

</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's high summer across most of the United States. The
blend of sun, heat, and water gives rise to lush, ripe fruits and
vegetables. So as we sit back in the humid haze under a shady tree
with our mint-flavored ice tea, the last thing we're thinking about
is winter. But then there's Evelyn Tully Costa, and she's here, back
in the Green Garden Spot, to explain why colder weather should be
foremost in our minds. Hi there, Evelyn.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hello, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So, it's hot, everything's green. I like to hang out in
the shade and in fact something cool and frosty isn't totally out of
the question, but that's not what you're talking about, is it?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: What I'm thinking about is forgotten gardens. I'm
thinking about gardens that are simply overlooked once the summer
starts winding down and people start to forget about their gardens.
I'm talking about fall, winter, and spring crops, which can be
planted now. Remember what I said about gardening being like a big
circle?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Mm hm.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: A circle that is surrounded by the seasons and one
that can be jumped into at any point. So with a little extra seeding
right now, many food crops can be started in August, September, and
October, for harvesting throughout the fall, the winter, and even
into the early spring.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Hmm. So in other words, you're saying that the growing
season never has to stop, and we're going to get fresh organic food
in season all year long, huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right. If you think of this type of gardening as
being 4 overlapping crops that more or less echo the seasons
depending on where you live. So I thought we would start with the
crops that most people are familiar with, the summer warm-season
crops. These are the most common and they include corn, beans,
squash, cucumbers, tomatoes, melons, and these last until the first
frosts.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Right, they're dead finished when it gets cold.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah, it polishes them off. So the next season is the
fall season, and these vegetables include kale, turnips, mustard,
broccoli, lettuce, and cabbage. They do really well during cool fall
days, and they can withstand light frosts.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Really? The lettuce can handle some frost?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yep. In fact, some of the sugar content of certain
vegetables is enhanced by the frost. Now, over-wintering crops are
kale, spinach, onions, parsley, beets, turnips, carrots, and cold
frame-grown lettuce that can be dug or picked as you need them. And
then this brings us kind of to full circle, to the most common cold
season crops that most people are familiar with and that's early
spring. And a winter garden -- you're going to love this part, Steve
-- is very easy to take care of. There are no bugs and there are no
weeds to deal with.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: No weeds? Does that mean I don't have to mulch anything,
either?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: No, it doesn't mean that, Steven (laughs). It's not
that carefree.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Mulching actually helps you -- actually, mulching
actually does a great job of blanketing the ground during the cold
winter months, and that stabilizes the soil temperature. Now this
helps prevent damage from frost and freezing.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: All right. Now, let's say I want to go ahead with this,
this fall crop. I could get a few seeds out shortly, if I could think
that really in October I'd have a fresh salad, huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. Well, do you like arugula?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Yeah, it's pretty spicy but it really makes a salad jump
around.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. You should plant arugula seeds into the soil at
weekly intervals starting in August and continue this right through
September.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Weekly intervals, huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well that's so you can harvest it on a weekly basis
and so it doesn't grow, so you don't have 200 heads of fully-grown
arugula. You can stagger the growth. Now you can do this and harvest
it fall, winter, and even spring, depending on the severity of your
winters. And you might have to cover these crops with a cold frame or
a tent, which is a really easy way to keep fresh salads going all
year long.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, can you describe for me what will ba good cold
frame? I've seen some sort of elaborate ones, but I don't want to do
that.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. Well, first of all, let's just talk about what
a cold frame does. A cold frame is like a miniature greenhouse. Now
in this case, let's keep it simple, you can put a clear piece of
plastic, like a plastic tent, directly over the rows of your lettuce
or whatever it is you're growing, and this absorbs sunlight during
the day and it holds in heat at night. Now, this type of extending
the seasons is becoming increasingly popular among kitchen gardeners.
It's also really important to adhere that buying your own seeds is
about the surest way of getting these so-called off-season gardens
going. Most nurseries don't carry seedlings or seeds for fall
gardening, for fall and winter gardening, but that might change, too,
if you mention what you're interested in to your local garden shop.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Huh. But it doesn't sound all that hard to do. I'm just
wondering, though, are there any resources I can get with, you know,
some charts and some tips on the various vegetables that might work
in this off-season, as you call it?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, one catalogue that I thought was really amazing
and packed with information was the Territorial Seed Company's
catalogue. And they're in Cottage Grove, Oregon. They just put out
their winter seed catalogue and it's got really handy charts and it's
filled with cultivation hints and tips. Now, another resource would
be Solar Gardening, by Leandra Poisson, and that's put out by Chelsea
Green Publishing. So those are just some of the resources that you
can get your hands on.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And can save a little money here, because have you seen
the price of organic lettuce in the middle of winter?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: (Laughs) Well, yeah. I mean, if you're willing to do
the work, it's worth it.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: (Laugh) Okay, so what you're telling me is that the
gardening never stops. I guess I have to put down my mint ice tea and
get back to work putting in some seeds here. Thanks a million, Evelyn
. Next time, huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right. Well, good luck, Steve, and bye bye.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now, if you have any questions for Evelyn Tully Costa,
you can write her. Just write to the Green Garden Spot, that's Post
Office Box 639 in Harvard Square Station, Cambridge, Massachusetts
02238. That address again: the Green Garden Spot, Box 639, Harvard

<P>CURWOOD: According to most surveys, gardening is America's number
one leisure activity. Last year we spent over $26 billion on flowers,
lawns, equipment, and garden services. And most of this handiwork is
done with what we now call conventional methods. Synthetic
fertilizers and pesticides, and plants that originated in far off
places. But in scattered plots around the country, gardeners are
giving synthetic chemicals the green thumbs down and turning to
organic methods. So we here at Living on Earth decided to get some
dirt under our fingernails. We went looking for some advice about
organic gardening. Evelyn Tully Costa is known to most of the world
as a features producer for public radio. But to a lucky few, she's
known as a professional garden designer. She's one of the owners of
Garden Services, an organic landscaping outfit in Brooklyn. Welcome,
Evelyn.</P>

<P>COSTA: Hi, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Hey, listen, we called you because at last it is finally
spring here in Boston. And we're really feeling the urge to get
outside and do some planting.</P>

<P>COSTA: Well, you know, it's interesting, Steve. Maybe gardeners
found what native peoples, animals, plants, poets, and even
songwriters have known for thousands of years: there is no getting
around the seasons, the sunlight, or the weather. Now lately, there's
been a lot of attention given to this Seasonal Affective Disorder, or
SAD. That's when some of us during the dark winter months, we slow
down, we get depressed, we want to sleep and eat more. Just like some
plants and animals. Now, in the spring time, everything comes out of
hibernation including humans. Now, if that's a disorder, then perhaps
we should quickly get the bears, the trees, and the shrubs into
therapy. (Curwood laughs) Now, that urge that you talked about is a
biochemical response to more sunlight. We share increased energy and
excitement in the spring time with the living world around us because
we're part of it. So it doesn't surprise me that gardening is
America's number one leisure activity. It outpaces golf and even
watching football.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, well in New York I suppose you have lots of
therapists. But you're not in that business, you're a gardener. And
you have a very successful gardening business, organic gardening
business in Brooklyn. Have you always gone organic?</P>

<P>COSTA: No, I didn't. I mean, like a lot of people I started about
15 years ago, and like a lot of beginners I believed everything I
read in the landscaping books. And of course everything you read is
take this dangerous chemical and spray that and head for the hills.
Now at that time I was using some pretty common but dangerous
pesticides. And one day I thought to myself hey, wait a minute. If
this stuff is deadly for fish, for pets, for children, what about me?
So slowly I learned about organics and it just made a lot of sense to
me. So I figured for thousands of years, humans have managed to grow
delicious, beautiful plants on this planet without the benefit of
petrochemicals. So the good news is that millions of people are still
using these old methods and millions more are heading backwards. Or
as I like to say, they're heading forwards into sensible gardening
and organic farming practices.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I've got to ask you, Evelyn, about the timing of all
this. I mean, is it too late to start a garden this spring?</P>

<P>COSTA: Not at all. I think people should just relax and think of
gardening as a big circle. Anywhere in the year they want to jump in,
they can. Gardens go on for years; in fact, they never stop moving
through the seasons. Now for every month, for every situation,
there's something to do. There's no real beginning or end. Now for
instance, if it's for the fall I'd be asking you to plant some shrubs
and trees, build up your soil. In the winter time it would be time to
start planning your gardening, ordering your seed packets. So there's
always something going on. But the most basic rule is to know where
you are going to do your planting. You have to figure out how much
sun or shade your garden is going to have. Now this changes across
the year, of course, so that' s something to consider. Get out a
piece of paper, a pencil, a compass, figure out what direction your
house faces -- that's north, south, east, or west -- and follow the
shadows and the light across the day.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, so get paper, pencil, compass, check out the sun,
check out temperature. I've got to figure out what my weather zone is
here, right? And then when I get all this done, I can get some seeds,
right? Or get a catalogue or something, and go down to the nursery
and buy some things, right?</P>

<P>COSTA: Well, you could do all that. But I think there's something
else that you really need to consider, that are more important than
just flipping through the pages of a catalogue and ordering anything
you want.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Uh huh.</P>

<P>COSTA: And that's trying to learn what native plant province you
live in. It's not just a matter of plopping in any old plant from
anywhere in the world. Why not try to grow mostly plants, trees, and
shrub varieties that grow naturally in a region? They're a lot easier
to take care of, they attract native butterflies and bird species
that otherwise have to look to exotics for their food supplies. Now,
some of the regions that you might think about are eastern deciduous
forests, coastal plains, central prairies and western deserts, just
to name a few. So, the point here is really get to know your bio
region, and you're doing this for a very practical reason in a very
practical way.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: All right, I'll do that. But what's next?</P>

<P>COSTA: Well, I think the most important thing to do is get
started. You can get a lot of good information at your local library,
at your book store, botanical garden, plant society, garden clubs,
get information from magazines. You can even get stuff on the
Internet. Now, I think a wonderful book for first time gardeners is
The First Time Gardener. It's authored by Patty Barren and it's
published by Crown. It's very simply and clearly illustrated, and it
make a lot of good sense for people making their first big foray into
the wide world of gardens.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: All right, let's see, that's quite a list. Is there
anything I can do quickly to get something going in the back yard?
</P>

<P>COSTA: Why don't you start some seeds? There are so many new and
innovative seed companies out there these days. They offer enormous
variety of seeds that you can't get at your local nursery. Now, 2
seed types that you couldn't possibly mess up--</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I don't know about that --</P>

<P>COSTA: Are nasturtiums (laughs) we'll find out, we're going to do
a test on these -- are nasturtiums and sunflowers. Try calling the
American Horticultural Society's national information line at
1-800-777-7931. That's 1-800-777-7931. Not only do they give out
general gardening information, but ask for their horticultural
resource list. So for now just get out there, get some information,
and start planning and planting. The next thing we're going to look
at is soil. So the next time we talk, we're going to learn about how
to size it up and how to improve it.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, I'll get some books and find out where the sun
shines in my yard, and see what's growing there already. Maybe that
will give me some clues about how rich or lousy the dirt is.</P>

<P>COSTA: That's right, you got it. Now, I would love to hear from
your listeners about their gardens and perhaps with some of their
questions.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, so we'll hear from you in a few weeks.</P>

<P>COSTA: Great. See you, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Evelyn Tully Costa runs Garden Services in Brooklyn, New
York. Now, if you have a question for Evelyn, write it down and send

<H2>Green Garden Spot: Dirt</H2>

<P>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the written
authority of World Media Foundation.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: It's time now once again to turn to the green garden spot
with organic gardener Evelyn Tully Costa. Evelyn heads Garden
Services in Brooklyn, New York. Hi, Evelyn.</P>

<P>COSTA: Hi, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Last time we talked about figuring out where to get
started in our gardens. But before we plunk down those expensive
plattes of flowers and vegetables in the ground, what about the dirt?
</P>

<P>COSTA: Very good question, Steve. Now the first thing everybody
asks these days is, what about my pH levels? And I tell them, forget
about those soil testing kits and let's look at the big picture
first. We really need to understand a little bit about Earth history
before a pH test is going to make any sense. Now, somebody who's done
a lot of thinking and philosophizing about the soil is Bill Logan.
Bill is a writer in residence at St. John the Divine in Manhattan and
he's an arborist. Logan recently wrote Dirt: The Ecstatic Skin of the
Earth. It reads like 100 Years of Solitude meets Scientific American.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: [Laughs] In other words, pH is the first 2 letters of
philosophy.</P>

<P>COSTA: You got it. For instance, in his chapter called "Stardust,"
he writes, "The truth is, we really don't know the first thing about
dirt. We don't even know where it comes from. All we can say is it
doesn't come from here. Our own sun is too young and too cool to
manufacture any element heavier than helium. We are all stardust," he
writes, "in fact, everything is stardust."</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Wow.</P>

<P>COSTA: Now, what did you want to know about pH, Steve?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: [Laughs] Well, I mean, if I shouldn't be worrying about
my pH right away, I mean, what should I be thinking about?</P>

<P>COSTA: Well, once you figured out where the sun hit your property,
you need to figure out what the plants are going to go into. Soil, in
my opinion, is the basic raw material of the gardener's art. The
chemical gardener uses soil simply as a means to anchor all those
plant roots to artificial fertilizers. Think of those fertilizers as
the human equivalent of caffeine: you might get a quick fix from
coffee, but your body is depleted of energy and nutrients and you
have no fuel left over for the long haul. Now, the soil is no
different. Now, organic gardening on the other hand aims to enrich
the soil, and it recognizes that the soil is actually a complex
ecosystem like a swamp or a forest. And it's teeming with millions of
organisms. Those organisms release nutrients that are required for
healthy plant growth. So think of the organic matter that you need to
add to your soil as good nutritious solid food. Like a hearty
balanced meal that lasts you all day and keeps you healthy for a
lifetime.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: All right. So does soil, I mean stardust, come in
different flavors?</P>

<P>COSTA: Yep. It comes in 5 different flavors: clay, sand, silt,
limestone, and peat, and these are going to vary depending on where
you live. So the next thing you need to do is dig deep enough to find
out where the 3 layers of soil are. For most gardeners who do shrubs,
flowers, and vegetables, you need 10 to 12 inches of topsoil. You
have the subsoil, and then you have the third layer. And the reason
you want to dig down, let's say, about 2 or 3 feet, is to get a sense
of the relative depth of each of these and their texture, and that's
going to vary according to your location.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, and then what do I do?</P>

<P>COSTA: The next thing you want to do is find out what you're going
to grow there, and then you can decide what nutrients, minerals, and
ecosystems you need to encourage to make your particular garden
thrive. You can send a soil sample to your local cooperative
extension for a small fee.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: And then what will they tell me?</P>

<P>COSTA: Well, you're probably going to find out whether or not your
soil is acidic, alkaline, and what nutrients are already there. But
just keep in mind that the solution to most gardeners' needs is very
simple. Generally speaking, if you add lots of rich, composted,
organic matter, this is a surefire way to neutralize the soil, which
is what most garden plants need to grow. This gets the main nutrients
going in your back yard. Now, you can supplement your plot with some
organic fertilizer such as bone, fish, blood meal, cow manure, fish
emulsion, wood ash, and liquid seaweed. But remember, these only fine
tune what should be a healthy, rich environment that you've created
by adding organic compost.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay. And what's the scoop on getting this organic
matter.</P>

<P>COSTA: Where to get it, well, there's a couple of ways to do that.
You can buy it. Manures are sold at most garden centers along with
organic mulches such as cocoa and buckwheat chips. You can make it
yourself by starting a compost heap with all those leaves and lawn
clippings that you might otherwise stuff into plastic bags and haul
out the front to be taken away. In my opinion that's like throwing
out money. Just let's think about what soil philosopher and tree
pruner Bill Logan says: "As the beings that make up organic life
continue to exist, evolve, and cover the earth, they create a rich,
stable atmosphere and rich, deep soils. Only here on earth does
stardust engage in this extraordinary array of self-organizing
behaviors." Okay, Steve, till next time.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Bye for now, Evelyn.</P>

<P>COSTA: Bye bye.</P>

<H2>Love Bugs</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: With us now from Brooklyn to answer that question is
Living on Earths organic gardening commentator Evelyn Tully Costa.
Welcome, Evelyn.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hey, Steve. Sounds like you have a little trouble up
there in your garden. Whats eatin' ya?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oho, thats not funny, Evelyn. My plants are in, I'm
watering, mulching, I've loaded the soil with lots of organic matter.
The roses are blooming, my tomatoes and cucumbers look wonderful,
they're sending flowers -- but I've got this small problem. In fact
thousands of them. Im sharing my vegetables and flowers with lots of
ravenous bugs and my garden's the main course!</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. Okay, Steve, calm down. It's true, it's true.
Insects are our number one competitors on this planet. They eat our
food, they eat our clothing, our houses and us. They even give us
terrible diseases. I'm not saying we should ignore bugs, but before
we reach for all those toxic chemicals and the machine guns, please
be careful that the cure isnt worse than the problem.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Yeah, right, thats all well and good. But come on, what
about those sap-sucking aphids that are out there destroying my
tomatoes right now!</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay, all right, so now its personal, I understand.
Why don't you take the divide and conquer approach to pest management
instead of the slash and burn? After all there's some one percent of
those bugs are pests, and the rest, thats 99%, we can use those to
eat up the bad guys. So why don't we start with the aphids since
they've started with your tomatoes?</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Yes!</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: These sucking, clustering little bugs are definitely
a major problem throughout most of North America, so our listeners
will be familiar with these guys. Now wherever you have aphids you
have ants, because they are involved in this kind of weird but very
fascinating relationship, okay. Aphids produce this sweet sticky
nectar called honeydew, which ants love to drink. And in exchange for
this fruit juice the ants herd the aphids around and protect them. So
in a way, aphids are cows for ants and ants are cowboys for aphids.
So the idea is to divert the ants from the aphids and leave the
aphids vulnerable to other critters. So you got to put coffee grinds
around the base of plants to keep the ants away from their dairy
herd. Now once the aphids are left unprotected, all sorts of other
critters who dine on them will move in and serve themselves.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Aah -- so let me get this straight. It's like, you know,
the ants are the enforcers in the neighborhood. They have this
protection thing with these aphids, they get all of their juice. And
if we can, like, scare them off then, hey, the aphids are vulnerable
and they wont eat my tomato plants, huh?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah. I mean the trick is, with all of this using
natural controls to keep your garden in shape is to lure the good
guys, were calling beneficials, to feed on the bad guys, were calling
pests. Now for example ladybugs which everyones heard of and wants in
their garden, their favorite snack happens to be those nice, soft,
juicy aphids.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Yes!</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Lacewings love aphids, too, but if the ants are on
guard like you said, they'll eat mealybugs, thrips, small
caterpillars and mites instead. So you want them to chow down on the
aphids first, thats lacewings, and then they'll move onto these other
guys you definitely dont want in your yard.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Right.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Now, another really neat predator to encourage in
your back yard are the tiny bracketed wasps. Now these do not sting
humans. They will take out a lot of bugs that we dont want around.
Now the wasp table manners are right out of the movie Alien, a little
bit gross, they lay their eggs inside a number of bad bugs like the
tomato hornworm, for example. The hornworm, which is this big, fat,
plump caterpillar, becomes a living feeding station for lots of
little larvae which are sucking the vital juices from inside the
hornworm, slowly killing them, so that the hornworm cannot snack on
your garden.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh boy, well I guess -- I guess I got to go along with
this science fiction bug war happening, cause I mean, if this is what
I can do to get it to work to my advantage Im gonna do it but -- ugh!
What a mess! Tell me, what do I do to invite the good guys to dinner
and get them to chow down on the party crashers?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, what I've been saying all along: diversity
diversity diversity. You have to grow lots of flowers, which I'm
assuming you're doing anyway.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: My wife likes that.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay. Well, the flowers will attract beneficials with
their nectar and pollen. And when the pest populations are low
because the good guys have fed on the bad guys, they will return to
these flowers for their nectar and pollen. And that will provide food
for the troops while they're waiting for the bad guys to come back in
again for another battle. So you want to have something blooming for
the entire season. You also might try to grow a little patch of
grass. That will attract ground beetles, rove beetles, and tiger
beetles, and they eat a lot of bad things. And you want to allow for
a little wild spot in your garden.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Hey, that's real easy for me.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Okay, all right, less weeding for you, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: (Laughs) Yes.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: And a little watering hole for the good bugs to slurp
from time to time in</P>

<P>between their hunts. And do not use pesticides; you will destroy
the good guys with the bad, you will leave your garden unprotected.
The bad guys will come back in, wipe your garden out, and you wont
get your tomatoes, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay. I'm getting the picture, now. It's the basic lesson
here. You gotta create an entire ecosystem, huh? Its everything from
the soil to the bug balance.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Right right right right that's right. There's no
magic bullet to winning over nature with poisons, because it always
comes back to you twice as strong in a bad way. This garden war is
really about balancing with the scales tipped in our favor most of
the time. So if we set the stage with an arsenal of diversity to
favor beneficials, youll make it through the season and you'll get
your tomatoes.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Now how can I tell which are the good bugs and which are
the bad bugs?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, it turns out that the May/June issue of Organic
Gardening has a great lineup of the good guys and the bad guys, and
Organic Gardening is put out by Rodale Press, which has been
publishing organic gardening books for, I think at least the last 30
or 40 years. And they have an enormous listing of books on this
topic. And go down to your library and bug them to carry not only the
magazine (Curwood laughs) but also the books, which are just filled
with really good information on how to do organic gardening.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, Evelyn. Well I'm all charged up. I am off on a tiny
game hunt now in my back yard armed with coffee grinds and I'll let
you know who wins. Till next time.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Great. Good luck, Steve.</P>

<H2>Listeners Query the Green Gardener</H2>

<P>NUNLEY: For many of us home gardeners, things are slowing down a
bit these days on our little patch of earth. Most of the digging, the
soil preparation, planting, weeding, mulching, pruning, that's all
behind us. And the big payoff of the late summer and fall harvest is
yet to come. It's a good time to sit back, relax just a little, and
take time to look into some of the questions we've just been too busy
to get to till now. Like, whether some bugs that are causing us fits
in our gardens might also be causing problems elsewhere. Or why the
tomatoes on the other side of that fence look so much better than
ours. To help us answer some of these questions we're joined by
Living on Earth's very own organic gardener, Evelyn Tully Costa of
Brooklyn. How are you doing, Evelyn?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hello, Jan. So, I hear the grass is greener in your
neighbor's yard and you're wondering why.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Ah, but the crabgrass is greener in mine.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Ah, don't worry about it. But I understand that some
listeners and Living on Earth staff have burning questions of their
own today.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: They certainly do. Our first question is from one of our
listeners, Marianne Reynolds of Skillman, New Jersey. She wants to
know how to get rid of carpenter ants. It seems she lives in the
woods along with the ants who are sort of hanging out in her</P>

<P>compost heap and some of the railroad ties and in her herb garden.
</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hmm. If Mary Ann has carpenter ants in her garden,
that's okay. But she's got to be careful to keep them from nesting
inside the house. Now these ants love to live in soggy, rotting wood,
which you wouldn't want to find out is one of your support beams. So
to avoid infiltration she can ring her house with boric acid or
diatomaceous earth, and she should keep firewood elevated, with
breaks contact with the soil, and this promotes air circulation. If
she has any rotting window or door frames she should replace those
immediately. Now, how do you know you have carpenter ants in the
house? Some signs are slit-like holes in the wood and they have
droppings that look like sawdust. And even sometimes you can hear
them kind of crackling away inside their burrows. Carpenter ants have
wings and they leave their nests to search for food, so you can trace
them back to their nests. You can drill holes, once you find the
problem area you can drill holes around the infestation and blow
diatomaceous earth or boric acid into the nest.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: All right. Dan Grossman, who's one of our freelancers here
at Living on Earth, wants to know about lead in the soil. He's heard
it's okay to eat fruit but not roots out of tainted soil. Now is that
true?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, that's such a really common question these
days, I'm sorry to say. And it's also one of the first ones that most
of my clients ask when they're considering their garden's edible
future. Now flower gardens aren't really an issue unless you've got
young children digging around in the dirt and you're worried about
them eating it. With vegetables and fruits, though, that's another
story, and I wouldn't take any chances. So the first thing to do is
to get your soil tested by your local agricultural extension service
or the Health Department. Now, read their guidelines carefully. But
beyond that, if you suspect that there's any construction or dumping
that took place in your lot, or the test shows the soil's only
marginally safe, I would spend the time and effort excavating that
bad stuff out of there. Then you can build up your own organic soil
and you know it's back there. Meanwhile, I wouldn't eat the fruit or
the roots if I suspected lead in the back yard. Now, if the soil
tests fine but you live near a roadway and you're worried about lead
and other pollutants, you know, blowing onto your food, this is what
I think you should do. You can wash off your fruit and your
vegetables with a little vinegar, two and a half tablespoons to one
gallon of water, or half that amount dishwashing liquid. The</P>

<P>other thing you might think about is planting a solid hedge of
privet or even a quince to keep out some of the fumes. Now just
remember that lead is a toxin, so I wouldn't take any chances with
it.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Mm, not me. One of our listeners, Marlene Tosig, is waging
what she calls a losing battle with horsetail at her home on Lake
Winepesaukee in New Hampshire. What can she do to get rid of that?
</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, the good news is horsetail, bottle brush,
scouring rush, shavebrush, Devil's guts, or joint grass, just to name
a few, can be used for polishing silver, brass, wood, or as a
re-mineralizing tincture. This plant is really interesting because
it's been used successfully to treat kidney, skin, and internal
disorders since Roman times. Now the bad news is that this living bit
of prehistoric flora is almost impossible to get rid of once it's
gotten into your garden, and you know, to be honest about this, what
we're fighting here is the plant equivalent of a dinosaur. Actually,
horsetail predates dinosaurs</P>

<P>by a hundred million years and it survived them. So we're looking
at one of the toughest living things on this planet. This grows in
the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere on the entire planet
where drainage is poor and swampy and that's key to locating your
garden. Now the only cure is to dig this stuff up, but even that's
not a guarantee because the extensive root system is a weedy success
story. The roots are slender, dark brown, hairy, creeping, and
branching.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Ooohh...</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Now this stuff has got to be dug out to at least a
exasperating depth of 3 feet.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Ow, I'm hurting already.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah, it's a back breaking proposition. And on top of
this endless underground root network, horsetail also produces
fertile stems. Now you've got to cut those off the minute they come
up in the spring, otherwise take advantage of the plant's</P>

<P>high silica content, make a scrub brush with it, and use it to
wash your dishes.</P>

<P>NUNLEY: [Laughs] Oh, my. Now that sounds most unpleasant. Have you
got any resources on problem plants like horsetail that you would
recommend before we close?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah, actually a really wonderful book that I came
across that your listeners might want to get a copy of is Just Weeds:
History, Myths, and Uses. It's put out by Chapters Publishing and of
course there's always Rodale, who puts out Organic Gardening and lots
of books on organic problem solving in your back yard.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>NUNLEY: Meanwhile, keep those questions coming to the Green Garden
Spot, care of Living on Earth, PO Box 639, Harvard Square Station,
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02238. Till next time, Evelyn.</P>

<H2>Designing a Garden</H2>

<P>CURWOOD: To many of us, the urge to clip, mow, weed, and dig, is
more than just another item in the weekly checklist of chores to do.
It's an act of passion. How we shape the bit of nature we call a
garden can be as exciting or soothing as any painting, sculpture, or
memoir we leave behind. And it's an entree into our moods, our state
of minds and heart. Here to discuss the creative side of gardening is
our very own garden designer Evelyn Tully Costa. She's out in the
Green Garden Spot as usual. Welcome, Evelyn.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Hi, Steve.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So, let's get right to the heart of the matter. For weeks
we've been fussing over technique, you know, the soil, how to and how
to dig. And all the mechanics of gardening. But you're saying there's
a deeper issue here?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yeah. Really the main issue. I really think people
should know the basics of how to garden, but what I really do for a
living when I'm not talking to you is to help others realizing their
visions through plants, through cobblestones and soil. It really
boils down to design.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: So what if I don't know anything about, you know,
designing? I mean, do I need some expert or do I have to go through
these slick magazines that have these beautiful pictures in them?
</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: No. I mean, I'm not saying you shouldn't look at
those. But just like clothes or jewelry or houses, garden designing
is a total manifestation of our personalities, and there's no right
or wrong here, Steve. What's interesting is how our state of mind
gets played out through the living landscape or the garden. We
develop relationships with plants, attachments, since they're living
and we have to nurture them to varying degrees. And they're like
children. I mean, we even have expectations of how they're supposed
to turn out. But often, the best gardens in my opinion happen despite
our rigid notions of what's expected from a particular design.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: I thought you weren't going to tell people about my
garden here today, Evelyn. [Evelyn laughs] But seriously, I mean,
it's hard not to think that, you know, the great garden designers in
Japan or in Europe, and especially go to England, you see these
perfect little gardens by these perfect brick walls. Can we really
compete with that?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, I think that we really need to acknowledge the
influences. I mean it's just like food or culture or music or
anything else. We really need to acknowledge the history. But we also
need to come to grips, and this is especially true of gardening, we
really need to come to grips with the fact that we're not in Europe.
We should look here in the United States at our own incredible
landscapes, and we should look there for ideas for inspirations.
Suzanne Lipschuts is a featured designer in the most recent issue of
Garden Design magazine, and she had a great little quote. She says
anyone can do a perfectly gorgeous landscape, but it's the insanity,
the abnormal gardens, that inspire. It takes guts, but people should
always do their own thing.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh well, I guess I can feel better with that. Tell me,
Evelyn, what are your inspirations for this kind of thing?</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: That's a trade secret, Steve. Of course, I do read
and collect design books by the box load, I visit gardens, I talk to
other landscapers. But there are really two people whose garden, and
their lifestyle, have inspired me over the last 10 years. Noah Baen
and Karen Shmeckpeper have a cottage and a garden in Galilee,
Pennsylvania, that always gives me pause to think. And what I think
in their case is that I'll never have the breadth of knowledge,
vision, and skill to pull things together quite the way these 2 have.
Now, Noah and Karen have surrounded their 1870s farmhouse with a
wonderful combination of native plants, roses, exotics, and annuals,
that cause people to slam on the brakes when they drive past.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Wow.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Karen has, on top of just what's around the house,
she's built a maze across the road from their house. And Noah
recreated a working Stonehenge using bales of hay further back in the
field.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Oh, okay. So what you've got here are some fine artists
who are using the landscape as, like, a canvas.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Yes. But it's also very inviting. In fact, Karen
named it the Galilee Gathering Garden. She actually cuts and sells
flowers right out of her living painting. And wonderfully enough,
people actually use Hay Henge and the Garden Maze as a gathering
place. So it's really a stunning example of making the most out of a
location. In this particular case, and I think this is probably one
of the most important things about designing where you are, we're
talking about sky meeting fields that slip into this woodland which
is bordered by a stream. The plants blend in and they pop out at you
in very refreshing and unusual ways. Noah and Karen have also managed
to attract at least a dozen different types of butterfly species,
many more birds, and also local residents, who are an interesting mix
of farmers, professionals, artists and transplants from other places.
Like Brooklyn.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Aha, so that's where you go when you want to get away
from it all.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: That's right.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: But now, what about the rest of us if we're not all that
artistically inclined or think we're not, anyway. Where do we start?
</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Well, I would very much recommend any book by garden
designer, writer, and photographer Ken Druse. He's one of this
country's leading designers and a well-known advocate of the native
plant movement. Now, if you really want to learn something about
plants that belong in the United States, in settings that are as
stunning as anything you'll see in Europe, go out and get a copy of
The Natural Garden or The Natural Habitat Garden. Now, I consider
both of these books bibles for the work that I do.</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Okay, so those books are by Ken Druse and they are The
Natural Garden and The Natural Habitat Garden. And I'll check them
out in the library and we'll talk in a few weeks.</P>

<P>TULLY COSTA: Great. Well, good luck, Steve, at the drawing board.
</P>

<P>CURWOOD: Thanks, Evelyn. Evelyn Tully Costa designs and builds
gardens in Brooklyn. She comes to us from WNYC, New York. If you have
a question or a comment you can write the Green Garden Spot at Box

<H2>Steve talks with Con Von Hoffman about Spring Cleaning</H2>

Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>

CURWOOD: It's Spring, and we've been bottled up in our houses all  winter long.  It's time, now, to shake out the carpet, scrub  extra hard in some places that may not have seen the light of day  in recent months.  But you know, some ways of doing that are a  lot easier on us and our families and the earth than others, and  with us now to sort all this out is Living on Earth's news editor  and sanitary engineer, Constantine Von Hoffman.  Now, what's the  first thing you found out that's important for spring cleaning, from your research?

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Well, I found out that the best thing you can have  is a good grandmother-in-law.

<P>

CURWOOD: Really.

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: My grandmother-in-law gave me this fine 25th  anniversary cookbook from Advent Lutheran Church in Maple Grove,  Minnesota.  In it are not only more recipes with more brand name  items than you can shake a stick at, but also ways to clean your  house that are not only environmentally friendly but cost  conscious.

<P>

CURWOOD: All right.  So, being public radio, what's the cheapest  way to clean up with spring cleaning?

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Open your darn windows, okay?  Let all that good air  in, let all that stale air, that dusty, polluted air that's been  building up in your house over the winter, let it out.

<P>

CURWOOD: Okay, now I assume that we're going to have to do a  little scrubbing?  So what are the right chemicals?  You brought  in some; this looks like a conventional toilet bowl cleaner, and  I see on the back of it, it says that it's got -- ugh,  hydrochloric acid.  What did the grandmothers say I can use

<P>

instead?

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Well unfortunately the grandmothers recommend elbow  grease, not chemical warfare.  They say use a little vinegar, a  little water.  That'll keep your toilet bowl clean.  But you have  to do it often.

<P>

CURWOOD: Now what about -- you know, the clogged drain?  We've  got these power chemicals that will, you know, get right through  the grease in my drain.

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Well, you know why we have those clogs?  'Cause  you're like me: lazy.  If you regularly dump a cup of salt, a cup  of baking soda and one kettle of boiling water down your drains,   that's going to take care of most of the build-ups.  Now, if you  get a nasty, ugly grease build-up, something that just won't  budge otherwise, it's time to go to the snake and we're not  talking, oh, a python.  It's time to turn to mechanical measures;  that will clean it right out of there.

<P>

CURWOOD: Okay, now what about polishing up the furniture in the  house?  We have some lemon oil furniture polish; this stuff looks  great.  It says, "contains petroleum distillates; harmful or  fatal if swallowed.  Keep out of reach of children."  What do the  grandmothers say I can use instead?

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: You know, they liked this stuff until they realized they  were going to have to use it on their own dining room table.  At  which point they said uh uh.  And they recommended using a little  olive oil, a little lemon juice, mix them together, spread them  around. That will keep all your furniture nice and polished.  You  can get a nice vinaigrette going, too, if you have the time.

<P>

CURWOOD: Now, one last area of the elbow grease department, the  windows.  Spring time comes, it's time to clean them.  It's okay  to use the blue stuff or the green stuff, right?

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: It's okay, but a) it's expensive.  This stuff runs a  buck forty-nine for a quart.  And b) it's not very effective.   Consumer Reports did a study that said water is just as effective  as half the stuff that's on the market today.

<P>

CURWOOD: Well, I guess I'm a cheapskate, I guess I should try  water.  But if I don't want to use just water, what can I use to  --

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Well, if you want to improve on the water, add some  vinegar to it.

<P>

CURWOOD: What about getting my woolens ready to be stored all  summer?  You know, the moths will get in there and I'll come and  it'll be confetti instead of a sweater.

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Actually, the moths won't do it.  It's their kids,

<P>

the larvae.  You know what trouble kids can be.  If you take your  woolens, toss them in the dryer, run it for about 10, 20 minutes,  that will bake out the larvae nice and good.  Then you want to  take your clothes, put them in a good, tight plastic bag, add a  lot of cedar, you know, so you get that good cedar aroma out of  it.  And then in the fall, you'll have nice complete clothes  again.

<P>

CURWOOD: Without toxic mothballs.

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Without toxic mothballs.

<P>

CURWOOD: The green way to get into Spring from Living on Earth's  own Constantine Von Hoffman, our news editor and now chief  sanitary engineer.  See, there's another promotion.

<P>

VON HOFFMAN: Oh thanks, Steve, I appreciate that.  Could you pass  the sponge?

<P>

(Scrubbing sounds)

<H2>Steve talks with Lois Gibbs, author of Dying from Dioxin</H2>
Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>
<BR>
CURWOOD: Since 1978, the name Lois Gibbs has been synonymous with upstate New York's Love Canal.  The Niagara Falls community was built near a toxic waste dump.  After years of lobbying and litigation, Ms. Gibbs was successful in forcing the polluter to pay to relocate the residents.  The experience convinced Ms. Gibbs that America's toxic problem extended beyond her back yard, so she moved to the Washington, DC, area, and created the Citizens' Clearing House for Hazardous Waste, a national organization whose goal is to stop pollutants at their source.  The group's latest focus is on dioxin, and Ms. Gibbs has recently published a book called Dying from Dioxin: A Citizen's Guide to Reclaiming Our Health.  Lois Gibbs says she began this latest crusade after she read an EPA report which said there is literally no place in America that is dioxin free.
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: I thought I moved my family away from all toxics.  I thought that they were healthy.  And when I read that EPA report in September '94, and I realized that every time I was feeding my child a glass of milk I was feeding my child dioxin, I became angry again.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: I need a little chemistry lesson here, Lois Gibbs.  Just what is dioxin?
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: Dioxin comes as a byproduct of burning products and containers and manufacturing of things with chlorine in it.  And in the burning of solid waste, garbage, in an incinerator, dioxin is produced in the stack, and it travels out the stack and into the community.  So it's not deliberately made; it's really a byproduct of burning plastics and other products that have chlorine in them.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: How did it get to be the major health problem that you see it is today?
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: What happened is that when the dioxin comes out and travels in the grass, cows eat this grass and they get a little dioxin in their body each time they eat.  This dioxin in their body is stored in their body, and it bioaccumulates, and then when we drink the milk or we eat the cow's meat in our hamburgers, we as human beings get little bits of dioxin in our body, and it is stored in our body.  And so over time what has happened is that the American public, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, is at or near full of dioxin.  And what that means is that everybody has enough dioxin in their bodies, or almost enough dioxin in their body, that any other exposure will put them over the edge for an adverse health effect.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: When you say adverse health effect, what are you talking about?  What does dioxin do to us?
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: The EPA has said that dioxin is one of the most toxic chemicals that affect the US population, and is a human cancer causing chemical.  But more importantly, it also affects the immune system, and the reproductive system.  So if you don't have an immune system, the cancer cells that are normally killed by your regular immune system are bypassed, because the immune system is not geared up to take care of it.  And as a result, the cancer cells are allowed to move.  And our reproductive, system especially the men, they have discovered that the men today have 50% less sperm count than their daddies, and that's a direct result of dioxin working as a hormone.  And one of the things a hormone does is it feminizes men.  It changes their hormone balance.  It reduces their sperm count.  It creates reduced testes size, reduced penis size, reduced sex drive.  So it's not just about women and breast cancer and uterine cancer and our children, but it's really about fertility.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Okay.  So what can people do to reduce their exposure to dioxin, as individuals as well as in communities?
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: Well, as individuals one of the things that they can do, dioxin stays in the fat.  So if you were to drink skim milk as opposed to whole milk, if you were to cut the fat off your meat before preparing it, all those things are healthful.  The less fat in your diet, the less dioxin in your diet.  It doesn't eliminate it all, but those are some little steps.  But the more important thing that we need to do is really work in our communities.  We need to find out where are the medical wastes, the solid wastes, and the hazardous waste incinerators in our neighborhoods and begin to figure out how can we stop them from producing dioxin.  What else can we do with those waste streams?  What other processes are out there to take care of our wastes so that we're not putting this in the air even in small amounts?
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Now, what's being done to reduce dioxin levels today?  What progress do you feel is being made?
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: There's actually a small amount of progress.  Many of the incinerators, especially the old ones that burned household trash in Columbus, Ohio, a couple in Illinois and Florida have been closed down.  They've been closed down because they've been found to contaminate the neighborhoods so badly.  And as a result of those being closed down, there's been a significant reduction in dioxin in those communities.  But also, the solid wastes that they once burned, the household trash, is now being recycled and reused, so it's not going up in smoke and is actually being put back into society in a productive sort of way.  So that's one of the things that is happening over there.  Across the country people are working on medical waste incinerators to the same degree and trying to work with administrators to get the plastic out of the waste stream, and to shut down the incinerator if it's really, really, really old.  And finally, there's a lot of work being done with the paper and pulp industry, who also contributes to dioxin.  They contribute through bleaching paper with chlorine, and the paper and pulp industry is now looking at changing their process from chlorine bleaching to hydrogen peroxide and other methods which are totally closed loop.  So the American public can have their white paper, we can still maintain our jobs, an we can have some balance in the whole picture.  And we can protect human health and our environment at the same time.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Well thank you for taking this time with us.
<BR>

<BR>
GIBBS: Thank you for having me.
<BR>

<BR>
CURWOOD: Lois Gibbs is head of the Citizens' Clearing House for Hazardous Waste in Falls Church, Virginia.

CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  Ah, summer.  Finally time to enjoy the great outdoors, right?  Well, Mother Nature isn't always glad to see us.  The itch inducing trio of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, lurk just about everywhere in North America.  And just because you've never had  it before doesn't mean you won't get it.  Author Susan Carol Hauser, who's written the new book Nature's Revenge, thought she was immune until -- well, let's let her tell the story.

<P>

HAUSER: Well, I thought I was one of the chosen immune.  That I was not going to get poison ivy.  I waded through it all of my life, merrily, with people yelling at me, you're going to get poison ivy.  And I never did, so I didn't pay any attention until about 5 years ago.  And I was helping a friend clear some brush, and I wore leather gloves and jeans and I covered up all my skin, and 3 days later I broke out in a terrible rash that -- I'd been
sitting on berries and the juice from the berries soaked through the back of my jeans --

<P>

CURWOOD: Uh ohhh...

<P>

HAUSER: And the backs of my legs became like raw hamburger.  So I became inspired to find out about poison ivy and found there was very little reliable information on it.  It was very difficult.  So I started doing some heavy research.

<P>

CURWOOD: All right.  So you went out, you did that research, and you can tell us now the secrets of it.  First of all, what is it that happens when you're exposed to poison ivy or poison oak or sumac?  Is it the same thing?

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.  The oil in the plants, in all 3 plants, is exactly the same.  It's called arusiol, and it's an almost invisible -- well, it's invisible to us in the quantities that we would see it
in.  It's a very clear, thin oil that flows in canals in all parts of the plant.  When the canals get broken by something such as a broken leaf or even an insect bite, the arusiol comes out and sits on the leaf and waits for a human to pass by, and when it gets on our skin 85% of us will have an allergic reaction after our first exposure.  As with most allergic reactions you have to have a sensitizing exposure.  Then the next exposure, the body decides that this allergen is a dangerous thing and goes after it.

<P>

CURWOOD: You started scratching.

<P>

HAUSER: I did start scratching and I will probably continue to do so for a while.  Because the experience of having poison ivy is so intense that even thinking about it brings back the memory. I think the skin remembers the assault.

<P>

CURWOOD: All right.  Now we called you here today specifically to get the secrets of how to deal with this stuff once you get it.

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.

<P>

CURWOOD: What do you do if you're exposed to it?  What should you do if you think you've been exposed to poison ivy?

<P>

HAUSER: The first thing you do if you're going to be outside is to have someone help you identify the plants and do learn what they look like, because it does help to avoid contact.  But the second thing to do is to take care to respond to the presence of the arusiol if you think you might have gotten into it.  And there are a couple of ways to do that.  One is to bathe in lots and lots of water; it takes copious amounts of water.  Don't just use a washcloth over your skin; get under running water so that you dilute the arusiol.  But the best thing I found out in my research and it's wonderful, it's inexpensive, wonderful, pretty much benign, is that rubbing alcohol is an organic solvent and neutralizes the arusiol.

<P>

CURWOOD:  Mm hm.

<P>

HAUSER: So we keep a Mason jar with rubbing alcohol in it, with a cloth, and we take it when we go hiking and we keep one in the garage when we worked outside.  You just take the cloth and swab it over your skin, you don't have to scrub.  And then wash with
lots of water.  And it will neutralize the arusiol and prevent a reaction up to 3 to 4 hours after exposure.  Whereas water you have to use within less than an hour.  The arusiol starts to bond with your skin in 10 to 15 minutes.

<P>

CURWOOD: Okay.  But what if we didn't notice so we didn't have the alcohol with us or we didn't wash and we're starting to get that itchy feeling?

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.  It'll start with just a little kind of itch and you won't even realize it's poison ivy.  And then it'll start getting red.  And the next day it'll start to blister and ooze and do terrible things and people won't want to come near you.

<P>

CURWOOD: Mm.

<P>

HAUSER: Because they don't know if you can spread the poison ivy or poison oak to them.

<P>

CURWOOD: Can I?

<P>

HAUSER: And in fact you cannot.  The blisters, the fluid in the blisters is body serum and does not contain the oil arusiol, which is long gone from your skin; it bonded within 10 to 15 minutes, and unless you're recontaminating yourself from clothing or tools, you cannot get -- your exposure to the arusiol is done.  So you don't have to worry about spreading it by scratching the blisters.  As you start reacting, if you have a mild case and you can avoid scratching, use home remedies and over the counter drugs like cortisone creams, calamine lotion, compresses of Avena, oatmeal solutions, vinegar and water is another good one.  And whatever you can use that's comforting to your skin and allows you to not scratch it.  If you must scratch, and you have a big case with bad blisters and over more than a fourth of your body or on your face, you should get some kind of help.  There are prescription drugs that stop the reaction.  The prednisone, cortical steroids, injection and pills, will stop the itching.  They have side effects, they might make you feel bad, but they will stop the itching.

<P>

CURWOOD: What about the home remedies, or rather the folk remedy I'm thinking of, of jewel weed?

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.

<P>

CURWOOD: You know, it's a long, spindly plant, and you're supposed to be able to use the sap from that to protect you.

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.  The stem of jewel weed is very juicy, like an aloe plant.

<P>

CURWOOD:  Mm hm.

<P>

HAUSER: And it's an old American Indian remedy for poison ivy and for other things.  Many people report good effect from using this immediately; as a preventive they wash with it after they've been in the woods.  Or as soon as they feel a rash they start using it.  They've done clinical studies with this, and it works about 30% of the time.

<P>

CURWOOD: Okay, but for right now what I should do is, I'm out walking, I should stay on the path.  If I get off the path I should look out for those plants.

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.

<P>

CURWOOD: And if I am not careful about it, if I think I've got the stuff, I should wash off with rubbing alcohol.

<P>

HAUSER: Yes.

<P>

CURWOOD: And then a lot of water.

<P>

HAUSER: That's right, a lot of water, yes.  Also, watch out for your clothes, your bicycle tires, any tools you're using.  The oil arusiol bonds within 10 to 15 minutes to human skin, but it stays active for years on objects.  So if you get some on your tennis shoe laces and you put your tennis shoes away in the fall and take them out again in the spring, or in January, you can get arusiol on your hands from your tennis shoes.  And then you scratch your face and you've got poison ivy in January, and you wonder where in the world it came from.

<P>

CURWOOD: Susan Carol Hauser's book is called Nature's Revenge: the Secrets of Poison Ivy, Poison Oak and Poison Sumac and the Remedies.  And now you know the secret remedies that she does.  Thanks for coming and joining us.

<P>

HAUSER: Thank you so much.  I enjoyed it.

<H2>Brox Farm in Winter</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No

<P><BR>

CURWOOD: Jane Brox has written about her family's farm in the
Merrimack Valley of Massachusetts in her book <I>Here and Nowhere
Else: Late Seasons of a Farm and its Family</I>, published by Beacon
Press. In it, she recounts the story of her grandparents who bought
the land at the turn of the century when the area was mostly
agricultural. And how now, cut through by a busy road, the farm is
one of the very few left in the area. But as Ms. Brox tells us, even
a small family farm in the shadow of the city in the dead of winter
is rich with life.</P>

<P>JANE BROX: The barn has been cold for years, and in a hard winter
snow accumulates on the roof. Back when my grandfather kept a dairy
herd, the cows warmed the barn enough to meld a moderate snow falling
on the shingles. This was early in the century, and the farm itself
looked far different than it does not. An open country then, the
pasture and fields running to the horizon, one set off from the next
with walls built from stones that had been cleared from the land.
</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: You know, that don't seem so long ago. But it was, 60,
70 years ago.</P>

<P>JANE BROX: When my father took over the farm, a small dairy herd
could no longer support the family. So he gradually sold off the cows
as he expanded his vegetable crops. The herd was gone by mid-century.
The farm I've always known is 50 acres cultivated in crops we sell on
our farm stand. People from the surrounding cities and suburbs drive
here to buy sweet corn, tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, peas, apples,
peaches. Our winter barn is swept and neat and rowed with machinery.
Harrow planter, cultivator, rice spreader. It smells a little oily
and metallic, and is utterly still in the cold as I stand here. Not
even a swallow lighting off the rafters. Remnants from its earlier
use are hanging on nails struck into the back wall. A double yoke, a
horse's collar, a rusting sigh.</P>

<P>(Metal on metal sounds)</P>

<P>JANE BROX: And the far pastures have grown into woods. Their soils
are too poor and stony for our crops.</P>

<P>(Footfalls)</P>

<P>JANE BROX: Now I walk here among white pines whose soft tops sway.
Those trees protect me from the brunt of the wind, so I can walk a
long time.</P>

<P>(Footfalls)</P>

<P>JANE BROX: I can't imagine these woods as ever having been part of
any farm. Though countless signs tell me otherwise. (Watch, there's
barbed wire here.) There are stone walls here, too, squared off
through the trees. I found strands of barbed wire, an ox shoe, an old
milk cans half sunk in dust. I could probably find such remnants in
any woods I walked through in these parks. At the turn of the century
the farms were countless. All you could smell was cows, my father
remembers. And he tamps his ash cane as he names down the places.
Bragden had 30 cows; Dooley must have had 20 or so. Stevens, he had a
small herd. Cox, Clough...</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: And John Perry Mashado and sons had about 25. And the
Ritzes and all that cattle.</P>

<P>JANE BROX: What were once those families' homesteads and pastures
are housing tracts now, or convenience stores, supermarkets, small
industries. On the road, there's traffic at all hours, and tankers
drive our milk in from the north and west in the middle of the night.
I can count the remaining farms in this part of the valley on one
hand.</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: Old man Cox used to come up with a wagon every night
and take the milk...</P>

<P>JANE BROX: My father tamps his cane again as he counts the
children who lived up and down the road when he was young. There were
10 at Bailey's, he says, 14 at Cloughs. We were 9. There must have
been 50 of us just along these few miles. He pauses for a moment,
then goes on. Now we're alone here, he says, speaking of my mother
and himself. If you have your own house, your brother has his...</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: See the generations change...</P>

<P>JANE BROX: He talks as if we were, and I guess we are, some tough
old remnant, too.</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: Yeah.</P>

<P>JANE BROX:Though it never seems so in the middle of summer, when
everyone has a shoulder to the picking, hoeing, and packing. And
there are days when workers are in and out of the fields until nearly
dusk. But all that goes in a matter of months. Corn field after corn
field is harrowed down and planted in winter rye. One cold star-hung
night kills the tomato and cucumber vines, and frost settles in the
low place in the orchard. The last yellow leaves fall to reveal the
spare turned branches of the apple trees, and we face a stretched out
white time. More than anything I miss the voices I'd hear calling
across the field. Just simple orders really: okay! Don't forget the
twine! I need more baskets. Or 2 or more talking as they rest on
overturned crates or stop for water at the end of a row. They've all
scattered to their own lives for the winter.</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: The weeds have grown in the greenhouse. (Jane: "Yeah.")
</P>

<P>JANE BROX: Snow has settled in the fields and woods now. My father
spends much of the day at his desk going over figures, or he puts his
magnifier to the pages of the American Agriculturist. He tells me
he's just read a piece about an organization that matches up people
who want to buy working farms with farms that are for sale. And then
we talk about how that sort of thing could never happen here. We're
too close to Boston. The start-up costs, the land values, the taxes
are all too high. It's talk we've fallen into more often than not
this winter. Even a few years back he'd be thinking instead about
trying a new supplier for the early corn seed, or about buying a new
orchard mower. But this winter he's 85. He leans on his cane and
counts another vanishing thing.</P>

<P>JOHN BROX: Blue birds. We used to have big blue birds every
summer. That was our world, you know.</P>

<P>(Music up and under)</P>

<P>CURWOOD: John Brox died shortly after we visited him and his
daughter Jane Brox on her farm in Dracut, Massachusetts. Jane Brox
says the family plans to keep on farming.</P>

<H2> Jane Brox on her farm in Spring</H2>

Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>
CURWOOD: On Jane Brox's farm in Dracut, Massachusetts, spring has
come and her family is preparing the soil and picking up the
branches that fell during an especially harsh winter.  As she
tells us, along with rebirth and renewal, spring brings
uncertainty over what the future holds.

<P>

(Birdsong)

<P>

BROX: We call the small rocky field across from the farm house
"the early land."  It usually dries out by the first ord
week in April, and for as long as I can remember it had been the
first field my father worked every year.  Always the same.

<P>

(A motor struggles to start)

<P>

BROX: One morning I'd hear the tractor engine, even and deep, as
he made his way across the winter rye leaving a wake of polished,
turned over soil.

<P>

(The motor runs)

<P>

BROX: The spring air steepened with the smell of mineral earth,
and the work year all of a sudden felt open to me.  All we looked
forward to, all we were responsible for, our clear and narrow
way.

<P>

(The motor runs.  Fade to the sound of branches  breaking)

<P>

BROX: Not that the work hadn't started months before.  By this
far into the year, we've pruned the apple and peach trees.  The
cuttings are laid down in soldierly windrows waiting to be
gathered into brush piles.  And in the greenhouse, fragrant with
damp peaty growing mix, tomato and pepper seedlings are warming
in the trays. 

<P>

But the pruning and greenhouse work begins while the world is

<P>

still spare and cold.  The footprints we make in soft noonday mud
are frozen in place the next morning.  To me, it doesn't seem as if the spring
really starts until I hear the tractor turning over that first
field.

<P>

(The tractor motor runs.  Fade to bird call)

<P>

BROX: How different the same sound can feel at different times. 
The morning dove's first solitary call of the year one bright
spring morning isn't the same as her call extinguishing the
August dusk.

<P>

(The dove calls)

<P>

BROX: And the cut of a relic scythe used rarely and
self-consciously.

<P>

(The scythe cuts)

<P>

BROX: How can it sound the same as the scythe used as an everyday
tool?

<P>

(The scythe cuts)

<P>

BROX: My father died in late December.  Now, my brother alone
works the tractor across the rye and I'm apprehensive when I hear
the reliable sound of its engine.  I can't help but wonder about
what's to come, and how all of us will get along.  I wonder if
we've learned what we need to keep things going.  My father knew
so much about the land, the crops, the weather.  A knowledge
grown into over the long years of his life.  A knowledge we've
come to depend on.

<P>

All winter, with the snow, the quiet, the fire I'd looked into
for months, I was afraid of how the spring would make me feel.  I
was afraid I'd miss my father most when the season opened up
again.

<P>

(The sound of branches being moved)

<P>

BROX: But now that I'm out picking up the prunings in the orchard
and gathering them into piles of brush, walking back and forth
among the rows of spare, turned trees, I'm starting to feel more
sure of my responsibilities.  He'd say work was good for that. 
For getting out of a doubting winter mind.

<P>

(Birdsong)

<P>

BROX: I can hear the call of the finches and chickadees, and the
brook and flood rushing over its tumbled granite bed.

<P>

(Water runs)

<P>

BROX: As I traced the way my father worked for countless seasons,

<P>

I can't help but think about the course of his life.  As he
carried the farm through this dark accelerating century, it
couldn't have been easy.  He had to make his own lone decisions
as he faced the passings of the ones he loved and relied on.  The
very sound of his work changed relentlessly.  At first he knew
only the patient breathing of oxen and work horses.  That was
before the entrenched noise of an engine in the fields.

<P>

(The tractor motor runs)

<P>

BROX: I always think of my father on the tractor.  That's what I
remember.  But he liked to remember how he plowed the early land
with a matched pair of horses.  Back then he must have felt some
of the apprehension I feel now, as he stepped into the soft,
turned earth.  Certain of nothing other than the love he had for
this place.

<P>

(The dove calls.  Footfalls)

<P>

CURWOOD: Jane Brox lives and writes in Dracut, Massachusetts.  Her latest book is Here and Nowhere Else: Late Seasons of a Farm and Its Family.  
Her commentaries are produced by Sandy Tolan.

<H2>Brox Farm at the End of Summer</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation. No

<P><BR>

CURWOOD: It's the end of the season for Living on Earth commentator
Jane Brox, who writes about the year's ebb and flow on her family
farm in Dracut, Massachusetts. With summer now winding down, Ms. Brox
says she's spending less time out in the fields and more time at the
farm stand.</P>

<P>BROX: It's September now, and our farm stand bears the weight of
the whole summer.</P>

<P>(A door closes)</P>

<P>BROX: Twenty-pound boxes of canning tomatoes hold open the door.
There are baskets of pickling cukes stashed under the shelves. Jars
of honey catch the afternoon light.</P>

<P>(A motor runs; corn is husked)</P>

<P>BROX: We're deep into the corn season. It's piled high on the
table. The bins of eggplant, beans, cukes, and peppers are over-full.
A few blueberries are left and the last of the peaches. There's also
the first of the butternut squash and apples: Macouns, Macintosh,
Cortlands soon. For these brief September weeks summer and fall crops
share this space, and there isn't room for more.</P>

<P>(Conversation)</P>

<P>BROX: Even the voices crowd in. Neighbor catching up with
neighbor, talking of their trips to the mountains or the coast and
where their children are heading for school. Younger people still
nerved with summer rush in for a quick dozen corn on their way to one
last evening at the beach. Just one more barbecue.</P>

<P>(Conversation continues)</P>

<P>BROX: Older folks shop more deliberately. They've waited all week
for a neighbor to bring them out from the city. Coming here may be
their only outing for the day, so they take a long time to choose
their few tomatoes. One frail, white-haired woman asks if she can buy
just 3 ears of corn. When she's told yes, of course, she's more
grateful than you'd want, thanking you again and again, saying, "You
don't need much when you live alone."</P>

<P>(A cash register runs. Woman: "Is that going to be it, ma'am?")
</P>

<P>BROX: Now that the crops are running over, there are those who
come to buy tomatoes, peppers and cukes by the box and bushel. Maybe
they no longer own the strength of the space to grow things
themselves, but they remember their old gardens and want to put up
some tomatoes or make some picallily.</P>

<P>(Woman: "This is the correct size. You want something that's going
to make a nice presentation. You don't want something that's curved
too much because then it's hard to take the core out.")</P>

<P>BROX: Voices go on long into the afternoon, while beyond the farm
stand the leaves on the weaker trees, the ones near the road, already
sound a little raspy in the afternoon wind.</P>

<P>(Wind in the leaves)</P>

<P>BROX: Apples are dropping in the laden orchard. In the coming
weeks they'll be twisted off the branches one by one until the last
bushel of Northern Spies goes into the apple cellar. Butternuts,
pumpkins, and blue hubbards, some weigh upwards of 30 pounds, still
have to be cut from their vines and stored away. Whoever works here
is tired now.</P>

<P>(Woman: "This is not a good bunch. I don't like this bunch.")</P>

<P>BROX: What felt like pure devotion in the first warm spring days
became a job of work, and then a hall of work, with the pests and too
little rain or too much and the plantings running together.</P>

<P>(Woman: "Okay." Woman: "You okay?" Woman: "I'm going down to get
the other pail now." Woman: "Okay.")</P>

<P>BROX: The frost may be only weeks away, and times I've dreamt of
it. Because afterwards, when the vines have died back and the corn
stalks dried up, what remains of our day is more orderly, steeped in
the sharper fragrance of stored things. And then I think again and I
can't believe what I've been wishing for. It's September, and you
realize a hundred days is all you have to make the most of the year.
Dusk is no longer that lingering time.</P>

<P>(Geese honk)</P>

<P>BROX: Canada geese land to feed in a field of harrowed-down corn.
I am afraid of wasted minutes. Deep in our night as we sleep, the
bright stars of winter are rising.</P>

CURWOOD: During the past year, commentator Jane Brox has taken us on
a journey through the seasons on her family's farm in northern
Massachusetts. Last winter, she introduced us to her father, who was
born when family farms were the norm in the Merrimack Valley. Today,
only a few people still work the land. Jane and her father were among
them. Just before we aired that story her father, John Brox, passed
away. In the spring, Ms. Brox told us what it was like to go through
a time of planting, renewal, and hope for the first time without him.
At the end of the summer she introduced us to her farm stand, where
city folks came to shop and where she longed for the end of the long
harvest season. Now, as the long shadows of winter again start to
fall over her home, Jane Brox reflects on the long year since her
father died, and the changes that have come to her and her farm.</P>

<P>BROX: The air no longer smells of fermenting windfall apples. It's
clear and cold and a harder light falls on the bare turned branches
of the fruit trees. The farm stand is closed tight. Except for a few
rows of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower, which I could still pick
on a warm day, all the fields are in rye. What remains of the
vibrant, tight-hearted fall, is the scrape of oak leaves and the
small, thin notes of finches as they peck at seed.</P>

<P>(Sounds of scribbling)</P>

<P>BROX: I work inside at a table set in a west-facing bay window
that frames a solitary Baldwin apple tree. It's one of the oldest
fruit trees here, planted by the man who built my white farmhouse,
who lived a more frugal life than I could imagine, repairing with
scrap, insulating with paper, saving string. Baldwins were a standard
part of that earlier life, when every family farm had its own orchard
and every tree yielded a different variety of apple: Russet,
Greening, Winesap, Sheetnose, Ben Davis, Astracan.</P>

<P>(Footfalls)</P>

<P>BROX: A few trees of those varieties still bear on gravelly New
England hillsides. Their gray bark trunks have thickened with the
years. Their crabbed branches clatter in the winter wind. Commercial
apple trees will never look that way again. Most have been cut down
and replaced, if not by houses, by dwarf or semi-dwarf trees, which
are easier to pick and produce a higher yield per acre. And the old
kinds of apples, fallen to market pressures, have been replaced by
more uniform, redder varieties: Macintosh and Delicious that everyone
knows, crisp bright Macoun, perfect for eating out of hand.</P>

<P>(Crows)</P>

<P>BROX: But the Baldwin tree still bears a good crop every other
year. This fall its branches almost touched the ground, it was so
laden. The fruit slowly turns a brownish red all September, before it
deepens to a darker red, with a rusty splay at its stem. Spicy and
juicy, long valued for its keeping qualities, I can still make a pie
from its fruit in March. Baldwins are slow to ripen and sweeter after
the frost, so this tree is one of the last to be picked, and its
harvest, late this fall, marked the final turn of the difficult year.
</P>

<P>(Church music: Ave Maria)</P>

<P>BROX: Back at the start, in the clear winter light of my father's
funeral, I couldn't even imagine getting this far.</P>

<P>(Music continues)</P>

<P>BROX: The old farmers hold on a long time, and my father was no
different. He had worked so hard to his own dreams and ideas of this
place, had for so long alone decided what to grow and where, how to
market and to whom. Even in his last months I think he found the
necessity to compromise and relent, more difficult than the physical
work. Such control doesn't make for easy succession, and there are
days, I feel, we're all the more lost for his having held on so
stubbornly.</P>

<P>(Crows)</P>

<P>BROX: Even so, it may be that very stubbornness that also makes it
possible for us to continue. My father had his choices. He could have
done other things to greater profit and with less love with his life
and this land. Having chosen to continue farming here, he has given
us the chance to go on, too. And in the end, however well he may have
prepared us, it would never have been enough. Since it's not so much
the work we're unprepared for as it is his absence.</P>

<P>(Music up and under)</P>

<H2> Bill McKibben on Endangered Species</H2>
Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>
CURWOOD: Amid all the fears about species going extinct, we hear reports of animals reappearing in places they haven't been seen in generations.  On the face of it, this seems like a positive finding.  But to commentator Bill McKibben it's only the latest chapter in a story that may not have a happy ending.
<BR>

<BR>
McKIBBEN: In the mid-18th century, Thoreau made a list of all the animals that had once lived in and around his Concord, Massachusetts home but were no longer to be found there.  The wolf, the turkey, the beaver, the bear, the deer, the porcupine, the moose.  Save for the wolf, they've all returned.  Deer in record numbers to browse on suburban shrubbery, wild turkey flocking back toward the scene of the first Thanksgiving, beaver busy creating new wetlands.  Several years ago, state game officials shot a moose that had taken up residence on the median strip of nearby Route 128, America's Technology Highway.  They donated the carcass to a Salvation Army soup kitchen.
<BR>

<BR>
And it's not just the northern forest.  Seals have returned to Long Island Sound in the last decade.  The sea otter population off California's coastline is booming.  Alligators have moved so far off the endangered species list that no Florida golfer would even consider fishing for a ball lost in a water hazard. 
<BR>

<BR>
In an age that biologists assure us is marked mostly by extinction, and by extinction on the order of the great cataclysms that killed the dinosaurs, what do these small resurgences mean?  Not that we should assume nature will bounce back from our abuse; for every sea otter rebounding on the Pacific shore there are 100 populations of birds and beetles and frogs losing ground.  Indeed, even some of the so-called recoveries are signs of dsperation.  When a manatee spends all winter in the hot wastewater of a Houston sewage treatment plant, it's a sign of life out of whack.
<BR>

<BR>
All it means is that in those few places where human beings have backed off, nature retains some small measure of resilience.  In the mountain east, where farming moved west a century ago and the forest began a slow recovery, even the cougar may be returning to the woods.  Where game laws and endangered species acts have ended poaching in protected habitat, and where toxic pollution has abated to levels that allow reproduction, animals have responded.
<BR>

<BR>
It's almost dangerous to discuss these successes, because too many people are eager to take them as signs we can gut our environmental laws and count on nature to clean up after us.  Instead, they're signs of just the opposite, signs that the early efforts at ecological vigilance have shown some payoff.  Signs that there's some grace left on the planet, that we may yet by redoubled effort be able to meet the rest of creation halfway.  Signs that in a few scattered places we've started down the right track.
<BR>

<H2> Bill McKibben on Sustainability</H2>

Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>
CURWOOD: Our economic system thrives on the concept of growth.  More is better, we're prone to say, and that's why the concept of sustainability and the notion of limits to growth get a cool reception in many quarters.  But commentator Bill McKibben says the problem isn't the concept of sustainability.  The problem is the buzzword itself.

<P>

McKIBBEN: For some time now, environmental advocates have been converging on a similar idea: that the world's economies and societies now need to cease their pell mell growth and begin the search for a stability that will keep them safely inside the planet's physical bounds.  The buzzword that we've been using since at least the mid-1980s is: sustainability.  But as buzzwords go, it's been unsuccessful in capturing the attention of most people.

<P>

The reason that sustainability has excited no one outside of narrow policy circles, I think, is because it refers to nothing in human experience.  We are born.  We grow.  We die.  These, therefore, become powerful metaphors.  A growing economy.  A dying civilization.  These make intuitive sense to us.  But we do something else in our lives, too, at least if we're lucky.  We mature.  We cease to grow physically, and instead begin the process of developing spiritually and intellectually and morally.  And that's what we now must start to do as economies and societies and as a species.  All the signals suddenly flashing back to us from the natural world -- the rising temperatures, the higher concentrations of CO2, the sudden spike in extinctions -- all these are signs that we've grown large enough as a civilization.  That we must now mature.

<P>

Simply saying so doesn't get us very far, of course.  The transition to an economy not based on growth will be extraordinarily difficult, calling on every intellectual resource we can muster.  But words do count.  They count enormously.  Since at the moment the only good we can perceive is growth, that's where our energy goes. 

<P>

And maturity could be a naturally attractive idea.  We admire mature people.  In many ways we admire them more than the people who have only energy to offer.  We know, too, that maturity is a process, never completed, always a struggle to become more the person we want to be.  And finally, we realize that self-restraint is the key virtue of maturity, the ability to sacrifice some impulse for the greater good of one's family or friends or nation. 

<P>

Now we need to summon that same virtue as a society, even as a species.  We need to be able to see that just as there is a certain wise satisfaction in foregoing a sports car to save for your child's education, so there's a certain satisfaction in beginning to share the world's wealth more equitably, so that the countries of the poor world needn't follow an environmentally ruinous course to development.

<P>

At the moment, our culture admires Donald Trump because he's grown his wallet so quickly.  Our economists admire, say, China, because its economy has expanded so fast.  But if we took a different measure of value, we might admire different people, different naions.  Just as with a child, physical growth is much to be desired for a time.  But just as with a child, the time comes to stop growing, at least in external ways, and start the more complicated, more interesting, and ultimately more fulfilling task of maturation.  For this planet, that time is now.

<H2> Sy Montgomery on March Madness</H2>

<P>
<BR>
CURWOOD: It's Living on Earth.  I'm Steve Curwood.  Here in the northern regions while we wait for the buds and flowers to pop, we're missing some of nature's wildest shows, says Living on Earth commentator Sy Montgomery.
<BR>

<BR>
MONTGOMERY: This is a bleak time here in New Hampshire.  The snow is gray and brown from winter's blanket of chimney ash and sand.  Then when the snow melts that's even worse.  Nothing but mud everywhere.  The whole landscape looks, if not dead, then at least exhausted.  But that's why I love this time of year.  It reminds me of one of the most powerful lessons nature has to teach us.  Look again.
<BR>

<BR>
On one of those days when it seems there's nothing to do but watch the dirty snow melt, go out and watch the dirty snow melt.  You may well find that what looks like specks of ashes on the snow are jumping around.  You've encountered one of the world's weirdest animals, engaged in a dramatic spectacle so bizarre that no one is really sure what's going on.
<BR>

<BR>
They're called snow fleas.  Actually, they're not fleas at all but animals called spring tails.  They're called spring tails because they've got a mechanism at the rear of the abdomen that lets them catapult into space.  These guys are only one sixteenth of an inch long, but each can jump six inches in a single bound: the equivalent of a person covering a mile in ten leaps.
<BR>

<BR>
Normally, they live beneath the leaf litter where you'd never see them.  Why do they appear now?  One theory is this: a population explosion so severe that the only solution is cannibalism.  A British entomologist watching a swarm of snow fleas under magnification found the animals savagely fighting one another with mouth parts and tarsal claws.  The victors ate the victims and then died themselves.  The blood of spring tails is toxic.  True, not every day offers such a spectacle as snow fleas fighting on melting snow. 
<BR>

<BR>
Fortunately, once the snow is gone, there's mud to look forward to.  Mud is full of life.  A few years back, a biologist removed 6 inches of the stuff from a dried up pasture pool, added water, and found no fewer than 5 different kinds of tiny animals hatched out.  Nice wet estuary mud is even richer.  On average, each cubic inch contains 1.4 million microscopic worms and more than a quarter mile of cobweb-thin filaments called hyfulthreads, which belong to a fungus.
<BR>

<BR>
My friend Rick Van Depoll calls mud a mini Gaia system, because the animals who live in mud recreate and regulate their own environment.  There's a lot going on here.  For mud, like melting snow, is full of life and speaks to us eloquently, inviting us to look again.  Reminding us, even now, to trust the richness, abundance, and generosity of nature.

<H2> Jonathan Adler on Regulations</H2>

Copyright c 1996 by World Media Foundation.  No portion of this
transcript may be copied, sold, or transmitted without the
written authority of World Media Foundation.
<P>

CURWOOD: Ever since the presidential campaign season began, the Republican party has been trying to reposition itself on the environment.  Leaders in the House of Representatives have been working especially hard to make the party look more moderate on green issue.  But that doesn't impress commentator Jonathan Adler.

<P>

ADLER: Recently, News Gingrich and some of his colleagues stood on Roosevelt Island in the Potomac to announce a new set of Republican principles on the environment.  Only, they aren't very new.  It sounds like the GOP is trying to embrace the rhetoric of its opponents in an attempt to regain political momentum.  It will not work.  Offering a moderated version of the conventional agenda will gain Republicans little credit in environmental circles.  No matter how hard they try they will never out-spend or out-regulate the Democrats.  Efforts to "me too" the issue will look lukewarm and insincere.  And why should any self-respecting environmentalist vote for a half-hearted green when they can vote for the real thing?

<P>

Republicans need an environmental message.  But to be successful, it has to be one of their own.  In 1994 they showed they understood the frustrations of those who must comply with America's environmental laws.  Now they must prove they understand the aspirations of those who wish to safeguard the environment.  Republicans must articulate an environmental vision that rejects Federal bureaucracies and embraces the principles of free enterprise and limited government.  Most importantly, the GOP must demonstrate that allegiance to these principles does not pose an environmental threat.

<P>

As most experts recognize, there is a strong environmental case  against the status quo.  But Republicans have failed to make it.  Emphasizing economic costs pits environmental protection against corporate profits, a debate that is difficult to win and obscures what is really at stake.  It may be unreasonable that cleaning a Superfund site costs many millions of dollars.  But the true outrage is that the 15-year-old program is doing little, if anything, to clean up the environment.  And it is frustrating economic redevelopment in poor communities.  Current hazardous waste regulations and endangered species protections often create perverse incentives that increase waste production and the destruction of wildlife habitat.  Challenging this state of affairs is not anti-environment. 

<P>

Large majorities of Americans embrace both the need for strong environmental protection and a limited government agenda. The challenge to would-be reformers is to bridge this gap.  Thus far, the Republicans have not been up to the job.

<P>

CURWOOD: Jonathan Adler is director of Environmental Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and author of Environmentalism at the Crossroads.  Coming up we meet the 23-year-old who's taken the reins of the Sierra Club.  That's next on Living on Earth.

<H1><A NAME = support></A>Federal 
support slipping</H1>
During the 1980s, public concern over health, social and economic problems related to substance abuse 
was very strong, and governments in the US and Canada responded by funding countermeasures such as 
the US War on Drugs and Canada's Drug Strategy (CDS).  Since that time, attention to these vital issues 
has gradually slipped away, and governments now spend less and less on prevention and treatment of drug 
abuse and alcoholism. In late 1995, Health Canada decided to substantially reduce its participation in the CDS, 
which the department had launched with great fanfare in 1987, and renewed in 1992. The abandonment 
of the CDS a year earlier than anticipated comes at a time when drug use among North American high 
school students is inching upwards for the first time in 10 years, and the trend toward fewer alcohol-
related road fatalities appears to be about to reverse itself.<P>
If the Canadian government's faltering commitment to reducing the devastation caused by alcohol and 
other drugs is of concern to you, why not speak up?  Send a message to the federal cabinet ministers 
responsible for Canada's Drug Strategy:<P>

<H1><A NAME = 
provincial></A>Provincial agencies 
disappearing</H1>
Cutbacks have had a disastrous impact on provincial and territorial efforts to treat and prevent substance 
abuse problems. During the past couple of years, several provinces have dismantled independently run 
government agencies established in the 1960s and '70s to focus special attention on drug and alcohol 
issues. Now, as part of the overall health care delivery system in these jurisdictions, prevention, education 
and treatment no longer receive the attention they once did, and a wealth of expertise is being lost. Even 
in provinces where independent agencies such as the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission and 
the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario continue to exist, cuts to funding have seriously 
compromised the effectiveness of substance abuse programs.<P>

Canadian substance abuse experts and resources, contact any or all of the following provincial/territorial

<H1><A NAME = funding></A>Funding 
and outlook for the CCSA</H1>
The CCSA was originally funded under Canada's Drug Strategy to the tune of $2 million per year, but is 
now receiving less than 40% of that original annual allocation.  The Strategy sunsets this year, and the 
Centre has been told that no further funding will be forthcoming after this fiscal year.  The crunch has 
come this year with a 50% cut in core funding (from government) over last year's allocation.  Last year, 
the Centre was able to generate 38% of its budget from revenue received from the sale of products and 
services.  Efforts towards financial self-sufficiency continue;  however, the drastic reduction in core 
funding seriously jeopardizes the future of the Centre.<P>
If you have found this Web site and the other products and services of the Centre to be useful and 
valuable, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to the Centre.  Please contact our Chief 
Executive Officer if you have questions about the funding of the Centre, and would like to offer your

<H1>Canada's Drug Strategy</H1>
<HR>
The objective of Canada's Drug Strategy (CDS) is to reduce the social, economic, physical and 
psychological harm to individuals, families and communities caused by the use and abuse of alcohol and 
other drugs.  The Strategy is a national initiative for which the Minister of Health Canada has lead 
responsibility.  It is an integrated, multi-departmental, and multi-sectoral strategy involving seven federal 
program departments:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Health Canada
<LI>Canadian Heritage
<LI>Justice Canada
<LI>Revenue Canada, Customs
<LI>Ministry of the Solicitor General
<UL>
<LI>Solicitor General Secretariat
<LI>Royal Canadian Mounted Police
<LI>Correction Services Canada
</UL>
<LI>Human Resources Development
<LI>Foreign Affairs and International Trade
</UL>
The Strategy was originally initiated in 1987 for a five-year period with an allocation of $210 million.  
The Strategy was renewed in 1992 for a second five-year term with an allocation of $270 million.  Also 
included in Phase II was the National Driving While Impaired Strategy.<P>
Fundamental to the Strategy are principles of collaboration and partnership and as such inlcudes the 
participation of provincial and territorial governments, law enforcement agencies and organizations, 
community groups, NGO's, business, labour and professional associations.  The Strategy is characterized 
by a balanced approach which includes elements of enforcement and control as well as prevention, 
treatment and rehabilitation.<P>

<H1><A NAME = support></A>Le support 
fédéral tombe</H1>
Au cours des années 1980, la préoccupation concernant les problèmes de santé, sociaux et 
économique reliés aux toxicomanies était très présente et les gouvernements aux États-
unis et au Canada ont réagi en finançant des contre-mesures telles la guerre à la drogue 
des États-unis et la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue (SCA).  Depuis ce temps, l'intérêt 
pour ces questions vitales a graduellement disparu et les gouvernements dépensent de 
moins en moins sur la prévention et le traitement relié à l'abus des drogues et à 
l'alcoolisme. À la fin de l'année 1995, Santé Canada a décidé de réduire sa participation dans la Stratégie 
canadienne antidrogue que le département avait lancé avec grand éclat en 1987, et 
renouvelée en 1992.  L'abandon de la SCA un an avant sa fin prévue, arrive à un moment 
ou la consommation de drogues, par les étudiants nord américains, est en hausse pour la 
première fois depuis dix ans, et la tendance concernant la réduction des accidents de la 
route reliée à l'alcool semble vouloir faire volte-face.<P>
Si l'engagement plutôt chancelant du gouvernement concernant la réduction des 
problèmes dévastateurs causés par l'alcool et les autres drogues vous préoccupe, pourquoi 
ne pas réagir ? Faites parvenir un message aux bureaux des ministres responsables de la 
Stratégie canadienne antidrogue:<P>

<H1><A NAME = provincial></A>Les 
agences provinciales disparaissent</H1>
Les coupures budgétaires ont eu un effet dévastateur sur les efforts provinciaux et 
territoriaux pour prévenir et traiter les problèmes de toxicomanies. Au cours des dernières 
années plusieurs provinces ont démantelé les agences gouvernementales développées dans 
les années 1960 et 1970 afin de s'occuper de façon particulière des questions reliées à 
l'alcool et aux autres drogues. Maintenant, la prévention, l'éducation et le traitement ne 
reçoivent plus l'attention qu'ils ont déjà reçue et une expertise importante est perdue 
parce que ces services sont maintenant intégrés dans l'ensemble général des services 
sociaux et de santé dans ces provinces.  Même les provinces ou des agences privées 
comme l'Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission et la Fondation de la recherche en 
toxicomanie de l'Ontario existent toujours, les coupures budgétaires ont sérieusement 
compromis l'efficacité des programmes relatifs à la toxicomanie.<P>

antérieurement un réseau Canadien d'experts fort et utile et de ressources en toxicomanie,

<H1><A NAME = funding></A>Le 
financement et la perspective pour le 
CCLAT</H1>
Le CCLAT a été à l'origine financé dans le cadre de la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue 
pour une somme de 2 millions de dollars par année, mais reçoit maintenant moins de 40 % 
de l'allocation annuelle de départ. La Stratégie se termine cette année et le CCLAT a été 
avisé qu'aucun financement ne lui sera accordé après cette année fiscale.  Cette année 
nous avons subi une coupure radicale de 50 % de la subvention gouvernementale accordée 
l'an passé. Au cours de la dernière année le Centre a pu générer 38 % de son budget, 
provenant de la vente de produits et services. Les efforts pour l'autonomie financière se 
poursuivent; toutefois la réduction drastique dans la subvention du gouvernement met 
sérieusement en péril l'avenir du CCLAT. <P>
Si vous avez trouvé utile et valable ce site Web et d'autres produits et services du Centre, 
veuillez considérer faire un don déductible d'impôt au Centre.  Veuillez, s'il vous plaît 
communiquer avec le Directeur général du CCLAT si vous avez des questions concernant 
le financement du Centre et que vous souhaitez apporter votre support:<P>

<H1>Stratégie canadienne antidrogue</H1>
<HR>
La Stratégie canadienne antidrogue (SCA) a pour objectif de réduire les méfaits (sur les plans social, 
économique, physique et psychologique) causés aux personnes, aux familles et aux collectivités par l'usage 
et l'abus de l'alcool et des autres drogues.  Cette stratégie intégrée, pluri-ministérielle et multi-sectorielle est une 
initiative nationale dont la mise en oeuvre relève principalement de la ministre de la Santé.  Sept 
ministères fédéraux y participent:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Santé Canada
<LI>Développement des ressources humaines
<LI>Patrimoine canadien
<LI>Affaires étrangères et Commerce international
<LI>Revenu Canada (Douanes)
<LI>Justice Canada
<LI>Ministère du Solliciteur général
<UL>
<LI>Secrétariat du Solliciteur général
<LI>Gendarmerie royale du Canada
<LI>Service correctionnel Canada
</UL>
</UL>
La SCA a été lancée en 1987 pour une période initiale de cinq ans.  Le budget alloué était de 210 millions 
de dollars.  La SCA a ensuite été reconduite pour une nouvelle période de cinq ans.  Le budget de la phase 
II, qui incorporait la Stratégie nationale de lutte contre la conduite avec facultés affaiblies, s'élevait à 270 
millions de dollars en 1992.<P>
La Stratégie repose sur des principes de collaboration et de partenariat, ce qui explique que tout un 
éventail de partenaires y participent : gouvernements des provinces et des territoires, organismes 
d'application de la loi, ONG, monde des affaires, groupements syndicaux et associations professionnelles.  
La Stratégie se caractérise par une approche équilibrée qui laisse autant de place aux mesures 
d'application de la loi et de contrôle qu'à la prévention, au traitement et à la réadaptation.<P>

<TITLE>Being sued can ruin a good party</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/suedwebe.gif" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=365 HSPACE=20 ALT="Being Sued">
<H1><BR><BR>Being sued can ruin a good 
party</H1>
<H3>What you should know about serving alcohol 
responsibly</H3><BR CLEAR=left>
<H4><BR>Your party, your problem</H4>
When you host a party, you want it to be a good time - an opportunity for you and your guests to unwind a 
little.  When alcohol is involved, unwinding can sometimes go too far: the actions of an intoxicated guest 
can lead to death or injury.  And you can be held responsible, whether you're a private citizen, an 
employer, or the owner of a commercial establishment.  You can be sued - and sued big - even if you 
didn't actually serve a drop of liquor.<P>
<H4>Serving intoxicated patrons</H4>
Many of us are familiar with the kind of case in which a tavern or bar is sued when an intoxicated patron 
leaves the premises and injures or kills someone while driving home.  Licensed establishments have legal 
responsibilities to prevent people from becoming drunk and to stop serving people who are already drunk.  
What many people don't realize, says University of Western Ontario law professor Robert Solomon, is that 
the same tough principles are being applied to social hosts.<P>
<H4>Suing the social host</H4>
The first Canadian case to address a social host's liability for serving alcohol was Baumeister.  He was 
rendered a quadriplegic in a car accident following a high school graduation party at the Carefoots' home.  
He sued the driver and the Carefoots.  The court indicated that social hosts, like bars, could be held liable 
for serving intoxicated guests who subsequently injure themselves or others.  In addition to liability as a 
provider of alcohol, a homeowner may be held liable as an occupier (a person who has control of the 
premises).<P>
<H4>Losing control</H4>
That's what happened to Fulton when his son threw a "bush party" on the family property.<P>
One of the 300 participants, Meunier, got drunk and started a fight that left him a quadriplegic.  He sued, 
claiming that Fulton was responsible for allowing an event to take place which he should have realized 
was potentially dangerous.  This was not the first "bush party" on the Fulton property that had resulted in 
problems.  Fulton's insurance company settled out of court fro $700,000, <I>even though Fulton's son 
hadn't provided alcohol to anyone, and hadn't even formally invited anyone to the party.</I><P>
<H4>Expanding legal responsibility</H4>
As the Baumeister and Meunier cases suggest, there has been a clear trend towards increasing the legal 
responsibility of anyone who provides alcohol or hosts events where people are drinking.<P>
<H4>No "quick fixes"</H4>
Various strategies have been advanced to reduce the risks of a civil suit, including designated driver 
programs, waivers of liability and even special-event insurance.  But, Prof. Solomon cautions, the "piece-
meal adoption of isolated initiatives" cannot take the place of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risks 
associated with alcohol.  For example, while designated drivers and alternative transportation policies 
address the major risk of drinking and driving, it may lull the host into a false belief that he can serve his 
non-driving guests as much alcohol as he wishes.  However, if one of the drunken guests falls down the 
stairs, walks through a patio door, or starts a fight, the home-owner may be successfully sued.<P>
<H4>What you can do</H4>
If you operate a drinking establishment, you can reduce your risk of legal liability by instituting a program 
of manager and server training.  Personnel should learn to recognize and prevent intoxication and its 
associated problems.<P>
As a social host, you have broad responsibilities where alcohol is involved, but you also have authority to 
control who comes onto your premises.  With a little common sense, you can avoid situations that lead to 
injuries and lawsuits.  Even if mishaps don't occur, no thoughtful host would want a guest to lose his or 
her licence for impaired driving.  Prof. Solomon offers the following suggestions:<P>
<I><B>Plan your party</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>Plan to provide food throughout the party.  A guest who has been eating may not become as 
intoxicated;
<LI>Do not make drinking the focus of the party;
<LI>Do not combine alcohol and dangerous activities, such as boating, swimming, skiing and 
snowmobiling;
<LI>Smaller parties are easier to manage.  Large parties and open houses require more planning and 
supervision;
<LI>Arrange transportation ahead of time for those who will be drinking;
<LI>Check the physical condition of the premises for hazards that could endanger the safety of your 
guest;
</UL>
<I><B>Serve alcohol sensibly</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>Promote non-alcoholic or low-alcohol content drinks;
<LI>Serve your guests rather than having an open bar;
<LI>Do not serve doubles or extra-strong drinks;
<LI>Stop serving alcohol long before you expect the party to break up;
</UL>
<I><B>Stay on top of problems</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>Be attentive to your guests' behaviour and be prepared to have a friendly word with a guest who is 
becoming intoxicated;
<LI>Do not tolerate drinking competitions, or other illegal behaviour;
<LI>Do not serve guests who are already intoxicated.  Remember, they may be legally impaired before 
they appear drunk;
<LI>Arrange for guests who may be impaired to be taken home safely or stay the night.  Friends don't let 
friends drive drunk.
</UL>
<H3><I>Being a good host means protecting your guests, 
yourself and others, as well as having a good time.</I></H3>

<FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>Policy, Research and Information</H2></FONT>
<STRONG>The Policy, Research and Information Unit identifies new research developments and provides technical 
support to the Centre and its key stakeholders.  Policy analysts and research associates focus on 
bridging the gap between research and policy, making research more relevant to community groups, law 
enforcement officials and policy makers.<P>
<P><FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>National Clearinghouse</H2></FONT>
The Clearinghouse has a full and part-time staff of six.  Staff time is divided between two major efforts:  
development of information products, and provision of information services.  One of the primary reasons 
for the creation of the Clearinghouse was to fill the gaps in substance abuse information in Canada, and to 
disseminate that information to those needing it.  The Clearinghouse coordinates the <A HREF="/csaine.htm">Canadian Substance 
Abuse Information Network (CSAIN),</A> whose members exchange information, share resources, and 
develop new information products.<P>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>Liaison and Coordination</H2></FONT>
The goal of Liaison and Coordination is to create opportunities for dialogue and exchange among the 
Centre's various partners, nationally and internationally.  This work is focused on several key areas, 
including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Workplace issues
<LI>Youth-related issues
<LI>Partnerships among different sectors
</UL>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>Communications</H2></FONT>
The Communications Unit is responsible for publishing high quality print products, including the Centre's 
newsletter, <A HREF="/aneng.htm">Action News</A>.  Communications staff are also involved in a variety of non-publishing 
activities, or in projects where publishing is not the primary goal.  These endeavors include  providing background and assistance to the news media on a wide range of current issues.</STRONG><P>

Throughout its seven-year existence, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse has worked hard to live up 
to the mandate it received from Parliament to contribute "to the development and application of 
knowledge and expertise" in the substance abuse field.  Although CCSA fulfils other functions, we see this 
role as our main raison d'être.  Our long-term goal is to develop a Canadian knowledge system on alcohol 
and other drugs.<P>
That is why we established the National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse, and why, more recently, we 
initiated projects on estimating the social and economic costs of alcohol and other drug abuse.  That is 
also the reason we are spearheading new information partnerships such as the Canadian community 
Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (CCENDU), and the Workplace Substance Abuse Information 
Network.  For us the impetus in each of these cases is simple: we cannot make sound decisions about 
alcohol and drug policy and programming in this country if our knowledge of the problem is lacking.<P>
This report is intended as a "snapshot" of CCSA activity in the gathering, creation and dissemination of 
information.  Its focus is mainly quantitative; that is, how many people have we reached? This type of 
measurement is a necessary first step toward discovering something more important: did we really help 
those people? We have begun to work on mechanisms for making that determination and this effort will 
be reflected in future annual reports.<P>

<H3>The official newsletter of the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>Important notice to <I>Action News</I> readers</H2>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse began publishing <I>Action News</I> more than six years ago as a way of disseminating news about drug and alcohol abuse to a wide variety of people involved in, or at least concerned with, the prevention of addiction-related problems. Despite endless cost-saving measures, and the introduction of paid subscriptions, the cost of publishing and distributing <I>Action News</I> was a drain on <A HREF="/funding.htm#funding">CCSA's core funding</A>. Now this funding has been severely cut, and as a result, we have suspended formal publication of <I>Action News</I> (<A HREF="/anletter.htm">click here for more details</A>). We will continue to mail out a scaled-down version of our newsletter to paid subscribers for as long as resources allow. We will also post this abbreviated material on our web site. We'll still call it <I>Action News</I> (why reinvent the pretzel?) and, to make librarians' lives easier, we will retain the volume and number system of the old <I>Action News</I>.<P>

<H2>National collaboration paves the way for a Canadian prevalence study of problem gambling</H2>
Gambling losses averaged $166 for every person in Canada in 1995. For some families, the cost was 
devastating. A new project could help reduce the harm.<P>
Gambling has become big business in Canada, and big trouble for many people who take a chance on 
lotteries, casinos, and video lottery terminals (VLTs). Provincial governments, quick to em-brace this form of 
voluntary taxation, raked in more than $5 billion in 1995 in lottery revenues alone.<P>
VLTs, described as the "crack cocaine of gambling" by some addictions specialists, are popping up 
everywhere, including Ontario where 20,000 new machines will soon go into service. Government casinos are 
siphoning money away from local charity bingos, and swelling the ranks of impoverished people showing up at 
soup kitchens.<P>
Some provinces are starting to plow a small percentage of gambling revenues back into prevention and 
treatment, and agencies such as the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC) are making great 
strides in preparing addictions professionals to deal with the emerging problems.<P>
However, the job of understanding and treating compulsive gambling is severely hampered by a lack of in-
formation about the nature and extent of the problem. We don't have the depth of knowledge around gambling 
that we have around alcohol and drug abuse where we can draw on decades of prevalence studies. As well, the 
methods used to measure problem gambling are not totally satisfactory.<P>
The standard instrument, the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) was designed for clinical use, not for surveying general populations.<P>
<H3>Provinces unite in project</H3>
The need for more reliable data has led to a promising exercise in national collaboration. In August, Nova 
Scotia hosted a video-conference bringing together officials from nine provinces to talk about gambling and the 
need to collaborate on ways to gather prevalence data. Another meeting of these representatives was held the 
following month in Winnipeg in conjunction with a conference on problem gambling organized by AADAC, 
Saskatchewan Health, and the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba (AFM). The event, Profiling the Canadian 
Experience, attracted more than 250 participants, including 27 representatives from eight provinces who 
agreed to continue discussions on the new Canadian Problem Gambling Prevalence Project.<P>
The project will define problem gambling, and affected populations, using common criteria and standard 
terminology; determine indicators of socio-economic impact; and provide provinces with data they can use to 
decide how to best spend resources. Project participants are communicating by means of an Internet listserv 
provided by CCSA. For more project information, contact <A HREF="mailto:groberts @ccsa.ca">Gary Roberts</A> at CCSA, (613) 235-4048, ext. 225. 
<P>
<H3>What the CADS says about gambling</H3>
CCSA research associate Eric Single has written a chapter on gambling in <I>Canada's Alcohol and Other 
Drugs Survey,</I> soon to be released by Health Canada. The CADS questions were designed to measure 
gambling activity, not problem severity. They reveal:<P>
<UL>
<LI>61.4% of Canadians over the age of 15 played a lottery or cards for money in the previous 12 months;
<LI>46.3% reported playing a lottery, betting on sports, or playing cards for money once a month or more;
<LI>14.8% of respondents played bingo, with 7.7% playing once a month or more;
<LI>8% of those who reported betting on a lottery, sports or cards, or playing bingo travelled to places such as 
Las Vegas, Atlantic City or other Canadian cities with casinos in order to gamble;
<LI>6.8% engaged in some other form of gambling in the past 12 months such as VLTs (0.8%) or buying a 
raffle ticket (0.7%);
<LI>men are more likely than women to bet on lotteries (66.1% v. 59.4%), whereas women are more likely to 
play bingo (18.5% v. 8.2%);
<LI>betting on lotteries, cards or sports increases from ages 15-17 (28.6%) to ages 55-64 (70.6%), then 
declines.

<H3>Long-awaited statement on FAS advises abstention</H3>
A joint statement on fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects, issued by Health C and the Canadian Pediatric Society (CPS), calls FAS the "leading cause of developmental delay" in North America and recommends that "the prudent choice for women who are or may become pregnant is to abstain from alcohol". However, "women who have consumed small amounts of alcohol occasionally during pregnancy" should be told that "the risk is likely minimal".<P>
The FAS/FAE prevention statement was developed and supported by 19 national associations representing medical, nursing and midwifery disciplines, aboriginal and multicultural groups, and other organizations, including CCSA, known for their work in FAS. More than two years in preparation, the statement says prevention efforts should be "family-centred culturally sensitive, and comprehensive".<P>

<H3>Big-city police chiefs pick treatment over prisons</H3>
An article in the <I>RCMP Gazette</I> (Vol. 58, No. 7 and 8, 1996) says a majority of US police chiefs 
regard drug abuse as the most serious crime problem in their community and call for major changes in 
approaches to reducing drug use. In a 1995 survey, 60% of the chiefs said law enforcement efforts have been 
unsuccessful. However, they overwhelmingly rejected decriminalization of drugs as an alternative measure.<P>
Two-thirds of large-city chiefs said it is a step in the wrong direction to shift federal funds from drug prevention 
and treatment programs to law enforcement and prison construction. The majority said treatment programs for 
offenders are hard to find in their communities. <P>

</I><H3>Yukon finds formula for cost-recovered training</H3>
Some innovative thinking by a small team of prevention consultants with Alcohol and Drug Services (ADS) in 
Whitehorse resulted in three days of professional development training for nine ADS staff members, as well as 
the creation of a new network of allied professionals committed to community mobilization-all at no cost to 
ADS.  <P>
The staff at ADS wanted to take the training in Prevention and Community Mobilization offered by the Alberta 
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC), but couldn't afford it. So they organized a three-day 
workshop by AADAC in September and opened it up to allied professionals, including people from justice and 
law enforcement, who paid $95 each to attend. Nine ADS staff and 31 allied professionals took the training. 
<P>
Addictions prevention consultant Jocelyn Gauthier said ADS not only recovered more than the cost of training, 
but they also built a network of people interested in community mobilization. By keeping the event small and 
making it a workshop rather than a conferee, they were able to handle the administrative chores without extra 
staff.<P>

<H2>New survey results paint a clear picture of rising illicit drug use by North American youth</H2>
<FONT SIZE=4>Figures for 1993-95 show the first upsurge in adolescent drug use–including heroin–in more than a decade. No one knows why for sure, but shifting government priorities could be part of the answer.</FONT><P>
The good news is that illicit drug use by youth in Canada and the US is still well below levels recorded in the late 1970s and early '80s. It was these soaring rates that prompted the US to declare a "war on drugs", and Canada to launch Canada's Drug Strategy in the mid-1980s.<P>
We may never know with any certainty what role these well-funded efforts played in the reduction of drug use that followed; there are too many confounding factors. But we do know–and here's the bad news–that drug use is starting to trend upwards again, at a time when political commitment to the areas of prevention, education and treatment is gradually evaporating. Here is some recent evidence of rising drug use:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The latest edition of The Ontario Student Drug Use Survey, which has been carried out every two years since 1977 by the Addiction Research Foundation (ARF), shows that between 1993 and 1995, past-year use of eight of 20 drugs increased significantly, while no drug declined in use. Attitudes and beliefs about drug use, particularly marijuana, became more liberal in this period.
<LI>Drugs whose use increased significantly included cannabis (12.7% to 22.7%), glue (1.6% to 2.4%), methamphetamine ("speed") (2% to 4.6%), hallucinogens other than LSD or PCP (3.1% to 7.6%), PCP (0.6% to 1.7%), cocaine (1.5% to 2.4%), and ecstasy (0.6% to 1.8%)
<LI>The ARF survey also showed a disturbing increase in heroin use by 9th graders, from 1.2% to 2.2%.
<LI>The survey also revealed that the percentage of students injecting drugs increased from 5.4% in 1993 to 8.8% in 1995.
<LI>In the US, Preliminary estimates from the 1995 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, released in August, show that the percentage of adolescents (12-17 years old) using drugs increased between 1994 and 1995, continuing a trend that began in 1993. The rate in 1995 (10.9%) was twice that of 1992.
<LI>Significant increases in past-month marijuana use (from 6% to 8.2%), cocaine use (from 0.3% to 0.8%), and hallucinogen use (from 1.1% to 1.7%) were recorded between 1994 and 1995.
</UL>
<H3>Perceived risk is less</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Another US report, the 21st Annual Monitoring the Future Study, showed similar results for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, but added heroin and stimulants to the list of drugs whose use is growing. As well, the perception of risk connected with drug use has dropped and the perceived availability of drugs has increased.
<LI>Preliminary estimates from the US Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), released in August, show increases in marijuana/hashish-related hospital emergencies among those 12 to 17 years old, and 35 and older, between 1994 and 1995.
</UL>
US authorities are bracing for more bad news about marijuana. The 1995 Household Survey notes that "the decrease in prevalence of marijuana use that occurred in the 1980s did not begin until several years after the peak in incidence (initiation) estimates. This suggests that unless there are changes in the factors that influence drug use behaviours, we should not expect decreases in prevalence to occur soon, since incidence was still rising in 1994."<P>
A final sobering note: "The recent upturn in illicit drug use . . .has important implications for substance abuse prevention and treatment efforts. In terms of prevention, there is an obvious need to focus immediate attention on children and adolescents. In the long run, the increasing proportion of young people using illicit drugs will probably result in continuing pressure on the substance abuse treatment system in future years, as many new drug users progress to addiction and require intervention."<P>

<H3>Canadian drug policy under House scrutiny</H3>
The House of Commons Standing Committee on Health will focus on demand reduction when it begins its 
review of substance abuse policies in October. The Committee will look at education, prevention, treatment and 
rehabilitation, and does not plan to re-open the debate on supply reduction that marked the lengthy passage of 
Bill C-8 (the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act) through Parliament.<P>
The Committee will examine the impact of legal and illegal drugs on the social behaviour and physical health of 
Canadians, and will assess demand reduction measures implemented under Canada's Drug Strategy over 
nearly 10 years. It will then make appropriate recommendations on future policy directions no later than June, 
1997.<P>

<H3>CACP asks Ottawa for renewed commitment</H3>
The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has strongly urged the Government of Canada to renew its 
commitment to a "coordinated and balanced drug strategy with appropriate resources" to deal with drug 
trafficking and money laundering "in a collaborative fashion with health, enforcement, prevention and treatment 
programs". The message was contained in a resolution passed at the CACP's annual general meeting in Ottawa 
in August.<P>
In another resolution, the CACP objected to the growing of low-THC hemp "without appropriate regulations, 
monitoring systems, security and enforcement procedures being implemented by Health and Welfare 
Canada".<P>

<H3>CRTC eases restrictions on broadcast alcohol ads</H3>
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is proposing to do away with the requirement for pre-clearance of scripts advertising alcoholic beverages. Instead, the CRTC will "encourage" the broadcast industry to establish its own mechanisms for weeding out ads that don't meet the CRTC's advertising code.<P>
Another proposed change to CRTC regulations is the lifting of restrictions on who may advertise alcoholic beverages. Current rules prohibit advertising by anyone other than brewers, distillers, wineries and cider-houses. Now any retailer could advertise as long as they follow the CRTC's code. <P>
The CRTC's proposed amendments would see its advertising code incorporated into the regulations, but there is no explanation of how the code will be enforced once the CRTC ends its involvement with the pre-clearance process. As well, an interpretation section has been written, but this will not be part of the code itself. The Canadian Association of Broadcasters, which would take over responsibility for pre-clearance, had recommended that the interpretation section be dropped altogether.<P>
The CRTC expressed the "expectation" that broadcasters would expand their efforts to inform the public about alcohol-related problems and will require the industry to report annually on these efforts.<P>
However, it is not clear what objective test the CRTC will use to determine whether the public has been presented with a balanced view. The CRTC rejected the notion of specifying a ratio of counter-advertising to brand promotion.<P>
<I>The CRTC wants reaction to Public Notice CRTC 1996-108 by Oct. 1. Write the Secretary-General, CRTC, Ottawa, ON  K1A 0N2 Tel. 819-997-0313, fax 819-994-0218</I><P>

<H3>Alcohol and Other Drug Use in Canada</H3>
<H4>Eric Single, Anne MacLennan, and Patricia MacNeil</H4>
<H5>A Research Publication from the Studies Unit, Health Promotion 
Directorate, Health Canada; and the Canadian Centre on Substance 
Abuse</H5><BR CLEAR=left>
<H3><BR>Executive Summary</H3>
Canada's Drug Strategy was launched by the federal government in May 1987 in collaboration with the 10 
provincial and two territorial governments and many nongovernment organizations.  The objective of the 
partners is to reduce harm caused by alcohol and other drug use.<P>
<I>Horizons 1994: Alcohol and Other Drug Use in Canada</I> is the first research-based publication to 
emerge since the Strategy entered its second phase in 1992.  The publication is one of the most current and 
comprehensive views to date of knowledge about alcohol and other drug use and related health and social 
problems in Canada. It also examines work of potentially national significance in all of the provinces and 
territories with people at particular risk of harm: women, Métis, Inuit and off-reserve aboriginal peoples, out-
of-the-mainstream youth, seniors, and impaired drivers.<P>
<H5>Who Drinks?</H5>
Fewer Canadians are drinking alcohol.  The proportion of people 15 years and older who say in various 
national surveys that they drink dropped to 74.4% in the 1993 General Social Survey (GSS) from 79.0% in the 
1991 GSS.  In 1993, 18.0% said they had quit drinking, and 7.7% had never drunk.  Men are more likely than 
women to drink (80.6% vs. 68.4%), and younger people more likely than older (84.6% of those 20 to 24 years 
old vs. 43.0% of those 65 years and more).  Unemployed people, however, are less likely than those working 
to report drinking in the past year (75.2% vs. 82.7%).<P>
<H5>Who Smokes?</H5>
Rates of cigarette smoking have declined substantially in recent years, but 29% of Canadians aged 15 and 
older still smoke regularly, with Québec and Newfoundland having the highest proportion of smokers (34% 
and 32% respectively) and Ontario and British Columbia the lowest (27% and 26% respectively).  Health 
Canada has been monitoring smoking rates since cigarette prices were reduced.  Early results indicate a 
slight increase in the number of young people (aged 15-19) smoking but no overall change in the amount 
smoked.<P>
<H5>Licit Drugs</H5>
In 1993, more than two of every three Canadians aged 15 and older (69.8%) reported using ASA (Aspirin) in 
the month before the survey.  Québecers were least likely to use ASA (59.1%), and people in Saskatchewan, 
Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia were most likely (about 75% each).  Narcotic pain relievers, such as 
codeine, Demerol (meperidine), and morphine, are the most frequently used type of prescription drugs 
(8.2%), with use highest in British Columbia (12.4%) and lowest in Québec (3.2%).  About 4% of Canadians 
aged 15 and older - one in 25 - reported using sleeping pills, and 3.8% reported using tranquillizers.  Of all of 
the provinces, Québec has the highest reported levels of use of sleeping pills (6.1%) and tranquillizers 
(7.4%).<P>
<H5>Illicit Drugs</H5>
In 1993, about one million Canadians (4.2%) aged 15 or older reported use of marijuana in the past year; use 
is highest in British Columbia and lowest in Saskatchewan.<P>
<H5>At-Risk Groups</H5>
Data on at-risk populations are limited nationally and rarely comparable region to region, but knowledge is 
emerging from research projects and programs across the country.  Review of work in the provinces and 
territories - west to east - highlights findings about at-risk populations and provides glimpses of some of the 
diverse regional forces - social, geographical, and historical - that help shape the larger picture of alcohol- 
and other drug-related harm in Canada.<P>
<H5>Issues and Challenges</H5>
The Drug Strategy is complex and challenging, but there is growing acknowledgement and understanding of 
some of the difficulties.  Researchers and other contributors to this document refer to a range of issues: 
difficulties around gathering the data and developing new knowledge; around getting the information out to 
the people who need it and in the language and format in which they need it; around reconciling research 
imperatives with the requirements of policymakers; and, for the treatment worker and program person, 
around translating what is new and useful into action in the community.  With understanding of some of the 
problems comes progress.<P>

<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
While there is considerable interest in the subject, information on the use of alcohol and other drugs by 
Canadian seniors is not extensive.  This report summarizes some of the more significant and interesting 
results which have been found to date from survey research.  It also highlights gaps in our current 
knowledge, and suggests methods by which deficiencies in our understanding can be corrected.<P>
<H2>Key Findings to Date</H2>
<H3>Alcohol</H3>
<UL>
<LI>There are proportionally fewer current drinkers among older people than there are in the younger age 
categories.  Alcohol is the most common drug used by older persons.
<LI>The main reasons for consuming alcohol reported by older people is to be sociable.  Older individuals 
are much more likely to drink at home or with friends than other age groups.
<LI>Individuals in the older age categories are much less likely to report problems with alcohol than 
younger individuals.
</UL>
<H3>Tobacco</H3>
<UL>
<LI>On average, 25 to 30% of older men and 15 to 20% of older women smoke.
<LI>Older smokers are less likely to express the desire to quit and are less concerned with the health 
problems caused by smoking than younger smokers.
</UL>
<H3>Medications</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Use of medications for both sexes, although not common, tends to increase with age.  Generally, older 
women use more medications than older men.

<HR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
Women's use of substances is not a new phenomenon. The first widely documented use of drugs by women 
occurred in the 18th century, when the use of patent medicines was widespread. These medicines were 
recommended to women for a wide variety of ailments, such as menstrual symptoms and anxiety. They 
usually contained alcohol and, in some cases, opiates. Their usage was so widespread that many women 
become dependent. Consumption of laudanum, an opium derivative, escalated in the 19th century. The 
few studies done on opiate use in the 1880's revealed that women users outnumbered men two to one. 
Although social consumption of drugs and alcohol by women was widely condemned by society, doctors 
continued to prescribe them as medicine. This type of use was viewed acceptable in the eyes of 
society.<P>
Medicating women's symptoms continues to this day. Women are still seeking the help of physicians to 
deal with symptoms that cause distress in their lives. Many caregivers fail to address the underlying 
causes of the symptoms, prescribing tranquillizers and other medications to deal with various problems.  
The use of chemicals is reinforced as a means of solving problems rather than addressing them 
directly.<P>
Until the early 1980s determining the prevalence of drinking and other drug use by women was difficult 
because national surveys tended to use questions based on men's experiences which were not necessarily 
relevant to women. Research since 1980 has more systematically examined gender differences and a more 
accurate picture is evolving.<P>
This report summarizes some of the more significant and interesting results from recent Canadian survey 
research. It also highlights gaps in our current knowledge and suggests ways to correct these 
deficiencies.<P>
<H2>Key findings to date</H2>
<H3>Alcohol</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol is the drug most commonly used by women. Within all age groups, women are less likely 
than men to be current drinkers and to drink less frequently in smaller amounts.
<LI>Over the past decade, surveys have found the proportion of women who are abstainers is declining. 
This may be in part because drinking is more common among younger women of today.
<LI>The most common reason given by women for quitting or reducing alcohol consumption is 
pregnancy, diet or athletic training.
<LI>Almost one-fifth (19%) of women between the ages of 20 and 24 had consumed five or more drinks 
on a single occasion six or more times during the previous year.  Preventing alcohol-related birth defects 
is important for this age group.
<LI>Fewer women than men report having a problem with alcohol. This may reflect a lack of gender-
relevant questions in surveys or a reluctance of women to report problems.
</UL>
<H3>Tobacco</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The highest percentage of current smokers is among those aged 25-44 (34%), followed by those aged 
20-24 (31%). The lowest percentage (13%) is among those aged 65 and older.
<LI>While tobacco use has decreased in the population as a whole, women's rates are now equal to or 
slightly higher than men's rates among younger age groups.
<LI>In mid-age groups, the percentage of women who smoke is approaching that of men because men 
have quit at higher rates than women.
<LI>Smoking during pregnancy has been associated with lower birth weights and increases in 
spontaneous abortions.
</UL>
<H3>Medications</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Except for ASA, vitamins and codeine, the use of medications by women in general is relatively rare.
<LI>For those 45 and older and in particular for those 65 and older, use of heart or blood pressure 
medications is fairly common. The use of sleeping pills shows a similar pattern, but with lower use rates.
<LI>Higher medication use among older women poses special problems because of increased multiple 
drug use and the potential for drug interactions.
<LI>Most prescribed medications have not been tested for effects on pregnancy.
</UL>
<H3>Illegal drugs</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Except for marijuana, lifetime use of illegal drugs is relatively rare among women. Use of these 
drugs decreases with age and is almost non-existent after age 45.
<LI>Frequent use of drugs such as cocaine, crack and amphetamines is likely more common among sub-
groups of women such as those who are on the street. General population surveys usually miss these 
groups.
<LI>The effects of illegal drugs on pregnancy are difficult to determine because most users also drink and 
smoke tobacco.
</UL>
<H2>Future research needs</H2>
Research on women and substance use has been limited in the past to an examination of the problem, 
without acknowledging its connection to other problems and events. Future research focusing on the 
multitude of inter-related factors comprising the reality of women's lives may be the key to understanding 
and responding to their needs.<P>
The final part of this report discusses some of the special considerations which should be addressed when 
investigating women's alcohol and other drug use and concludes with recommendations concerning 
specific questions which could be included in future surveys.<P>
<HR>
<H2>Acknowledgments</H2>

<HR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
The assessment of alcohol and other drug problems among young people is particularly important because 
such research can identify present problems and may predict future trends and problems.<P>
Alcohol and other drug use among young people is characterized by rapid change. From the early teens 
onward there is decreasing psychological and physical dependency on parents and other adults, combined 
with the increasing influence of peers. However, throughout early adolescence the family still continues to 
exert considerable control which may conflict with peer influence and with situations where this control is 
no longer valid. Thus, drinking and drug use contexts and changes in these contexts are important to 
assess in order to understand patterns of alcohol and other drug consumption among the young.<P>
Alcohol and other drug problems among youth differ from those among adults. First, if young people are 
under the legal drinking age they violate the law by the very acts of purchasing and consuming alcohol. 
Second, their problems tend to have two dimensions: using large amounts periodically rather than regular 
consumption and having acute experiences like nausea, loss of coordination, and situational difficulties 
like arguments and physical injury rather than chronic health concerns and familial breakdown.<P>
This report summarizes some of the more significant and interesting results about young people's alcohol 
and other drug use from recent Canadian survey research. It also highlights gaps in current knowledge 
and suggests methods by which deficiencies in our understanding can be corrected.<P>
<H2>Key findings to date</H2>
<H3>Alcohol</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Among young people alcohol is the most frequently used drug. There are large increases in use with 
age up to the mid-twenties.
<LI>Research during the last two decades has tended to show a decrease in alcohol consumption among 
youth. There are, however, some indications that this trend may be reversing, particularly among older 
youth in university.
<LI>The rate of abstinence from alcohol is greater for young women than for young men. However, it is 
not known if reported abstinence among young people represents permanent abstinence.
<LI>Among young Canadians problem drinking is often of the infrequent, high volume variety.
<LI>Although consumption rates rise considerably with age, reported problems do not. Reported 
problems tend to consist of acute distress, such as nausea and hangovers or interpersonal problems with 
friends.
<LI>Friends are the dominant drinking companions for young people and a significant amount of 
consumption occurs in bars and taverns despite legal age restrictions.
</UL>
<H3>Tobacco</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Among those under 20, less than one fifth smoke daily and there is little difference between men and 
women.
<LI>Young men are more likely than young women to be lifetime abstainers.
</UL>
<H3>Medications</H3>
<UL>
<LI>There is an extremely low rate of medication use by young people.
<LI>The two most frequently reported types of potentially addictive medications used by young people are 
diet pills or stimulants and codeine, Demerol or morphine.
</UL>
<H3>Illegal drugs</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The most widely used illegal drug is cannabis with over one-third of those aged 15-24 having used at 
some time in their lives.
<LI>Use of other illegal drugs is rare in the general youth population. However, studies of street youth 
have shown greater use of LSD.
</UL>
<H2>Future research needs</H2>
Because the use of alcohol and other drugs varies with age, each age group presents unique problems for 
survey design and analyses. With respect to young people, the following issues and problems are 
particularly relevant.<P>
<H3>Age, or what is youth?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Among major surveys, the age range for young people varies from 12 to 30. Because there is no 
consistency in the range limits or in the age groupings used, comparisons among surveys are difficult.
<LI>Youth is a time of rapid change, thus any study of the relationship between age and change must 
have a large enough sample to allow for very fine categorization.
<LI>The legal drinking age, which varies from province to province, is an important consideration and 
should be taken into account when creating age categories.
</UL>
<H3>Sampling</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Youth who are most at risk from harm related to drug use are not likely to be identified through 
national sample surveys. They must be sought out in institutions, in the streets and in aboriginal 
communities.
<LI>Problems of adolescents who are in the most trouble with substance use cannot be assessed through 
surveys. Different, perhaps more qualitative and intensive, methods are required.
</UL>
<H3>Measuring alcohol consumption</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Patterns of use vary considerably with age; therefore, careful consideration must be given to 
assessing alcohol consumption.
<LI>A three-dimensional conceptualization as used in the Yukon Alcohol and Drug Survey is suggested 
for use with young people.
</UL>
<H3>Education, marital status and income</H3>
<UL>
<LI>While these variables have fairly good associations with some measures of alcohol and other drug 
use, the meaning of such associations is dubious when young people are involved.
</UL>
<H3>Contexts of young peoples' alcohol use</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Drinking contexts have rarely been examined systematically despite their presumed importance.
<LI>For youth, special attention needs to be paid to the aspects of the setting in which drinking occurs, 
the incidence of intoxication and the length of the drinking occasion.
</UL>
<H3>Consequences of alcohol use</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The positive functions of alcohol use have received little attention. Since most people begin drinking 
in a social situation, the positive aspects of this are important to understand.
<LI>With respect to problems, the instruments and scales commonly used to measure alcohol dependence 
in adults are inappropriate for measuring the problems common to youth.
</UL>
<H3>Health risks</H3>
Research about youth and substance use generally ignores the biomedical consequences of frequent and/or 
heavy use. Nutrition is an important factor which should be examined.<P>
Studies have consistently shown a positive association between alcohol use, sexual activity and having 
unprotected sex. Since youth are generally sexually active and likely to periodically drink heavily, these 
relationships need to be explored in more detail.<P>
<H2>Recommended survey questions</H2>
The final part of this report presents a wide variety of recommended survey questions for use with young 
people.<P>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
Drug use and drug injecting can result in a number of problems for the individual, the community and 
society as a whole.  HIV has greatly increased the direct harms associated with drug injecting in particular 
and the indirect harms associated with drug use in general.  HIV and other infections can be transmitted 
when used needles, syringes and other paraphernalia are shared and they thereby pose a direct risk to 
injection drug users.  In addition, use of alcohol and other drugs may pose an indirect threat in that drug use 
in general may be associated with the practice of risky behaviours including unsafe sex and unsafe 
injecting.<P>
The implications of HIV transmission among drug users are profound.  In Canada as in many other 
countries, the heterosexual transmission of HIV is in part fed by the epidemic among injection drug users.  
The gravity of the situation is made more apparent by consideration of the fact that the majority of injection 
drug users have non-injecting sexual partners.  In addition, women with HIV infection due to drug use or 
sexual activity with an injection drug user are at risk of bearing HIV infected children.<P>
Experience in a number of countries has shown that, in the absence of preventive measures, the number of 
people infected with HIV can increase very rapidly once the virus has spread among drug users.  Experts 
around the world agree that intensive efforts to keep infection rates among injection drug users below 10 
percent are necessary.  If infection levels go beyond this, the epidemic can become explosive in nature as 
has been seen in several cities around the world.  In Edinburgh, Scotland, seroprevalence in injection drug 
users increased from 5 in 1983 to 57 percent in 1985 (Robertson et al., 1986).  In Bangkok, Thailand, rates 
rose from 1 percent in 1987 to 43 percent in 1988 (Berkelman et al., 1989).  In both of these cities, the primary 
reason for the rapid rise in levels of infection was the lack of availability of clean injection equipment.<P>
In Canada, proportions of injection drug users with HIV infection vary from 5-6 percent in Vancouver to 6-8 
percent in Toronto and 10-20 percent in Montreal.  Among inmates of correctional institutions, rates of HIV 
infection appear to reflect the level of infection among injection drug users in the general community.  In a 
study of provincial jails in BC, 2.1 percent of inmates with a history of injection drug use were found to be 
HIV positive (Rothon, 1993).  In an Ontario study of the provincial system, this rate was 3.8 percent 
(Calzavara, 1993).  In Quebec, the rates among male and female provincial prison inmates who had injected 
drugs were found to be 8 percent and 13 percent respectively (Hankins et al., 1991, 1994).<P>
There is an urgent need to prevent the increase of HIV infection rates among drug users, their sexual 
partners and unborn children.  Preventive measures aimed at these groups should be a priority in all areas of 
the country.  Implementation of prevention programs with injection drug users is, however, extremely 
difficult.  Marginalized by the laws and attitudes of our society, injection drug users are often hard to reach 
both literally and figuratively.  Many tend to distrust services because of a history of unpleasant 
experiences with authority.  Many rank prevention of AIDS a low priority in their day to day struggle to find 
food, drugs, shelter and escape from abuse.  In order to reach these individuals, programs must be sensitive, 
non-judgmental, multifaceted, and innovative in nature.  Data from Canada and a number of other countries 
show that drug users can and do try to protect themselves and others from HIV infection.  Studies of cities 
with syringe exchanges and other harm reduction programs show the spread of HIV among injection drug 
users can be slowed and even halted.<P>
In many cases, however, our current preventive measures are inadequate for the purposes of significantly 
reducing the spread of HIV among drug users on a long term basis.  It is important to mobilize drug users, 
their partners and those who work with them to encourage them to adopt harm reduction practices such as 
the use of clean needles and condoms.  People practice risky behaviours for complex reasons related to 
attitudes, pressures and barriers.  It is only through training, research and cooperation that we will be able to 
deal adequately and humanely with this complex and compelling problem.<P>
In 1988, the World Health Organization designated drug users as a target group for measures to be adopted 
to prevent the spread of AIDS.  In the same year, the National Advisory Council on AIDS (NAC-AIDS) 
established a Working Group on HIV Infection and Injection Drug Use with members appointed from the 
field of drug treatment, epidemiology, and public health.  The mandate of the group was to assess the level 
of HIV infection among Canadian injection drug users, to identify issues, and to make recommendations 
about the development of national strategies to reduce the transmission of HIV associated with injection 
drug use in Canada.<P>
Because of the concern regarding the spread of HIV in Canada, the NAC-AIDS Working Group 
recommended, in early 1989, that a national workshop be held on this topic.  Sponsored jointly by the 
Federal Centre for AIDS, Health and Welfare Canada, NAC-AIDS and the Canadian Public Health 
Association AIDS Education and Awareness Program, this workshop provided the first opportunity in 
Canada for those working in the AIDS and injection drug use fields to exchange information and experiences 
from various communities across the country.  More than 120 participants from many disciplines and 
affiliations and many areas of Canada attended this meeting.  A report on the proceedings of the first 
workshop is available from the National AIDS Clearinghouse at the Canadian Public Health Association, 
Ottawa.<P>
One of the outcomes of the NAC-AIDS Working Group on HIV Infection and Injection Drug Use was a 
document entitled <I>Principles and Recommendations on HIV Infection and Injection Drug Use</I>, 
which was released as a discussion paper for use at this workshop.  The purpose of the <I>Principles and 
Recommendations</I> document was "to stimulate discussion, to challenge our perceptions, and to 
motivate all of us to examine policies and practices in agencies, departments, municipalities, hospitals, 
correctional services, and educational systems which may be contributing to the spread of HIV infection, 
affecting the quality of care, or which may be discriminatory" (1993, page 3).  This document, included in 
these proceedings, served as background materials for the Second National Workshop, and was the 
foundation on which workshop discussions and recommendations were based.  Participants were 
encouraged to read the document in preparation for the meeting and to consider ways in which strategies 
and programs could build upon its recommendations.  Participants were also asked to consider additions 
and/or modifications to the <I>Principles and Recommendations</I> document in light of their own 
experiences and recent trends.  The recommendations that came out of this process are included in the 
current proceedings.<P>
In the years that followed the first workshop the nature of the HIV epidemic in drug users changed in nature 
as did our understanding of it.  On the one hand it became clear that, while harm reduction efforts were 
working, more intensive, multifaceted approaches to the problem were needed.  On the other hand, it also 
became apparent that the focus of the epidemic was no longer injection drug users alone.  Other drug users, 
including users of alcohol, were clearly at risk because of the association between drug use and the practice 
of risky sexual and drug injection practices.  Because of the need to both update and broaden prevention 
efforts in Canada, it was decided in 1993 that another national workshop was called for.<P>
The Second National Workshop on HIV, Alcohol and Other Drug Use took place in Edmonton, Alberta in 
February of 1994.  The workshop was co-hosted by Health Canada, the Canadian Centre on Substance 
Abuse, the Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission and the Alberta Health AIDS Program.  The 
overall goal of the workshop was to contribute to the prevention of HIV infection and its consequences by 
highlighting new information and strategies to reduce HIV transmission associated with the use of alcohol 
and other drugs (both licit and illicit).  Session themes included effective prevention strategies and 
suggested new models and partnerships for outreach, care and intervention.<P>
The specific objectives of the workshop were:<P>
<OL>
<LI>To review relevant research, policy and program developments.
<LI>To raise the profile of selected issues through special sessions on, for example, risk environments and 
target populations.
<LI>To work towards agreement on effective strategies, and promote partnerships for action on harm 
reduction objectives.
</OL>
As was the case with the first meeting, participants of the workshop represented a number of disciplines and 
affiliations including community groups, public health agencies, treatment centres, governments, clinics, 
and other non-governmental organizations in the health field.  The population of a province/territory was 
also a criterion for determining the number of persons representing that area.  Every effort was made to 
ensure representation from smaller and remote communities so that information was shared as widely as 
possible around Canada.<P>
Speakers at the workshop were from a wide variety of disciplines, services and community groups.  They 
included street workers, counselors, administrators, police officers, lawyers, policy analysts and public 
health professionals.  Their expertise provided participants with valuable information and strategies for 
reaching drug users and helping individuals, families and communities to prevent the spread of HIV.<P>
The Second National Workshop on HIV Infection, Alcohol and Other Drug Use, like the first, provided an 
opportunity for individuals working in the area to share their experiences with colleagues from across 
Canada.  The workshop provided a vital step towards improved prevention methods by facilitating the 
exchange of information and skills regarding the reduction of drug-related harm in Canada.  It was apparent 
to all in attendance that the ongoing threat of HIV leaves no room for complacency.  An increased and 
sustained emphasis on preventive interventions which focus on reducing the harms associated with drug 
use is essential if we are to contain the spread of HIV.<P>

<H2>Introduction and background</H2>
This Highlights report summarizes key findings of a comprehensive study of the health, 
social and economic costs associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs in 
Canada. The impact of substance abuse on society is an issue of vital importance, yet very 
little information exists that links this impact to familiar economic indicators such as Gross 
Domestic Product. Estimates of the costs associated with illicit drugs in particular are 
plagued by methodological difficulties that result in wide discrepancies, not only in 
Canada, but in many other countries as well. <P>
In May, 1994, the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA) organized an 
International Symposium on the Economic and Social Costs of Substance Abuse. The 
meeting, in Banff, Alberta, brought together economists, addictions specialists and policy 
makers from eight countries, as well as representatives of international addictions 
agencies. The goal of this unprecedented gathering was to reach consensus on 
international guidelines for the conducting of economic cost studies. The set of guidelines 
that emerged reflected a remarkable degree of agreement on ways to resolve the many 
difficult methodological issues involved in cost estimation.<P>
In October, 1995, a second Symposium was held in Montebello, Québec to review the 
results of some initial attempts to apply the guidelines to actual cost studies. Adjustments 
were made to the guidelines and the group moved on to discuss ways of promoting the 
concept of economic cost studies to a broader international community. Participants also 
examined the utility of cost estimates in informing policy and program development.<P>
<H3>A Canadian cost study</H3>
<H4><I>The development of reliable cost estimation guidelines has 
paved the way for the first comprehensive study of the costs of substance 
abuse in Canada.</I></H4>
To our knowledge, there has been no attempt to estimate the total costs associated with 
the use and abuse of all psychoactive substances in Canada. Various studies have looked 
at individual costs associated with alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs using different 
methodologies and relying to varying degrees on assumptions of uncertain validity and 
reliability. The results often vary widely. Under these circumstances, policy makers and the 
public can hardly be blamed if they view cost estimates on substance abuse with 
skepticism.<P>
The development of reliable cost estimation guidelines has paved the way for the first 
comprehensive study of the costs of substance abuse in Canada. As well as taking 
advantage of the experience and expertise of researchers in other countries, this project 
involves the participation of provincial agencies which are conducting economic cost 
studies within their jurisdictions. This partnership is intended to foster interprovincial 
comparability of results and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. The study has been 
carried out by a team of people broadly representing the areas of addiction studies, health 
economics, epidemiology, criminology, social policy and law enforcement. These experts 
worked under the guidance of a steering committee composed of representatives of 
government, addiction agencies, private industry and academia.<P>
The study began by examining the research literature on estimating alcohol, tobacco and 
drug costs.  Using the Cost of Illness (COI) approach, a detailed list of costs to be 
included was drawn up and existing data systems were inventoried for relevant 
information. In addition to estimating the economic costs of substance abuse nationally, 
the study attempts to develop cost estimates for each province. Where data cannot be 
captured provincially, the study apportions national costs in a reasonable manner.<P>
<H3>Scope of the study</H3>
<H4><I>The figure of $18.45 billion, or 2.7% of GDP, represents the 
most optimistic estimate of this cost.  The actual number could be 
significantly higher.</I></H4>
The reader is cautioned that <I>The Costs of Substance Abuse in Canada</I> is NOT a 
study of the budgetary impact of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs on governments. The 
costs included in this study relate to the whole of society and not just to government 
accounts. This kind of study is useful in conducting an accounting of the budgetary impact 
of psychoactive substances, as it provides estimates for many of the expenditures that 
government must make. However, government costs do not include all of the costs 
imposed on the community. Furthermore, the notion of budget impact includes 
consideration of government revenues and other benefits, which are not be part of this 
study. <P>
Although this study provides a wealth of new and useful cost information, it should not be 
confused with a cost-benefit analysis of measures taken to reduce the harm associated with 
substance abuse. It takes a giant step toward making such an analysis possible, but much 
more work is required to set the stage. Having reliably established the costs associated 
with substance abuse, we now must calculate what portion of those costs is reasonably 
avoidable. The next step is to determine where we should invest to avoid those costs. 
Finally, we need to monitor the return on that investment. Only then can we determine 
whether the cost of substance abuse policies and programs is justified by the benefits they 
produce. This is the kind of information decision makers need to determine how to invest 
scarce resources. In the months and years to come, CCSA will be seeking broad support 
from the community for continued effort toward making this information readily 
available.<P>
The authors of this study have taken a decidedly conservative approach to estimating the 
costs of substance abuse. Where data are incomplete or alternative sources yield different 
figures, lower estimates are generally used. Furthermore, data are completely lacking for 
some cost components, such as, for example, property crime related to illicit drugs. 
Therefore, the figure of $18.45 billion, or 2.7% of GDP, given as the total cost of 
substance abuse in Canada, represents the most optimistic estimate of this cost. The actual 
number is probably higher and could be significantly higher.<P>
<H2>Definition of costs</H2>
Costs in this study are defined according to the concept of alternative uses for scarce 
resources, or opportunity costs. With certain exceptions, the major direct costs are the 
tangible, external costs of substance abuse; that is, those costs borne by persons other than 
the abuser, including the abuser's family. Although certain minor internal costs are 
included in Cost of Illness studies (such as the private costs of drugs for treatment, or the 
costs of property damage due to alcohol-related traffic accidents), the major direct costs 
considered are external in the Canadian context. The costs of purchasing alcohol, tobacco 
and illicit drugs to the users are not included. Nor are transfer payments, such as welfare 
benefits to people disabled by substance abuse (although administrative costs are 
included).<P>
<H3>Focus on gross rather than net costs</H3>
As this is not a cost-benefit study, we generally refer to gross rather than net costs of 
substance abuse. The use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs involves benefits as well as 
costs. In some instances, the use of a particular psychoactive substance will result in both 
an increase as well as a decrease in the incidence of an adverse consequence. Thus, for 
example, the use of alcohol is associated with decreased levels of coronary heart disease at 
low consumption levels.<I> Indeed, the net number of deaths from coronary heart 
disease attributable to alcohol is negative; that is, more deaths are prevented than 
caused by alcohol.</I> However, this is small comfort to the families of those who die as 
a result of their misuse of alcohol.<P>
For causes of disease and death where a psychoactive substance is associated with both 
beneficial and adverse effects, we do not subtract the number of cases prevented by 
alcohol use from the total number attributed to alcohol. Instead, we present the gross 
figures in the cost tabulations. This is done to avoid contaminating estimates of the costs 
of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs with <I>partial</I> consideration of benefits. The 
question is, when you start looking at benefits, where do you stop? For causes of disease 
where the use of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs has both beneficial and adverse effects, 
the study presents the <I>number of cases</I> prevented by the use of a particular 
substance so that comparisons may be made to the results of studies which report net 
rather than gross costs (for example, Collins and Lapsley, 1991).<P>
<H4><I>The economic cost estimates in this study do not necessarily 
indicate the amount of money and life years which could realistically be 
saved as a result of effective government and social policy and 
programming.</I></H4>
<H3>Intangible costs</H3>
Intangible costs are viewed as very significant even if they cannot be estimated in dollar 
terms. The major intangible costs of substance use are caused by death, pain, suffering and 
bereavement. While the study does not include a dollar value on the intangible aspects of 
life-years lost due to substance abuse, it does estimate the numbers of life-years lost for 
each major type of substance. This will permit the estimate of these costs in dollar terms, 
using the "willingness to pay" method of valuation.<P>
<H3>Welfare costs</H3>
In dealing with the welfare costs attributable to drug abuse, care is taken to distinguish 
between the real resource costs of abuse (administrative costs for substance abuse-related 
welfare cases) and costs which are simply transfer payments. The welfare costs involved 
relate to the payments borne by the state (such as invalid pensions and sickness benefits). 
It is particularly important to ensure that there is no double counting of costs or benefits. 
If a person previously in the workforce receives welfare benefits as a result of abuse-
related sickness, it would be double counting to also include in the estimate of external 
costs the productivity loss. Thus, the only welfare costs included in this study are 
administrative costs.<P>
<H3>Non-workforce death and illness</H3>
This study assumes that people of working age not in the workforce (that is, employed or 
seeking employment) are providing non-market services to the rest of the community. This 
implies that the sickness or death of such people will involve withdrawal of others from 
the workforce to maintain the supply of non-market services.  For example, the death of a 
non-working mother of school-age children means those children must be looked after by 
someone else, who in turn becomes unavailable for employment. The productive value lost 
due to the death or illness of working-age people not in the workforce is estimated from 
Statistics Canada figures for the value of houseworkers of similar age and gender.<P>
<H3>Research, education and law enforcement costs</H3>
Some costs which are clearly attributable to substance use result from public decisions to 
reduce abuse rather than from the direct effects of substance use.  Costs in this category 
include research expenditures, public education campaigns, and law enforcement 
programs. These costs are discretionary in the sense that governments could choose not to 
incur them. Presumably such reduced expenditures would lead to higher direct costs of 
substance use, but these expenditures are not themselves direct costs. In this study, these 
costs are included, but categorized as "policy costs".  In this way, costs are identified as 
being incurred in relation to substance use, but are not classified as unavoidable costs of 
use.<P>
<H3>Estimation of avoidable costs</H3>
The economic cost estimates in this study do not necessarily indicate the amount of money 
and life years which could realistically be saved as a result of effective government and 
social policy and programming. The alternative scenario in this study is one in which there 
are no problems associated with the use of psychoactive substances. This situation is 
hypothetical and generally not attainable under any circumstances. The estimated costs 
include both avoidable and unavoidable costs. Even if completely effective policies could 
be found with no appreciable costs for enforcement, treatment and prevention 
programming, implementation would not be instantaneous and there would still be 
lingering adverse consequences from past use of psychoactive substances.<P>
<H2>Death and illness<BR>
associated with substance abuse</H2>
<H3>Alcohol</H3>
It is estimated that 6,701 Canadians lost their lives as a result of alcohol consumption in 
1992. The largest number of alcohol-related deaths stem from impaired driving accidents. 
It is estimated that 1,021 Canadian men and 456 women died in motor vehicle accidents as 
the result of drinking. Alcoholic liver cirrhosis accounted for 960 deaths and there were 
908 alcohol-related suicides. Many of these deaths involved relatively young persons. Due 
to the high incidence of alcohol-related accidental deaths and suicides, the number of 
potential years of life lost is relatively high at 186,257 (134,495 years for men and 51,762 
for women). This represents 27.8 years for each alcohol-related death. Motor vehicle 
deaths represent 22% of all alcohol-related deaths and 33% of potential years of life lost—
an indication of the relatively young age of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. <P>
With regard to alcohol-related morbidity (illness), it is estimated that there were 86,076 
hospitalizations in 1992 (56,474 men and 29,602 women). These people spent a total of 
1,149,106 days in hospital (755,205 for men and 393,902 for women). The greatest 
number of alcohol-related hospitalizations resulted from accidental falls (16,901), alcohol 
dependence syndrome (14,316) and motor vehicle accidents (11,154). The greatest 
number of hospital days were for accidental falls (308,224 days). Thus, accidental falls 
accounted for 6% of deaths, 20% of hospitalizations and 27% of days spent in hospital as 
a result of alcohol. In contrast, motor vehicle accidents associated with alcohol accounted 
for 22% of deaths, but only 13% of hospitalizations and 12% of days in hospital.<P>
<H3>Tobacco</H3>
The total number of tobacco-related deaths in Canada is estimated to be 33,498<I> </I>in 
1992. The largest number of tobacco-related deaths (11,704) stem from lung cancer, 
representing 35% of all such deaths. Tobacco-related ischaemic heart disease accounts for 
6,762 deaths and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<I> </I>accounts for 
5,816 deaths. More than two-thirds (69%) of those who die from tobacco-related causes 
in Canada are men. <P>
There were 208,095 hospitalizations as a result of tobacco use in Canada in 1992. The 
largest number was for ischaemic heart disease (37,648 hospitalizations for men and 
14,363 for women). There were more than three million hospital days (3,024,265) 
resulting from tobacco-related causes. The largest contributors to the number of tobacco-
related hospital days were COPD (630,282 days or 21% of the total due to tobacco), 
stroke (570,289 days or 19%), ischaemic heart disease (450,795 days or 15%) and lung 
cancer (423,239 days or 14%). <P>
<H3>Illicit drugs</H3>
<H4><I>Mortality resulting from illicit drug use may be relatively 
infrequent compared with alcohol and tobacco-related deaths, but illicit 
drug death tends to involve younger victims.</I></H4>
The total number of illicit drug-related deaths in Canada is estimated to be 732 in 1992. 
The vast majority (88%) of these deaths involve males. Suicide accounts for 42% of illicit 
drug-related deaths, while opiate poisoning and cocaine poisoning account for 14% and 
9%, respectively. AIDS acquired through the use of illicit drugs accounts for 61 deaths 
(8% of all illicit drug-related deaths). Mortality resulting from illicit drug use may be 
relatively infrequent compared with alcohol and tobacco-related deaths, but illicit drug 
death tends to involve younger victims. The 732 illicit drug-related deaths resulted in 
31,147 potential years of life lost, or 42.6 years for each death.<P>
There were 7,095 hospitalizations and 58,571 days spent in hospital as a result of illicit 
drug use in 1992. Drug psychosis (1,207 or 17%), assaults (1,184 or 17%) and cocaine 
dependence (1,151 or 16%) account for about one-half of all illicit drug-related 
hospitalizations. The greatest proportion of hospital days due to illicit drugs is for drug 
psychosis (13,183 days or 22%), cocaine dependence (9,044 days or 15%) and drug-
related assault (8,508 days or 14%).<P>
<H2>Overview <BR>
of the economic costs of substance abuse</H2>
It is estimated that substance abuse cost more than $18.45 billion in Canada in 1992. This 
represents $649 per capita, or about 2.67% of the total Gross Domestic Product. <P>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol accounts for more than $7.5 billion in costs, or $265 per capita. This 
represents 40.8% of the total costs of substance abuse. The largest economic costs of 
alcohol are $4.1 billion for lost productivity due to illness and premature death, $1.36 
billion for law enforcement  and $1.3 billion in direct health care costs. 
<LI>Tobacco accounts for $9.56 billion in costs, or $336 per capita. This is more than 
half (51.8%) of the total substance abuse costs. Lost productivity due to illness and 
premature death accounts for more than $6.8 billion of these costs and direct health care 
costs due to smoking account for $2.67 billion in costs.
<LI>The economic costs of illicit drugs are estimated at $1.37 billion, or $48 per capita. 
The largest cost (approximately $823 million) is lost productivity due to illness and 
premature death, and a substantial portion of the costs ($400 million) are for law 
enforcement. Direct health care costs due to illicit drugs are estimated at $88 million.

<H2>Discussion of national results</H2>
<H3>Comparisons with other studies</H3>
<H4><I>There is now a significant body of epidemiological research 
and information on relative risk that was not available for earlier 
Canadian studies.</I></H4>
The estimated costs of alcohol in this study ($7.5 billion) are similar to most other studies 
as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (1.1%), but are somewhat lower than a 
previous Canadian study by Adrian et al. (1988) which found the costs of alcohol to be 
$11.8 billion (2.7% of GDP) in 1984. There are several possible reasons for this 
difference. As noted earlier, this investigation is based on a conservative operating 
principle and includes only those costs which can be reliably linked to the use of 
psychoactive substances. Where alternative sources of data disagree, the lowest figures are 
generally used. In addition, there are differences in methodology. Unlike the previous 
study, this report uses a cost-of-illness approach.<P>
Perhaps most importantly, there is now a significant body of epidemiological research and 
information on relative risk that was not available for earlier Canadian studies. These new 
data permit us to estimate mortality with much greater precision than was previously 
possible. For example, previous Canadian studies assumed that 10% of all cancer deaths 
were due to alcohol; this study takes specific diagnosis, age and gender into account and 
finds that only 2.1% of cancer mortality is due to alcohol.<P>
Similarly, this study arrives at a lower estimation of tobacco-related mortality than some 
previous research. For example, the estimated number of tobacco deaths is approximately 
25% lower than the 41,400 deaths due to tobacco for 1991 estimated by Makomaski-Illing 
and Kaiserman (1995). Some of the discrepancy results from the use of different risk 
ratios for lung cancer in male smokers. The previous study used a risk ratio of 22 based on 
one of the largest studies available (US Department of Health and Human Services, 1989). 
The risk ratio of 13 for male lung cancer used in this study was derived by pooling 
estimates from 10 studies <I>in addition to</I> the study cited by Makomaski-Illing and 
Kaiserman.<P>
This study presents costs of illicit drugs that are similar to other studies as a percentage of 
Gross Domestic Product (0.2%), with two notable exceptions. First, US studies (for 
example, Rice et al., 1990) have generally found illicit drug costs to be considerably 
higher, probably because these costs are, in fact, higher in the US where illicit drug use is 
much more prevalent. Second, the results of this study are considerably lower than in the 
only previous national estimate of drug-related costs. As with the alcohol estimates, it is 
likely these discrepancies stem from methodological differences and from more precise 
calculations based on new epidemiological data.<P>
<H3>"Policy" costs</H3>
Policy costs are those which are incurred as a conscious decision by policy makers, as 
opposed to those costs imposed on the treatment system and on industry as a result of 
substance-related illness and death. Policy costs include virtually all of the costs for 
prevention, research and law enforcement. It is estimated that these costs are 
approximately $1.5 billion for alcohol (20% of the total economic costs due to alcohol) 
and $442 million for illicit drugs (32% of the total costs). By contrast, policy costs in 1992 
were negligible for tobacco, representing less than 1% of the total economic costs due to 
tobacco. This means that policy costs—including law enforcement, prevention and 
research—were lowest for the substance which inflicts the greatest cost on society.<P>
<H3>"Avoidable" costs</H3>
<H4><I>Since treatment, law enforcement and productivity costs 
constitute the bulk of the costs associated with alcohol, it is reasonable to 
conclude that the majority of alcohol-related costs could be 
avoided.</I></H4>
Avoidable costs are those which would not have been incurred if there had been no 
problems associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs in Canada in 1992 (the 
counterfactual scenario). As noted earlier, even if there had been a sudden end to 
substance abuse problems in that year, there would still have been costs due to the 
cumulative and/or lagged impact of prior substance abuse, in addition to persistent policy 
costs. There are insufficient data to make a precise and detailed calculation of avoidable 
costs, but several observations can be made. <P>
With regard to alcohol, it would appear that most of the economic costs are avoidable. 
Approximately half of deaths and hospitalizations result from acute causes such as motor 
vehicle and other accidents, alcohol toxicity, suicide, and assault. Most of these deaths 
involve relatively young people, so that the number of potential years of life lost and 
productivity losses due to premature death are disproportionately high. As well, some of 
the deaths and hospitalizations due to alcohol-related chronic conditions would have been 
avoided if alcohol misuse had ceased. This means that most of the treatment costs and lost 
productivity due to premature death are avoidable. Most of the law enforcement costs 
related to alcohol use are also avoidable. Since treatment, law enforcement and pro-
ductivity costs constitute the bulk of the costs associated with alcohol, it is reasonable to 
conclude that the majority of alcohol-related costs could be avoided. <P>
Although a substantial portion of the costs associated with tobacco use are avoidable, ex-
smokers still have a considerably elevated risk for several disorders, most notably lung 
cancer, compared with people who never smoked.  This means that if every Canadian 
smoker were to suddenly quit smoking, levels of lung cancer and other tobacco-related 
disorders would decrease substantially, but a considerable portion of tobacco-related death 
and illness would persist.<P>
Illicit drug costs, on the other hand, are largely avoidable. The vast majority of illicit drug-
related deaths are due to suicide, poisoning and assault. The relatively small proportion of 
mortality due to drug-related AIDS (less than 10% of total illicit drug deaths) would 
persist, but most illicit drug mortality would cease if the misuse of illicit drugs ended. It is 
not clear if law enforcement costs would diminish significantly if there were no illicit drug 
misuse because the law is directed at all use, not just use which leads to a net social cost. 
Nonetheless, the majority of costs associated with illicit drug use are the productivity 
losses due to premature death, so we conclude that most illicit drug costs could be 
avoided.<P>
<H3>Sensitivity analyses</H3>
The results of cost studies can vary according to the methods used to estimate cost 
components. Sensitivity analyses are done to examine the extent to which the use of a 
particular method changes the findings. This study looked at three methodological 
considerations:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The weighting of hospitalization costs according to diagnosis
<LI>The use of alternative discount rates to estimate lost productivity
<LI>The use of alternative ways to measure prevalence of abuse.
</UL>
<H4>Hospitalization costs</H4>
Previous studies have generally estimated hospitalization costs using a mean daily rate for 
time spent in hospital. This ignores the fact that some disorders involve higher (or lower) 
costs. For example, the daily hospital cost for treating an AIDS patient is reported to be 
considerably higher than for other patients.  At issue is whether the use of a mean daily 
cost biases the results in one direction or the other, leading to estimates that are too high 
or too low. A special analysis was conducted for this study in which hospitalization costs 
were calculated according to "Resource Intensity Weights" (RIWs) developed by the 
Canadian Institute on Health Information. This analysis showed that hospitalization costs 
do vary according to diagnosis, but not considerably. There are undoubtedly many 
substance-related conditions which involve above-average costs, but by the same token, 
there are also many which are below the overall average. The sensitivity analysis 
confirmed that the use of mean daily costs is a reasonable approximation of hospitalization 
costs.<P>
<H4>Alternative discount rates</H4>
Estimates of the value of lost productivity due to premature death are strongly influenced 
by the way we compute the present value of future earnings (the discount rate). The 
higher the discount rate chosen, the lower the present value of lifetime earnings. In this 
study, the estimated productivity losses due to premature death are presented using 
discount rates of  4%, 5%, 6% and 10%. The costs reported are based on a 6% discount 
rate. Assuming a 1% annual increase in productivity, this represents an effective discount 
rate of 5%.<P>
The total estimated value of lifetime earnings of people who die prematurely from 
substance-related conditions ranges from $7.17 billion using a discount rate of 10% to 
$12.35 billion using a discount rate of 4%. The estimated productivity losses due to 
alcohol are $1.82 billion with a 10% discount rate and $3.57 billion with a 4% discount 
rate. The range for tobacco is from $5.0 billion to $8.06 billion, and the range for illicit 
drug productivity costs is from $354 million  to $724 million. The choice of discount rate 
has a considerable impact on estimated productivity losses, and consequently on the total 
estimated costs of substance abuse. <P>
<H4>Alternative measures</H4>
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of three different measures of 
alcohol consumption: quantity-frequency (QF), graduated frequency (GF), and weekly 
drinking (WD). QF measures average consumption based on questions about the 
frequency of drinking occasions and the usual or average number of drinks on each 
occasion. A QF survey requires only two questions, but in giving averaged responses, 
survey subjects tend to disregard heavy (and harmful) drinking events.<P>
The GF measure starts with a question about the highest number of drinks on any 
occasion during the past year. It then asks a series of questions to determine how often the 
respondent consumed specific amounts, starting with the highest quantity and gradually 
working down to one or two drinks.<P>
WD patterns are usually measured by asking the number of drinks an individual had eight 
days before the survey, and then continuing with each day of the week until the day before 
the survey. Using this measure tends to over-represent abstainers.<P>
These consumption measures yield different estimates of the economic costs of alcohol. 
Hospitalization days, drug costs, physicians' fees and productivity losses due to illness or 
premature death are all highest using the GF measure and lowest using the WD measure, 
with estimates falling in between when using the QF measure. The total estimated costs of 
alcohol misuse is $7.734 billion using the GF measure, $7.522 billion using the QF 
measure, and $7.225 billion using the WD measure.<P>
The sensitivity analysis indicated that the method of measuring alcohol consumption has a 
major influence on prevalence estimates for hazardous and harmful drinking. The influence 
on mortality and other derived measures is less dramatic. Since almost all epidemiological 
studies use QF measures to assess alcohol use, it was decided to base cost estimates in this 
study on QF measures. We believe the GF measure reflects real drinking patterns more 
accurately, but the use of GF figures would have biased the results since our attributable 
fractions (the degree to which alcohol is responsible for a given condition) are based on 
epidemiological studies.  We hope that future epidemiological studies will use 
methodologies that yield a more accurate picture of consumption patterns and their 
influence on harm and costs.<P>
<H3>Range of estimated costs</H3>
The results of the sensitivity analyses indicate the following ranges of estimated economic 
costs of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. For alcohol, the highest estimate would involve 
not using Resource Intensity Weights, discounting future income at 4% and using a 
graduated frequency measure for alcohol prevalence. The lowest estimate would result 
from using Resource Intensity Weights, discounting future income at 10% and using a 
weekly drinking measure for alcohol prevalence. Under these extreme assumptions, the 
estimated costs of alcohol range from $6.3 billion to $8.6 billion. This compares with our 
"best" estimate of $ 7.5 billion.<P>
For tobacco, the highest estimate would involve using Resource Intensity Weights and 
discounting future income at 4%. The lowest estimate would result from not using 
Resource Intensity Weights and discounting future income at 10%. Under these extreme 
assumptions, the estimated costs of tobacco range from $7.8 billion to $11.1 billion. Our 
estimate of $ 9.6 billion lies between these estimates. <P>
For illicit drugs, the highest estimate would involve using Resource Intensity Weights and 
discounting future income at 4%, while the lowest estimate would result from not using 
Resource Intensity Weights and discounting future income at 10%. Under these extreme 
assumptions, the estimated costs of illicit drugs range from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Our 
estimate of $1.37 billion falls near the middle of these two estimates.  <P>

<H2>Provincial estimates</H2>
The economic costs of substance abuse have also been estimated for each of the 10 
Canadian provinces. The estimates of death and illness due to alcohol, tobacco and drugs 
are based on provincial data regarding prevalence of use and the number of deaths and 
hospitalizations. Where available, province-specific data on the various cost components 
have been used. Where not available, national per capita averages are used. <P>
<H3>Differences in mortality and morbidity</H3>
<H4><I>Somewhat surprisingly, illicit drug mortality in Ontario is 
close to the national average despite the concentration of drug users in 
Metropolitan Toronto.</I></H4>
The overall rate of mortality due to substance abuse is highest in Prince Edward Island 
(180 deaths per 100,000 population) and in Nova Scotia (180 per 100,000) and lowest in 
Alberta (117 per 100,000 population) and Newfoundland (128 per 100,000).  These 
provincial differences in overall substance-related mortality are largely due to tobacco-
related mortality, which is highest in Nova Scotia (154 deaths per 100,000) and Prince 
Edward Island (153 per 100,000). Alberta, on the other hand, has the lowest rate of 
mortality due to smoking (89 deaths per 100,000 population). Ontario (110 per 100,000), 
Newfoundland (112 per 100,000) and Saskatchewan (116 per 100,000) also have 
relatively low tobacco mortality rates, while Québec (132 per 100,000) and New 
Brunswick (131 per 100,000) are above the national average.<P>
Provincial differences in years of potential life lost and hospitalizations due to tobacco use 
reflect mortality patterns, with the highest per-capita rates in PEI and Nova Scotia and 
lowest in Alberta. However, the highest rates of hospital days due to tobacco-related 
illnesses are in New Brunswick (13,493 days per 100,000 population) and in Québec 
(13,225 per 100,000).<P>
The lowest mortality rate for alcohol-related disorders is in Newfoundland (15 deaths per 
100,000 population). Among the other provinces, there is relatively little provincial 
variation in alcohol-related mortality rates, which range from 23 per 100,000 population in 
Ontario, Québec and New Brunswick to 27 per 100,000 in British Columbia. 
Newfoundland and Ontario have the lowest rate of potential years of life lost, while 
Alberta has the highest. The fewest hospitalizations and hospital days for alcohol-related 
problems are in New Brunswick. Saskatchewan has the highest rate of hospitalizations for 
alcohol-related disorders while British Columbia has the most number of days per capita 
spent in hospital for alcohol-related problems.<P>
Illicit drug-related conditions contribute a great deal less than tobacco or alcohol to 
overall mortality. Death rates due to illicit drugs vary considerably from province to 
province. By far, the greatest number of deaths per capita occur in British Columbia (4.7 
per 100,000 population) and the lowest rate is in Newfoundland (1.0 per l00,000). Alberta 
(3.1) and Québec (2.8) have illicit drug mortality rates which are above the national 
average. There is relatively little variation among the other provinces, which range from 
1.5 in New Brunswick to 2.0 in Saskatchewan and Ontario. Somewhat surprisingly, illicit 
drug mortality in Ontario is close to the national average despite the concentration of drug 
users in metropolitan Toronto. Provincial differences in potential years of life lost, 
hospitalizations and hospital days generally follow mortality rates. However, 
Newfoundland has a relatively high rate of hospital days related to illicit drug use despite 
relatively low mortality and hospitalization rates. <P>
<H3>Differences in economic costs</H3>
The report shows that the per-capita costs of alcohol misuse are highest in Alberta ($285 
per capita). The lowest per-capita costs of alcohol are in Newfoundland ($199). Among 
the other provinces, per-capita alcohol costs range from $243 in Québec to $283 in Prince 
Edward Island.<P>
Nova Scotia incurs the highest costs related to tobacco ($398), followed by Prince 
Edward Island ($361), New Brunswick ($354) and Ontario ($346). The lowest per-capita 
costs attributed to tobacco are in Alberta ($277), Saskatchewan ($281) and 
Newfoundland ($294).<P>
The per-capita costs of illicit drugs range from $31 in Newfoundland to $60 in British 
Columbia. It is estimated that illicit drugs cost the British Columbia economy $207 million 
in 1992. Relatively high economic costs are also attributed to illicit drugs in Alberta ($135 
million or $51 per capita), Ontario ($507 million or $48 per capita), Québec ($333 million 
or $47 per capita) and Prince Edward Island ($4.7 million or $36 per capita).   <P>
The following table shows costs of substance abuse in the provinces in terms of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) and as a per-capita expense. Per-capita costs are highest in 
Nova Scotia ($699) and Prince Edward Island ($681) and lowest in Newfoundland 
($524). Relative to GDP, substance abuse costs the most in Prince Edward Island ($88.7 
million or 4.0% of GDP) and the least in Alberta ($1.6 billion or 2.2% of GDP). The costs 
of substance abuse in the other provinces range from 2.5% of GDP in Ontario to 3.6% in 
Nova Scotia.<P>

<H2>Summary and conclusions</H2>
<H3>A considerable toll</H3>
There were 40,930 deaths attributable to substance abuse in Canada in 1992. Tobacco 
accounted for 33,498 of these deaths, alcohol 6,701 and illicit drugs 732. This represents 
21% of total mortality for that year. Smoking-related deaths alone account for 17% of 
total mortality in 1992. Potential years of life lost due to substance abuse constitute 23% 
of the total years of life lost due to any cause–16% due to tobacco, 6% due to alcohol and 
1% due to illicit drug use. The number of hospitalizations due to substance abuse 
constitutes 8% of total hospitalizations and 10% of the total days spent in hospitals for any 
cause.<P><B>
</B>It is estimated that substance abuse cost $18.45 billion in Canada in 1992. This 
represents $649 per capita, or about 2.7% of the total Gross Domestic Product. Alcohol 
accounted for more than $7.5 billion in costs, representing $265 per capita. Tobacco 
accounted for more than $9.6 billion in costs, or $340 per capita. The economic costs of 
illicit drugs are estimated at $1.37 billion, or $48 per person.<P>
<H3>Better estimates</H3>
In this study, estimates of death and illness attributable to substance abuse are lower than 
in previous studies. This is largely due to the availability of much more precise information 
on the attributable fractions of specific disease categories (vs. broad categories), with age, 
gender and province all taken into account. With regard to tobacco, the lower estimation 
of illness and death is partly due to the use of pooled estimates from several studies rather 
than one study alone.<P>
<H3>Deaths averted</H3>
It was found that alcohol prevented 7,401 deaths in 1992, largely because of the beneficial 
impact of alcohol use on ischaemic heart disease and stroke. However, years of potential 
life lost due to alcohol (186,257) are much greater than years of potential life saved by its 
beneficial effects (88,656). Furthermore, the number of hospitalizations caused by alcohol 
(86,076) far outnumbers the number prevented by alcohol use (45,414). <P>
<H3>Accidental death</H3>
Accidental death contributes a much greater share of overall alcohol-related morbidity and 
mortality than shown in previous studies. This is a result of chronic disease contributing a 
lower proportion of overall alcohol-related illness and death than in previous studies. For 
example, previous estimates attributed 10% of all cancer deaths to alcohol, but more 
detailed calculations indicate that only 2.1% of cancer mortality is due to alcohol.<P>
<H3>Avoidable costs</H3>
In 1992, policy costs—law enforcement, prevention and research—were lowest for 
tobacco, the psychoactive substance which inflicts the greatest cost on society. It is 
concluded that most of the economic costs associated with alcohol and illicit drugs are 
avoidable, but this is less true for tobacco.<P>
<H3>Costs vary</H3>
Finally, it is concluded that the costs of substance abuse vary considerably from province 
to province in Canada. <P>

<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Alcohol consumption continues to decline: 74.4% of Canadians report drinking in 1993 
compared to 79% in 1990, and the average Canadian age 15 or older consumed the equivalent 
of 7.97 litres of absolute alcohol per capita in 1991-92, representing a decrease of 4.3% from 
the previous year. Consumption is highest among young adults, males and those with relatively 
higher incomes.
<LI>In the 1993 General Social Survey, nearly one in 10 Canadians age 15 or older (9.2%) 
reported a problem with their drinking. The most commonly reported problems were 
deleterious effects on physical health (5.1%), and effects on financial position (4.7%). 
Furthermore, 43.9% of respondents reported that they had experienced some problem due to 
other people's drinking. The problems most commonly reported were being disturbed by loud 
parties or other behaviour (23.8%), being insulted or humiliated by someone who had been 
drinking (20.9%), and having a serious argument or quarrel as a result of someone's drinking 
(15.6%).
<LI>In 1990-91 there were 38,261 recorded alcohol-related hospital separations in Canadian 
mental and general hospitals for alcohol-related diagnoses. Despite the decline in overall alcohol 
consumption, alcohol-related mortality increased. There were 3,183 deaths directly attributable 
to alcohol and 15,980 deaths indirectly attributable to alcohol in 1991.
<LI>Impaired driving remains a major cause of death among young Canadians; among fatally 
injured drivers, 46% had some alcohol in their blood and 39% were over the legal limit of .08%

<H3>Consumption trends and patterns of drinking</H3>
OVERVIEW: Alcohol consumption continues to decline across Canada. Among respondents in 
the 1993 General Social Survey, the proportion of Canadians aged 15 years or older who 
reported drinking in the past year was 74.4%, compared to 79.0% in 1991. Per capita, 
Canadians consumed the equivalent of 7.97 litres of absolute alcohol in 1991, a decrease of 
4.4% from 1990.<P>
PERCENTAGE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO DRINK: The proportion of 
Canadians reporting that they are current drinkers in various national surveys was approximately 
80% in 1979, 81% in 1985, 78% in 1989,79% in 1991, and 74.4% in 1993 (Table 2.1). Of 
the 10,385 respondents in the 1993 General Social Survey, 74.4% reported that they were 
current drinkers, 18.0% were former drinkers and 7.7% have never drunk alcohol (Table 2.2). 
Men were more likely than women to be current drinkers (81% vs. 68%), and the proportion 
who reported drinking alcohol declined from 85% among those aged 20-24 to 43% among 
those 75 years of age or older (Table 2.2). The proportion of the population who report 
drinking is highest in Ontario (79%) and lowest in British Columbia (71%). Relatively high 
proportion of persons who report that they drink alcohol is also associated with high income, 
post-secondary educational level, employed persons, and those living in cities with populations 
between 500,000 and 1,000,000 (Table 2.3).<P>
SOURCES OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DATA: Data on alcohol consumption and 
drinking problems stem from a variety of sources. Sales reports from provincial monopoly 
boards provide a readily available estimate of alcohol consumption. These data are compiled 
and reported by Statistics Canada in an annual report on The Control and Sale of Alcoholic 
Beverages in Canada. However, sales data do not include unrecorded sources of consumption 
such as homemade wine and beer, assisted "homemade" alcohol in commercial "u-brew" 
establishments, illicit production, illegal importation, or legal importation of small amounts for 
personal use. Special studies are required to estimate the extent to which sales data reflect 
overall consumption. Such studies are generally lacking. The most recent examination was 
conducted in 1978 and was limited to Ontario (Single and Giesbrecht, 1979). This study 
estimated that sales data underestimated true consumption by 6% to 7%, mainly due to the large 
volume of homemade wine in Ontario at that time. Another source of error in estimates based 
on sales data is the use of conversion factors for the alcohol content of beer, wine and spirits 
which may not reflect current realities. Based on consultations with industry representatives, the 
conversion factors used in this report were updated in 1994 to more accurately reflect current 
national drinking patterns. The alcohol content of spirits in 1991 is estimated at 36.9% for 
spirits, 4.9% for beer and 11.7% for wine.<P>
Despite these potential sources of error, sales data still provide the best available estimate of 
total annual alcohol consumption. The most serious limitation of sales data is that they do not 
enable us to examine the individual characteristics of drinkers. General population surveys 
provide information on the number and sociodemographic characteristics of persons who 
abstain from alcohol and persons who drink. Survey data, however, generally underestimate 
alcohol consumption (Pernanen, 1974). For example, the number of drinks per week reported 
by drinkers in the most recent national survey, the General Social Survey of 1993, was 4.2 
(Table 2.8). This is less than one half the average number of drinks indicated by sales data (9.0 
drinks per capita per week in 1991-92, as shown in Table 2.7). There are several reasons for 
this discrepancy. The heaviest users of alcohol tend to be underrepresented in samples and 
those who are interviewed are more likely than light drinkers to underreport their consumption 
(Pernanen, 1974). Therefore, survey data are an important source of data on individual 
correlates of drinking and heavy consumption, but they are not used to estimate aggregate 
alcohol consumption.<P>
LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION: According to sales data, Canadians drank slightly more than 2 
billion litres of beer, 231 million litres of wine and 136 million litres of spirits in 1991-92 (Table 
2.4). This amounts to 7.97 litres of absolute alcohol per person aged 15 or older. Expressed in 
terms of the number of standard drinks per week, the average Canadian drank about nine 
drinks per week in 1991-92 (Table 2.7). <A HREF="/cpfig25.htm">Beer accounted for 56.4% of total alcohol 
consumption while spirits accounted for 28.4% and wine 15.2%</A> (Table 2.5).<P>
As indicated in <A HREF="/cpfig21.htm">Figure 2.1, overall consumption in 1991-92 was highest in the Yukon Territory 
(14.4 litres per person age 15 or older), the Northwest Territories (9.6 litres) and British 
Columbia (9.4 litres), and consumption was lowest in New Brunswick (6.2 litres), 
Saskatchewan (7.1 litres) and Québec (7.1 litres).</A> It is suspected that tourism is part of the 
reason for the exceptionally high alcohol sales in the Yukon. The proportion of total alcohol 
consumption accounted for by beer, wine and spirits also varies from province to province, with 
relatively high consumption of beer in Québec, wine in Québec and British Columbia, and spirits 
in the Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan.<P>
TRENDS IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION: The per adult sales figure of 8.0 litres of 
absolute alcohol for 1991-92 represents a decline of 4.3% from the previous year (Table 2.7). 
Indeed, as seen in Figure 2.2, there has been a steady decline in sales of alcoholic beverages 
from 10.9 litres per person age 15 or older in 1981-82 to 8.0 litres in 1991-92. There is no 
clear long-term trend regarding the amount of alcohol consumption accounted for by beer, wine 
and spirits. A trend toward an increase in the relative consumption of wine and a decrease in the 
relative consumption of beer in the 1950s and 1960s has not continued, and beer has even 
shown a slight increase in its share of total consumption in the past few years while spirits have 
decreased.<P>
CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH-VOLUME DRINKERS:  The portrait of the relatively high 
volume drinker is that of a well-to-do young male (Table 2.8). Men drink more than twice as 
much as women (5.9 drinks reported by men in the 1993 General Social Survey vs. 2.3 drinks 
reported by women) and drinking rates are particularly high among Canadians in their early 20s, 
and those who are single. Young adults, men and single persons are also the most likely to 
report consuming five or more drinks on an occasion. Income is positively related to self-
reported level of consumption. Education is positively related to drinking but negatively related 
to level of drinking: university graduates are more likely to drink, but they tend to drink less 
when they do. Persons looking for work report the highest levels of alcohol consumption. 
Students have relatively low levels of consumption, but they are the most likely to report 
consuming five or more drinks on an occasion (63%). There is no clear relationship between 
community size and level of drinking or number of heavy drinking occasions.<P>
The 1989 National Alcohol and Drug Survey contained detailed information on drinking venues. 
Respondents were asked how often they engaged in certain activities such as spending a quiet 
evening at home, going to a bar or tavern, visiting friends, etc., as well as how often and how 
much they drink when they engage in these activities. The answers to these questions have been 
combined to estimate the <A HREF="/cpfig23.htm">proportion of total alcohol consumption in different settings. As seen in 
Figure 2.3,</A> the highest proportion of drinking occurs in private settings, such as when spending a 
quiet evening at home (18%), going to a party or other social gathering (16%), having friends 
visit (16%) or visiting others (15%). Drinking in bars and taverns accounts for 12% of 
consumption and drinking in restaurants 13%. The remaining consumption is accounted for by 
drinking at outdoor activities (5%), when participating at a sporting activity (2%), when 
attending a club or organizational meeting (2%) and when attending a concert or sports event 
(1%). Settings are strongly related to characteristics of the drinkers and level of consumption 
(Table 2.10). In particular, drinking in bars and taverns is related to high levels of consumption 
and to drinking problems.<P>
<H3>Problems associated with alcohol use</H3>
SELF-REPORTED PROBLEMS: Respondents in the 1993 General Social Survey were asked 
whether, in the past 12 months, their drinking had had an adverse effect on their social life, 
physical health, happiness, home life or marriage, work, or finances. The proportion of current 
drinkers in each demographic category reporting any problems, the mean number of problems 
reported, and the proportion of respondents reporting each specific problem, are shown in 
Table 2.9. Overall, 9.2% of current drinkers reported experiencing at least one of these 
problems due to their consumption of alcohol. The most commonly reported problems were 
deleterious effects on physical health (5.1%), and effects on financial position (4.7%).<P>
With regard to the correlates of self-reported drinking problems, men are more likely to report 
a problem relating to their drinking (11.9% v. 6.2% of women), particularly problems relating to 
finances (6.7% for men v. 2.5% of women), work or school (2.0% v. 0.8%), home life and 
marriage (2.4% v. 1.1%) and physical health (6.7% v. 3.2%). The highest proportion reporting 
drinking problems is found among those between the ages of 15 and 24. The proportion 
reporting drinking problems declines consistently after the age of 19. Teenagers and young 
adults are particularly likely to report financial problems resulting from their drinking. Given the 
higher rates of drinking among those who are single or divorced, it is perhaps not surprising that 
these respondents are the most likely to report a problem with their drinking (16.9% and 
11.0%, respectively, compared to 5.9% of married respondents and 5.6% of the widowed). 
Canadians in the lowest income category are the most likely to report a problem with their 
drinking (17.9%, compared to 7.9% of those in the highest income category). Low income is 
related not only to financial problems but to other alcohol-related problems as well. There is no 
clear relationship between education and drinking problems.<P>
Students and those looking for work are the most likely to report a problem with their drinking 
(16.9%), particularly financial problems resulting from their drinking. The lowest rates of self-
reported drinking problems are among homemakers (4.7%), the retired (5.2%) and 
professionals (5.8%).Residents of the Atlantic provinces are the most likely to report a problem 
related to their drinking (13.0%) while Ontarians are the least likely to report a drinking problem 
(7.5%). Although community size is not related to level of drinking, respondents who live in rural 
areas are somewhat more likely to report a drinking problem (10.8%, compared to 8.1% 
among those living in cities of one million or more).<P>
PROBLEMS WITH OTHER PERSON S DRINKING: In the 1993 General Social Survey 
respondents were also asked whether they had ever suffered any of the following 10 negative 
consequences as a result of someone else's drinking:<P>
<UL>
<LI>they had been insulted by someone who had been drinking
<LI>they had an serious argument as a result of someone's drinking
<LI>they had a friendship broken due to another's drinking
<LI>they had marital or family problems as a result of someone else's drinking
<LI>they had been in a car driven by someone who had had too much to drink
<LI>they had been in an accident as a result of someone else's drinking
<LI>they had been a victim of vandalism resulting from another's drinking
<LI>they had been assaulted by someone who had been drinking
<LI>they had been annoyed by loud parties due to drinking, and/or
<LI>they had suffered financially due to another's drinking.
</UL>
The proportion of respondents reporting any problem, the mean number of problems reported, 
and the proportion reporting any of 10 individual problems, for those in different demographic 
categories, is shown in Table 2.10. Overall, 43.9% of respondents reported that they had 
experienced some problem due to other people's drinking. The problems most commonly 
reported were being disturbed by loud parties or other behaviour (23.8%), being insulted or 
humiliated by someone who had been drinking (20.9%), and having a serious argument or 
quarrel as a result of someone's drinking (15.6%).<P>
The likelihood of reporting a problem as the result of someone else's drinking is approximately 
the same for men (4S.5%) and women (42.5%). Men are somewhat more likely to report being 
involved in an impaired driving incident or an accident as a result of someone else's drinking, 
while women are more likely to report a family or marriage problem resulting from someone 
else's drinking. With regard to age, the proportion of respondents reporting problems with 
others' drinking increases from 43.4% in the 15-17 year age group to a high of 66.0% among 
those aged 20-24. The proportion reporting problems then declines after the age of 24 to a low 
of 12.4% in the 75 + age category. This age pattern generally applies to each of the 10 
problems resulting from others' drinking, although family and marriage problems tend to peak 
among those aged 25-34.<P>
Problems resulting from others' drinking are experienced by the majority of Canadians who are 
single or divorced (55.6% and 58.8%, respectively). Widowed people were least likely to have 
experienced problems from others' drinking (19.4%). This pattern was similar with respect to 
the specific problems, except that separated or divorced respondents were much more likely 
than others to report having experienced family or marriage problems (19.5%) or to have had 
friendships break up (13.9%) than other respondents.<P>
The probability of experiencing a problem due to others' drinking did not show a consistent 
relationship with income levels. However, lower income respondents reported a greater number 
of problems with others' drinking, and several individual problems (having an argument or 
quarrel as a result of someone's drinking; having friendships break up; family or marriage 
problems; being a passenger with a driver who had had too much to drink; being assaulted by a 
drinker; financial problems) were most likely to be reported by those in the lowest income 
categories, and the proportion of respondents reporting these problems generally declined as 
income level increased.<P>
Those with some post-secondary education were most likely to report having had problems as 
a result of someone else's drinking (55.1%). The lowest proportion of respondents reporting 
such problems was among those who have less than secondary education (35.1%). The 
problems which those who had some post-secondary education reported very much more often 
than other educational categories were: insults (28.4%), serious arguments or quarrels (23.2%); 
family &amp  marriage problems (11.9%); being a passenger with a driver who had had too 
much to drink (13.4%); and having been assaulted (9.5%). Having been disturbed by loud 
parties or other behaviour was most likely to be reported by those who had completed 
university (29.4%), and less likely to be reported by those with less than secondary education 
(16.8%).<P>
Semi-professional workers (53.7%), students (53.7%), those looking for work (52.0%) and 
unskilled workers (51.8%) are most likely to report problems with others' drinking. Those who 
are retired are least likely to report such problems (21.4%). This pattern is generally consistent 
across individual problems, except that homemakers are relatively likely to report family or 
marriage problems (11.3%), and respondents who are in any of the employed categories are 
more likely to be disturbed by loud parties than respondents not in the labour force.<P>
Residents of British Columbia (57.8%) are most likely to report a problem with others' drinking, 
while those in Québec (39.6%) are least likely to do so. However, residents of the Prairie 
provinces were the most likely to report being a passenger with someone who had had too 
much to drink (10.8%) and Québeckers are most likely to report financial problems due to 
another's drinking (2.9%). The incidence of problems arising from other persons' drinking is not 
related to community size in a clear fashion. Rural residents are somewhat less likely to report a 
problem with others' drinking, but they report slightly higher numbers of problems when they do 
experience difficulties.<P>
ALCOHOL-RELATED MORBIDITY: The estimated prevalence of alcoholism in Canada was 
490,700 or 1,800 per 100,000 population in 1990 (Table 2.11). It should be noted, however, 
that these estimates are calculated from the number of cirrhosis deaths using the Jellinek formula, 
which is based on somewhat dated estimates of the proportion of cirrhosis deaths attributable to 
alcoholism. Therefore, the reader is advised to view these prevalence estimates with caution: 
they are at best, crude estimates of the number of Canadians who are alcohol dependent.<P>
In 1990-91 there were 38,261 recorded alcohol-related hospital separations in Canadian 
mental and general hospitals (Table 2.12). Males accounted for 27,249 or 71.2% of these 
cases. For both males and females, the largest number of cases were between the ages of 45 
and 64; this age category accounted for 13,629 cases or 35.6% of total morbidity. The median 
age for persons treated in either a general or psychiatric hospital for an alcohol-related problem 
was 46.9 years. Alcohol dependence syndrome was the most common alcohol-related 
diagnosis, accounting for 17,080 or 44.6% of all alcohol-related cases.<P>
The overall rate of alcohol-related separations in general or psychiatric hospitals was 137.7 per 
100,000 population in 1990-91 (Table 2.13). The rate for men (197.7) was approximately 2.5 
times that of women (78.6). Rates were highest in the 45-64 and 65-74 age groups (256.2 and 
254.2, respectively). The largest number of alcohol-related hospital separations in 199091 
occurred in Ontario, which recorded 13,917 cases or 36.4% of the total (Table 2.14). This 
figure corresponds roughly to the Ontario share of the Canadian population. The highest rates of 
cases per 100,000 population were in Prince Edward Island (406.1) and in Saskatchewan 
(215.4), while the lowest were in Québec (109.2) and in New Brunswick (129.7).<P>
Psychiatric hospitals reported 8.8% of the total alcohol-related hospital separations (Table 
2.15). There was considerable variation between provinces in this regard. Psychiatric hospitals 
accounted for 22.4% of alcohol-related hospital separations in Nova Scotia and 17.2% in 
Newfoundland, while there were no alcohol-related separations from psychiatric hospitals 
recorded in New Brunswick and Manitoba. Overall, alcohol-related diagnoses accounted for 
11.0% of all psychiatric hospital separations in Canada.<P>
ALCOHOL-RELATED MORTALITY: There were 3,183 deaths directly attributable to 
alcohol in Canada in 1991, representing an increase of 7.6% from the previous year (Table 
2.16). Death from cirrhosis and other liver disease accounted for 2,200 deaths or 69.1% of the 
deaths directly attributable to alcohol. Alcohol-related mental disorders accounted for 647 
cases or 20.3% of deaths directly attributable to alcohol. Males accounted for 2,252 or 70.8% 
of these deaths. The rate of death directly attributable to alcohol per 100,000 population was 
11.6 for Canada in 1991 (Table 2.17). The rate was 16.6 for males vs. 6.7 for females, and it 
was highest in the older age groups. The highest rate of death per 100,000 population directly 
attributable to alcohol in 1991 was 44.7 in the Yukon Territory (Table 2.18).<P>
The estimated number of deaths indirectly attributable to alcohol in Canada in 1991 was 
15,980, an increase of 2.0% from 1990 (Table 2.19). This figure is based on a proportion of 
cases attributable to alcohol for the following causes of death: neoplasms, 10%; diseases of the 
circulatory system, 5%; diseases of the respiratory system, 15%; motor vehicle accidents, 45%; 
accidental falls, 40%; accidents due to fire, 30%; accidental drownings, 30%; suicides, 30%; 
and homicides, 60%. The reader is cautioned that these attribution factors are not always 
current or based on Canadian studies. Deaths indirectly attributable to alcohol included 5,475 
persons who died of neoplasms (or 34.3% of all deaths indirectly attributable to alcohol), 3,800 
deaths due to diseases of the circulatory system (23.8%), 2,520 deaths due to diseases of the 
respiratory system (15.8%), 1,695 deaths due to motor vehicle accidents (10.6%) and 820 
deaths due to accident falls (5.1%). The rate of death indirectly attributable to alcohol in 1991 
was 56.8 per 100,000 population, with the highest rates reported in Prince Edward Island 
(76.5), Saskatchewan (65.5), Nova Scotia (64.8), Manitoba (62.4) and British Columbia 
(61.3).<P>
ALCOHOL-RELATED ACCIDENTS: With the exception of motor vehicle injuries and 
fatalities, there are few national data on other types of alcohol-related trauma such boating 
accidents, fires and assaults. Although there has been considerable progress in reducing 
impaired driving, alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents are still a major health and social 
problem in Canada. Indeed, impaired driving is the major cause of death for young Canadians. 
As seen in Table 2.20, in 1991 46% of fatally injured drivers had some alcohol in their blood, 
39% were over the legal limit of .08% Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) and 30% were 
over .15% BAC. These figures represent an increase in the BAC levels of fatally injured drivers, 
after more than 10 years of decline. Impairment is particularly high among fatally injured drivers 
between the ages of 26 and 35 (Table 2.21).<P>
In the 1993 General Social Survey, approximately one in eight respondents age 15 or older 
(12.9%) reported driving after consuming two or more drinks in the past year (Table 2.22). 
Self-reported driving after drinking is particularly high among males, those between 18 and 45 
years of age, and those with high income (Table 2.22). Homemakers, the retired and 
professionals are the least likely to report driving after drinking. Québeckers are the most likely 
to report driving after drinking (19.4%, compared to 13.4% in the Prairies, 13.1% in British 
Columbia, 10.7% in the Atlantic provinces and 9.2% in Ontario), and rural residents are more 
likely to drive after drinking.<P>

<H3>Highlights </H3>
<UL>
<LI>From 1981 to 1991 tobacco sales in Canada steadily declined, dropping from 3,728 
cigarettes to 2,103 cigarettes per person age 15 and older. Overall there was a 37% drop in 
sales over this time. Although sales of tailor made cigarettes declined by about 42% over this 
time, fine-cut tobacco increased by 14.6%.
<LI>According to the August 1994 Survey on Smoking in Canada, 30% of Canadians over 15 
years of age smoke cigarettes. Rates of use are highest among those aged 20-24 (38%) and 
lowest for adults over 65 (16 %).
<LI>About 36,325 deaths across Canada were indirectly attributed to smoking in 1990. Prince 
Edward Island and Nova Scotia have the highest rates of smoking-related deaths in the country 
and the Yukon and Northwest Territories have the lowest.
</UL>
<H3>Sources of data</H3>
Data on tobacco consumption and problems associated with smoking are drawn from a variety 
of sources. Distribution reports from agricultural sources, manufacturers and customs reports 
provide the most reliable estimate of tobacco consumption. These data are compiled by 
Statistics Canada in a monthly report on <I>Production and disposition of tobacco products. 
</I>Manufacturer's data provide the most accurate estimate of total annual tobacco 
consumption.<P>
Estimates of tobacco production are limited and do not include unrecorded sources of 
consumption such as imported tobacco, cross border shopping, illicit production and illegal 
importation. The consumption of tobacco products obtained through unrecorded sources 
increased substantially in 1991 with the introduction of the Federal Goods and Services Tax 
(GST) and a 3-cents-per-cigarette federal tax. These tax changes led to a protest by Canadian 
consumers who increasingly purchased tobacco products in the United States (Kaiserman, 
1992). For example, it is estimated that 6.4 billion cigarettes were illegally brought into Canada 
in 1991, about 11 % of the total market (Stamler, 1992).<P>
Just as different conversion factors are used to calculate the amount of alcohol sold in Canada, 
estimates of tobacco sales involve similar calculations. Tobacco products are categorized as 
cigarettes, fine-cu tobacco, cigars, pipe tobacco and smokeless tobacco. The conversion 
factors used by Statistics Canada for calculating "pieces" of tobacco are 0.865 g (1 cigarette) 
for manufactured cigarettes, 0.77 g. (l cigarette) for fine-cut tobacco and 3.72 g. (1 cigar) for 
cigars (Kaiserman, 1992).<P>
The problems and size of the illegal tobacco market continued to grow through 1993. As 
indicated by data in Table 10.10, exports of Canadian cigarette increased dramatically during 
the early 90s and a large proportion of these products ultimately found their way illegally back 
into Canada. In an effort to eliminate the illegal tobacco market the federal government 
introduced the anti-tobacco smuggling initiative in early 1994. While the most obvious impact 
was to lower the federal taxes on tobacco products this was only one component of the overall 
initiative. In addition to the tax changes, the federal government also announced the Tobacco 
Demand Reduction Strategy, a three-year program to fund legislative changes, research and 
public education. A part of this strategy, legislative changes have been made to increase the 
legal smoking age and substantially increase the penalties associated with tobacco sales to 
minors. During 1994/95 a number of national surveys are also being conducted as part of the 
Strategy to monitor the impact of the tobacco tax reductions and other initiatives. Subsequent to 
the federal actions several provinces also lowered their provincial tax rates (most notably 
Québec and Ontario). Cigarette tax rates can be found in Table 10.9.<P>
In comparison to what we know about the individual patterns of alcohol use and characteristics 
of drinkers, information about tobacco consumption is seriously limited. General population 
surveys provide information on the number and socio-demographic characteristics of abstainers, 
former smokers and current smokers. Little information, however, is available about the 
quantity/frequency/patterns of use that allow us to measure the overall effect of individual 
consumption patterns. These measurement issues also make it difficult to examine the correlates 
of heavy consumption and the behaviours for hard-core smokers —individuals who do not 
respond to the usual, . .smoking prevention programs.<P>
<H3>Overview of consumption trends and patterns of 
smoking</H3>
The patterns and levels of smoking have changed substantially in Canada since the mid-1960s. 
In 1994, there were about 6.5 million (30%) smokers (includes both daily and occasional 
smokers) among persons age 15 or older in Canada. Although the proportion of the population 
who smoke has dropped almost 50 per cent since 1965, there have been no changes since 
1990.<P>
The number of cigarettes consumed per adult declined almost as much over the same 
period.<P>
PERCENTAGE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO SMOKE: The proportion 
of Canadians who reported smoking in various national surveys was almost 50% in 1965, 44% 
in 1975, 40% in 1981 and 32% in 1989 (Table 3.1). Of those who responded to the 1991 
General Social Survey, 31 % said they were current smokers, 23% were former daily smokers 
and 45% said they had never smoked cigarettes on a daily basis (Table 3.2). In the 1991 
General Social Survey, men and women were about equally likely to be current smokers (32% 
vs. 30%), but men were more likely to be former daily smokers than women (28% vs. 19%). 
The proportion of respondents who are smokers is highest among 20 to 24 year olds (40%) 
and lowest for those over 65 (16%). The proportion of the population who smoke varies across 
the provinces (Table 3.3). Nova Scotia (35%), Newfoundland (35%), Alberta (34%), and 
Québec (33%) were all above the national rate. Current smoking status is also associated with 
having a lower level of education and a sedentary lifestyle (Table 3.4). As Table 3.6 indicates, 
nearly two thirds (63%) of all daily smokers started to smoke daily before the age of 18. 
Amongst younger smokers aged 20 to 24, 51% had started to smoke on a daily basis before 
the age of 16.<P>
<A HREF="/cpfig32.htm">LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION:</A> Sales data indicate that Canadians consumed approximately 
48.0 billion cigarettes in 1993 (Table 3.7). On an annual basis, this amounts to 2,103 cigarettes 
per person aged 15 or older. About 19 cigarettes per smoker are consumed per day, costing 
the average Canadian smoker anywhere from an estimated $821 per year in Québec to $2,025 
in Newfoundland. Manufactured cigarettes account for about 85% of total tobacco 
consumption while fine-cut tobacco accounts for 14%. Cigars, pipe tobacco and smokeless 
tobacco account for less than 2% of all sales.<P>
Overall 65% of daily smokers consume between 11 and 25 cigarettes per day and an additional 
12% consume over 25 cigarettes each day (Table 3.2). Men are heavier daily smokers than 
women: while 12% of men consume 26 or more cigarettes each day only 8% of women smoke 
at this level. In terms of age patterns, the majority of daily smokers in all age groups consume 
between 11 and 25 cigarettes per day, ranging between 56% of smokers age 15 to 19 and 
71% of those age 25 to 44. The heaviest daily smokers are men over the age of 45, 20% 
consuming in excess of 25 cigarettes per day.<P>
CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH-VOLUME SMOKERS: The portrait of the high volume, 
daily smoker taken from survey data is one of middle aged, well-to-do men and women who 
are college educated. Although individuals who are well educated and have adequate incomes 
are less likely to smoke, they tend to smoke more than less well educated and lower income 
Canadians (Health and Welfare Canada, 1993).<P>
Overall, current smokers report drinking more than non-smokers (5.2 drinks per week vs. 3.2 
drinks) and male smokers drink more than twice as much as female smokers (7.3 drinks per 
week vs. 2.7). The majority of female smokers (51.8%) report not drinking during the current 
week (Table 3.5).<P>
<H3>Problems associated with tobacco use</H3>
TOBACCO-RELATED MORTALITY: There were an estimated 36,325 deaths indirectly 
attributed to smoking in Canada for 1991 (Table 3.8). Although this number represents a 
nominal decline from 1989, it is a 3.4% increase over 1984. The rates of death per 100,000 
population vary across the provinces. Prince Edward Island (158.3) and Nova Scotia (151.2) 
have the highest smoking related death rate and the Yukon (56.4) and Northwest Territories 
(35.0) have the lowest. The numbers of deaths indirectly due to smoking are estimated from the 
number of deaths due to chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema and 30% of all deaths due to 
neoplasms, stroke, hypertension and heart disease.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The 1993 General Social Survey indicates that 69.8% of Canadians use aspirin, 8.2% use 
opiate narcotics, 3.8% use tranquillizers, 4.2% use sleeping pills and 2.5% use antidepressants. 
In 1994, the number of prescriptions written for psychotherapeutic drugs increased by 4.0% 
and prescriptions for analgesics increased by 0.7% over the previous year.
<LI>Between 1989 and 1993, the proportion of Canadians who used cannabis declined from 
6.5% to 4.2%, the proportion who used cocaine declined from 1.4% to 0.3%, and the 
proportion who used LSD, speed or heroin was relatively stable (0.4% in 1989 and 0.3% in 
1993):
<LI>In 1992, Canadian police forces seized 115,081 kg. of cannabis, 5,285 kg. of cocaine 
and 85 kg of heroin. There were 1,321 reported thefts and other losses involving narcotics and 
controlled drugs; 2,170 prescription forgeries were detected.
<LI>In 1990-91, there were 21,746 drug-related cases (78.2 separations per 100,000 
population) handled at general and psychiatric hospitals.
<LI>In 1991, there were 510 drug-related deaths in Canada. Drug-related mental disorders 
accounted for 10.8% and the remaining deaths involved various types of poisoning.
</UL>
SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Unlike alcohol, the use of licit and illicit drugs in Canada is 
not well documented and, as a result, their patterns and problems are difficult to describe. Sales 
of prescription drugs are not monitored on a national basis and little information exists on the 
availability of illegal drugs. As a result, surveys appear to be the best source of information on 
the use of licit and illicit drugs in Canada.<P>
Surveys of drug use are limited because "use" is not measured in terms that help quantify 
patterns and levels of consumption (e.g., quantity and frequency of use, drug purity, dosage size 
and problems), or their relationship to problems experienced by segments of society. While the 
concept of a standard drink (i.e., a bottle of beer; one shot or mixed drink with hard liquor; or a 
glass of wine) is a common feature of alcohol surveys, there is no comparable unit of measure 
for illegal or prescription drug use. Another issue is the lack of direct indicators of drug sales 
and distribution patterns in Canada. We rely almost exclusively on indirect measures to monitor 
the availability of drugs and their effect on users. Prevalence surveys, registries of addicts, 
coroner reports on drug-related death, drug-related crime, drug seizures, and surveys of victims 
help develop limited profiles of illicit drug use in Canada.<P>
The following information is based on four sources: (1) the 1993 General Social Survey, (2) 
Bureau of Drugs Surveillance seizure and diversion statistics, (3) hospital separations from the 
Canadian Centre for Health Information, and (4) causes of death from Statistics Canada.<P>
<H3>Licit Drugs</H3>
PATTERNS OF USE: The 1993 General Social Survey collected information on aspirin and 
other pain relievers, and five categories of licit prescription drugs: sleeping pills, tranquillizers, 
diet pills and stimulants, antidepressants, and narcotic pain relievers (Single et al., 1994). 
Individuals were asked about their usage of these substances during the previous month. This 
source indicates that the consumption of licit drugs decreases with higher education and income 
levels (Table 4.1). Tranquillizers, sleeping pills and antidepressants are used more frequently 
among lower income groups and the less educated. People with higher education or income 
tend to use more prescription narcotics and aspirin. There are no clear trends in licit drug use by 
occupation.<P>
ASPIRIN: The most widely used licit drug is aspirin, used by 69.8% of adult Canadians (Table 
4.1). Women are more likely to use aspirin than men (75.1% vs. 64.2%). The level of use is 
highest between 18 and 19 (74.5%) and 35 and 44 (72.9%) years of age. Divorced or 
separated people are more likely to use aspirin (71.3%) and widowed people are least likely to 
use them (65.2%). Use of aspirin in the past month is lowest among those with less than a high 
school education (66%) and highest among individuals who have completed university (73.0%). 
Regionally, Québec (59.1 %) reports much lower levels of aspirin use than all other parts of the 
country such as the Prairie provinces (74.0%) and British Columbia (72.3%).<P>
CODEINE, DEMEROL AND MORPHINE: Overall, 8.2% of adult Canadians used an opiate 
narcotic (e.g., codeine, Demerol, and morphine) in the month before answering the General 
Social Survey (Table 4.1). Individuals under 55 years of age are more likely to use opiate 
narcotics, especially those between 25 and 34 years of age (11.0%). Codeine, Demerol and 
morphine are more likely to be used by people who are divorced or separated 19.1%) and 
least likely to be used by those who are widowed (6.0%). Use is highest in the lower middle 
income groups (10.3%) and lowest in the highest income groups (7.3%). Women (9.0%) are 
more likely to use these drugs than men (7.4%). Opiate narcotics are most likely to be used in 
British Columbia (12.4%) and least likely to be used in Québec (3.2%). I<P>
TRANQUILLIZERS, SLEEPING PILLS AND ANTI-DEPRESSANTS: The use of 
tranquillizers (3.8%), sleeping pills (4.2%) and antidepressants (2.5%) is low in Canada <A HREF="/cpfig41.htm">(Figure 
4.1).</A> Tranquillizers and sleeping pills are used more often as people age; the elderly (over 75) 
have the highest level of use (10.6% for tranquillizers; 20.1 % for sleeping pills). The use of anti-
depressants does not have a clear age trend, with the highest rate of use among individuals 
between 45 and 54 (4.0%). Women (3.4%) are more likely to use these drugs than men 
(1.6%).<P>
The level of tranquillizers, sleeping pills and antidepressant use decreases as income increases. 
The use of tranquillizers (7.8%) and anti-depressants (5.S%) is highest among those in the 
lowest income groups and the use of sleeping pills (8.4%) is highest among lower-middle 
income earners. The highest rates of use are among those with less than a secondary school 
education (6.2% for tranquillizers, 6.5% for sleeping pills and 3.0% for anti-depressants). 
Regionally, tranquillizers (7.1 %) and sleeping pills (6.1 %) are more widely used in Québec 
than in other areas of Canada. The use of anti-depressants has little relationship to region.<P>
DIET PILLS: Diet pills are used by less than 1 % of the Canadian population (0.6%) (Table 
4.1). Young people between 15 and 17 (1.0%) and 20 and 24 (1.3%) years of age are 
attracted to these drugs, and those who are single (1.0%), in the middle income group (1.0%), 
semi-skilled (1.0%), and looking for work (1.3%). Regionally, individuals who live in the 
Atlantic provinces (1.1 %) and British Columbia (1.0%) are more likely to use diet pills.<P>
LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION: Although the actual number of prescriptions and total sales of 
prescription drugs are not available, information about the proportions of drugs being prescribed 
by the medical profession in Canada is available (Therriault, 1994). For example, of the <A HREF="/cpfig42.htm">top 10 
therapeutic classes of drug prescriptions,</A> cardiovascular drugs were prescribed most often 
accounting for 12.7% of all prescriptions, followed by systemic anti-infective drugs (12.1%), 
psychotherapeutic drugs (9.7%), analgesics (8.6%), hormone drugs (7.5%), bronchial therapy 
drugs (5.1%), anti-spasmodics (4.8%), anti-arthritics (4.5%), contraceptives (4.1%) and 
diuretics (4.0%) (Figure 4.2). These 10 therapeutic drug classes accounted for 73.1 % of all 
prescriptions written in 1993-94 and 65.5% of total drug sales (Therriault, 1994). For the 12 
month period ending July 1994, the total prescriptions written in Canada increased by 1.4%. 
The number of prescriptions written for hormones (+6.0%), systemic anti-infectives (+4.3%), 
bronchial therapy drugs (+4.3%), anti-spasmodics (+4.1%) and psychotherapeutic drugs 
(+4.0%) increased over the previous year.<P>
<H3>Illicit Drugs</H3>
PATTERNS OF USE: A substantial proportion of Canadians admit using illicit drugs. As many 
as one in five adult Canadians, or four million two hundred thousand people, have used an illegal 
substance at least once over their lifetime. The most widely used illicit drug is cannabis 
(marijuana or hashish), used by 20 per cent or 4,250,000 adult Canadians over their lifetime 
(Adlaf, 1993). Three per cent or 640,000 people say they have used cocaine or crack, three 
per cent have used LSD, two per cent or 427,000 people have used amphetamines (speed) 
and less than one per cent or 213,4()0 people have used heroin in their lifetime. Over the past 
five years, the annual use of all drugs by Canadians declined, especially cannabis and cocaine 
(Table 4.2).<P>
CANNABIS: Cannabis use dropped from 6.5% in 1989 to 4.2% in 1993 (Table 4.2). This 
decline is most evident among adults, although use among 15 to 19 year olds increased from 
9% in 1990 to 10.3% in 1993 (Table 4.3). Regionally, the trend toward using less cannabis 
spread across the country (Table 4.4). This change was especially large in British Columbia 
where use declined from 9.6% in 1989 to 6.0% in 1993. The exception to this pattern was 
Prince Edward Island where use increased from 4.0% in 1990 to 5.4% in 1993.<P>
COCAINE: Other illicit drugs such as cocaine are used much less frequently by Canadians than 
cannabis. For example, in 1990 only about 3% of all Canadians had ever tried cocaine in their 
lifetime (Adlaf, 1993). Between 1989 and 1993, the proportion of Canadians who used 
cocaine in the past year declined from 1.4% to 0.3% (Table 4.2). This decline was evident 
among those under 19 (from 1.9% in 1989 vs. 0.9% in 1993), 20 to 24 years (from 3.1 in 
1989 to 1.0% in 1993) and 25 to 34 years (from 3.3% in 1989 to 0.6% in 1993) (Table 4.3). 
Regionally, fewer people used cocaine in Québec (from 2.0 in 1990 to 0.6% in 1993), Ontario 
(from 1.1% in 1990 to 0.1% in 1993), Alberta (from 1.1% in 1990 to 0.1% in 1993) and 
British Columbia (from 2.1% in 1990 to 0.8% in 1993) (Table 4.4).<P>
LSD, SPEED AND HEROIN:  The proportion of the Canadians who used LSD, speed or 
heroin over the past year was relatively stable between 1989 (0.4%) and 1993 (0.3%), despite 
some changes (Table 4.2). Fewer individuals between 15 and 19 used these drugs in 1993 
(1.7%) than in 1989 (2.1%). However, more young people between 20 and 24 years of age 
(0.0% 1989 to 1.0% 1993) reported using them (Table 4.3). Although use of these drugs is 
relatively low across the country, use is highest in Nova Scotia (0.8%), P.E.I. (0.6%) and B.C. 
(0.6%). Newfoundland is the only province with no reported use of LSD, speed or heroin 
(Table 4.4).<P>
Overall, illicit drug use is highest among those with the lowest income levels, who are outside the 
work force (e.g., looking for work, student), living in larger urban centres and on the west coast 
of Canada (Table 4.5). Young people tend to be the main consumers of illicit drugs in Canada. 
Although illicit drugs are used more often by those between 16-17 years, adolescents begin to 
use them between 12 and 15 years of age. In Ontario, 12.7% of students in grades 7, 9, 11, 
and 13 report experimenting with cannabis at least once in their lifetime (Adlaf, et al. 1993). In 
British Columbia, 23.1% used cannabis in the past year (British Columbia Ministry of Health 
and Ministry Responsible for Seniors, 1992). In Alberta, more than one in five adolescents 
(19.3%) say they have experimented with cannabis, one in 10 (10.5%) say they have used 
hallucinogens, and one in nine (8.9%) have used amphetamines or stimulants (Bertrand et al., 
1994). Less than 3% of students report using narcotics over their lifetime and almost 6% report 
using glue/solvents.<P>
<H3>Supply and Distribution of Illicit Drugs</H3>
The use of illicit drugs in the general population may be directly linked to the overall availability 
of drugs in society (U.N., 1994). The seizure statistics reported below are indirect measures of 
trafficking as reported by the Bureau of Drugs Surveillance (B.D.S., 1994) and the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP, 1994).<P>
CANNABIS: Cannabis, in its various forms, is the most widely available drug in Canada. In 
1992, Canadian police forces seized a total of 115,081 kg. of cannabis, a 14% decrease from 
1991 (134,296 kg.) (Table 4.6). About 98,865 kg. of marijuana, 15,797 kg. of hash and 419 
kg. of hash oil were seized in 1992. Regionally, marijuana was available in all areas of the 
country, most notably in Québec (37,905 kg.), British Columbia (33,659 kg.) and Ontario 
(20,108 kg.). Substantial quantities were also seized in Nova Scotia (2,08S kg.) and New 
Brunswick (1,210 kg.). The main centres in Québec were Montreal, Trois-Rivieres, 
Sherbrooke and Québec City (Table 4.7). In Ontario, seizures of marijuana occurred in 
Toronto, Hamilton, London, and St. Catharine's. In British Columbia, the major seizures were in 
Vancouver and Victoria. About 871 kg. of marijuana were seized in Calgary.<P>
Although the overall quantity of cannabis seized declined in 1992, the total number of seizures 
increased (31,416 in 1991 versus 32,630 in 1992). THC levels of cannabis increased. For 
example, the highest level of THC for marijuana was 12%, with an average of 3.1%. For 
hashish, the highest THC level was 15% with an average at 6.3%. For liquid hashish, the highest 
level was 35% and averaged 12% (RCMP, 1994).<P>
COCAINE: The amount of cocaine seized in 1992 (5,285 kg.) increased dramatically as 
compared to 1991 (1,696 kg.). Regionally, the most seizure activity was in Québec (4,901 kg.) 
and Ontario (226 kg.) (Table 4.6). Trois-Rivieres (3,920 kg.), Montreal (345 kg.), Toronto 
(191 kg.) and Vancouver (58 kg.) were the centres that were most involved in the drug trade in 
1992 (Table 4.7). Cocaine purity was stable, but street prices dropped by as much as 25% in 
some places. In 1992, the price of one kilogram of pure cocaine ranged from $25,000 to 
$65,000. The retail price of one ounce of cocaine (60% pure) ranged from $1,000 to $3,000 
(see Table 7.13).<P>
HEROIN: Seizures of heroin decreased substantially in 1992 (85 kg.) as compared to 1991 
(119 kg.). Regionally, seizures occurred almost exclusively in Ontario (32 kg.), Québec (26 
kg.) and British Columbia (26 kg.) (Table 4.6). The drop in heroin seizures is most evident in 
Ontario, where heroin seizures were over 65 kg. in 1991. The majority of activity was in 
Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver (Table 4.7). Heroin purity was stable between 1991 and 
1992. The purity of heroin remained high, ranging from 50% to 97% at the wholesale level and 
from 10% to 18% at the street level (RCMP, 1994).<P>
CHEMICAL DRUGS: In 1992, large quantities of stimulants, hallucinogens, anabolic steroids 
and diverted pharmaceuticals were seized (Table 4.6, Table 4.7). LSD was widely available 
across Canada, especially in Québec (23.5 kg.), Ontario (5.5 kg.) and British Columbia (7.59 
kg.). The largest quantities of LSD were seized in Québec, especially in Chicoutimi-Jonquiere 
(6.3 kg.), Québec City (6.5 kg.), and Montreal (9.4 kg.) (Table 4.7). Phencyclidine (PCP) was 
more widely available in 1992, especially in the western provinces. Large seizures were made in 
British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta (RCMP, 1994). The centre for PCP manufacture 
and distribution was Québec.<P>
<H3>Diversion of Licit Drugs to Illicit Markets</H3>
OVERVIEW: Licit drug diversion is defined as any illegal manoeuvre to secure drugs from the 
accepted distribution system (Clark, 1992; Archer, 1984). Losses in transit by legitimate drug 
manufacturers, break and entries, grab thefts, armed robberies and pilfering by staff from 
pharmacies are all sources of drug diversion (Clark, 1992). Physicians and patients become 
involved when patients obtain drugs illegally from physicians for personal use or for resale on the 
illicit market (Clark, 1992).<P>
In 1992, there were 1,321 <A HREF="/cpfig43.htm">reported thefts and other losses involving narcotics and controlled 
drugs (Figure 4.3).</A> Over half (55.9%) of these thefts were from pharmacies, almost one third 
(30.7%) were from hospitals and 10.4% were from licensed dealers. The largest thefts of 
narcotic drugs include codeine tablets (915,014 tabs) and liquid (219,335 mls.), hydrocodone 
liquid (300,793 mls.), meperidine tablets (70,084 tabs), morphine tablets (97,568 tabs) and 
liquid (65,189 mls.), and oxycodone tablets (307,248 tabs). The largest quantities of stolen 
controlled drugs for 1992 were methylphenidate tablets (51,356 tabs), phentermine capsules 
(17,162 caps), barbiturate tablets (150,592 tabs), and steroid tablets (4,800 tabs) (see Table 
12.24). Regionally, the most significant thefts were in Ontario (47.3%), followed by Alberta 
(17.2%), Québec (15.3$6) and British Columbia (8.7%) (see Table 12.23).<P>
Prescription forgeries are another aspect of drug diversion. In 1992, 2,170 prescription 
forgeries were detected across the country, 2,018 for narcotic drugs and 152 for controlled 
drugs (see Table 12.25). The largest number of forgeries for narcotic drugs was for codeine 
(n=994), oxycodone (n=495) and hydromorphone (n= 159). The largest number of 
prescription forgeries for controlled drugs was for phentermine (n= 37), amphetamines (n= 34) 
and secobarbital (n=29).<P>
<H3>Problems Related to Use of Licit and Illicit 
Drugs</H3>
MORBIDITY:  This section presents information about individuals treated in general or 
psychiatric hospitals with a primary drug-related problem. The diagnostic classifications used by 
Canadian hospitals (International Classification of Diseases, Version 9) do not differentiate licit 
or illicit drug problems. These sources record the category of drug used. In some instances, 
both licit and illicit drug problems would be recorded in the same category. Cases where a drug 
problem is a complicating condition to a more serious (non-drug) problem are not included in 
this information .<P>
For example, a drug poisoning case involving heroin would be classified in the category of 
poisoning by analgesics, anti-pyretics and anti-rheumatics involving opiates and related narcotics 
(ICD-9 965.0). This category includes not only heroin but also drugs such as codeine, 
morphine, methadone and opium. Under these reporting practices, it is not possible to 
distinguish health problems due to licit and illicit drugs.<P>
In Canada, the problem of differentiating drug-related health problems is complicated by the 
fact that treatment resources do not use the same reporting system as general hospitals. 
Treatment information may not be available in some provinces. In Ontario, a survey of treatment 
services is conducted every three years to monitor the number and nature of problems 
experienced by users. It also examines the ability of the health system to respond appropriately 
to the needs of the public.<P>
In 1990-91 there were 21,746 separations from general and psychiatric hospitals for drug-
related disorders, a rate of 78.2 separations per 100,000 population (Tables 4.8 and 4.9). This 
rate is slightly lower than past years, declining from 82.2 in 1987-88 to 78.6 in 1990-91 (Table 
4.9). About one third (33.5%) (7,290 separations) of all drug-related separations are for mental 
disorders (psychoses, drug dependence syndrome and non-dependent abuse of drugs). Drug 
dependence was involved in over half (60.0%) of the separations for mental disorders. Only 
6.9% of all drug related cases are handled in psychiatric hospitals (Table 4.11).<P>
The remaining 66.5 % of drug-related hospital separations were cases treated for poisonings 
involving prescription drugs. Poisoning by analgesics, anti-pyretics and anti-rheumatics 
accounted for 29.3% of all separations and 28.7% involved poisoning by psychotropic 
agents.<P>
During 1990-91, 56.4% of all drug-related hospital separations involved women. While females 
had overall higher rate of separation for drug-related poisonings, males had higher separation 
rates for drug-related mental disorders.<P>
In terms of age, 15- 19 year olds had the highest separation rates (162.5 per 100,000) for drug 
problems, followed by those aged 20-24 (122.8 per 100,000) and 25-34 (117.9 per 100,000) 
(Figure 4.4). Drug-related hospital separations declined among children under 15 and those 
over 65. Individuals over 75 years of age have high separation rates for drug psychosis (9.7 per 
100,000), and poisoning due to analgesics, anti-pyretics and anti-rheumatics (10.2 per 
100,000) and sedatives and hypnotics (7.0 per 100,000).<P>
Regionally, drug-related hospital separation rates differ across the country. For example, in 
1990-91 the separation rate for drug psychosis is lowest in Québec (2.4 per 100,000) and 
highest in Alberta (10.0 per 100,000). Separations for drug dependence are highest in Nova 
Scotia(24.1 per 100,000)and Québec(23.5 per 100,000) and lowest in Manitoba (4.2 per 
100,000). Separations for non-dependent abuse of drugs are highest in Nova Scotia (14.1 per 
100,000) and lowest in Québec (3.9 per 100,000) (Table 4.10).<P>
Although the overall rate of hospital separations due to complications of pregnancy and 
childbirth is low across the country, British Columbia rates are much higher than other parts (1.7 
per 100,000). Rates for poisonings by analgesics, anti-pyretics and anti-rheumatics are 
considerably higher for western provinces such as Saskatchewan (34.8 per 100,000), Alberta 
(33.9 per 100,000) and British Columbia (32.8 per 100,000) than for other parts of the 
country. Hospital separations for poisonings due to sedatives and hypnotics, although lower than 
other categories, are highest in Saskatchewan (10.1 per 100,000) and P.E.I. (9.9 per 
100,000). Separations for poisonings due to psychotropic agents are highest in P.E.I. (35.1 per 
100,000), New Brunswick (34.6 per 100,000) and British Columbia (31.6 per 100,000). 
Québec has the lowest rate with 12.0 separations per 100,000 population.<P>
MORTALITY: Estimating drug-related mortality is difficult. Although there are epidemiological 
methods to determine deaths that are an indirect result of alcohol and tobacco use, there are 
few comparable methods available for other substances. Two measures of mortality are 
presented below. Although both sources are based on criteria for assigning "underlying cause of 
death", the first measure is based on the nature of injury and the second is the external cause of 
death.<P>
In 1991, there were 510 drug-related (licit and illicit) deaths in Canada (Table 4.12). Mental 
disorders accounted for 10.8% of this total (55 deaths) and the remaining deaths involved 
various types of poisoning. Poisoning by analgesics, anti-pyretics and anti-rheumatics accounted 
for 46.1% of deaths. One in three deaths (33.3%) was from poisoning by psychotropic agents 
and one in 10 deaths (9.8%) was from poisoning by sedatives and hypnotics. The largest 
increase between 1990 (82 deaths) and 1991 (133 deaths) was for poisoning by opiates and 
related narcotics. In l991, 60.4% of all drug-related deaths involved men (Table 4.12). 
Although men have higher proportion of deaths due to drug-related poisonings, more females 
died from poisoning by salicylates and aromatic analgesics. The number of poisoning deaths by 
anti-depressants was about equal for males (59 deaths) and females (62 deaths) in 1991.<P>
In terms of age, the highest rate for drug-related death was for those between 35 and 44 (3.7 
per 100,000), followed by 25 to 34 year olds (2.6 per 100,000) and 45 to 54 (2.3 per 
100,000) (Table 4.13). The age pattern for males follows that of the general population. The 
pattern for females differs, however, with the highest rate among individuals 35 and 44 years of 
age (2.9 per 100,000), 55 and 59 (2.6 per 100,000) and over 75 years (2.1 per 100,000) 
(Table 4.13). Regionally, the highest number of drug-related deaths occurred in British 
Columbia (173 deaths), Ontario (142 deaths), Alberta (98 deaths) and Québec (36 deaths) 
(Table 4.14).<P>
In 1991, there were 438 cases in which drugs were the external cause of death, a 20.0% 
increase over 1990 (Table 4.15). Almost half (46.8%) of these deaths were suicide-related and 
44.5% were accidentally inflicted. One of every 11 drug-related deaths (8.7%) could not be 
categorized as either accidentally or purposefully inflicted.<P>
Seven in 10 (69.7%) deaths from accidental causes involved poisoning by analgesics, anti-
pyretics and anti-rheumatics, 23.1% involved poisonings by psychotropic agents and 7.2% 
involved poisoning by sedatives and hypnotics. Overall, the proportion of deaths with drugs as 
an external cause was higher among males (60.5%) than females (39.5%). In terms of age, 
individuals between 35 and 44 (31.7%) were more likely to have drug involvement, followed by 
those between 25 and 34 (25.3%) and 45 and 54 (14.2%) years of age than other age groups 
(Table 4.15; Table 4.16). Regionally, the highest proportion of drug-related deaths by external 
cause was in British Columbia (34.0%), followed by Ontario (29.2%) and Alberta (16.7%) 
(Table 4.17).<P>

<UL>
<LI>Native youths are at two to six times greater risk for every alcohol-related problem than 
their counterparts in other segments of the Canadian population.
<LI>The majority of Aboriginal Canadians smoke; half of those who smoke, do so daily.
<LI>One in five young Natives have used solvents. One third of all users are under 15 and over 
one half began to use solvents before they were 11 years old.
</UL>
Developing a national picture of alcohol and drug use among Aboriginal people is a challenging 
task. Classifications of tribal affiliation, regional distribution, European contact and community 
structure complicate epidemiology studies based on traditional research methods (Scott, 1994). 
Although a great deal of data is available about Natives who live on reserves, about 40 per cent 
of the population live off reserve and are excluded from government health and addiction 
services. This situation produces an incomplete picture of the problem. Most information about 
Native substance use comes from surveys, an approach that many Aboriginal people disagree 
with because it invades their privacy and the information is rarely used to improve Native 
communities (Scott, 1994; LeCavalier and McKenzie, 1993).<P>
Traditional approaches for measuring alcohol or drug problems may not be appropriate to 
Native populations because of community isolation and a variety of high-risk behaviours. For 
example, Scott (1994) suggests that the Jellinek Formula, a measure used to estimate the 
number of alcoholics in a population based on the number of deaths due to liver cirrhosis) is not 
relevant to Native communities.  Native people do not live long enough to die from liver 
cirrhosis.  Instead, Scott recommends Fiddler's (1985) approach that uses violent death as the 
prime indicator of substance abuse among Native people.<P>
Despite these difficulties, some information is available at the national level. For example, 
national information about alcohol-related morbidity is gathered through a Native Treatment 
Addiction Reporting System (TARS) maintained by the Medical Services Branch of Health 
Canada. These centres are non-medical facilities that are residential and culturally sensitive 
(Scott, 1994). Individuals who live off-reserve are not captured in this data base. Another 
source is Statistics Canada's 1991 Aboriginal Survey that examined on-reserve Aboriginal 
languages, traditions, t health and lifestyles. Although 135,600 individuals responded to the 
survey (77% response rate), Statistics Canada admits that the frequency of reported alcohol 
consumption may be low (Douglas, 1993). Although the consumption of heavier drinkers is 
normally under-estimated in surveys because of non-response bias, non-response (23%) and 
the exclusion of 78 Native communities from the sample makes this survey problematic. Thus, 
the consumption estimates are likely to be particularly low.<P>
The 1993 First Nations and Inuit Youth Solvent Abuse Survey is another important source of 
information about Aboriginal substance abuse. The survey gathered information about solvent 
use by Aboriginal young people to help develop appropriate treatment programs 
(Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). "Community profiles" were developed about 
youth known to abuse solvents. "Key informant" t committees prepared lists of individual solvent 
abusers under 25 years of age living in the community.  Information was gathered on type of 
use, age, gender, use of other substances and other problems/conditions in the youth's life 
(Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). Although 631 First Nations Communities were 
contacted about the survey, about one third responded. Information on 1,248 known solvent 
users was received. The following information is based on these three sources.<P>
ALCOHOL USE: According to the 1991 survey of on-reserve Natives, 67% of those claiming 
Aboriginal identity were current drinkers, 14.4% were former drinkers and 14.8% were life-
time abstainers (Statistics Canada. 1993). Regionally, Native Canadians who reported drinking 
were highest in Newfoundland (71%) and lowest in Prince Edward Island (54.8%) and Nova 
Scotia (56.9%) (Table 5.1).<P>
Although over 60% of current drinkers said they drank less than twice per month, 35% drank 
regularly (Statistics Canada, 1993). About 19% drank about once a week, 11% drank 2-3 
times a week and 3% drank 4-6 times per week. Less than 2% of the respondents drank daily. 
No information was available about how much alcohol Native people drank per occasion or 
under what circumstances drinking occurred. For regional patterns, the largest proportion of 
daily drinkers is in British Columbia (21 %) and Ontario (19%).<P>
TOBACCO USE: The majority of Natives living on reserves (55%) currently smoke; about 
42% are either former smokers or abstainers (Table 5.2). About 44% of all smokers do so 
daily. Regionally, Northwest Territories (59.3%) and Prince Edward Island (55%) have the 
highest proportion of daily smokers, while British Columbia (33.7%) and Ontario (40.7%) have 
the lowest. Among those who smoke daily, 32% smoke between one and 10 cigarettes per 
day, 40% smoke 11 20 cigarettes per day and 27% smoke more than 21 cigarettes per 
day.<P>
DRUG USE: Very little information is available about drug use among Native Canadians. The 
most comprehensive source is the 1990 Yukon Alcohol and Drug Survey. The level of alcohol 
and drug use is higher in the Yukon than other parts of the country. According to this survey, 
about half of Aboriginal people (47%) report using marijuana at some point in their lives, and 
16% used it in the past year. These rates are almost double those for the rest of Canada (23% 
for life-time users and 7% for current users). Almost all current marijuana users (90%) also 
drink and heavy drinkers report using marijuana more often than those who drink lightly. Sixteen 
per cent of Aboriginal people report using cocaine at some time in their lives compared to the 
rest of Canada at 4%. About 18% of Aboriginal people in the Yukon used LSD or some other 
hallucinogenic substance compared to 4% for other Canadians. These patterns, however, may 
not apply to other Native communities across Canada.<P>
SOLVENT USE: A substantial number of Native Canadians, particularly young people, use 
solvents. According to the 1993 First Nations and Inuit Community Youth Solvent Abuse 
Survey, solvent users are most often male (68.6%) and between 12 and 15 (36.0%)or 16 and 
19 years of age(28.5%) (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). Females (31.4%) 
who use solvents tend to be somewhat younger, with almost half (45.2%) being between 12 
and 15 years of age. This age pattern varies across the country. For example, solvent users 
from British Columbia are very young—between four and 11 years old (40%). Those in 
Newfoundland/Labrador are older, between 20 and 25 years (30%) and 26 years of age or 
older (30.0%). The highest proportion of female users is in Québec (40.7%), Yukon (38.5%), 
Manitoba (36.0%) and British Columbia (35.6%).<P>
Over half of all solvent users (50.8%) began to use solvents before they were 11 years old 
(Table 5.3). One in three Aboriginal solvent users in Manitoba (36.6%), Nova Scotia (36.0%), 
Newfoundland/Labrador (40.0%) and the Yukon (44.4%) fit this age profile (Kaweionnehta 
Human Resource Group, 1993). In Ontario, solvent use begins a little older, between 16 and 
19 (35 %). The majority of young people use solvents to experiment (42.3%) or for social 
reasons (37.5%) (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). Young people who use 
solvents have troubled family and life circumstances (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 
1993). About half of users experience financial hardship (42.8%), neglect or malnutrition 
(49.0%), or unemployment (51.8%) in their families. Two thirds are affected by family conflict 
(66.3%) or alcohol and drug abuse (66.3%) (Table 5.5).<P>
The nature of these situational problems differs across the county (Kaweionnehta Human 
Resource Group, 1993) (Table 5.6). For example, family conflict is higher in B.C. (80.4%) and 
lower in Manitoba (38.5%), Québec (46.0%), and Newfoundland/Labrador (40.0%) than 
average (66.3%).<P>
Solvent users in Ontario (15.2%), Québec (10.3%), Nova Scotia (7.7%) and Newfoundland/ 
Labrador (10.0%) have lower rates of neglect and malnutrition than the national average (49.0). 
The presence of alcohol and drug abuse in the home is lower in Québec (32.3%), 
Newfoundland/Labrador (40%), and the Northwest Territories (45.5%), than the national 
average (66.3%). Some regions experienced more family deaths than others. For example, 
more youths in Newfoundland/Labrador had a parent die (40.0% versus an average of 15.8%) 
and those in the Yukon (61.5% versus 24.1%) and the Northwest Territories (45.5%) 
experienced the death of another close relative.<P>
Solvent users also tend to consume other substances (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 
1993). Overall, 54.1% used both alcohol and solvents and 76% of those who used alcohol also 
used solvents.<P>
SUBSTANCE-RELATED PROBLEMS:  Native populations are overall younger and have 
higher rates of mortality and morbidity than their counterparts in other segments of Canadian 
society (Scott, 1994).  native youths are at two to six times greater risk for every alcohol-
related problem experienced by other Canadian youth except for cancers.  They are three to 
four times more likely to die from accidental death than other Canadians (Scott, 1994).<P>
There appears to be a geographic pattern regarding serious accidental and violent death among 
Native communities: Western Native people are three to four times more likely to die from 
accidental and violent death than their Eastern counterparts and those who live in the isolated 
north are at greater risk than those who live in the south (Scott, 1994). Men are more likely to 
abuse alcohol than women, while women tend to use more prescription drugs than men. Men 
between 25 and 44 experience the majority of alcohol and drug problems in the Aboriginal 
population (Scott, 1994).<P>
The majority of Native people in treatment are receiving it for 1) alcohol 2) narcotics and 3) 
hallucinogens (in hierarchical order) (Scott, 1994). Alcohol is four times more likely to be 
abused than other substances. The most common cross addiction patterns are 1) alcohol and 
narcotics, 2) alcohol and hallucinogens, 3) alcohol and prescription drugs; and 4) narcotics and 
hallucinogens (in hierarchical order).<P>
Over 1,500 Native Canadians receive treatment annually (Scott, 1994). <A HREF="/cpfig51.htm">The bulk of treatment 
participation is in the 25 to 34 age category (Figure 5.1).</A> About 40% of those in treatment are 
women; gender differences in treatment participation are narrowing across the country, except 
for in Québec. Native treatment centres are newer in Québec and women are still reluctant to 
attend. The greatest barrier to getting women into treatment across the country is the lack of 
child care facilities in treatment centres. Women need to pay for child care, a circumstance that 
is not possible for those in need of treatment.<P>
Hospital discharge rates for Native Canadians for substance-related diagnoses are three times 
the national rate (Scott, 1994). Alcoholic psychosis is four times the national rate, alcoholic liver 
disease is 3'/2 and alcohol dependency is 2l/2 times the national rate. Binge drinking may be the 
predominant pattern among individuals who enter the treatment system.<P>
The problems associated with solvent abuse are less well documented than for other 
substances. Little is known about the effect of any one type of solvent on the human body, let 
alone the effects of these compounds in combination (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 
1993). Abnormalities experienced by chronic sniffers are respiratory difficulties, liver function, 
kidney, metabolic and electrolyte disturbances, blood abnormalities and central and peripheral 
nervous system damage. Although some abnormalities may be reversible if solvent use stops, 
some conditions (e.g., cerebral and cerebella atrophy) are permanent.<P>
Several problems are closely associated with solvent use (Kaweionnehta Human Resource 
Group, 1993). They include Sudden Sniffing Death, euphoria, panic reactions, violence and 
aggression (e.g., homicide and suicide), suffocation, burns, asphyxiation, freezing to death and 
fetal solvent syndrome.<P>
TREATMENT ISSUES: Native people who enter treatment suffer from a complicated mix of 
problems that should be considered as well as treatment for their addictions. Three issues show 
up in the treatment system (McKenzie, 1994). For example, some types of substance abuse 
also involve self-abuse, particularly for children. Children from families in distress tend to use 
solvents very early - sometimes before the age of five or 10. These problems, in turn, aggravate 
the addiction problems of their parents, tying them in a revolving cycle of abuse.<P>
Other issues include the role of violence and suicide in treatment (McKenzie, 1994). Many 
Native people enter treatment because a situation at home ends up in violence. Along with 
substance abuse, there is an increased risk of suicide for some Native people. Suicide is not just 
an indicator of mental illness, but also an indicator of psychiatric disorder. Therefore, self-abuse, 
violence, suicide and psychiatric disorders should be part of an appropriate treatment 
intervention for Native peoples.<P>
A recent report prepared for the National Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program presents a 
vision of the ideal addiction treatment program for an Alberta reserve (Wong, 1994). The 
approach, referred to as the Alexis Mental Health Plan, is a holistic model. There are four 
treatment components: 1) spiritual guidance and healing, 2) addiction treatment, 3) family 
assistance, and 4) outpatient psychotherapy. The Alexis plan is based on the assumption that 
addicted people on the reserve have many kinds of problems, demanding that addiction 
treatment be integrated with other treatment programs.<P>
The Alexis plan (Figure 5.2) suggests that treatment services should be integrated at several 
levels such as intake, referral, assessment, treatment and evaluation (Wong, 1994). Requests for 
treatment should be evaluated through a centralized intake process involving professional 
therapists, elders and health staff. Clients are referred to one or more of seven treatment 
assistance programs, one of which is addiction treatment. Requests for addiction treatment can 
come from<B> </B>four sources (1): the individual or his/her family, child welfare, social 
services and the court.<P>
SOCIAL PROBLEMS: When asked to identify important problems in their community, Native 
Canadians identified unemployment (67%), alcohol abuse (61%), drug abuse (48%), suicide 
(25%), family violence (39%) and sexual abuse (25%) as key concerns (Statistics Canada, 
1993) (Table 5.7). Respondents also identified several strategies that may improve conditions in 
their communities, including improved education (7.4%), more policing (10.1%), family 
counseling services (10.5%), other counseling services (9.0%), improved community services 
(9.8%) and more employment (7.8%) (Table 5.8).<P>
In sum, information about alcohol and drug use in Native communities, alcohol-related problems 
and appropriate treatment programs is seriously limited (McKenzie, 1994). More information is 
needed about the relationship among age, gender, the role of culture and economics in 
substance abuse. This information should be standardized, using valid, reliable methods and 
instruments. The challenge, however, is to gather this information while being sensitive to Native 
issues and developing a strategy for applying it at the community level to solve practical 
problems (LeCavalier and McKenzie, 1993; McKenzie, 1994).<P>

<H2>Social Attitudes Toward Use and

<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>80% of smokers believe quitting smoking would improve their health while 16% of current 
drinkers think a reduction in their alcohol consumption would be beneficial.
<LI>A majority of Canadians consider government action on drug use (79% of Canadians), 
AIDS (78%), alcohol problems (63%) and smoking (53%) to be of high importance.
<LI>Canadians generally favour current alcohol controls; however, 74% would favour the 
introduction of warning labels on alcoholic beverages.
</UL>
Surveys are often used to gauge individual values, benefit of government policies or self-
perceived benefits/harm from health-related practices. Information in this section is derived from 
the 1990 Health Promotion survey and the 1989 National Alcohol and Other Drugs 
Survey'.<P>
(The information in this chapter is similar to what was presented in the previous edition of the 
Canadian Profile. Since the 1990 Health Promotion Survey there have been no national public 
domain surveys that have examined the policy and social issues associated with substance use 
and abuse. However, in 1994, the Canadian Alcohol and Other Drug Survey (CADS) was 
conducted which did contain a significant number of policy and social questions. While data 
from this survey were not available for inclusion in this edition of the Canadian Profile, it is 
anticipated that this section will undergo a significant update in the 1996 report.)<P>
<H3>Perceived health benefits</H3>
As part of the 1990 Health Promotion Survey, Canadians were asked about whether selected 
health-related actions would improve their health and well-being. The vast majority of smokers 
(81 %, Table 9.1) feel that they would benefit by quitting smoking and 16% of current drinkers 
feel they would benefit from reducing their drinking. Older Canadians are somewhat less likely 
to perceive a benefit from reduced use of tobacco, alcohol or other drugs. Male drinkers are 
twice as likely as female drinkers to perceive a benefit from a reduction in their drinking.<P>
<H3>Importance of government action</H3>
Canadians were also asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 the importance of government action 
with regard to selected health topics. The results reported reflect the percentage of Canadians 
who rated each action at a level of 7 or higher. Of the substance-related health issues, drug use 
is the most important topic for governments to deal with (79% rate as high importance, Table 
9.2). AIDS follows closely with 78% ranking this as high priority followed by alcohol problems 
(63%) and smoking (53%). Women are more likely than men to note the importance of 
government action on all topics. Younger Canadians are more concerned with AIDS, while 
older age groups give more importance to drug abuse issues (Figure 9.1).<P>
Canadians in Atlantic Canada generally rank government action as more important than other 
parts of the country. In fact, there is a general decline in the importance of government action as 
one moves across Canada from east to west. There are no noticeable differences across income 
and education groups.<P>
<H3>Drinking in social situations</H3>
Most Canadians find it appropriate to drink at a party in someone's home (80.8%, Table 9.3), 
at a bar with friends (80.3% for men to do so, 76.7% for women to do so), when a couple is 
having dinner at home (76.8%) or when friends visit (77.3%). In all of these situations, the 
majority find that consuming only 1-2 drinks more appropriate than drinking "enough to feel the 
effects". Opinion is split regarding the appropriateness of drinking at sports events, or with 
friends after work, and the majority of Canadians (59%) feel it is not appropriate to drink with 
co-workers during lunch. Women are more moderate than men preferring 1-2 drinks or no 
drinking at all over drinking to feel the effects.<P>
<H3><A HREF="/cpfig92.htm">Alcohol and drug policy issues</A></H3>
Canadians generally favour current controls over the availability of alcohol. The majority (70%, 
Table 9.4) of Canadians believe that beer/liquor store hours should remain the same. Moreover, 
74% of Canadians believe that alcohol should not be sold in corner stores and should have 
warning labels (Figure 9.2, Table 9.5)<P>
While Canadians do not want the legal drinking age decreased, public opinion is split on 
whether drinking ages should stay the same or increase. Fifty per cent (S0%) of Canadians 
believe that legal drinking age should be increased while 45% believe it should remain the same. 
One half (51 %) said they do not want alcohol advertising on TV; however, only 41% favour 
the government stopping alcohol sponsored events.<P>
Most Canadians want the government to increase health promotion and treatment activities such 
as efforts to prevent serving drinks, alcohol and drug abuse prevention programs, treatment 
programs and government's advertising against drinking.<P>
A very slight majority (54%) of Canadians said possession of marijuana should be criminal 
versus 35% who stated possession of marijuana should not be criminal.<P>
<H3>Programs to reduce substance abuse</H3>
Most Canadians believe that self-help programs such as A.A., emergency phone services, 
community prevention efforts, and treatment by social workers or medical staff are either 
moderately or very effective in helping to reduce problems with substance abuse (Table 9.6). 
Self-help such as AA was considered the most effective (79.2% of Canadians believed this 
program to be moderately or very effective), followed by community prevention efforts 
(64.0%), emergency phone services (63.2%), and treatment by social workers or medical staff 
(60.3%).<P>

<HR>
<H2>Economic Aspects</H2>
by Eric Single, Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse <P>
<H3>Highlights </H3>
<UL>
<LI>The average Canadian age 15 or older spent S462 on alcoholic beverages in 1991-92, 
and the value of alcohol sales totaled more than $10 billion.
<LI>Alcohol provided employment for 17,831 Canadians and nearly $4 billion in government 
revenue in 1991-92.
<LI>Through the 1980s until the tax decreases in 1994, tobacco prices had increased 
substantially and, despite declining rates of consumption, government revenues from tobacco 
products had increased to $7.196 billion in 1991-92, accounting for 3% of total federal 
revenues and 2.1 % of provincial revenues.
<LI>The domestic market for the pharmaceutical industry, which employs more than 21,000 
Canadians, is valued at $4.3 billion.
</UL>
<H3>Economic Aspects of Alcohol</H3>
For the past three decades, the price of alcohol has increased substantially, but generally at the 
rates similar to other consumer goods (Table 10.1). Since 1986, however, the price of alcohol 
has increased at a slightly higher pace than the prices for other consumer goods. In 1991-92 the 
cost of alcohol as a percentage of personal disposable income increased to 2.79% from 2.68% 
in the previous year (Table 10.2). <P>
In 1991-92 the sale of alcoholic beverages totaled $10.294 billion (Table 10.3). Although 
consumption has been declining, there have been small but consistent increases in total sales of 
alcoholic beverage in recent years in terms of current dollars. The value « spirits, however, has 
been declining, even without taking inflation into account. On average, Canadians age 15 or 
older spent $243 on beer, $81 on wine and $137 on spirits in 1991-92. The highest per capita 
expenditure on alcohol was in the Yukon ( $925) and in the Northwest Territories ($740), 
reflecting the higher rates of consumption in these areas.<P>
Alcohol provided more than $3 billion in revenue to provincial governments in 1991-92, mainly 
from sales income (Table 10.5). This represents 2.2% of total provincial revenues. Federal 
revenue from the sales of alcohol is no longer reported, but was estimated be S937 million in 
1989-90.<P>
Alcoholic beverages have a small but positive impact on Canada's balance of trade. The value 
of alcohol exports in 1991-92 was $631 million, compared to $601 million for alcohol imports. 
Spirits are the major type of exported alcohol, but there has been a marked increase in the value 
of beer imports over the past 15 years (Table 10.6).<P>
In 1990 there were 17,831 persons employed in the production of alcoholic beverages, with 
salaries and wages totaling approximately $747 million (Table 10.7).<P>
<H3>Economic Aspects of Tobacco</H3>
The price of cigarettes relative to other consumer items generally decreased from the late 1940s 
until 1980. From 1980 to 1993, cigarette price increases were far greater than increases in the 
prices of other items. In 1994 the federal government dramatically decreased tobacco taxes in 
an attempt to reduce illicit importation (Table 10.1).<P>
Government revenue from tobacco products was $7.196 billion in 1991-92, with $4.155 billion 
going to the federal government and $3.041 billion to the provincial governments (Table 10.8). 
In 1991-92 tobacco taxes represented 3.0% of total federal revenues and 2.1 % of provincial 
revenues. Taxes range from S1.48 (Québec) to $5.14 (Newfoundland) on a pack of 25 
cigarettes (Table 10.9).<P>
Tobacco exports were valued at $814 million in 1993, while imports were valued at nearly $60 
million (Table 10.10). The value of tobacco exports increased more than eight-fold from 1989 
to 1993, and it was widely suspected that much of these exports were illegally reimported back 
into Canada. The number of persons employed in processing and manufacturing tobacco 
products was 4,928 in 1990, with salaries and wages totaling more than $241 million (Table 
10.11). The number of persons employed in the tobacco industry declined substantially from 
nearly 10,000 in 1977 to less than 5,000 in 1990.<P>
<H3>Economic Aspects of Other Drugs</H3>
More than 21,000 Canadians were employed in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and 
medicines in 1992, with salaries and wages totaling more than S851 million (Table 10.12). The 
domestic market for pharmaceuticals and medicines was valued at approximately $4.3 billion in 
1990.<P>
Reliable estimates of the size and value of the illicit drug trade are lacking. However, the RCMP 
does provide information on representative street prices of illegal drugs at successive stages of 
trafficking (Table10.13). In 1992, the street price was estimated to be S35-S50 for 0.1 gram of 
injectable (5%-6%) heroin, $70-$200 for 1 gram of 60% pure cocaine hydrochloride, $10-$50 
for 1 gram of Lebanese hashish, and S30-$50 for 1 gram of Jamaican hashish. The RCMP also 
provides data on the amount of illegal drugs seized (Table 10.14). There were large increases in 
the quantity of seizures for almost all classes of illicit drugs. For example, 194,170 kilograms of 
cannabis were seized in 1991, mainly in the form of hashish, representing an increase of 119% 
over the previous year.<P>
To counter money laundering effectively and better support other enforcement initiatives, the 
RCMP Ant Drug Profiteering Program seized more than S132 million in cash and other assets 
between 1988 and 1992. <A HREF="/cpfig101.htm">As seen in Figure 10.1, in 1992 $21.5 million was seized under this 
initiative.</A><P>
Three Anti-Drug Profiteering Integrated Units were created in 1992 with funding from Canada's 
Drug Strategy. The units, which are located in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, include 
RCMP personnel, local police, federal Crown Counsels, forensic accountants and various 
support personnel.<P>

<H3>Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs</H3>
<HR>
<H2>Drug-related Crime in Canada</H2>
by Bob Williams, Addiction Research Foundation, and Eric Single, Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse<P>
<H3>Highlights</H3>
<UL>
<LI>In 1992, there were 208,165 liquor act offences in Canada, representing 6S% of offences 
reported under provincial statutes (excluding traffic offences).
<LI>There were there were 142,377 federal drinking and driving offences during 1992. The 
number of federal drinking and driving offences across Canada has generally been declining 
since 1983 and the rate per 100,000 age 16 or older has declined an average 3.1% per year 
over the period 1984 to 1992.
<LI>In 1992, there were 56,490 drug-related offences, an increase of 0.7% over the level 
recorded in 1991. Offences involving cannabis accounted for 60% of the total while cocaine 
offences accounted for an additional 24%.
</UL>
This chapter is divided into three main parts dealing with offences under (1) provincial liquor 
acts, (2) federal drinking and driving legislation, and (3) federal drug offences falling under the 
Narcotic Control Act and Food and Drugs Act. For a description of the acts, types of offences 
and associated penalties please see Chapter 11.<P>
Most of the data reported in this chapter are based on police reported offences and charges 
recorded using the Uniform Crime Reporting system. Offence data represents a count of 
identified legal violations, while charges refer to the number of persons actually charged in 
connection with the offences. In general, if a person is charged with several offences, only the 
most serious offence or charge is reported. This results in fewer charges than offences and the 
under-reporting of charges for many less serious violations.<P>
<H3>Liquor Acts</H3>
The control and sale of liquor in Canada is regulated by legislation and enforcement policy in 
each province. Thus, interprovincial comparisons should be conducted with care.<P>
During 1992, there were 208,165 liquor act offences in Canada, representing 65% of offences 
reported under provincial statutes (excluding traffic offences). Since 1984, the total number of 
offences has declined by 24% (Table 12.1).<P>
Nationally, the rate per 100,000 population for liquor act was 732.1, a decline of 6.9% from 
1991. <A HREF="/cpfig121.htm">Regionally, rates of liquor act offences were highest in the Northwest Territories (3,967:9 
per 100,000), Prince Edward Island (2,717.6) followed by the Yukon (2,586.1). The lowest 
offence rate was in Québec with 29.5 offences per 100,000 population (Figure 12.1).</A><P>
The number of juvenile offenders involved in provincial liquor act offences dropped 24% to 
16,616 in 1992, continuing a declining trend that has been evident since 1988 (Table 12.2). A 
total of 128,800 adults (602.0 charges per 100,000 adults) were charged under provincial 
liquor acts in 1992. The number of adults charged declined 11.3% in 1992, compared with a 
annual average reduction of 5.7% between 1984 and 1992 (Table 12.3). In general, about 
90% of the adults charged in any given year were male.<P>
There were 5,766 reported sentenced admissions to provincial adult correctional service 
facilities for violating the provincial liquor acts in 1991-92 (Table 12.5). Liquor act offences 
accounted for 8% of all sentenced admissions to provincial correction facilities in 1991-92 
(Table 12.5).<P>
<H3>Drinking and Driving Offences</H3>
<A HREF="/cpfig122.htm">The number of drinking and driving offences across Canada has generally been declining since 
1984 and the rate per 100,000 age 16 or older has declined an average 3.3% per year over the 
period 1984 to 1992 (Table 12.6, Figure 12.2).</A> All regions of Canada, with the exception of 
the Northwest Territories and Saskatchewan, have experienced significant declines in the rate of 
drinking and driving offences.<P>
In 1992, there were 132,377 drinking and driving offences or 597 offences per 100,000 
population aged 16 or older (Table 12.6). The highest rates were recorded in the Yukon 
(2,524), the Northwest Territories (2,429), Saskatchewan (1,381) and Alberta (1,304). 
Ontario and Québec continued to have the lowest rates of drinking and driving offences at 406 
and 451 respectively.<P>
Impaired operation of a motor vehicle accounted for about 91% (120,094 offences) of drinking 
and driving offences in 1991 (Table 12.7, Figure 12.3). Failure or refusal to provide a breath or 
blood sample accounted for an additional 8% (10,279 offences) of the total, while the more 
serious offences of impaired operation causing bodily harm or death accounted for 1 % (1,623 
offences) .<P>
In 1992, there were 105,766 persons charged with alcohol-related traffic offences (Initial data 
releases for 1993 indicated that 92,539 persons were charged with impaired driving, a further 
decline of 13% between 1992 and 1993 Statistics Canada, <I>Juristat Volume 14, Number 
14 - Canadian Crime Statistics</I> , 1993, Ottawa: Statistics Canada, Catalogue No. 85-
002, August 1994) or 477 charges per 100,000 population age 16 or older (Tables 12.8 and 
12.9). Men accounted for 91% of all charges in each year from 1990 to 1992 (Table 
12.8).<P>
Excluding Ontario (where data were not available) there were 13,054 sentenced admissions to 
provincial adult correctional service facilities for drinking and driving offences in 1991 -92 
(Table 12.10). This represented 17% of all correctional facility admissions.<P>
<H3>Drug-related Crime</H3>
The interpretation of drug-related crime statistics is difficult. As noted in one of the original 
source materials "a change in police reported drug offences does not mean that there was a 
corresponding increase or decrease in drug usage but may in fact reflect changes in police 
enforcement practices" (Statistics Canada, Canadian Crime Statistics 1990, p. 45).<P>
In 1992, there were 56,490 drug-related offences, 0.7% higher than the level recorded in 1991 
(Table 12.11). This corresponded to a rate of 198.7 per 100,000 population (Table 12.12). 
Offences involving cannabis accounted for 60% of the total while cocaine offences accounted 
for an additional 24%. After increasing steadily during the period 1988 to 1991, offences 
involving heroin declined in 1992 and accounted for 2.2% of total drug offences. <A HREF="/cpfig124.htm">The highest 
rate of drug-related offences was recorded in the Yukon (569 per 100,00 followed by the 
Northwest Territories (549 per 100,000, Figure 12.4).</A> Among the 10 provinces the highest rate 
was in British Columbia (443 per 100,000) while the lowest rate of drug offences was in 
Québec (136).<P>
From 1986 to 1992, the number of juvenile offenders involved in drug-related offences under 
federal drug legislation has declined an average of 7.6% per year (Table 12.13). In 1992, the 
total number of juvenile offenders was down 18.9% from 1991. There were a total of 2,634 
juvenile drug offenders in 1992; 94% of the offenders committed offences under the Narcotic 
Control Act (NCA).<P>
In 1992 41,629 adults were charged with drug-related offences under federal legislation (Table 
12.14). The rate of charges per 100,000 adults for 1992 was 195, slightly higher than the rate 
recorded in 1991 (Table 12.15). The territories continue to record the highest rates (541 
charges per 100,000 in the N.W.T. adults and 410 in the Yukon) while the lowest rate 
occurred in New Brunswick (88 per 100,000 adults). As was the case with alcohol-related 
charges, males accounted for the majority of drug-related charges in 1992 (86%).<P>
It should be noted that data relating to the disposition of charges and convictions are from the 
Bureau of Drugs Surveillence (formerly the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs), Health Canada, and 
do not include convictions for offences involving cannabis. All data for 1993 in tables 12.16 
through 12.20 are preliminary estimates.<P>
According to preliminary estimates, of the 13,781 charges which reached disposition in 1993, 
10,227 (74%) resulted in convictions (Table 12.16). Over half (63% or 6,392) of all 
convictions resulted in prison sentences, while 26% were handled with fines and 9% resulted in 
a suspended sentence or probation.<P>
Charges under the Narcotic Control Act accounted for 91% of all federal drug convictions, 
while convictions involving controlled drugs in the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) represented 9% 
of the total (Table 12.17). Forty-five percent (45%) of all convictions were for possession, 
34% for trafficking, 19% possession for the purpose of trafficking, 1% for multiple doctoring 
and 1 % for importing (Table 12.18). Men accounted for 86% of all drug-related convictions 
(Table 12.19). Persons under the age of 30 accounted for 53% of the drug-related convictions 
while those aged 30 to 39 accounted for an additional 32% (Table 12.19).<P>
In 1991-92, there were 732 admissions to federal adult correctional institutions for drug-related 
offences, up 13.7% from the year before (Table 12.21). Drug-related admissions represented 
15% of all admissions to federal correctional institutions.<P>
There were 1,104 reported thefts and other losses involving drugs controlled under the NCA 
and FDA in 1993 (Table 12.23). Most thefts and losses occurred in pharmacies (54%), but 
since 1985 hospitals have increasingly been targeted as sources of loss, accounting for 33% of 
reported losses during 1993 (Table 12.23). Table 12.24 identifies the drugs and quantities there 
were reported lost for the period 1987 to 1993.<P>
The number of reported prescription forgeries decreased by 20% to 1,733 in 1992 (Table 
12.25). Forgeries involving codeine accounted for 42% of all prescription forgeries in 
1992.<P>

<HR>
<H2>Epilogue: Information Gaps and Implications 
to Research</H2>
by Eric Single, Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse; Bob Williams, Addiction Research 
Foundation; and Diane McKenzie, Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
This volume has presented information on alcohol and other drug use in Canada. The data in the 
tables and figures have been selected from an enormous amount of data available. There are 
many surveys on alcohol and drug use, and there are well organized systems for collecting and 
reporting information on morbidity and mortality, enforcement statistics, and in some provinces, 
sales of legal drugs.<P>
Nonetheless, there are a number of major gaps in the information available. There is little or no 
information regarding the typical dosages for street drugs, temporal patterns of alcohol and 
other drug use, or situational features of consumption. There is only anecdotal information on the 
availability of illicit drugs. Detailed information on diagnostic practices which may influence 
treatment data is sometimes lacking. The proportion of particular conditions which can be 
accurately attributed to alcohol or other drug use is often based on dated information or 
research from other countries. Furthermore, treatment data are limited to cases reported in the 
health care system, and thus do not include information on self-help groups.<P>
Partly due to these problems and partly due to a lack of consensus regarding appropriate cost 
estimation methodologies, information on the economic and social costs of alcohol, tobacco and 
other drug use is very limited. Without reliable, credible estimates of the costs of alcohol and 
other drugs to Canadian society, substance abuse may not receive the priority it should on the 
social and political agenda.<P>
<H3>Underlying dimensions of information gaps</H3>
There are a number of underlying reasons for these information gaps:<P>
STIGMATIZATION: Often in consideration of the need to reintegrate alcohol or drug 
dependent persons back into society, there is a tendency to diagnose alcohol or drug related 
problems in terms of the presenting problem rather than the underlying substance abuse 
problem. In the case of illicit drug use, the very fact that use is illegal makes users reluctant to 
seek treatment. And, of course, the illegal status of these drugs precludes the collection of 
reliable statistics on production and trade.<P>
INADEQUATE REPORTING SYSTEMS: Some of our information is inadequate due to 
deficiencies in reporting systems. Thus, for example, the provinces which have not adopted a 
triplicate prescription system. have less complete information on prescription drug use. Similarly, 
the statistics on alcohol- and drug related morbidity are limited to hospital-based treatment 
settings. Further, reporting systems sometimes fail to provide detailed information on 
classification criteria and the procedures used in collecting information. Routinely collected 
statistics can be strongly affected by changes in procedures ever though there may have been 
little or no change in the prevalence or incidence. For example, the introduction of breathalyzers 
influenced impaired driving statistics. The user of these statistics must be aware of the 
procedures by which the information is obtained, and alert to any technological advances or 
other changes which may influence the results. Perhaps most importantly, routinely collected 
statistics and surveys are limited in that they do not tap situational or interactional features of 
alcohol and other drug use. <P>
PREDOMINANT CONCEPTS REGARDING ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG 
PROBLEMS: Another reason underlying information gaps concerns how problem use is 
conceptualized. Changes have occurred in our concepts of dependence and their contribution to 
overall problem levels. Thirty years ago, the major alcohol problem was seen as "alcoholism"; it 
is now generally recognized that there are many problems associated with alcohol consumption 
well below levels associated with dependence. Similarly, the lack of data on dosage for illicit 
drug use stems in part from its legal status as criminal activity. Because it is illegal, any use IS 
viewed as a problem so detailed information on the pattern of use and dosage is often 
neglected. Even our notion of which substances should be included in a report on substance 
abuse is constantly changing.  Thirty years ago, this report would not have contained any 
information on tobacco use. We now know that tobacco accounts for more deaths than any 
other psychoactive substance. By the same token, this report does not include information on 
caffeine use; 30 years from now, it might do so.<P>
<H3>Implications for future research</H3>
Given these information gaps and their underlying causes, the following recommendations are 
offered for improving our information base:<P>
Improved Communication: There should be improved communication among research, 
treatment and enforcement specialists and organizations. The recent development of the CCSA 
National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse provides an electronic network of resources 
centres across Canada. Further expansion of this network should be promoted. Other means 
for improving communication were noted ell the report of an expert panel on substance abuse 
commissioned by the National Health Research Development Program: <P>
"Efforts should be directed toward establishing archives and data banks for maintaining, 
classifying and retrieving data from surveys and other studies concerning substance use and 
abuse. Such material can be used for secondary analysis, including meta-analytic research. To 
this end, and where applicable, computer-readable data sets should be required, along with the 
final report of funded studies.<P>
"Consideration should be given to establishing a community of Canadian researchers involved in 
the drug and alcohol field. Such a community may be created and maintained through various 
structures: regular or topical conferences and workshops; electronic networks; newsletters; or a 
scholarly journal. The federal and provincial governments should also consider the development 
of an inventory of existing data sources, researchers and research projects in the substance 
abuse field in Canada" (Andrews and Single, 1993: 2).<P>
EXPANSION OF RESEARCH DESIGNS: As noted at several points in this report, there is a 
need to consider a variety of data sources in order to obtain a complete picture of alcohol and 
other drug use in Canada. Man) of the information gaps will require nontraditional methods to 
supplement the aggregate statistics and survey data. Ethnographic, observational and 
nontraditional methods should be encouraged, particularly where there is a lack of basic 
description of the nature and extent of problems. Effects of natural events (i.e., major social 
changes) as well as "managed change" (i.e. changes in social policy) should be assessed, to 
make the information more policy relevant. There should also be special studies on unrecorded 
consumption of licit drugs such as alcohol and tobacco.<P>
ATTENTION TO SPECIAL POPULATIONS: There is a particularly need to obtain better 
information on the nature and extent of substance abuse in special population groups. In 
particular, special attention should be given to street youth, women, Aboriginal peoples, elderly 
and illicit drug users.<P>
For the next edition of the Canadian Profile, there are a number of initiatives currently underway 
that will generate new data. During 1994, the Federal government undertook the Canadian 
Alcohol and Other Drug Survey which will provide current data, not only on usage, but also 
public opinion on the social and policy issues associated with substance use. An initiative to 
more fully examine the costs to society from substance use and abuse is being coordinated by 
the CCSA. Initiatives are also underway to develop a network of groups that will monitor drug 
problem trends in Canada's major cities.<P>
The challenge for the future is clear. This volume will be updated periodically. It will be 
instructive to see whether and how our information on substance abuse improves in the 
future.<P>

<H1>Alcohol and Drug Use: Results from 
the 1993 General Social Survey</H1>
<H3>Report prepared for the Studies Unit, Health 
Promotion Directorate, Health Canada, January 1995</H3>
<B>by Eric W. Single, Joan M. Brewster, Patricia MacNeil, Jeffrey Hatcher, and Catherine 
Trainor</B><P><B>
</B><HR>
<H4>Highlights</H4>
<UL>
<LI>The proportion of Canadians who report drinking in the past twelve months decreased from 79.0% 
in the 1991 General Social Survey to 74.4% in 1993.  Levels of use among drinkers also continues to 
decline in Canada.  The portrait of the Canadian who is most likely to drink and drink heavily is that of a 
young adult male who is not married, relatively well-off, speaks English or French at home and rarely or 
never attends religious services.  Residents of the Prairies and British Columbia tend to drink less often 
and in lower quantities than other Canadians, but community size accounts for little variation in rates of 
drinking.
<LI>In a multivariate analysis of the combined impact of socio-demographic factors on drinking and 
drinking levels, it is found that the frequency of religious attendance and age are the strongest predictors 
of current drinking.  Language spoken at home, gender, income adequacy, education and employment 
status are also significantly related to drinking status.  Gender is the strongest predictor of volume of 
alcohol consumption.  The higher volume of consumption by males is not accounted for by other variables 
in the analysis.  The second strongest predictor of volume of consumption is religious attendance, 
followed by age, marital status and employment status.
<LI>Slightly less than one in ten Canadian drinkers (9.2%) report that drinking has had an adverse effect 
on their social life, physical health, happiness, home life or marriage, work, or finances in the past year.  
The most commonly reported problems were deleterious effects on physical health (5.1%), and effects on 
financial position (4.7%).  Approximately one in eight Canadian drinkers (12.9%) drove a car within an 
hour after consuming two or more drinks in the past year.
<LI>The portrait of the individual most likely to report a drinking problem is that of a young adult male, 
single or divorced, who is unemployed and/or has relatively low income.  In a multivariate analysis, age, 
marital status, gender, religious attendance and employment status are the strongest predictors of the 
likelihood that the individual has a problem with his or her drinking.
<LI>The number of heavy drinking occasions is a stronger predictor of drinking problems than overall 
level of consumption.  The likelihood of experiencing a drinking problem is greater for a moderate level 
drinker who occasionally drinks immoderately than for a high volume drinker who rarely or never 
consumes immoderately.
<LI>More than two of every five Canadians (43.9%) report that they have experienced some problem due 
to other people's drinking.  The problems most commonly reported are being disturbed by loud parties or 
other behaviour (23.8%), being insulted or humiliated by someone who had been drinking (20.9%), and 
having a serious argument or quarrel as a result of someone's drinking (15.6%).  The likelihood of 
reporting a problem as the result of someone else's drinking is approximately the same for men (45.5%) 
and women (42.5%).
<LI>With regard to use of licit drugs, 69.8% of Canadians report using aspirin in the month prior to the 
survey, 8.2% codeine, Demerol or morphine, 4.2% sleeping pills, 3.8% tranquilizers, 2.5% anti-
depressants and 0.6% diet pills.  Women are more likely than men to use aspirin.  The use of aspirin is 
also associated with higher income and education.  Women and the elderly are more likely to use 
tranquilizers, sleeping pills and anti-depressants.  The use of codeine, Demerol or morphine is particularly 
high among anglophone Canadians and among those who are not working due to illness.  In contrast to 
these pain killers, francophone Canadians are more likely to use tranquilizers and sleeping pills.
<LI>The most prevalent illicit drug is cannabis.  In 1993, 4.2% of Canadians report using marijuana in 
the past year, 0.3% report using cocaine, and 0.3% report using heroin, LSD, or speed.  The use of 
cannabis and other illicit drugs is strongly associated with being young, male and single.  British 
Columbians have the highest rates of illicit drug use.
<LI>A multivariate analysis of the combined impact of socio-demographic factors on cannabis use 
confirmed the findings that young males who are relatively unattached (i.e., single and not closely tied to 
religion) are the most likely to use cannabis.  The high rate of cannabis use in British Columbia is partly 
attenuated by taking socio-demographic factors into consideration.  The relatively high rate of cannabis 
use in Québec is largely explained by socio-demographic differences -- once these factors are taken into 
account, the predicted rate of cannabis use in Québec is the same as the national average.

<TITLE>University Student Drug Use and Lifestyle Behaviours</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H2>News Release</H2>
<H1>University Student Drug Use and 
Lifestyle Behaviours</H1>
<H4>Addiction Research Foundation</H4>
Toronto, February 2, 1995—About one-third of Ontario university students drink at a level that puts them 
at risk of health and other problems, according to a new study released today by the Addiction Research 
Foundation (ARF).<P>
The study, carried out in the fall of 1993, found that 31.1 per cent of undergraduate students consumed 15 
or more drinks per week on average.<P>
About 52 per cent of students also reported consuming five or more drinks at a single sitting in the week 
before the survey. First-year students, students living in residence and men tend to be the heaviest 
drinkers.<P>
More than 6,000 undergraduate students at six universities across the province replied to the survey.<P>
More than 15 per cent reported drinking between 15 and 28 drinks a week, and an additional 15.6 per 
cent reported drinking more than 28 drinks a week.<P>
"The levels of heavy drinking are a cause for concern," said Louis Gliksman, a scientist at ARF and one of 
the study's five authors. "Drinking at these levels puts people at a higher risk for problems."<P>
In fact, the survey shows a significant increase in problems related to alcohol since 1988. More students 
reported problems related to drinking, including hangovers, missing classes, lower grades, vomiting, 
memory loss, fighting, and trouble with the law. Students with D averages were 3.2 times more likely to 
drink 15 or more drinks a week than students with A averages. Ten per cent reported driving after several 
drinks, and 15 per cent reported cutting class after drinking in the two months prior to the Survey.<P>
Students also said they had experienced problems as a result of other people's drinking during the 12 
months prior to the survey. Forty-three per cent reported being insulted or humiliated, 24 per cent said 
they had been physically assaulted, and 38 per cent reported arguments. More than half of the students 
surveyed were in favor of more spot checks by campus police, more education programs and activities 
about alcohol, and not selling alcohol at campus sports events.<P>
The survey identified significant increases in the use of certain other drugs. In particular, the proportion 
of students using LSD has more than doubled since 1988, from 3.2 per cent to 7 per cent. Heroin use 
increased from 0.3 per cent in 1988 to 1.1 per cent in 1993. Use of anabolic steroids, which were almost 
unknown at the time of the first survey, increased from 0.6 per cent in 1988 to 1.5 per cent in 1993. Use of 
crack cocaine and prescription stimulants were also up. Over the same period, however, use of powdered 
cocaine, cannabis, non-prescription stimulants and prescription tranquillizers declined significantly.<P>
The study found that, between 1988 and 1993, despite overall alcohol consumption on campus remaining 
relatively stable, there has been an increase in the numbers of students drinking heavily. Neither of these 
findings are reflected in the general population. Other ARF studies have found that Ontario adults and 
high school students now drink less alcohol, and drink less frequently, than in previous years.<P>
The ARF study also found that students who live in university residences tend to be the heaviest drinkers. 
Students in off-campus housing drink less, and those who live with their parents drink the least.<P>
"This really speaks to the need to do something in the residence environment to educate students about 
responsible drinking," said Gliksman. Most universities hold workshops for residence dons about 
drinking, but more needs to be done, he said.<P>
The survey results are accurate within 1.2 per cent 19 times out of 20.<P>
The Addiction Research Foundation is an agency of the Province of Ontario.<P>

<TITLE>Drug Use in Metropolitan Toronto 1995;  Metro Toronto Research Group on Drug 
Use</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Drug Use in Metropolitan Toronto 
1995</H1>
<H3>Metro Toronto Research Group on Drug Use</H3>
<HR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<H3>Cocaine</H3>
<UL>
<I><LI>Overview:</I>  Survey, enforcement and mortality indicators remained relatively stable between 
1993 and 1994.  The most notable change occurred for treatment indicators.  The percentage seeking 
treatment for cocaine, primarily crack, increased from 19.8% in 1993 to 26.2% in 1994.
<LI>Crack cocaine remains the dominant drug in seizure activity, representing almost 40% of all drug 
seizures.  In contrast to crack, seizures of cocaine HCl remain at levels lower than those found pre-1990.
<LI>Thirty-two drug-factor deaths involved cocaine in 1993.  This represents a drop from the record 39 
deaths in 1992, although still relatively high for the period observed.  Seventy-five percent of these deaths 
also involved heroin.  <A HREF="/statsto2.htm">Figure 8</A>
<LI>Cocaine use among mainstream populations remains low, with less than 3% reporting its use.
<LI>The percentage of ARF clients seeking treatment for cocaine increased overall (from 19.8% in 1993 to 
26.2% in 1994) as well as among clients under 26 years (from 31.9% to 35.2%).  This increase is primarily 
attributable to crack cocaine.  <A HREF="/statsto1.htm">Figure 6</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Heroin</H3>
<UL>
<I><LI>Overview:</I>  Of all the drugs monitored, heroin showed the greatest changes between 1993 and 
1994.  Purity and mortality indicators remained stable but high.  Seizure and treatment indicators increased.
<LI>Sixty-three heroin related deaths occurred in 1993, surpassing the record high of 60 deaths in 1992.  
This observed peak in deaths is partly accounted for by the high purity levels of heroin observed during the 
corresponding period.  <A HREF="/statsto4.htm">Figure 14</A>
<LI>The average purity of heroin HC1 seized in 1994 remained high (68%).
<LI>Rates of heroin use among mainstream populations remain low, with under 2% reporting its use.
<LI>Although heroin seizures account for only 9% of all drug seizures, the amount seized increased almost 
400% between 1993 and 1994.
<LI>The percentage of ARF clients seeking treatment for narcotics (namely heroin) increased from 6.2% in 
1993 to 9.9% in 1994.  This increase was especially sizable among clients aged under 26 years, whose heroin 
problems increased from 9.0% to 14.7%.  <A HREF="/statsto3.htm">Figure 12</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Cannabis</H3>
<UL>
<LI>While survey, treatment, and mortality indicators for Metro remained stable, there are signs of 
increasing marijuana use.  Provincially there was an increase in reported use among grade 7 students in 
1993.  In addition there have been sizeable increases in quantities seized.  Information provided by 
enforcement officers confirms this perception of increased use.
<LI>Rates of cannabis use vary widely by population (9% of secondary school students, 10% of adults, 
23% of university students and 83% of street youth).  No substantial changes in use occurred.
<LI>Only 7 of the 161 drug-factor coroner cases had cannabis in their systems, and in none of these was 
cannabis lethally related.  <A HREF="/statsto6.htm">Figure 23</A>
<LI>The percentage of ARF clients citing cannabis as their major drug of choice remained stable between 
1993 and 1994 at 6%.  <A HREF="/statsto5.htm">Figure 21</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Sedative-Hypnotics &amp  Tranquillizers</H3>
<UL>
<I><LI>Overview:</I>  Survey and treatment data remained low and stable between 1993 and 1994; 
fatalities showed a small drop.  <A HREF="/statsto7.htm">Figure 24</A>
<LI>Although the number of sedative-hypnotic deaths dropped to 78 in 1993 from 86 in 1992, sedative-
hypnotic fatalities remain the most frequently found substance in coroner cases.  <A HREF="/statsto8.htm">Figure 25</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Hallucinogens</H3>
<UL>
<I><LI>Overview:</I>  All Metropolitan indicators remained stable between 1993 and 1994.  However, 
provincial surveys and qualitative police information suggest increased activity regarding LSD.
<LI>Use of LSD, the most widely used hallucinogen, remained low among mainstream populations (3% of 
secondary and 4% of university students).  However, LSD use among street youth populations is 
substantially higher, with 59% reporting use in 1992.
<LI>Seizures of LSD represent less than 1% of all drug seizures.
<LI>Hallucinogens were not commonly cited as a primary drug problem among treatment clients.  <A HREF="/statsto9.htm">Figure 28</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>HIV &amp  AIDS</H3>
<UL>
<LI>As of October 31, 1994, 7,018 reports of HIV infection and 2,414 cases of AIDS were reported to the City 
of Toronto Department of Public Health.  By far the highest risk category among those with AIDS was 
homosexual or bisexual behaviour among males, reported 91% (2,191) of these individuals.  Among this 
latter group, 90 had injected drugs in their lifetime.  Injection drug use as a sole risk factor was reported by 
49 people, or approximately two percent of all individuals diagnosed with AIDS.
<LI>As of January 9, 1995, Toronto's Needle Exchange Program had accommodated over 64,000 client visits.  
Over 600,000 used needles have been turned into The Works in less than four years of operation.  In 
addition, 9,800 kits for disinfecting needles have been distributed over this time period.  The relatively low 
risk associated with injection drug use among those with AIDS in Toronto may be due to the success of the 
needle exchange program.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Newborn Hospital Discharge Data</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The records of infants born in Metropolitan Toronto hospitals between 1986 and 1993 were searched 
for evidence of prenatal drug exposure.  Three categories of suspected drug induced damage were 
investigated:  (1) suspected damage to fetus from drugs, (2) noxious influences transmitted via placenta or 
breast milk, and (3) drug withdrawal syndrome in newborn of dependent mother.  For the eighth consecutive 
year, the total number of newborns diagnosed with problems of these types increased.

Rockville, Maryland 20857<P>
The Community Epidemiology Work Group (CEWG) is a network of researchers from major metropolitan 
areas of the United States and from selected foreign countries.  The CEWG meets semiannually with the 
primary objective of providing ongoing community-level public health surveillance of drug use and abuse, 
principally through collection and analysis of epidemiologic and ethnographic research data.  Through this 
program, the CEWG provides current descriptive and analytical information regarding the nature and 
patterns of drug abuse, emerging trends, and characteristics of vulnerable populations.<P>
All material in this volume is in the public domain and may be reproduced or copied without permission from 
the Institute or the authors.  Citation of the source is appreciated.  The data in Volume I (this volume) of this 
publication were extracted from 19 city drug abuse indicator trend reports whose full edited text appear in 
Volume II.  Volume II also contains the full edited text of reports on specialized topics and international 
reports.<P>
<HR>
<H1>Highlights</H1>
<H3>COCAINE AND CRACK</H3>
<B>Cocaine (including crack) remains the Nation's most serious drug problem.  
However, most indicator data are corroborating previous ethnographic observations: 
the epidemic appears to be leveling off or decreasing in many areas.</B><P>
Partial 1994 mortality figures were available in 10 CEWG cities:  compared with 1993 data, 
cocaine involvement in deaths appears level or declining in 7 of those cities and increasing in 
3.<P>
<A HREF="/totaled.gif">Similarly, cocaine ED rates declined or were stable between 1992 and 1993 in 13 of the 18 
CEWG cities in DAWN.</A>  However, cocaine remains the most frequently reported nonalcohol 
illicit drug ED mention in all but three CEWG cities in DAWN:  heroin is more frequently 
mentioned in Newark and San Francisco, and the two drugs are mentioned approximately equally 
in Seattle.  <A HREF="/cocained.gif">The highest population-based rates during 1993 occurred in New York, Detroit, 
Philadelphia, and Newark, and the lowest rate occurred in Minneapolis/St. Paul.</A>  Nationally, 
cocaine vastly outnumbered heroin in mentions per 100,000 population (53.8 versus 27.5).  In 
several CEWG cities, the cocaine-to-heroin ratios were strikingly high:  Atlanta (17:1), Miami 
(11:1), and New Orleans (8:1).<P>
Like the mortality and emergency indicators, rates of cocaine use among arrestees between 1992 
and 1993 were generally unchanged or decreased.<P>
In 10 of the 17 CEWG areas where treatment data were available, cocaine (including crack) as 
the primary drug of abuse accounts for the largest proportions of admissions (excluding alcohol-
only, but including alcohol-in-combination).  <P>
In all reporting cities, the vast majority of cocaine admissions report smoking the drug.  Mode of 
administration, however, is often correlated with gender, race/ethnicity, age, and other 
demographics.  Additionally, multisubstance use is often the norm, rather than the exception.<P>
Observational and indicator data suggest a generally aging population of cocaine users in most 
cities. For example, the largest populations comprising deaths, ED mentions, and treatment 
admissions fall into the oldest age groups.  Youth involvement remains confined largely to street 
sales, often involving gangs. <P>
Males generally continue to dominate the mortality, emergency, and treatment data;  females, 
however, account for the majority of cocaine admissions in Newark, Los Angeles, and San Diego, 
and they predominate at most arrestee urinalysis sites.  <P>
Cocaine remains readily available in all CEWG areas at both the distribution and street levels.  
Prices were either stable or down in virtually all areas.  The price of powdered cocaine ranges 
widely both within and across CEWG sites: the lowest gram prices are reported in Seattle ($30) 
Chicago ($35), and St. Louis ($36), and the highest prices are reported in New Orleans and 
Honolulu ($125 each) and Washington, DC ($120).  Crack prices also vary widely within and 
across CEWG cities.  In Detroit, for example, a rock of crack can range from $5 to $50.  Of cities 
that reported ounce prices, Los Angeles had the lowest prices ($425) and St. Louis had the 
highest ($1,500).<P>
<P>
<H3>HEROIN</H3>
<B>Negative consequences of heroin use continue to increase in most areas.  In 
several areas, ethnographic and epidemiologic sources suggest a new cohort of young 
users.</B><P>
Heroin-related mortality increased in seven of the nine areas where partial-1994 data were 
available.  <A HREF="/heroined.gif">Similarly, heroin ED rates increased between 1992 and 1993 in 13 of the 18 CEWG 
cities in DAWN;</A> they were relatively level in 2 cities (Phoenix and St. Louis); and they declined 
slightly in 2 cities (New Orleans and Washington, DC).  Only in San Diego did they decline 
sharply (by 28 percent).  Newark and San Francisco, followed by New York and Seattle, had the 
highest rates per 100,000 population in 1993.<P>
These increased consequences of heroin use may be the result of relatively low prices and high 
purity and availability of white heroin (mostly from Southeast and Southwest Asia and (more 
recently) from Colombia) in several CEWG areas, particularly in most northeastern cities and 
some midwestern areas (such as Chicago).  Lower purity black tar and brown heroin (from 
Mexico), however, still predominate in western areas.  But most indicators show increases even in 
those areas (except for DAWN data in San Diego).<P>
Increased consequences, however, are not yet reflected in arrestee use:  opiate-positive urinalyses 
remained largely unchanged from 1992 to 1993.<P>
With increased purity levels, intranasal use has continued to replace injection in many areas, such 
as Newark, New York City, Chicago, and Detroit.  Injection, however, remains the primary route 
of administration in the West.  Smoking is reported in some areas (such as Atlanta, Chicago, 
Minneapolis/St. Paul), especially among younger users, and often in combination or sequentially 
with crack.   For example, "primos" or "flamethrowers" (mixtures of heroin, cocaine, and tobacco 
that are smoked) are common in Chicago and among young African-American users in St. Louis.  
Other practices involving smoking crack and heroin include "chasing the dragon" (sequential use), 
as reported in Chicago and Miami, and "speedballing" (simultaneous use), as reported in Chicago 
(in other areas, "speedballing" refers to simultaneous injection). <P>
Along with the increased intranasal use and smoking, ethnographic observations and treatment 
demographics in several areas suggest that young people are increasingly initiating heroin use.  In 
Chicago, for example, admissions fall into a bimodal distribution of younger inhalers and older 
injectors.  Similarly, the 18-25 age group constitutes 10 percent or more of heroin admissions in 
Boston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Newark, New York City, and St. Louis.  Ethnographic data also 
indicate a new cohort of young users in Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, New Orleans, New York City, 
St. Louis, San Francisco, and Washington, DC.<P>
Males predominate in heroin mortality and treatment figures.  Women, however, are increasingly 
entering treatment for opiate abuse in many areas.  The proportion of women is particularly high in 
Newark, San Diego, and Minneapolis/St. Paul.<P>
Whites are predominant in heroin mortality figures, but treatment data indicate more diverse 
racial/ethnic distributions in different areas of the country.  Multiple ethnic groups are mentioned 
as major traffickers and distributors in an increasing number of CEWG areas, such as New York 
City, Boston, Detroit, Texas, and the Pacific Northwest.  In New York City, especially, rarely 
have so many groups been involved in the heroin trade.<P>
<P>
<H3>MARIJUANA</H3>
<B>Qualitative and quantitative data continue to indicate increasing marijuana use, 
especially among adolescents, across the country.</B><P>
<A HREF="/marijuan.gif">Marijuana ED mentions per 100,000 population increased in 13 of the 18 CEWG cities in DAWN 
between 1992 and 1993.</A>  The largest increases occurred in Detroit and Washington, DC.  Rates 
were highest in Detroit, Washington, DC, New Orleans, and Philadelphia; St. Louis had the lowest 
rate. <P>
Marijuana was reported as the primary drug of abuse by sizable proportions of non-alcohol 
treatment admissions in Honolulu, New Orleans, Seattle, and Texas. The proportions increased 
recently in Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New Orleans, New York City, St. Louis, Seattle, and 
Texas.  Young males constitute the majority of primary marijuana admissions in all areas.  <P>
Increased use by juveniles is especially evident in arrestee urinalysis:  juvenile marijuana rates 
generally increased between 1992 and 1993, particularly in St. Louis, San Antonio, and 
Washington, DC.  Marijuana now outranks cocaine for juveniles at every DUF site; for adult 
arrestees, it has now surpassed cocaine in Detroit, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego.<P>
The "blunt" phenomenon (gutted cigars refilled with marijuana) continues to spread to diverse 
parts of the country, including Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York City, Philadelphia, San 
Francisco, Texas, and Washington, DC.  In many cities, blunts involve other drugs, such as crack, 
PCP, or even embalming fluid.  Blunts are sold on the street in some areas; in other areas, users 
prefer to prepare their own mixtures.<P>
Large-scale domestic indoor growing operations are becoming increasingly problematic, 
contributing to both increased potency and supplies.<P>
<P>
<H3>STIMULANTS</H3>
<B>Abuse of stimulants, especially methamphetamine, is generally a regional 
phenomenon.  The most affected areas are in the West.  To a lesser extent, some rural 
midwestern and southeastern areas also have problems with abuse and trafficking.  
The Northeast remains largely unaffected.</B><P>
Methamphetamine-related mortality has increased in San Diego, Honolulu, Phoenix, and San 
Francisco; it is stable in Seattle (averaging one death per year).<P>
Methamphetamine has increased as a primary drug of abuse among treatment admissions in San 
Diego (where it is the foremost problem) and Honolulu (where it ranks a close second to 
marijuana).  Similarly, amphetamine/methamphetamine detections continue to increase among San 
Diego adult arrestees.<P>
Injection is the most common route of administration among methamphetamine admissions in San 
Francisco, while intranasal use and smoking are more common in Los Angeles and San 
Diego.<P>
Much of the methamphetamine reported in different areas (for example, Atlanta and New 
Orleans) is transported from Los Angeles or Texas by Mexican trafficking organizations, who also 
broker in precursor chemicals.  Clandestine labs, however, operate in other areas, such as 
Phoenix, Florida, and Missouri.  Availability and abuse of 3,4-methylene dioxymethamphetamine 
(MDMA or "ecstasy") is reported in Atlanta, Dallas, Honolulu, Miami, St. Louis, San Francisco, 
and Texas.<P>
The spread of methcathinone ("cat") labs appears centralized in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Indiana.  
The drug has been reported in Detroit treatment programs.<P>
<P>
<H3>HALLUCINOGENS</H3>
Qualitative data, supported by ED data, indicate increased use of <A HREF="/lsder.gif">LSD (possibly associated with 
the rave phenomenon)</A> and <A HREF="/pcper.gif">PCP (possibly associated with the blunt phenomenon)</A> among youth in 
many CEWG areas.<P>
Datura stramonium ("jimsonweed," also known as "locoweed" or "stinkweed") is a poisonous 
hallucinogenic plant the use of which may be increasing among young people in the Northeast 
(particularly New York and New Jersey), Canada, and areas of Texas.  Two deaths and 
numerous emergency department episodes were reported in El Paso, and about a dozen youth 
from a New Jersey high school were rushed to emergency departments after chewing the 
seeds.<P>
Qualitative information in Philadelphia indicates that increased use of phencyclidine (PCP) is 
associated with the growing use of blunts.  PCP is also easily obtained in most other CEWG 
areas. It is available in a variety of forms:  sprinkled on marijuana, mint leaves, or tobacco; as a 
liquid; or dipped and dried onto cigarettes.  <P>
Ethnographic, school, and hotline data indicate that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is reemerging 
as a drug of abuse <P>
among youth in several cities, including Atlanta, Detroit, Miami, and San Francisco.  It is 
frequently reported in connection with the "rave" scene.  The drug is readily available in most 
CEWG areas, and prices are declining in several.  The western part of the country appears to be 
a major source area for several cities, including Atlanta, New Orleans, and St. Louis.<P>
Two other hallucinogens increasingly used as "club drugs" are ketamine ("Special K"), which is 
reported in Miami and St. Louis, and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylalamine ("nexus"), which is 
reported in Atlanta.<P>
Hallucinogens are rarely reported as the primary substance of abuse by treatment admissions.  In 
many cities, however, they are notable secondary and tertiary drugs among younger 
admissions.<P>
<P>
<H3>OTHER DRUGS</H3>
Various cough and cold medications, in both prescription and nonprescription form, are reportedly 
overutilized, sold on the streets, or mentioned by treatment admissions in Minneapolis/St. Paul, 
Houston, Newark, and Phoenix.  Substances mentioned include dextromethorphan (DXN, a 
synthetic nonopioid), various forms of guaifenesin (Robitussin, known in Newark as "robo"), 
butorphanol tartrate (Stadol), and nalbuphine hydrochloride (Nubain).<P>
Abuse of inhalants and anabolic steroids is reported as a problem in Texas.<P>

<H1><BR><BR>De fête à cauchemar</H1>
<H3>Ce que vous devriez savoir quant à votre 
responsabilité si vous servez de l'alcool</H3>
<BR CLEAR=left>
<H4><BR>Votre fete, c'est votre responsabilité</H4>
Lorsque vous organisez une fête, vous souhaitez que vos invités s'amusent et qu'ils se 
détendent. Toutefois, quand l'alcool s'en mêle, la détente peut mener à des conséquences 
tragiques. Les gestes d'un invité en état d'ébriété risquent de causer des blessures et même 
la mort. Saviez-vous que vous pouvez en être tenu responsable que vous soyez un simple 
citoyen, un employeur, ou le propriétaire d'un débit de boisson? Vous pouvez être la cible 
d'une action en domrnages, sans même avoir servi une seule goutte d'alcool. <P>
<H4>Servir des clients en état d'ébriété</H4>
Plusieurs d'entre nous ont entendu parler d'un bar ou d'une brasserie qui a été la cible d'une 
action en dommages après qu'un client ivre eut quitté l'établissement et blessé ou tué 
quelqu'un à son retour à la maison. Les propriétaires de débits de boisson ont l'obligation 
légale de prévenir que leurs clients s'enivrent et d'arrêter de servir quiconque est en état 
d'ébriété. «Ce que plusieurs personnes ne savent pas, de dire Robert Salomon, professeur 
de droit à l'Université de Western Ontario, c'est que le même principe s'applique à nos 
propres invités chez-soi.»<P>
<H4>Perdre le contrôle</H4>
C'est ce qui est arrivé à Robert Fulton, en mai 1986, quand son fils a organisé une fête à la 
demeure familiale, près de London en Ontario. Un des 300 participants à la fête, Perry 
Meunier s'enivra et engagea un combat au terme duquel it devint quadriplégique. It intenta 
une action en dommages contre la famille Fulton, à titre d'occupant des lieux, pour avoir 
organisé un événement don't elle aurait dû connaître le caractère poteniellemen dangereux. 
D'ailleurs, ce n'tait pas la première fois que cette famille organisait une fête qui tournait au 
vinaigre. La société d'assurance des Fulton régla hors cour pour la somme de 700 000$, 
<I>malgré le fait que leur fils n'ait pas servi d'alcool ni lancé d'invitation formelle à ses 
invités.</I><P>
<H4>Se faire poursuivre par ses invités</H4>
Le cas Baumeister constitue un précédent dans les annales judiciaires au Canada puisque 
c'était la première fois qu'une personne était poursuivie en dommages par l'un des ses 
invités pour avoir servi de l'alcool. <P>
M. Baumeister est devenu quadriplégique lors d'un accident de la route survenu après une 
réception de graduation au domicile de la famille Carefoots. II engagea une action en 
dommages contre le conducteur du véhicule et la famille Carefoots. La cour décida qu'un 
hôte, tout comme un tenancier de bar, peut être tenu responsable d'avoir servi une 
personne intoxiquée qui s'inflige des blessures ou qui en inflige aux autres. Sa 
responsabilité peut être engagée à titre d'organisateur de l'événement, mais aussi en tant 
que l'occupant des lieux (une personne qui exerce le controle des lieux).<P>
<H4>Étendre la responsabilité légale</H4>
Commes les cas Baumeister et Meunier le démontrent, il existe une tendance d'étendre la 
responsabilité légale à quiconque sert de l'alcool ou est l'hôte d'un événement où les invités 
consomment des boissons alcooliques.<P>
<H4>Élargir la responsabilité légale</H4>
Comme le cas «Meunier» le démontre, le principe qui s'applique aux bars et aux brasseries 
s'applique également aux particuliers qui servent de l'alcool. Le professeur Solomon 
affirme: «La responsabilité de l'hôte s'applique tout autant aux réceptions de mariages, aux 
fêtes de bureaux, aux tournois de golf, aux piqueniques qu'aux réceptions privées. II est 
clair que la tendance est à responsabiliser celui qui sert de l'alcool ou l'hôte d'une 
célébration que l'on y serve ou non des boissons alcoolisées», ajoute le professeur 
Solomon. D'ailleurs, des actions en dommages ont été intentées à l'endroit d'universités, de 
clubs sociaux, de débits de boisson du gouvernement, de transporteurs, de policiers et de 
comrnanditaires d'événements.<P>
<H4>Pas de recettes miracles</H4>
Pour prévenir les risques de poursuites en dommages, plusieurs ont recours à des 
programmes de conducteurs désignés, d'autres à des clauses spéciales visant à dégager 
leurs responsabilités voire même des assurances pour couvrir ce type d'événement. Mais le 
docteur Solomon fait la mise en garde suivante: «cette approche isolée ne saurait 
remplacer une stratégie intégrée de minimisation des risques liés à l'alcool. Par exemple, 
même si les programmes de conducteurs désignés et autres politiques de transport peuvent 
mininiser les principaux resques associés à l'usage d'alcool et la conduite d'un véhicule, les 
hôtes peuvent en déduire faussement qu'ils sont autorisés à servir aux non conducteurs 
autant d'alcool qu'ils en désirent. Toutefois, si un invité en état d'ébriété fait une chute dans 
les escaliers, se bute contre une porte vitrée donnant sur le jardin ou engage un combat, 
l'hôte peut se voir contraint à verser des dommages.<P>
<H4>Ce que vous pouvez faire</H4>
Si vous exploitez un débit de boisson, vous pouvez réduire les risques de poursuite civile 
en mettant sur pied un programme de formation pour la gérance et les serveurs de 
l'établissement. Le personnel de l'établissement doit apprendre à reconnaître et à prévenir 
une intoxication par l'alcool ainsi que les problèmes que cela peut entraîner.<P>
Servir de la boisson chez-soi comporte également de sérieuses responsabilités mais 
rappelez-vous que vous avez le privilège de refuser l'accès à votre propriété si vous le 
jugez à propos.  Avec un peu de bon sens, vous éviterez des situations qui peuvent mener 
à des blessures et à des poursuites légales. Le professeur Solomon émet les conseils 
suivants : <P>
<I><B>Planifiez votre fête</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>Pensez à servir de la nourriture durant la fête.  Un invité moins de s'enivrer s'il a 
mangé.
<LI>Évitez de faire de la consommation d'alcool le coeur de l'événement.  
<LI>Si vous prévoyez servir de l'alcool, n'organisez pas d'activités qui pourraient mettre 
la vie de vos invités en danger, telles qu'une randonnée en bateau, une baignade ou une 
balade en ski ou en motoneige.
<LI>Une fête de moindre envergure est plus facile à diriger.  Un événement plus 
important nécessitera une plus grande planification et plus de supervision.
<LI>Prenez des dispositions à l'avance pour le transport des invités qui consomment.
<LI>Vérifiez l'état des lieux pour éliminer tout risque à la sécurité de vos invités.
</UL>
<I><B>Servez l'alcool de manière responsable</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>Offrez des boissons sans alcool ou à faible teneur en alcool.
<LI>Servez vous-même vos invités plutôt que de leur laisser le libre accès au bar.
<LI>Ne servez pas de «doubles» ou de boissons à forte teneur en alcool.
<LI>Cessez de servir de l'alcool quelques heures avant la fin de la fête.
</UL>
<I><B>Demeurez aux commaneds de l'événement</B></I><P>
<UL>
<LI>Soyez attentif au comportement des invités et soyez prêt à conseiller gentiment une 
personne qui montre des signes d'ivresse.
<LI>Ne tolérez pas de comprotements illégaux ou de jeux qui incitent à la consommation 
d'alcool.
<LI>Ne servez pas d'alcool à des personnes enivrées. Souvenez-vous, que du point du vue 
légal, ils peuvent avoir les facultés affaiblies san le paraître.
<LI>Prenez les arrangements nécessaires pour que les invité qui ont les facultés affaiblies 
retournement à la maison en toute sécurité ou alors, qu'ils passent la niut chez vous. On ne 
doit jamais laisser un ami conduite un véhicule en état d'ébriété

même et sur les autres tout en ayant du plaisir.</I></H3>

<STRONG>Au cours de l'année 1992-1993, cette direction s'est engagée à combler le fossé qui sépare la recherche de la 
politique et à rendre la recherche plus conforme aux besoins des groupes communautaires, des corps 
policiers et des dirigeants politiques.  <P>
<FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>Centre national de documentation</H2></FONT>
Le personnel consacre ses efforts dans deux domaines particuliers, soient:  la mise au point de nouveaux 
véhicules d'information et la prestation de services de renseignements.  En plus de maintenir le <A HREF="/csainf.htm">Réseau canadien d'information sur les toxicomanies (RCIT),</A> le Centre national de 
documentation doit faciliter l'accès à des réseaux d'information internationaux.<P>
<FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>Liaison et coordination</H2></FONT>
La direction de liaison et de coordination vise avant tout à favoriser le dialogue et les échanges parmi les 
partenaires associés au Centre, tant au Canada qu'à l'étranger.  Ce secteur a surtout fait porter son action dans 
les domaines suivants:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Questions relatives au monde du travail
<LI>Questions relatives aux jeunes
<LI>Questions relatives aux autochtones
</UL>
<FONT COLOR=#ffff00><H2>Communications</H2></FONT>
La direction des Communications est responsable du bulletin d'information intitulé <A HREF="/anfre.htm">Action Nouvelles,</A> qui est 
publié six fois par année.  De plus, elle est chargée de la publication de brochures, de livres et de rapports 
dans le domaine de l'alcoolisme et des autres toxicomanies.  La plupart des publications sont rédigées par le 
personnel du CCLAT ou par des chercheurs embauchés par le Centre pour faire de la recherche sur des 
sujets spécifiques.  Le personnel de l'Unité des Communications est aussi impliqués dans plusieurs autres projets qui ne sont 
pas reliés directement aux publications, tels que la transmission aux 
médias d'informations et d'énoncés de politique publique.</STRONG><P>

<HR>
Depuis sa création, il y a sept ans, le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a 
toujours poursuivi la mission dont l'a investi le Parlement, soit de contribuer au développement et à la 
mise en application des compétences et du savoir dans le domaine de la toxicomanie. Et bien que le 
CCLAT assume plusieurs rôles, c'est là, estimons-nous, sa principale raison d'être. Aussi comptons-nous, 
à long terme, mettre en oeuvre un système de connaissance en matière d'alcool et d'autres drogues.<P>
C'est dans cette optique que nous avons créé le Centre national de documentation sur les toxicomanies et 
lancé divers projets pour évaluer les coûts socio-économiques des méfaits des toxicomanies. C'est aussi 
pourquoi nous intervenons régulièrement pour favoriser la naissance de partenariats en information, tels 
le Réseau épidémiologique communautaire canadien sur la consommation de drogues et le Réseau 
d'information sur la toxicomanie en milieu de travail. Le fondement de notre activité est simple. Aucune 
décision avisée ne peut être prise au regard des politiques et des programmes concernant les toxicomanies 
sans une connaissance aiguë des problèmes nationaux en cause.<P>
Le présent rapport ne fournit qu'un bref survol de l'activité du CCLAT quant à la collecte, à la production 
et à la diffusion de l'information. Surtout quantitatif, il vise principalement à établir la part de la clientèle 
rejointe, ce qui représente une mesure initiale essentielle pour déterminer si nous avons véritablement 
servi cette clientèle. Nous avons en outre amorcé différentes démarches qui permettront d'évaluer cette 
réalité, effort dont il sera rendu compte dans nos futurs rapports annuels.<P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Publications - Action nouvelles</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><IMG SRC="/actnwww2.gif" WIDTH=720 HEIGHT=158 ALT="Action Nouvelles"><H3>Bulletin officiel du Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies</H3><H2>Important avis aux lecteurs d'<I>Action Nouvelles</H2></I>
Le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies a lancé <I>Action Nouvelles</I> il y a plus de six ans, dans le but de tenir informés tous ceux et celles qui s'intéressent à la prévention dans ce domaine. Malgré les innombrables coupures apportées, la production et la diffusion d'<I>Action Nouvelles</I> n'ont jamais été bon marché. Au départ diffusé gratuitement, il a plus tard été taxé d'un modeste coût d'abonnement en raison de la demande croissante, quoique la plupart des dépenses aient continué d'être imputées au <A HREF="/fundingf.htm#funding">budget principal du Centre</A>. Mais voilà que cette source de financement est aujourd'hui gravement compromise (<A HREF="/anlettef.htm">voir à ce sujet une lettre signée par Bill Deeks et Jacques LeCavalier</A>). C'est donc avec regret que nous avons décidé de mettre fin, avec le numéro 6 du volume VI, à la parution d'<I>Action Nouvelles</I> sous sa forme actuelle. Nous continuerons de publier une version abrégée d'<I>Action Nouvelles</I>, de forme analogue à celle reproduite ci-dessous.<P><P>
<HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=50%>

<FONT COLOR="0000FF"><H1>Action Nouvelles, Vol. VII n. 2, 1996</H1></FONT>

<H2>Un resserrement de l'effort national favorise 
la tenue d'une étude sur l'incidence du jeu au 
Canada</H2>
<B>Les pertes de jeu ont atteint une moyenne de 166 $ par personne au Canada en 
1995. Pour certaines familles, leur coût a été dévastateur. Un nouveau projet pourrait 
en réduire les méfaits.</B><P><B>
</B>Au Canada, bien que le jeu représente aujourd'hui une véritable mine d'or pour certains, il 
est par contre devenu un véritable cauchemar pour de nombreux adeptes de la loterie, du 
casino et des appareils de loterie vidéo. Prompts à embrasser cette forme de contribution fiscale 
volontaire, les gouvernements provinciaux ont raflé plus de 5 milliards de dollars en 1995 au seul 
titre des loteries.<P>
Les appareils de loterie vidéo qui, selon certains experts en toxicomanie, seraient aux joueurs ce 
que le crac est aux cocaïnomanes, poussent comme des champignons, y compris en Ontario, 
où l'on en comptera bientôt 20 000 de plus. Les casinos exploités par les gouvernements 
siphonnent les recettes des bingos de bienfaisance et gonflent les rangs des démunis fréquentant 
les soupes populaires.<P>
Certaines provinces commencent à réinvestir un mince pourcentage de leurs recettes de jeu 
dans la prévention et le traitement, et plusieurs organismes tels l'AADAC, commission albertaine 
antidrogue, s'empressent de préparer les professionnels en toxicomanie à faire face aux 
nouveaux problèmes.<P>
Cependant, les efforts dépensés en vue de comprendre et de traiter les joueurs compulsifs sont 
gravement compromis par le manque d'information sur la nature et la portée du problème. 
Contrairement à l'alcool et aux autres drogues, nous ne disposons pas encore de toutes les 
données voulues. Aussi, les méthodes servant à mesurer l'incidence du jeu compulsif manquent-
elles de rigueur. Le South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), instrument de mesure courant, a été 
élaboré pour fin d'étude clinique, et non pas pour la surveillance des populations en général.<P>
<H3>Actions concertées des provinces</H3>
La recherche de données plus fiables a suscité une collaboration nationale prometteuse. En 
août, à l'initiative de la Nouvelle-Ecosse, les représentants de neuf provinces se sont réunis en 
vidéoconférence pour discuter du jeu de hasard et d'une collaboration en vue de rassembler les 
données utiles sur l'incidence du jeu. Ils se sont de nouveau rencontrés le mois suivant à 
Winnipeg, à l'occasion de la conférence sur le jeu compulsif au Canada organisée par 
l'AADAC, le ministère de la Santé de la Saskatchewan, et la Fondation manitobaine de lutte 
contre les dépendances. Sur les 250 participants, 27 représentants de huit provinces ont 
accepté de poursuivre les discussions sur le projet d'étude de l'incidence du jeu compulsif au 
Canada.<P>
Le projet consistera à définir le jeu compulsif et les populations affectées sur la base de critères 
communs et d'une terminologie uniformisée, à déterminer les indicateurs de l'impact socioéco
nomique, puis à fournir aux provinces les données devant les guider dans l'utilisation judicieuse 
de leurs ressources. Les participants au projet sont reliés grâce à un serveur de liste Internet 
fourni par le CCLAT. Pour se renseigner sur le projet, contacter le CCLAT.   <P>

<H2>Que nous révèle l'ECAD sur le jeu de 
hasard?</H2>
Eric Single, adjoint de recherche au CCLAT, a rédigé le chapitre sur le jeu de hasard du 
rapport de l'Enquête canadienne sur l'alcool et les autres drogues, qui paraîtra sous peu. Les 
questions posées par les enquêteurs visaient à mesurer le jeu comme activité et non comme 
problème. Voici quelques-uns des résultats observés :<P>
<UL>
<LI>61,4 % des Canadiens de 15 ans et plus avaient joué à la loterie ou aux cartes pour de 
l'argent durant les douze mois précédents;
<LI>46,3 % des déclarants avaient joué à la loterie, parié aux sports, ou joué aux cartes pour 
de l'argent au moins une fois par mois;
<LI>14,8 % des répondants avaient joué au bingo, dont 7,7 % au moins une fois par mois;
<LI>8 % de ceux ayant parié à la loterie ou aux sports, ou joué aux cartes ou au bingo, avaient 
visité des endroits tels Las Vegas, Atlantic City ou des villes canadiennes pour y jouer au 
casino;
<LI> 6,8 % avaient participé à d'autres formes de jeu de hasard durant les douze mois 
précédents, dont les appareils de loterie vidéo (0,8 %) et les billets de divers tirages (0,7 %);
<LI> les hommes sont plus nombreux que les femmes à parier à la loterie (66,1 % contre 
59,4 %), mais les femmes plus nombreuses à jouer au bingo (18,5 % contre 8,25 %).

<H3>Une déclaration longuement attendue sur le 
SAF</H3>
Selon une déclaration conjointe sur le syndrome d'alcoolisme foetal (SAF) et les effets de 
l'alcool sur le foetus (EAF) émise par Santé Canada et la Société canadienne de pédiatrie, le 
SAF constitue la principale cause du retard du développement en Amérique du Nord, et «par 
mesure de prudence, les femmes qui sont enceintes ou qui pourraient le devenir devraient choisir 
de s'abstenir de boire». Il conviendrait cependant d'aviser les femmes qui auraient consommé de 
l'alcool en petites quantités ou de façon intermittente seulement durant leur grossesse, du fait que le 
risque couru dans leur cas est vraisemblablement minime.<P>
L'énoncé sur la prévention du SAF et des EAF a été élaboré et endossé par dix-neuf 
associations nationales représentant les médecins, les infirmiers, les sage-femmes, les 
Autochtones, les groupes multiculturels et d'autres organismes, dont le CCLAT, qui oeuvrent en matière de SAF. La déclaration, fruit de deux années de travail, soutient que la prévention doit surtout viser la famille, tenir compte des réalités culturelles, et être polyvalente. <P>

<H3>Colin s'envole vers l'ouest</H3>
Colin Mangham, auparavant de l'université Dalhousie en Nouvelle-Ecosse, devient directeur du 
nouveau BC Prevention Resource Service. La mission de ce dernier, qui remplace l'ancien BC 
Prevention Resource Centre, comprendra en outre l'usage des drogues par les personnes 
âgées et le tabac. On a demandé l'aide du CCLAT pour assurer une présence Internet.<P>
<H3>Les chefs de police préfèrent le traitement</H3>
D'après un article paru dans la Gazette de la GRC (Vol. 58, no 7-8, 1996), la majorité des 
chefs de police aux Etats-Unis considèrent l'abus des drogues comme le problème de criminalité 
le plus grave dans leurs communautés et réclament une refonte majeure des mesures correctives 
suivies jusqu'ici. Dans une étude de 1995, 60 % des chefs ont déclaré que l'effort policier avait 
échoué, mais la très grande majorité rejettent la décriminalisation des drogues.<P>
Les deux tiers des chefs croient que l'on fait fausse route en transférant les fonds fédéraux des 
programmes de prévention et de traitement à l'activité policière et à l'érection de prisons. La 
majorité soutiennent qu'il est difficile de trouver des programmes de traitement pour les 
contrevenants au sein de la communauté.<P>
<H3>Formation gratuite au Yukon</H3>
Grâce au génie d'une petite équipe de consultants en prévention des Alcohol and Drug Services 
(ADS), à Whitehorse, neuf membres du service ont pu bénéficier de trois jours de formation et 
de perfectionnement professionnel. On a aussi créé un nouveau réseau de professionnels alliés 
oeuvrant en mobilisation communautaire, sans frais pour l'ADS.<P>
Faute des fonds voulus pour suivre la formation en prévention et en mobilisation 
communautaire offerte par l'Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC), on a 
organisé la tenue d'un atelier de trois jours par l'AADAC en septembre, auquel on a convié les  
professionnels alliés, dont ceux de la justice et de la police, contre un droit d'inscription de 95 $. 
Neuf membres des ADS et trente-et-un professionnels des services connexes ont ainsi reçu la 
formation.<P>
Jocelyn Gauthier, consultant en prévention auprès des ADS, estime que l'organisme a non 
seulement recouvré le coût de la formation, mais a en outre bénéficié d'un nouveau réseau d'élé
ments intéressés à la mobilisation communautaire. Le fait de garder l'événement modeste et 
d'organiser un atelier plutôt qu'une conférence a permis de s'acquitter des tâches administratives 
sans personnel supplémentaire.<P>

<H2>La drogue remonte chez les jeunes en Amérique du Nord </H2>
<FONT SIZE=4>Les chiffres de 1993 à 1995 révèlent la première résurgence de la drogue chez les adolescents–héroïne comprise–en plus de dix ans. Personne ne sait la véritable cause, mais l'on soupçonne en partie les nouvelles priorités gouvernementales. </FONT><P>
Tout d'abord un fait réconfortant, la consommation des drogues illicites chez les jeunes au Canada et aux Etats-Unis demeure bien inférieure à celle de la fin des années 70. Ce sont les taux excessifs alors enregistrés qui avaient convaincu les Etats-Unis à déclarer la «guerre aux drogues» et le Canada à adopter, au milieu des années 80, la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue.<P>
Peut-être ne saurons-nous jamais exactement dans quelle mesure ces initiatives grassement financées ont contribué à réduire la consommation subséquente de drogues. Nous savons par contre que la consommation des drogues–et voilà un fait inquiétant–connaît une résurgence, et ce, au moment même où la volonté politique en matière de prévention, d'éducation et de traitement tend à s'estomper. Voici quelques preuves récentes de cette remontée :<P>
<UL>
<LI>La dernière édition de l'enquête sur la consommation de drogues chez les élèves de l'Ontario indique qu'entre 1993 et 1995, la consommation avait sensiblement augmenté pour 8 des 20 drogues à l'étude, tandis qu'elle n'avait reculé pour aucune des drogues. Pour la même période, on a observé une libéralisation des attitudes et de l'opinion face à l'usage des drogues, surtout de la marijuana.
<LI>Les drogues ayant accusé une forte hausse de consommation comprenaient notamment le cannabis (12,7 % à 22,7 %), la colle (1,6 % à 2,4–%), les méthamphétamines («speed») (2 % à 4,6 %), les hallucinogènes autres que le LSD ou le PCP (3,1 % à 7,6 %), le PCP (0,6 % à 1,7 %), la cocaïne (1,5 % à 2,4 %), et l'ecstasy (0,6 % à 1,8 %)
<LI>L'enquête a révélé une hausse alarmante de l'usage de l'héroïne chez les élèves de la 9e année, soit de 1,2 % à 2,2 %.
<LI>Le taux des élèves s'injectant des drogues est par ailleurs passé de 5,4 % en 1993 à 8,8 % en 1995.
<LI>Aux Etats-Unis, les estimations préliminaires de l'enquête-ménage de 1995 sur l'abus des drogues, publiées en août, révèlent une hausse du taux des adolescents (12 à 17 ans) consommateurs de drogues entre 1994 et 1995. En 1995, le taux (10,9 %) était deux fois plus élevé qu'en 1992.
<LI>D'importantes hausses de consommation ont été enregistrées pour la marijuana (6 % à 8,2 %), la cocaïne (0,3 % à 0,8 %), et les hallucinogènes (1,1 % à 1,7 %), entre 1994 et 1995.
</UL>
<H3>Méconnaissance du risque</H3>
<UL><LI>Un autre rapport américain, soit de la 21st Annual Monitoring the Future Study, fournit des résultats analogues pour les élèves des 8e, 10e, et 12e années, mais ajoute l'héroïne et les stimulants à la liste des drogues dont la consommation est à la hausse.
<LI>Le rapport souligne une perception plus mitigée du risque lié à la drogue et l'impression d'une plus grande disponibilité de ces dernières.
<LI>Selon des estimations préliminaires du US Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), parues en août, les hôpitaux ont enregistré un nombre supérieur des cas d'urgence reliés à la marijuana et au haschich chez les 12 à 17 ans et les 35 ans et plus, entre 1994 et 1995.
</UL>
Les autorités américaines s'attendent à d'autres mauvaises nouvelles concernant la marijuana. L'enquête-ménage de 1995 souligne que la baisse observée dans les années 80 quant à la fréquence de la consommation n'a commencé à se manifester que plusieurs années après le sommet de l'incidence (initiation). Cela laisse supposer qu'à moins de changements dans les facteurs influençant les habitudes, aucune diminution ne devrait prochainement marquer la fréquence de consommation, car le taux d'incidence est toujours à la hausse.<P>
Une dernière note de réflexion : «La récente remontée de la consommation des drogues illicites…a de fortes répercussions. Sur le plan prévention, il y a urgence évidente de s'occuper des enfants et des adolescents. A long terme, le nombre des nouveaux jeunes consommateurs à passer progressivement à la toxicomanie et à nécessiter de l'aide est tel que cette population créera sans doute d'énormes pressions sur le régime des services de traitement dans les années à venir.» <P>

<H3>La Chambre scrute la politique antidrogue</H3>
Le Comité permanent de la santé de la Chambre des communes débutera, en octobre, sa revue des politiques sur les stupéfiants, en mettant l'accent sur la réduction de la demande. Le Comité s'attardera aux questions d'éducation, de prévention, de traitement et de réadaptation, et ne prévoit pas rouvrir le débat sur la réduction de l'approvisionnement qui a marqué la longue étude parlementaire du Projet de loi C-8 (Loi réglementant certaines drogues et autres substances).<P>
Le Comité examinera l'impact des drogues licites et illicites sur le comportement social et la santé physique des Canadiens et évaluera les mesures de réduction de la demande adoptées dans le cadre de la Stratégie canadienne antidrogue depuis près de dix ans. Il déposera ses recommandations sur l'orientation future des politiques d'ici juin 1997.<P>

<H3>L'ACCP invite Ottawa à réitérer son engagement</H3>
Dans une résolution adoptée lors de son assemblée générale annuelle, en août, l'Association canadienne des chefs de police a vivement pressé le Gouvernement du Canada de réitérer son engagement d'assurer une «stratégie coordonnée et équilibrée, doublée des ressources pertinentes», permettant de traiter le trafic de la drogue et le blanchiment de fonds «en collaboration avec les programmes de santé, de justice, de prévention et de traitement».<P>
Dans une autre résolution, l'ACCP s'est opposée à la culture du chanvre à faible THC, «à moins que Santé Canada ne mette en place les règlements, les systèmes de contrôle, les procédures de sécurité et d'application de la loi qui s'imposent».<P>

<H3>Le CRTC relâche ses restrictions sur la publicité</H3>
Le Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des télécommunications canadiennes propose d'abolir le processus d'autorisation préalable de la publicité en faveur des boissons alcoolisées. Plutôt, il encourage l'industrie de la radio-diffusion à établir son propre processus. L'Association canadienne des radiodiffuseurs prendra en charge les autorisations.<P>
Le CRTC compte rayer de ses règlements les dispositions interdisant à certaines personnes de commanditer de la publicité en faveur de boissons alcoolisées. A l'heure actuelle, seuls les brasseurs, les distillateurs et les fabricants de vin ou de cidre y sont autorisés. Les règlements révisés accorderaient ce droit à tout détaillant dans la mesure où il se conforme au Code de la publicité radiodiffusée en faveur de boissons alcoolisées, lequel permettrait en théorie d'annoncer sur la base des prix.<P>
Le CRTC propose d'intégrer son Code aux règlements, mais ne fournit aucune explication sur son application après la fin de son engagement au regard du processus d'autorisation préalable. Une section d'interprétation est prévue, mais ne fera pas partie intégrante du Code.<P>
Le CRTC s'attend que les radio-diffuseurs redoublent leurs efforts pour informer le public des problèmes reliés à l'alcool et exigera que l'industrie en fasse un compte rendu annuel.<P>
On ignore quel test objectif le CRTC utilisera pour déterminer si la population a reçu une information équilibrée. Le CRTC refuse d'imposer un ratio de contre-publicité pour la publicité de marque.<P>

Canada</H3>
<H4>Eric Single, Anne MacLennan, and Patricia MacNeil</H4>
<H5>Une publication de recherche de l'Unité des études, de la Direction de 
la promotion de la santé, Santé Canada; et du Centre canadien de lutte contre 
l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies</H5><BR CLEAR=left>
<H3><BR>Sommaire</H3>
La Stratégie canadienne antidrogue a été lancée par le gouvernement fédéral en mai 1987, en 
collaboration avec les gouvernements des dix provinces et des deux territoires ainsi que de 
nombreux organismes non gouvernementaux. Les partenaires de la Stratégie ont pour objectif 
commun de réduire les méfaits de l'alcool et des autres drogues.<P>
<I>Horizons 1994: L'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues au Canada </I>est la 
première publication de recherche à paraître durant la seconde phase de la Stratégie, amorcée 
en 1992. Cette publication brosse l'un des tableaux les plus actuels et les plus complets qui soit 
des connaissances acquises sur l'alcool et les autres drogues et sur les problèmes de santé et de 
société connexes au Canada. Elle se penche également sur les travaux susceptibles de présenter 
un intérêt national, réalisés dans les provinces et les territoires auprès des populations à risque: 
les femmes; les Métis, les Inuit, et les autochtones vivant hors réserves; les jeunes en marge de 
la société; les aînés; et les conducteurs avec facultés affaiblies.<P>
<H5>Qui boit?</H5>
Les Canadiens sont aujourd'hui moins nombreux à consommer de l'alcool. Le taux des 15 ans 
et plus qui, lors des diverses enquêtes nationales, déclarent consommer de l'alcool, est passé de 
79,0 % lors de l'Enquête sociale générale de 1991 à 74,4 % lors de la même enquête en 1993. 
Cette même année, 18,0 % des participants ont déclaré avoir cessé de consommer et 7,7 %, 
n'en avoir jamais consommé. Les hommes sont plus susceptibles que les femmes d'en 
consommer (80,6 % contre 68,4 %) et les plus jeunes, davantage que les plus âgés (84,6 % 
des 20 à 24 ans contre 43,0 % des 65 ans et plus). Les sans emploi sont cependant moins 
nombreux que ceux qui ont un travail à déclarer en avoir consommé l'année avant l'enquête 
(75,2 % contre 82,7 %).<P>
<H5>Qui fume?</H5>
L'usage de la cigarette a reculé au cours des récentes années, mais 29 % des Canadiens de 15 
ans et plus fument encore régulièrement, les plus hauts taux revenant au Québec et à Terre-
Neuve (34 % et 32 % respectivement) et les plus bas, à l'Ontario et à la Colombie-Britannique 
(27 % et 26 %). Les premières analyses des données recueillies par Santé Canada depuis la 
récente diminution du prix des cigarettes indiquent une augmentation des fumeurs chez les 15 à 
19 ans, mais aucun changement de la quantité de tabac fumé.<P>
<H5>Les drogues licites</H5>
En 1993, plus de deux Canadiens de 15 ans et plus sur trois (69,8 %) ont déclaré avoir pris de 
l'aspirine au cours du mois avant l'enquête, les moins nombreux se trouvant au Québec (59,1 
%), et les plus nombreux dans les provinces de la Saskatchewan, de l'Île-du-Prince-Edouard et 
de la Nouvelle-Écosse (avec quelque 75,0 % chacune). Les drogues sur ordonnance les plus 
fréquemment utilisées sont les analgésiques narcotiques tels la codéine, le Démérol (mépéridine), 
et la morphine, les taux d'utilisation les plus élevés revenant à la Colombie-Britannique (12,4 %) 
et les plus bas au Québec (3,2 %). Quelque 4 % des 15 ans et plus, soit un sur vingt-cinq, ont 
déclaré faire usage des somnifères et 3,8 %, des tranquillisants. C'est au Québec que l'on 
déclare la plus grande utilisation de somnifères (6,1 %) et de tranquillisants (7,4 %).<P>
<H5>Les drogues illicites</H5>
En 1993, environ un million de Canadiens (4,2 %) de 15 ans et plus ont déclaré avoir utilisé de 
la marijuana au cours de l'année précédente; le plus haut taux revenant à la Colombie-
Britannique et le plus bas, à la Saskatchewan.<P>
<H5>Les populations à risque</H5>
Les données nationales sur les populations à risque sont insuffisantes et rarement comparables 
d'une région à l'autre, mais des gains sont néanmoins réalisés à ce chapitre, grâce aux divers 
projets de recherche et programmes en cours à travers le pays. Une revue, d'ouest en est, des 
travaux effectués dans les provinces et territoires met en relief certaines observations sur les 
populations à risque et fournit un aperçu des divers facteurs régionaux, soit sociaux, 
géographiques et historiques, qui contribuent à façonner la grande mosaïque des méfaits de 
l'alcool et des autres drogues au Canada.<P>
<H5>Problèmes et défis</H5>
La Stratégie antidrogue est complexe et riche en défis, mais on commence aujourd'hui à mieux 
cerner et à mieux saisir certains des obstacles à surmonter. Les chercheurs et les autres 
collaborateurs du présent ouvrage signalent maintes difficultés, celles notamment d'obtenir les 
données et de développer de nouveaux savoirs; de diffuser l'information aux personnes qui en 
ont besoin dans la langue et selon la présentation qui leur conviennent; de concilier les impératifs 
de recherche avec les exigences des décideurs; et pour ce qui est des intervenants et des 
responsables de programmes, de convertir les connaissances nouvelles et utiles en action 
communautaire. Bref, d'une meilleure compréhension des problèmes, naîtra le progrès.<P>

Même si l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues chez les aînés suscite un intérêt considérable, il 
existe relativement peu de données sur cette problématique. Le présent rapport résume certains 
des résultats les plus révélateurs et les plus intéressants fournis à ce jour par l'analyse des 
données d'enquête. II fait en même temps ressortir les lacunes qui marquent nos connaissances 
et propose diverses méthodes pour les combler.<P>
<H2>Principaux résultats à ce jour</H2>
<H3>L'alcool</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Comparativement aux populations plus jeunes, les aînés comptent moins de buveurs 
actuels, bien que l'alcool représente leur drogue de choix.
<LI>Les aînés déclarent prendre de l'alcool dans le but, principalement, d'être sociables. Les 
plus âgés d'entre eux consomment surtout à la maison ou avec des amis plutôt qu'avec des 
personnes d'autres groupes d'âge.
<LI>Les personnes des groupes âgés sont beaucoup moins susceptibles que les plus jeunes de 
déclarer des problèmes d'alcool.
</UL>
<H3>Le tabac</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Les aînés comptent en moyenne de 25 à 30 % de fumeurs chez les hommes et de 15 à 20 
% chez les femmes.
<LI>Les fumeurs plus âgés sont moins nombreux que les plus jeunes à exprimer le désir de 
cesser de fumer et à se soucier des problèmes de santé dus au tabac.
</UL>
<H3>Les médicaments</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Chez les deux sexes, l'usage des médicaments tend, même s'il n'est pas répandu, à croître 
avec l'âge. Dans l'ensemble, les femmes aînées consomment davantage de médicaments que 
leurs homologues masculins.
</UL>
<H3>Les drogues illicites</H3>
<UL>
<LI>L'usage des drogues illicites chez les aînés est extrêmement rare.

La présente publication est issue d'une étude menée par William McKim (Memorial University of Newfoundland), Brian Mishara (Université du Québec à Montréal) et Marc Eliany (anciennement de l'Unité des études de Santé Canada). Le personnel de l'Unité chargée de l'alcool et des autres drogues a coordonné un examen exhaustif du rapport provisoire et contribué à l'élaboration de la version définitive. Gordon Walsh (Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie de l'Ontario) et Ghislain Lafontaine (Santé Canada) ont participé à l'analyse des données de l'Enquête Promotion de la santé (1990) devant être inclues dans le présent rapport.<P>

<H2>Sommaire</H2>

<P>
L'usage de substances chez les femmes ne date pas d'hier. C'est
au 18e si&egrave;cle que l'on retrace la premi&egrave;re consommation
de drogues fortement document&eacute;e chez les femmes, alors
que le recours aux m&eacute;dicaments brevet&eacute;s &eacute;tait
largement r&eacute;pandu. Ces m&eacute;dicaments &eacute;taient
recommand&eacute;s aux femmes pour toutes sortes de raisons, allant
des sympt&ocirc;mes menstruels &agrave; l'angoisse. Ils contenaient
normalement de l'alcool et, dans certains cas, des opiac&eacute;s.
Selon quelques &eacute;tudes consacr&eacute;es aux opiac&eacute;s
vers 1880, les femmes &eacute;taient deux fois plus nombreuses
que les hommes &agrave; en consommer. Bien que la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
condamnait vivement l'usage de drogues et d'alcool en public par
les femmes, les m&eacute;decins continuaient de les prescrire
comme m&eacute;dicaments, usage g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement mieux
accept&eacute;.
<P>
On continue encore de nos jours &agrave; prescrire aux femmes
des m&eacute;dicaments pour les soulager de leurs sympt&ocirc;mes
f&eacute;minins. Et de leur c&ocirc;t&eacute;, les femmes continuent
de consulter les m&eacute;decins pour qu'ils traitent les sympt&ocirc;mes
qui les affectent. Mais de nombreux soignants n&eacute;gligent
de traiter les causes profondes, pr&eacute;f&eacute;rant traiter
les divers probl&egrave;mes &agrave; coups de tranquillisants
et d'autres m&eacute;dicaments. Plut&ocirc;t que de traiter le
mal directement &agrave; la source, on favorise le recours aux
produits chimiques.
<P>
Jusqu'au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1980, il &eacute;tait
difficile de d&eacute;terminer la pr&eacute;valence de la consommation
d'alcool et des autres drogues chez les femmes, puisque les questions
pos&eacute;es lors des enqu&ecirc;tes nationales n'&eacute;tablissaient
aucune distinction entre les sexes. Mais depuis 1980, les chercheurs
ont analys&eacute; plus syst&eacute;matiquement les &eacute;carts
entre les sexes, permettant ainsi de brosser un tableau plus exact
de la consommation des substance par les femmes.
<P>
Le pr&eacute;sent rapport r&eacute;sume certains des r&eacute;sultats
les plus significatifs et les plus int&eacute;ressants provenant
des r&eacute;centes enqu&ecirc;tes nationales. Il fait aussi ressortir
les lacunes de notre savoir actuel tout en proposant diverses
fa&ccedil;ons de les combler.
<H2>Principaux r&eacute;sultats &agrave; ce jour</H2>

<H3>L'alcool</H3>

<UL>
<LI>L'alcool constitue sans doute la drogue la plus populaire
aupr&egrave;s des femmes. Tous groupes d'&acirc;ge confondus,
les femmes sont moins nombreuses que les hommes &agrave; compter
parmi les buveurs actuels, elles boivent moins fr&eacute;quemment
et en plus petites quantit&eacute;s.
<LI>Les enqu&ecirc;tes des dix derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es
ont d&eacute;montr&eacute; que la proportion des femmes qui s'abstenaient
de boire r&eacute;gressait. Ce ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne s'explique
sans doute, du moins en partie, par le fait que l'usage de l'alcool
est aujourd'hui plus populaire aupr&egrave;s des jeunes femmes.
<LI>Les raisons le plus souvent &eacute;voqu&eacute;es par les
femmes pour cesser ou r&eacute;duire leur consommation d'alcool
sont la grossesse, les r&eacute;gimes ou les activit&eacute;s
sportives.
<LI>Pr&egrave;s d'un cinqui&egrave;me (19 %) des femmes de 20
&agrave; 24 ans avaient, &agrave; six reprises ou plus au cours
de l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, pris au moins cinq
consommations lors d'une m&ecirc;me occasion. Or, il est important
de pr&eacute;venir les malformations cong&eacute;nitales associ&eacute;es
&agrave; la consommation d'alcool durant la grossesse chez ce
groupe d'&acirc;ge.
<LI>Moins de femmes que d'hommes d&eacute;clarent des probl&egrave;mes
associ&eacute;s &agrave; l'alcool. Cela peut refl&eacute;ter le
manque de questions d'enqu&ecirc;te s'adressant sp&eacute;cifiquement
aux femmes ou la r&eacute;ticence de ces derni&egrave;res &agrave;
d&eacute;clarer leurs probl&egrave;mes.
</UL>

<H3>Le tabac</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Les plus hauts taux des fumeuses actuelles visent les 25 &agrave;
44 ans (34 %) et les 20 &agrave; 24 ans (31 %). Le plus bas taux
(13 %) revient aux 65 ans et plus.
<LI>L'usage du tabac a recul&eacute; pour l'ensemble de la population,
mais les taux observ&eacute;s quant aux femmes des plus jeunes
groupes ont par contre atteint, voire l&eacute;g&egrave;rement
d&eacute;pass&eacute;, ceux enregistr&eacute;s pour les groupes
masculins correspondants.
<LI>Chez les groupes d'&acirc;ge moyen, le taux des fumeuses approche
celui des fumours, ces derniers &eacute;tant plus nombreux que
les femmes &agrave; avoir cess&eacute; de fumer.
<LI>Le tabagisme durant la grossesse a &eacute;t&eacute; associ&eacute;
au faible poids des nouveau-n&eacute;s et &agrave; la hausse du
nombre des fausses couches.
</UL>

<H3>Les m&eacute;dicaments</H3>

<UL>
<LI>A l'exception de l'aspirine, des vitamines et de la cod&eacute;ine,
les femmes utilisent normalement peu de m&eacute;dicaments.
<LI>Les 45 ans et plus, dont surtout les 65 ans et plus, font
un usage relativement courant de m&eacute;dicaments pour le coeur
et la pression art&eacute;rielle. II en va sensiblement de m&ecirc;me
pour les somnif&egrave;res, mais avec des taux de consommation
inf&eacute;rieurs.
<LI>Le plus grand usage des m&eacute;dicaments dont font les a&icirc;n&eacute;es
pose des probl&egrave;mes particuliers en raison des risques qui
se rattachent &agrave; la combinaison de drogues multiples et
&agrave; leurs &eacute;ventuelles interactions.
<LI>La majorit&eacute; des m&eacute;dicaments d'ordonnance n'ont
pas &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s pour leurs effets sur la grossesse.
</UL>

<H3>Les drogues illicites</H3>

<UL>
<LI>A l'exception de la marijuana, les femmes font rarement un
usage permanent des drogues illicites. La consommation de ces
produits diminue en vieillissant pour dispara&icirc;tre presque
enti&egrave;rement apr&egrave;s 45 ans.
<LI>L'usage fr&eacute;quent de drogues telles la coca&iuml;ne,
le crack et les amph&eacute;tamines est sans doute plus courant
chez certains sous-groupes, notamment les femmes de la rue. Ces
sous-groupes &eacute;chappent aux enqu&ecirc;tes sur la population
en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.
<LI>Les effets des drogues illicites sur la grossesse demeurent
difficiles &agrave; d&eacute;terminer puisque la plupart des consommatrices
font aussi usage d'alcool et de tabac.
</UL>

<H2>Besoins de la recherche future</H2>

<P>
Jusqu'&agrave; ce jour, la recherche sur l'usage des substances
par les femmes s'est limit&eacute;e &agrave; l'examen du probl&egrave;me,
faisant abstraction de ses liens avec d'autres probl&egrave;mes
et ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes. Seule une recherche ax&eacute;e sur
la multiplicit&eacute; des facteurs interrelationnels tissant
la r&eacute;alit&eacute; des femmes pourrait sans doute fournir
la cl&eacute; qui permettra de comprendre leurs besoins et d'y
r&eacute;pondre.
<P>
Aussi exposons-nous dans la derni&egrave;re partie du pr&eacute;sent
rapport certaines des consid&eacute;rations particuli&egrave;res
qu'il conviendrait d'int&eacute;grer aux enqu&ecirc;tes sur l'usage
de l'alcool et des autres drogues chez les femmes. Nous terminons
par la recommandation d'une s&eacute;rie de questions sp&eacute;cifiques
qu'il y aurait peut-&ecirc;tre lieu d'utiliser lors des prochaines
enqu&ecirc;tes.<HR>

Au cours de 1993-1994, l'Unit&eacute; des &eacute;tudes de la
Direction g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des programmes et des services
de la sant&eacute; a command&eacute; une collection de rapports
de recherche sur la documentation et les donn&eacute;es d'enqu&ecirc;te
sur les populations &agrave; risque r&eacute;cemment publi&eacute;es.
 Le pr&eacute;sent rapport d&eacute;coule du rapport de recherche
intitul&eacute; &quot;Women and Substance Use in Canada&quot;,
de Virginia Carver (Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie
de l'Ontario) et Florence Andrews (Carleton University), pr&eacute;par&eacute;
sous la direction de Patricia MacNeil, de Sant&eacute; Canada.
<P>
Nous exprimons tout particuli&egrave;rement notre gratitude &agrave;
Diane Jacovella et aux autres membres de l'Unit&eacute; de l'alcool
et des autres drogues qui ont si soigneusement revu l'&eacute;preuve.
 Nous remercions &eacute;galement les nombreux analystes examinateurs,
dont Florence Andrews et Virginia Carver, de leurs pr&eacute;cieux
commentaires et suggestions.  Enfin, nous devons aussi la pr&eacute;sente
version aux judicieux conseils et r&eacute;visions de Dawn Fowler-Graham
et Ghislain Lafontaine, de l'Unit&eacute; des &eacute;tudes.

<H2>Sommaire</H2>

<P>
L'&eacute;valuation des probl&egrave;mes de l'alcoolisme et des
autres toxicomanies rev&ecirc;t une importante toute sp&eacute;ciale
puisqu'elle permet de cerner les probl&egrave;mes actuels et de
pr&eacute;voir les tendances et les probl&egrave;mes potentiels.
<P>
La consommation de l'alcool et des autres drogues chez les jeunes
&eacute;volue rapidement. Aussi constate-t-on chez eux, d&egrave;s
la prime adolescence, une diminution de la d&eacute;pendance psychique
et physique &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des parents et des autres
adultes, en m&ecirc;me temps qu'un renforcement de l'influence
des pairs. Durant les premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es de l'adolescence
toutefois, la famille continue d'exercer un contr&ocirc;le consid&eacute;rable,
mais susceptible cependant de s'opposer &agrave; l'influence des
pairs et &agrave; des situations o&ugrave; il perd toute validit&eacute;.
L'&eacute;valuation des contextes de consommation et de leur &eacute;volution
s'av&egrave;re donc essentielle si l'on veut arriver &agrave;
bien saisir les habitudes de consommation des jeunes.
<P>
Les probl&egrave;mes de l'alcoolisme et des autres toxicomanies
qui marquent les jeunes diff&egrave;rent de ceux observ&eacute;s
chez les adultes. En premier lieu, tout mineur qui ach&egrave;te
et consomme de l'alcool contrevient d'office &agrave; la loi.
En second lieu, les probl&egrave;mes de ces jeunes rev&ecirc;tent
le plus souvent un double aspect: d'une part ils consomment de
fortes quantit&eacute;s p&eacute;riodiquement plut&ocirc;t que
moyennement et r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement et, d'autre part, ils
&eacute;prouvent des maux aigus tels la naus&eacute;e et la perte
de coordination, et des situations difficiles tels les arguments
et les blessures corporelles, plut&ocirc;t que des probl&egrave;mes
de sant&eacute; chroniques et des ruptures familiales.
<P>
Le pr&eacute;sent rapport r&eacute;sume ceux des r&eacute;sultats
des r&eacute;centes &eacute;tudes canadiennes jug&eacute;s les
plus significatifs et les plus int&eacute;ressants au regard de
la consommation de l'alcool et des autres drogues chez les jeunes.
II souligne par ailleurs les lacunes de notre savoir actuel et
sugg&egrave;re divers moyens pour les corriger.
<H2>Principaux r&eacute;sultats &agrave; ce jour</H2>

<H3>L'alcool</H3>

<UL>
<LI>La drogue la plus fortement consomm&eacute;e par les jeunes
est l'alcool. Sa consommation augmente consid&eacute;rablement
jusque vers le milieu de la vingtaine.
<LI>La recherche des vingt derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es a le
plus souvent d&eacute;montr&eacute; une r&eacute;gression de la
consommation de l'alcool chez les jeunes, mais des facteurs indiqueraient
aujourd'hui un revirement de cette tendance, surtout chez les
&eacute;tudiants universitaires.
<LI>Les jeunes abstinentes sont plus nombreuses que les jeunes
abstinents. On ignore toutefois si l'abstinence d&eacute;clar&eacute;e
est permanente.
<LI>Le probl&egrave;me de boisson des jeunes Canadiens se traduit
souvent par une consommation peu fr&eacute;quente, mais &agrave;
quantit&eacute;s tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;es.
<LI>Les taux de consommation augmentent consid&eacute;rablement
avec l'&acirc;ge, mais tel n'est pas le cas des probl&egrave;mes
d&eacute;clar&eacute;s. Ceux-ci consistent normalement en maux
aigus, tels la naus&eacute;e et la gueule de bois, ou en probl&egrave;mes
de relations interpersonnelles avec les amis.
<LI>Les jeunes boivent surtout en compagnie des amis et g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement
dans les bars et les tavernes, malgr&eacute; les restrictions
de l'&acirc;ge l&eacute;gal.
</UL>

<H3>Le tabac</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Chez les moins de 20 ans, moins d'un cinqui&egrave;me fument
quotidiennement, et l'&eacute;cart entre les hommes et les femmes
est minime.
<LI>Les non-fumeurs sont plus nombreux que les non-fumeuses.
</UL>

<H3>Les m&eacute;dicaments</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Les jeunes consomment tr&egrave;s peu de m&eacute;dicaments.
<LI>Les deux genres de m&eacute;dicaments susceptibles de cr&eacute;er
une d&eacute;pendance les plus souvent d&eacute;clar&eacute;s
par les jeunes sont les amaigrisseurs ou les stimulants, ainsi
que la cod&eacute;ine, le D&eacute;m&eacute;rol ou la morphine.
</UL>

<H3>Les drogues illicites</H3>

<UL>
<LI>La drogue illicite la plus largement consomm&eacute;e est
le cannabis, plus d'un tiers des 15 &agrave; 24 ans en ayant d&eacute;j&agrave;
consomm&eacute;.
<LI>La consommation des autres drogues illicites est rare chez
les jeunes en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Des &eacute;tudes aupr&egrave;s
des jeunes de la rue ont cependant indiqu&eacute; un plus grand
usage de LSD parmi ce groupe.
</UL>

<H2>Besoins de la recherche future</H2>

<P>
Etant donn&eacute; que la consommation de l'alcool et des autres
drogues varie avec l'&acirc;ge, chaque groupe d'&acirc;ge pr&eacute;sente
des probl&egrave;mes uniques de conception d'enqu&ecirc;te et
d'analyse. En ce qui concerne les jeunes, les questions et les
probl&egrave;mes suivants sont particuli&egrave;rement pertinents.
<H3>L'&acirc;ge, ou la d&eacute;limitation des jeunes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Dans les grandes &eacute;tudes existantes, la d&eacute;limitation
des groupes d'&acirc;ge varie entre les 12 et 30 ans. Faute d'harmonisation
entre les groupes et les recoupements, il est tr&egrave;s difficile
de comparer les &eacute;tudes entre elles.
<LI>La jeunesse correspondant &agrave; une p&eacute;riode de rapide
transformation, toute &eacute;tude des rapports entre l'&acirc;ge
et les changements qui interviennent doit comporter un &eacute;chantillon
suffisamment large pour permettre une cat&eacute;gorisation la
plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;e possible.
<LI>L'&acirc;ge l&eacute;gal pour boire de l'alcool, diff&eacute;rent
d'une province &agrave; l'autre, constitue un facteur important
qu'il y aurait lieu de consid&eacute;rer au moment de cat&eacute;goriser
les &acirc;ges.
</UL>

<H3>L'&eacute;chantillonnoge</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Les jeunes les plus susceptibles d'&ecirc;tre affect&eacute;s
par la consommation de la drogue sont normalement exclus des &eacute;chantillons
des enqu&ecirc;tes nationales, puisqu'ils vivent dans les &eacute;tablissements,
dans la rue et dans les communaut&eacute;s autochtones.
<LI>Les enqu&ecirc;tes g&eacute;n&eacute;rales ne permettent pas
d'&eacute;valuer les probl&egrave;mes des jeunes les plus menac&eacute;s
par la drogue. L'adoption de m&eacute;thodes diff&eacute;rentes,
peut-&ecirc;tre plus qualitatives et plus intensives, s'impose.
</UL>

<H3>La mesure de la consommotion d'alcool</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Les habitudes de consommation variant consid&eacute;rablement
avec l'&acirc;ge, il convient d'accorder une attention particuli&egrave;re
&agrave; l'&eacute;valuation de la consommation d'alcool.
<LI>L'&eacute;valuation des jeunes devrait s'inspirer d'une conceptualisation
tridimensionnelle comme celle adopt&eacute;e pour la Yukon Alcohol
and Drug Survey.
</UL>

<H3>Les &eacute;tudes, l'&eacute;tat civil, et le revenu</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Ces variables pr&eacute;sentent des rapports fort valables
en ce qui concerne certaines mesures de la consommation de l'alcool
et des autres drogues, mais leur application n'est pas pertinente
&agrave; l'&eacute;tude des jeunes.
</UL>

<H3>Les contextes de consommation d'alcool chez les jeunes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Malgr&eacute; leur importance potentielle, les contextes de
consommation ont rarement &eacute;t&eacute; examin&eacute;s de
fa&ccedil;on syst&eacute;matique.
<LI>En ce qui concerne les jeunes, il convient de s'attarder tout
particuli&egrave;rement aux diff&eacute;rents aspects du contexte
de consommation, &agrave; la fr&eacute;quence d'enivrement, et
&agrave; la dur&eacute;e de la &#171;s&eacute;ance&#187; de consommation.
</UL>

<H3>Les cons&eacute;quences de la consommation de l'alcool</H3>

<UL>
<LI>On s'est peu int&eacute;ress&eacute; &agrave; ce jour aux
fonctions positives de la consommation de l'alcool. La majorit&eacute;
des gens commencent &agrave; consommer lors d'un &eacute;v&eacute;nement
social, aussi importe-t-il d'approfondir les aspects positifs
d'une telle activit&eacute;.
<LI>Les instruments et les &eacute;chelles utilis&eacute;s pour
mesurer la d&eacute;pendance &agrave; l'alcool chez les adultes
ne conviennent pas &agrave; l'&eacute;valuation des probl&egrave;mes
particuliers aux jeunes.
</UL>

<H3>Les dangers pour la sant&eacute;</H3>

<UL>
<LI>La recherche sur les jeunes et la consommation d'intoxicants
tend &agrave; ignorer les cons&eacute;quences biom&eacute;dicales
des consommations fr&eacute;quentes et importantes. II convient
&agrave; ce propos d'examiner attentivement le facteur nutrition.
<LI>Les &eacute;tudes ont constamment d&eacute;montr&eacute; qu'il
existait des rapports certains entre la consommation d'alcool,
l'activit&eacute; sexuelle et les relations sexuelles non prot&eacute;g&eacute;es.
Etant donn&eacute; que les jeunes sont en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
sexuellement actifs et susceptibles de boire de fortes quantit&eacute;s
d'alcool, il serait utile d'approfondir les rapports susmentionn&eacute;s.
</UL>

<H2>Questions d'enqu&ecirc;tes recommand&eacute;es</H2>

<P>
Nous pr&eacute;sentons dans cette derni&egrave;re partie du rapport
un vaste &eacute;ventail de questions jug&eacute;es utiles d'int&eacute;grer
dans les enqu&ecirc;tes consacr&eacute;es aux jeunes.

</I><H3>Introduction</H3>
La consommation de drogues et leur usage par injection peuvent entraîner de nombreux 
problèmes pour la personne, la collectivité et la société dans son ensemble. Le VIH a 
considérablement augmenté les méfaits directs associés à la prise de drogues par injection en 
particulier et les méfaits indirects associés à la consommation des drogues en général. Le VIH et 
les autres infections étant transmissibles lors du partage des aiguilles, des seringues et d'autre 
matériel souillés par les toxicomanes, ceux-ci se trouvent directement menacés. Aussi, puisque 
que la consommation des drogues en général suscite parfois des comportements à risque, 
notamment la pratique de rapports sexuels non protégés et l'injection non sécuritaire de 
drogues, la consommation d'alcool et d'autres drogues peuvent constituer une menace 
indirecte.<P>
La transmission du VIH chez les usagers de drogues a de profondes répercussions. Au Canada, 
comme dans de nombreux autres pays, sa transmission par les hétérosexuels est en partie 
imputable aux toxicomanes. La situation est d'autant plus grave si l'on considère que la majorité 
des toxicomanes qui s'injectent des drogues ont des partenaires sexuels qui eux ne se piquent 
pas. De plus, les femmes infectées par le VIH à cause de la consommation de drogues ou 
d'activités sexuelles avec un partenaire qui se pique risquent de donner naissance à des enfants 
aussi porteurs du virus.<P>
Selon l'expérience de plusieurs pays, dès lors que le virus atteint la population des usagers de 
drogues, le nombre des personnes infectées peut atteindre des sommets fulgurants si aucune 
mesure de prévention n'est prise. Les experts du monde entier reconnaissent l'urgence 
d'intensifier les efforts pour maintenir les taux d'infection en-deçà de 10 p. 100 chez ceux qui 
s'injectent des stupéfiants si l'on veut éviter que l'épidémie ne devienne explosive comme cela 
s'est produit dans plusieurs villes à travers le monde. A Édimbourg (Écosse), la séroprévalence 
chez les adeptes de l'injection est passée de 5 p. 100 en 1983 à 57 p. 100 en 1985 (Robertson 
et coll., 1986). A Bangkok (Thaïlande), les taux sont passés de 1 p. 100 en 1987 à 43 p. 100 
en 1988 (Berkelman et coll., 1989). Dans les deux cas, la croissance rapide des taux d'infection 
était surtout due au manque de matériel d'injection propre.<P>
Au Canada, les proportions des consommateurs de drogues par injection qui sont séropositifs 
varient entre 5 et 6 p. 100 à Vancouver, 6 et 8 p. 100 à Toronto, et 10 et 20 p. 100 à 
Montréal. Chez les détenus, les taux semblent refléter ceux observés pour la population 
générale des toxicomanes qui ont recours à l'injection. Une étude menée auprès des prisons 
provinciales de la Colombie-Britannique a révélé que 2,1 p. 100 des détenus ayant l'habitude 
de se piquer étaient séropositifs (Rothon, 1993). Selon une autre étude menée en Ontario cette 
fois, ce taux s'établissait à 3,8 p. 100 (Calzavara, 1993). Au Québec, les taux observés chez les 
détenus des prisons provinciales atteignaient 8 p. 100 chez les hommes et 13 p. 100 chez les 
femmes (Hankins et coll., 1991, 1994).<P>
I1 est donc urgent d'empêcher la croissance de la séropositivité chez les toxicomanes, leurs 
partenaires sexuels et les foetus. L'adoption de mesures préventives à l'intention de ces groupes 
devrait constituer une priorité dans tout le pays. Malgré tout, il demeure extrêmement difficile 
d'instaurer des programmes de prévention pour les toxicomanes. Marginalisés par la loi et la 
société, ces derniers s'avèrent peu faciles à joindre, tant au sens littéral que figuré. Aussi, vu 
certaines expériences plus ou moins heureuses qu'ils ont vécu avec les autorités, bon nombre 
d'entre eux ont tendance à se méfier des services mis à leur portée. Pour plusieurs, la nécessité 
de se prémunir contre le sida est de peu d'importance par rapport à la lutte quotidienne qu'ils 
doivent mener pour se nourrir, se procurer des stupéfiants, se trouver un abri, et échapper aux 
abus. Pour atteindre ces individus, les programmes doivent faire preuve d'une grande sensibilité, 
de neutralité, de polyvalence et d'ingéniosité. Les données concernant le Canada et plusieurs 
autres pays indiquent que les toxicomanes peuvent et s'efforcent effectivement de se protéger et 
de protéger les autres contre le VIH. Selon des études effectuées dans les villes dotées de 
programmes d'échange de seringues et d'autres programmes de réduction des méfaits, il est 
possible de freiner, voire même de stopper, la croissance de la séropositivité chez les 
toxicomanes ayant recours à l'injection.<P>
Trop souvent toutefois, les mesures préventives en place ne permettent pas de répondre à 
l'objectif établi, soit de réduire substantiellement, à long terme, la propagation du VIH chez les 
toxicomanes. II est important de mobiliser les consommateurs de drogues, leurs partenaires et 
ceux qui travaillent auprès d'eux, afin de les inciter à adopter des mesures de réduction des 
méfaits, notamment l'utilisation de seringues propres et de condoms. Les comportements à 
risque résultent souvent de raisons complexes liées aux attitudes, aux pressions et aux obstacles 
entretenus par la société. Seules la formation, la recherche et la coopération nous permettront 
de régler convenablement et humainement ce problème complexe et contraignant.<P>
En 1988, l'Organisation mondiale de la santé a désigné les toxicomanes comme groupe cible de 
mesures préventives contre la propagation du sida. La même année, le Conseil consultatif 
national sur le sida (CCN-SIDA) établissait un Groupe de travail sur l'infection au VIH et la 
consommation de drogues par injection, formé de représentants des secteurs du traitement des 
toxicomanes, de l'épidémiologie, et de la santé publique. Le groupe avait pour mission d'évaluer 
le taux de séropositivité chez les toxicomanes, de cerner les problèmes, et de présenter des 
recommandations pour l'élaboration de stratégies nationales afin de freiner la transmission du 
VIH par la consommation de drogues par injection au Canada.<P>
Vu l'inquiétude devant la propagation du VIH au Canada, au début de 1989, le Groupe de 
travail a recommandé la tenue d'un atelier national sur le sujet. Cet atelier, qui fut parrainé 
conjointement par le Centre fédéral sur le sida, Santé et Bien-être social Canada, le CCN-
SIDA et le programme d'éducation et d'information sur le sida de l'Association canadienne de 
santé publique, a permis de réunir pour la première fois au Canada les intervenants du secteur 
du sida et de la consommation de drogues par injection, afin qu'ils puissent partager de 
l'information et leurs expériences auprès des collectivités. Plus de cent vingt participants de 
multiples disciplines et affiliations provenant des diverses régions du pays ont assisté à la 
rencontre. Un rapport sur les Actes du Premier Atelier est disponible au Centre national de 
documentation sur le sida de l'Association canadienne de santé publique, à Ottawa.<P>
Le Groupe de travail du CCN-SIDA sur l'infection au VIH et la consommation de drogues par 
injection a, entre autres réalisations, publié les Principes et Recommandations concernant 
l'infection au VIH et la consommation de drogues par injection. Ce document avait pour but de 
"stimuler la discussion, remettre en question nos perceptions, et susciter la réflexion sur les 
politiques et les pratiques des organismes, des ministères, des municipalités, des hôpitaux, des 
services correctionnels, et des systèmes d'éducation, susceptibles de contribuer à propager 
l'infection au VIH, d'affecter la qualité des soins, ou d'être discriminatoires" (1993). Figurant 
dans les Actes du Premier Atelier, le document a servi de fondement aux discussions et aux 
recommandations du Deuxième Atelier national. Les participants de ce dernier avaient été 
invités à lire le document au préalable et à voir comment il pouvait inspirer le développement 
des stratégies et programmes nécessaires. On les avait encouragé à y apporter les ajouts ou les 
modifications jugés utiles à la lumière de leurs propres expériences et des récentes tendances. 
Les recommandations issues de cette démarche figurent dans le présent document.<P>
Dans les années qui ont suivi le Premier Atelier, la nature épidémique du VIH chez les 
toxicomanes s'est transformée parallèlement à notre compréhension du phénomène. Les efforts 
de réduction des méfaits étaient certes efficaces, mais il fallait de toute évidence utiliser des 
approches plus soutenues. Le centre de l'épidémie ne visait plus seulement les toxicomanes par 
injection, mais aussi les autres consommateurs, dont les consommateurs d'alcool, en raison des 
risques posés par l'usage des drogues et la pratique de rapports sexuels dangereux. Vu la 
nécessité de faire le point sur les connaissances acquises et de multiplier les mesures préventives 
au Canada, il a été décidé, en 1993, de tenir un deuxième atelier national.<P>
Le Deuxième Atelier national sur le VIH et l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues s'est tenu à 
Edmonton (Alberta), en février 1994. Il a été coparrainé par Santé Canada, le Centre canadien 
de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies, l'Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission 
et l'Alberta Health AIDS Program, et avait pour objectif général de contribuer à prévenir 
l'infection au VIH et ses conséquences, soit en diffusant les dernières données et les nouvelles 
stratégies pour freiner la transmission du VIH par la consommation de l'alcool et des autres 
drogues (licites et illicites). Les séances ont porté sur le développement de stratégies préventives 
efficaces, la création de nouveaux modèles et partenariats pour atteindre les groupes cibles, la 
prestation des soins et les interventions nécessaires.<P>
II avait comme objectifs spécifiques:<P>
<OL>
<LI>de revoir la recherche, ainsi que le développement des politiques et des programmes;
<LI>de rehausser le profil de certains thèmes retenus lors de séances spéciales consacrées, 
notamment, aux environnements à risque et aux populations cibles;
<LI>de prévoir une entente sur les stratégies efficaces, et d'encourager la création de 
partenariats en vue de réduire les méfaits.
</OL>
A l'instar du Premier Atelier, le Deuxième réunissait des participants de multiples disciplines et 
affiliations, y compris les groupes communautaires, organismes de santé publique, services de 
traitement, gouvernements, cliniques, et autres organismes de santé non gouvernementaux. Le 
nombre de représentants par région était fonction de la population de chaque province ou 
territoire. Toutes les mesures avaient été prises pour s'assurer que les collectivités plus petites et 
éloignées soient adéquatement représentées, de façon que l'information soit partagée par le plus 
grand nombre possible d'intéressés dans tout le pays.<P>
Les conférenciers, qui provenaient de nombreux services, disciplines, et groupes 
communautaires, regroupaient travailleurs de la rue, conseillers, administrateurs, agents de la 
police, avocats, analystes politiques et professionnels de la santé publique. Grâce à ces experts, 
les participants ont reçu une information précieuse et appris de nouvelles stratégies pour 
atteindre les toxicomanes et aider les individus, les familles et les collectivités à freiner le 
VIH.<P>
Ce deuxième atelier national a de nouveau permis aux intervenants du secteur de partager leurs 
expériences avec des collègues de tout le pays. Il a par ailleurs grandement contribué à 
améliorer les méthodes de prévention, en facilitant le partage des données et des compétences 
nécessaires pour réduire les méfaits de la drogue au Canada. Tous les participants y ont 
reconnu l'urgence d'agir. Il est essentiel, si nous voulons circonscrire la propagation du VIH, de 
maintenir et même d'intensifier les interventions préventives visant à freiner les méfaits de la 
drogue.<P>

<H2>Introduction et contexte</H2>
Ce rapport sur les points saillants résume les principales découvertes d'une étude 
approfondie sur les coûts socio-économiques et les dépenses de santé associés à la 
consommation de l'alcool, du tabac et des drogues illicites au Canada. Bien que l'impact 
de l'abus de substances dans une société soit une question d'une importance vitale, il 
existe très peu d'information faisant le lien avec des indicateurs économiques tel que 
le<B> </B>Produit intérieur brut. L'estimation des coûts associés, particulièrement aux 
drogues illicites, est semée d'embûches méthodologiques qui donnent des résultats 
dissemblables non seulement au Canada mais également dans plusieurs autres pays.<P>
Au mois de mai 1994, le Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies 
(CCLAT) a organisé un symposium international portant sur les coûts socio-économiques 
de l'abus de substances. La rencontre tenue à Banff en Alberta a réuni des économistes, 
des spécialistes du domaine des toxicomanies et des personnes responsables de 
l'élaboration de politiques de huit pays différents, de même que des représentants des 
différentes agences internationales. Le but de cette rencontre sans précédent était de 
développer un consensus sur des indicateurs internationaux  qui devaient permettre de 
mener une étude sur les coûts économiques. Les indicateurs de mesures qui en résultèrent 
reflètent un degré de consensus remarquable sur la façon de résoudre les nombreuses 
difficultés méthodologiques qui sont impliquées dans l'évaluation des coûts.<P>
Au mois d'octobre 1995, un deuxième symposium a eu lieu à Montebello au Québec afin 
d'analyser les résultats de tentatives initiales d'utilisation des lignes directrices relatives à 
l'estimation des coûts.  Des ajustements ont été apportés aux lignes directrices et le 
groupe procéda à des discussions visant à trouver des moyens pour faire la promotion du 
concept de l'étude, au plan international, à une plus grande communauté.<P>
<H3>Une étude canadienne sur les coûts</H3>
<H4><I>Le développement de lignes directrices fiables a permis 
d'ouvrir la voie à une première étude complète portant sur les coûts reliés 
à la toxicomanie au Canada</I></H4>
À notre connaissance, il n'y a eu aucune tentative antérieure visant à estimer les coûts 
globaux associés à l'utilisation et à l'abus de toutes les substances psychoactives au 
Canada. Différentes études ont porté sur les coûts individuels reliés à l'alcool, au tabac et 
aux drogues illicites utilisant différentes méthodologies et se basant à des degrés divers sur 
des postulats dont la valeur et la fiabilité sont incertaines. Les résultats sont souvent très 
différents. Dans ces circonstances, les responsables de l'élaboration de politiques et le 
public peuvent difficilement être blâmés s'ils considèrent l'estimation des coûts reliés à 
l'abus de substances avec scepticisme.<B> </B>Le développement de lignes directrices 
fiables a permis d'ouvrir la voie à une première étude complète portant sur les coûts reliés 
à la toxicomanie au Canada. Ce projet, en plus de tirer avantage de l'expertise et de 
l'expérience de chercheurs d'autres pays, implique la participation des agences 
provinciales qui procèdent à l'évaluation des coûts dans leur propre juridiction. Ce 
partenariat a pour but de favoriser entre les provinces des résultats comparables et éviter 
une duplication inutile des efforts consentis par chacun. Cette étude a été menée par une 
équipe de personnes représentant largement les secteurs reliés à l'étude des toxicomanies, 
aux coûts de la santé, à l'épidémiologie, à la criminologie, aux politiques sociales et à 
l'application des lois.  Ces experts ont travaillé sous la supervision d'un comité directeur 
composé de représentants du gouvernement, des agences de services pour toxicomanes, 
de l'industrie privée et du milieu universitaire.<P>
L'étude a débuté par une revue de la littérature sur la recherche portant sur l'estimation 
des coûts reliés à l'alcool, au tabac et aux drogues. Utilisant l'approche fondée sur les 
coûts de maladie, une liste détaillée des coûts à inclure a été élaborée et les systèmes de 
données ont été inventoriés afin d'identifier les informations pertinentes. En plus de 
l'estimation des coûts économiques reliés à l'abus de substances, l'étude tente de 
développer une estimation des coûts pour chaque province. Là où des données ne sont pas 
saisies provincialement, l'étude applique une proportion nationale des coûts de manière 
raisonnable.<P>
<H3>L'étendue de l'étude</H3>
<H4><I>Le donnée de 18,45 milliards, ou 2,7% du produit intérieur 
brut, représentant le coût total de l'abus de substances, est l'estimation la 
plus optimiste de ce coût.  Le coût réel est probablement significativement 
plus élevé</I></H4>
Le lecteur est avisé que les coûts reliés à la toxicomanie au Canada n'est pas une étude de 
l'impact budgétaire de l'alcool, du tabac et des autres drogues pour les gouvernements.  
Les coûts inclus dans cette étude sont reliés à l'ensemble de la société et non seulement 
aux comptes gouvernementaux.  Ce type d'étude est utile parce qu'il mesure l'impact 
budgétaire relié aux substances psychoactives, et donne une estimation pour plusieurs des 
dépenses que le gouvernement doit faire.  Toutefois, les coûts gouvernementaux 
n'incluent pas toutes les pertes subies par la communauté.  De plus, la notion de l'impact 
budgétaire inclut les considérations des revenus et autres bénéfices du gouvernement qui 
ne font pas partie de cette étude.  Même si cette étude donne une quantité d'informations 
nouvelles et utiles,  elle ne devrait pas être confondue avec une analyse coût et bénéfice de 
mesures prises pour réduire les méfaits associés à l'abus de substances.  Elle permet de 
faire un pas de géant face à la possibilité de réaliser une telle analyse, mais beaucoup plus 
de travail est nécessaire pour concrétiser une telle éventualité.  Ayant établi de façon 
satisfaisante les coûts associés à la toxicomanie, nous devons maintenant calculer quelle 
partie de ces coûts est raisonnablement évitable.  La prochaine étape consiste à déterminer 
là où nous devons investir pour éviter ces coûts.  Enfin, nous devons procéder à un 
monitoring afin de suivre les résultats de notre investissement.  Seulement alors pourrons-
nous déterminer si les politiques et les programmes reliés à l'abus de substances sont 
justifiés par les bénéfices qu'ils produisent.  C'est de ce type d'informations dont les 
dirigeants ont besoin pour déterminer comment utiliser les rarissimes ressources.  Dans les 
mois et les années à venir, le CCLAT sera à la recherche de support soutenu de la 
communauté afin de rendre cette information rapidement accessible. <P>
Les auteurs de cette étude ont pris une approche conservatrice pour estimer les coûts de la 
toxicomanie.  Là où les données sont incomplètes ou que les sources alternatives donnent 
des résultats différents, les estimations les moins élevées sont généralement utilisées.  De 
plus, des données sont complètement manquantes pour certaines composantes reliées aux 
coûts tels que, par exemple, les crimes contre la propriété reliés aux drogues illicites.  En 
conséquence, la donnée de 18,45 milliards, ou 2,7 % du Produit intérieur brut, 
représentant le coût total de l'abus de substances au Canada, est l'estimation la plus 
optimiste de ce coût.  Le coût réel est probablement plus élevé et pourrait être 
significativement plus élevé.<P>
<H2>Définition des coûts</H2>
Les coûts dans cette étude sont définis en rapport avec le concept de l'utilisation 
alternative des ressources rares, ou le coût de renonciation.  Sauf certaines exceptions, la 
majeure partie des coûts directs sont les coûts tangibles, les coûts externes de l'abus de 
substances; c'est-à-dire, les coûts encourus par les personnes autres que l'abuseur, 
incluant la famille de ce dernier.  Même si certains coûts internes mineurs sont inclus dans 
les études reliées à la maladie (tels que les coûts privés des médicaments pour fins de 
traitement, ou les coûts reliés aux dommages à la propriété dûs aux accidents de la route à 
cause de l'alcool), dans le contexte canadien la majeure partie des coûts pris en compte 
sont externes.  Les coûts d'achat pour l'alcool, le tabac et les drogues illicites par les 
utilisateurs ne sont pas inclus.  Les transferts de paiements, tels que les prestations de 
bien-être aux personnes handicapées par l'abus de substances, ne sont pas davantage 
inclus dans les coûts (toutefois sont inclus les coûts administratifs).<P>
<H3>Concentrer sur les coûts bruts </H3>
Comme ceci n'est pas une étude coût et bénéfice, nous référons généralement aux coûts 
globaux plutôt qu'aux coûts nets de la toxicomanie.  L'utilisation de l'alcool, du tabac et 
des drogues illicites implique des bénéfices de même que des coûts.  Dans certaines 
circonstances, l'utilisation des substances psychoactives particulières résultera, à la fois en 
une augmentation et en une diminution de  l'incidence d'une conséquence négative.  Par 
exemple, l'utilisation de l'alcool est associée à la baisse des maladies du coeur lorsque 
consommé à des niveaux peu élevés.  En effet, le nombre net de décès dûs aux maladies 
cardio-vasculaires du coeur attribuable à l'alcool est négatif; c'est-à-dire que l'alcool 
prévient davantage qu'il ne cause la mort.  Toutefois, ceci réconforte peu les familles des 
personnes qui sont décédées suite à l'abus d'alcool. <P>
Dans les cas de décès et de maladies où une substance psychoactive est associée à la fois 
aux effets positifs et négatifs, nous ne soustrayons pas le nombre de cas où l'alcool a eu un 
effet préventif du nombre total attribué à l'alcool. Nous présentons plutôt les données 
brutes dans les tableaux sur les coûts.  Ceci est fait afin d'éviter que l'estimation des coûts 
de l'alcool, du tabac et des drogues illicites soit contaminée par des considérations 
partiales reliées aux bénéfices.  La question est: lorsque vous commencez à prendre en 
compte les bénéfices, où vous arrêtez-vous?  Dans les cas de maladies où l'utilisation de 
l'alcool, du tabac ou des drogues illicites ont des effets à la fois bénéfiques et négatifs, 
l'étude présente le nombre de cas qui ont bénéficié de l'effet préventif d'une substance 
particulière, de façon à ce que des comparaisons puissent être faites avec les résultats des 
études qui rapportent les coûts nets plutôt que les coûts bruts<B> </B>(par exemple, 
Collins et Lapsley, 1991).<P>
<H4><I>L'estimation des coûts économiques dans cette étude 
n'indique pas nécessairement le montant d'argent et le nombre d'années 
de vie qui pourraient de façon réaliste être sauvés comme résultat de 
programmes et de politiques sociales</I></H4>
<H3>Les coûts intangibles</H3>
Les coûts intangibles sont considérés très significatifs même s'ils ne peuvent être estimés 
en dollars.  Les coûts intangibles majeurs dûs aux substances sont causés par le décès, la 
douleur, la souffrance et le deuil.  Même si l'étude n'inclut pas la valeur en dollars pour les 
aspects intangibles du nombre d'années de vie perdues dû à l'abus de substances, l'étude 
estime tout de même le nombre d'années de vie perdues pour chaque type de substances.  
Ceci permettra l'estimation de ces coûts en dollars, en utilisant la méthode d'evaluation 
fondée sur la volonté de payer. <P>
<H3>Coûts des allocations de bien-être</H3>
En traitant les coûts des allocations de bien-être attribuables à l'abus de drogues, on prend 
soin de distinguer entre les coûts réels de l'abus en termes de ressources (les coûts 
administratifs pour les cas d'aide sociale reliés à l'abus de substances) et les coûts qui sont 
simplement des transferts de paiements.  Les coûts des allocations de bien-être impliquent 
les paiements faits par l'État (tels que les pensions aux invalides et les bénéfices pour 
maladies). Il est particulièrement important de s'assurer que les coûts ou les bénéfices ne 
sont pas comptabilisés deux fois.  Si une personne antérieurement au travail reçoit des 
prestations suite à une maladie reliée à l'abus, elle serait doublement comptabilisée si elle 
était inclue dans les estimations des coûts externes de la perte de productivité.  Ainsi, les 
seuls coûts de prestations de bien-être inclus dans cette étude sont les coûts 
administratifs.<P>
<H3>Décès et maladie hors du marché du travail</H3>
Cette étude assume que les personnes en âge de travailler qui ne sont pas au travail (c'est-
à-dire employé ou cherchant du travail) produisent des services privés pour le reste de la 
communauté.  Ceci implique que la maladie ou le décès de ce type de personnes aura pour 
résultat le retrait d'autres personnes du milieu de travail afin de suppléer aux services 
antérieurement rendus par ces personnes.  Par exemple, le décès d'une mère qui n'est pas 
sur le marché du travail ayant des enfants d'âge scolaire signifie que les enfants devront 
être assumés par quelqu'un d'autre qui à son tour ne sera pas disponible pour travailler.  
La valeur de la perte de production due à la maladie ou au décès de personnes en âge de 
travailler et n'étant pas au travail est estimée par Statistique Canada pour la valeur d'une 
personne travaillant à la maison d'âge et de sexe similaire.<P>
<H3>Coût reliés aux politiques</H3>
Certains coûts clairement attribuables à l'utilisation de substances sont le résultat de 
décisions publiques de réduire l'abus plutôt que les effets directs de l'utilisation de 
substances.  Les coûts dans cette catégorie incluent les dépenses de recherches, les 
campagnes d'éducation publique et les programmes sur l'application des lois.  Ces coûts 
sont discrétionnaires en ce sens que les gouvernements pourraient choisir de ne pas 
engager ceux-ci.  Vraisemblablement, la réduction de telles dépenses conduirait à une 
augmentation des coûts directs de l'utilisation de substances mais ces dépenses, elles-
mêmes, ne sont pas des coûts directs.  Dans cette étude ces coûts sont inclus, mais 
catégorisés comme «coûts reliés aux politiques». De cette façon, les coûts sont identifiés 
comme étant en relation avec l'utilisation de substances, mais ne sont pas classifiés comme 
des coûts inévitables.<P>
<H3>Estimation des coûts évitables</H3>
L'estimation des coûts économiques dans cette étude n'indique pas nécessairement le 
montant d'argent et le nombre d'années de vie qui pourraient de façon réaliste être sauvés 
comme résultat de programmes et de politiques sociales effectives provenant du 
gouvernement.  Le scénario alternatif dans cette étude en est un où il n'y a aucun 
problème associé avec l'utilisation de substances psychoactives.  Cette situation est 
hypothétique et généralement impossible en toute circonstance.  L'estimation des coûts 
inclus à la fois des coûts évitables et inévitables. Même si des politiques totalement 
effectives pourraient être trouvées avec aucun coût pour les programmes de renforcement 
des lois, de traitement et de prévention, leur implantation ne serait pas instantanée et il y 
aurait tout de même des conséquences négatives de l'utilisation antérieure des substances 
psychoactives.<P><B>

associés à l'abus de substances</H2>
<H4><I>La mortalité résultant de l'utilisation de drogues illicites peut 
être relativement peu fréquente en comparaison des décès reliés à l'usage 
de l'alcool et du tabac, mais les décès reliés aux drogues illicites tendent à 
impliquer de plus jeunes victimes</I></H4>
<H3>Alcool</H3>
Il est estimé que 6 701 Canadiens ont perdu la vie suite à la consommation d'alcool en 
1992. Le plus grand nombre de décès reliés à l'alcool provient des accidents des personnes 
en état d'ébriété.  Il est estimée que 1 021 hommes canadiens et  456 femmes sont décédés 
dans les accidents d'autos dûs à l'abus d'alcool.  Les cirrhoses du foie ont fait 960 décès 
et il y a eu 908 suicides reliés à l'alcool.  Plusieurs de ces décès ont impliqué de jeunes 
personnes.  Dû à l'incidence relativement élevée des accidents mortels et des suicides 
reliés à l'alcool, le nombre potentiel de perte d'années de vie est relativement élevée avec  
186 257 années  (134 495 années pour les hommes et  51 762 années pour les femmes). 
Ceci représente 27,8 années pour chaque décès relié à l'alcool.  Les décès reliés aux 
accidents d'autos représentent  22 % de tous les décès reliés à l'alcool et 33 % de la perte 
d'années potentielles de vie—une indication de l'âge relativement jeune pour les fatalités 
de la circulation reliées à l'alcool.<P>
En regard de la morbidité (maladie) reliée à l'alcool, il est estimé qu'il y a eu 86 076 
hospitalisations en 1992 (56 474 hommes et 29 602 femmes). Ces personnes ont utilisé un 
total de 1 149 106 jours d'hospitalisation (755 205 pour les hommes et 393 902 pour les 
femmes). Le plus grand nombre d'hospitalisations reliées à l'alcool est dû à des chutes 
accidentelles (16 901), au syndrome de la dépendance alcoolique (14 316) et aux accidents 
de véhicules à moteur (11 154). Le plus grand nombre de jours d'hospitalisation est 
attribuable aux chutes accidentelles (308 224 jours). Ainsi, les chutes accidentelles ont 
compté pour 6 % des décès, 20 % des hospitalisations et 27 % des jours passés à l'hôpital 
à cause de l'alcool.  Par contre, les accidents de véhicules à moteur associés à l'alcool ont 
compté pour 22 % des décès, mais seulement 13 % des hospitalisations et 12 % des jours 
en milieu hospitalier.<P>
<H3>Tabac</H3>
Le nombre total de décès reliés au tabac au Canada est estimé à 33 498 en 1992.  Le plus 
grand nombre de décès reliés au tabac (11 704) provient du cancer du poumon, 
représentant 35 % de tous ces décès.  Les maladies cardiaques ischémiques reliées au 
tabac totalisent 6 762 décès et les maladies pulmonaires obstructives chroniques<B> 
</B>comptent 5 816 décès. Plus des deux tiers (69 %) de ceux qui décèdent des causes 
reliées au tabac au Canada sont des hommes.  Il y a eu 208 095 hospitalisations reliées au 
tabac au Canada en 1992.  Le plus grand nombre a été pour les maladies cardiaques 
ischémiques (37 648 hospitalisations pour les hommes et 14 363 pour les femmes).  Il y a 
eu l'utilisation de plus de trois millions de jours en milieu hospitalier (3 024 265) résultant 
des conséquences en lien avec le tabac.  Le plus grand nombre de jours en milieu 
hospitalier a été utilisé par les personnes ayant une maladie pulmonaire obstructive 
chronique (630 282 jours ou 21 % du total dû au tabac), ayant subi un arrêt cardiaque 
(570 289 jours ou 19 %), ayant une maladie cardiaque ischémique<B> </B> (450 795 
jours ou 15 %) et ayant développé un cancer du poumon (423 239 jours ou 14 %). <P>
<H3>Drogues illicites</H3>
Le nombre total de décès reliés aux drogues illicites au Canada est estimé à 732 en 1992.  
La très grande majorité (88 %) de ces décès impliquent des hommes.  Les suicides 
comptent pour 42 % des décès reliés aux drogues, tandis que l'empoisonnement aux 
opiacés et à la cocaïne compte pour 14 % et 9 %, respectivement.  Le SIDA contracté par 
l'utilisation de drogues illicites compte pour  61 décès (8 % de tous les décès reliés aux 
drogues illicites).  La mortalité résultant de l'utilisation de drogues illicites peut être 
relativement peu fréquente en comparaison des décès reliés à l'usage de l'alcool et du 
tabac, mais les décès reliés aux drogues illicites tendent à impliquer de plus jeunes 
victimes.  Les 732 décès reliés aux drogues illicites ont résulté en  31 147 années perdues 
de vie, ou  42,6 années pour chaque décès. <P>
Il y a eu 7 095 hospitalisations et 58 571 jours en milieu hospitalier résultant de 
l'utilisation de drogues illicites en 1992. Les psychoses reliées aux drogues (1 207 ou 17 
%), les assauts (1 184 ou 17 %) et la dépendance à la cocaïne  (1 151 ou 16 %) comptent 
pour près de  50 % de toutes les hospitalisations reliées aux drogues illicites.  La plus 
grande partie des jours en milieu hospitalier dûs aux drogues illicites est attribuable aux 
psychoses dues aux drogues (13 183 jours ou 22 %), à la dépendance à la cocaïne (9 044 
jours ou 15 %) et aux assauts reliés aux drogues (8 508 jours ou 14 %).<P>
<H2>Vue générale<BR>
des coûts économiques de l'abus de 
substances</H2>
Il est estimé que l'abus de substances coûte plus de 18,45 milliards au Canada en 1992.  
Ceci représente 649 dollars per capita, ou près de 2,67 % du total du Produit   intérieur  
brut.<P>
<UL>
<LI>L'alcool est responsable de 7,5 milliards des coûts, ou 265 $ per capita.  Ceci 
représente 40,8 % du total des coûts de l'abus de substances.  La majorité des coûts 
économiques pour l'alcool est de 4,1 milliards pour la perte de productivité due à la 
maladie et aux décès prématurés, 1,36 milliards pour l'application des lois et 1,3 milliards 
en coûts directs pour les soins de santé.
<LI>Le tabac compte pour 9,56 milliards en coût, ou 336 $ per capita.  Ceci représente 
plus de la moitié  (51,8 %) des coûts totaux de la toxicomanie. La perte de productivité 
due à la maladie et aux décès prématurés est responsable de plus de 6,8 milliards de ces 
coûts et les soins directs de santé dûs au tabagisme comptent pour 2,67 milliards des coûts 
totaux.
<LI>Les coûts économiques des drogues illicites sont estimés à  1,37 milliards, ou 48 $ 
per capita. La majorité des coûts (approximativement 823 millions) représente une perte 
de productivité due à la maladie et aux décès prématurés et une partie substantielle des 
coûts (400 millions) sont pour l'application des lois.  Les coûts directs pour les soins de 
santé dûs aux drogues illicites sont estimés à 88 millions.

<H3>Comparaisons avec d'autres études</H3>
<H4><I>Il y a maintenant une abondance de recherche en 
épidémiologie et de l'information sur les risques relatifs qui n'étaient pas 
disponible aux chercheurs antérieurement</I></H4>
Les coûts estimés concernant l'alcool dans cette étude (7,5 milliards) sont comparables à 
la plupart des autres études sur le pourcentage du Produit intérieur brut  (1,1 %), mais 
l'estimation est plus basse qu'une étude canadienne antérieure réalisée par Adrian et al. 
(1988) qui ont trouvé des coûts pour l'alcool de  11,8 milliards (2,7 % du Produit 
intérieur brut) en 1984.  Il y a plusieurs raisons possibles pour cette différence.  Comme 
noté précédemment,  cette investigation est basée sur des principes opérationnels 
conservateurs et inclut seulement les coûts qui peuvent être liés de façon évidente aux 
substances psychoactives.  Là où des sources de données diverses sont contradictoires les 
données conservatrices sont généralement utilisées.  De plus, il y a des différences dans la 
méthodologie.  Contrairement à l'étude précédente, ce rapport utilise une approche du 
coût de la maladie.<P>
Plus important peut-être, il y a maintenant une abondance de recherche en épidémiologie 
et de l'information sur les risques relatifs qui n'étaient pas disponible aux chercheurs 
antérieurement. Ces nouvelles données nous permettent d'estimer la mortalité avec un plus 
haut niveau de précision qu'il n'était possible avant. Par exemple, les études canadiennes 
précédentes assumaient que 10 % de tous les décès dûs au cancer étaient reliés à l'alcool; 
cette étude réfère aux diagnostics spécifiques, à l'âge et au genre et trouve seulement 2,1 
% des décès dûs au cancer reliés à l'alcool. <P>
De la même façon, cette étude constate une estimation moins élevée de la mortalité reliée 
au tabac que certaines recherches antérieures.  Par exemple, l'estimation de décès reliés au 
tabac est approximativement  25 % plus basse que les 41 400 décès dûs au tabac pour 
1991 estimés par Makomaski-Illing et Kaiserman (1995).  Quelques-unes des différences 
sont le résultat de l'utilisation de ratios différents de risque pour les cancers du poumon 
chez les fumeurs mâles.  Les études précédentes ont utilisé un ratio de risque de 22 basé 
sur une des plus grandes études connues (US Department of Health and Human Services, 
1989).  Le ratio de risque de 13 pour le cancer du poumon pour les hommes utilisé dans 
cette étude est le résultat de l'analyse de 10 études en plus de l'étude citée par 
Makomaski-Illing et Kaiserman.<P>
Cette étude présente des coûts pour les drogues illicites qui sont similaires à d'autres 
études en regard du pourcentage du Produit intérieur brut (0,2 %) avec deux exceptions 
importantes.  Premièrement, les études américaines (par exemple, Rice et al., 1990) ont 
généralement trouvé que les coûts reliés aux drogues illicites  sont considérablement plus 
élevés, probablement que ces coûts sont, en fait, plus élevés aux États-Unis à cause du 
facteur de prévalence des drogues illicites. Deuxièmement, les résultats de cette étude sont 
considérablement moins élevés que dans l'estimation nationale antérieure des coûts reliés à 
la drogue.  En ce qui concerne les estimations pour l'alcool, il est fort probable que les 
différences proviennent de la méthodologie et de calculs plus précis basés sur de nouvelles 
données épidémiologiques.<P>
<H3>Les coûts des politiques</H3>
Les coûts des politiques sont ceux qui sont inclus consciemment dans une décision par des 
responsables des politiques,  contrairement aux coûts reliés au système de traitement et à 
l'industrie suite à la maladie et aux décès reliés aux substances.   Les coûts reliés aux 
politiques incluent tous les coûts pour la prévention, la recherche et l'application des lois.  
Il est estimé que ces coûts représentent approximativement 1,5 milliards pour l'alcool (20 
% du coût économique total dû à l'alcool) et 442 millions pour les drogues illicites (32 % 
du coût total). En contrepartie, les coûts des politiques en 1992 étaient  négligeables pour 
le tabac, représentant moins de 1 % du coût économique total dû au tabac.  Ceci signifie 
que les coûts des politiques—incluant l'application des lois, la prévention et la 
recherche—étaient plus bas pour la substance qui implique les coûts les plus élevés pour la 
société.<P>
<H3>Coûts «évitables»</H3>
<H4><I>Comme les coûts reliés au traitement, à l'application des lois 
et à la productivité constituent les principaux coûts associés à l'alcool, il 
est raisonnable de conclure que la majorité des coûts reliés à l'alcool 
pourraient être évités</I></H4>
Les coûts évitables sont ceux qui ne se seraient pas produits s'il n'y avait pas eu de 
problèmes associés à l'utilisation de l'alcool, du tabac ou des drogues illicites au Canada 
en 1992 (le scénario alternatif).  Comme noté précédemment, même s'il y avait un arrêt 
soudain des problèmes reliés à l'abus de substances au cours de cette année, il y aurait eu 
des coûts dûs à l'impact cumulatif provenant de l'abus antérieur de substances en plus des 
coûts persistants des politiques.<B> </B>Il y a insuffisance de données pour un calcul 
précis et détaillé des coûts évitables, mais plusieurs observations peuvent être faites. <P>
Avec l'alcool il semble que la plupart des coûts économiques sont évitables. 
Approximativement la moitié des décès et des hospitalisations sont le résultat de causes 
telles que les accidents de véhicules à moteur et autres, l'intoxication à l'alcool, le suicide 
et les assauts.  La plupart de ces décès impliquent des personnes relativement jeunes, de 
sorte que le nombre d'années de vie potentielles perdues et de perte de productivité due 
aux décès prématurés est proportionnellement très élevé.  De même quelques-uns des 
décès et des hospitalisations dûs aux conditions chroniques en lien avec l'alcool auraient 
pu être évités si le mauvais usage de l'alcool avait cessé.  Ceci signifie que la plupart des 
coûts reliés au traitement et à la perte de productivité due à la mort prématurée sont 
évitables.  La plupart des coûts de l'application des lois reliés à l'alcool sont également 
évitables.  Comme les coûts reliés au traitement, à l'application des lois et à la productivité 
constituent les principaux coûts associés à l'alcool, il est raisonnable de conclure que la 
majorité des coûts reliés à l'alcool pourraient être évités.<P>
Même si une portion importante des coûts associés à l'utilisation du tabac est évitable,  les 
ex-fumeurs présentent  encore un risque considérablement élevé de présenter plusieurs 
problèmes, plus particulièrement le cancer du poumon,  comparé avec des personnes qui 
n'ont jamais fumés.  Ceci signifie que si tous les fumeurs canadiens arrêtaient 
soudainement de fumer, le taux du cancer du poumon et autres problèmes reliés au tabac 
diminuerait substantiellement, mais une portion considérable de décès et de maladies 
reliées au tabac persisterait. <P>
Les coûts reliés aux drogues illicites, par contre,  sont largement évitables.  La grande 
majorité des décès reliés aux drogues illicites est due aux suicides, à l'empoisonnement et 
aux assauts. La proportion relativement petite de mortalité due à la drogue et au SIDA 
(moins de 10 % du total des décès dûs aux drogues illicites) persisterait, mais la plupart 
des décès reliés aux drogues illicites cesseraient si le mauvais usage des drogues illicites 
arrêtait. Il n'est pas clair si les coûts reliés à l'application des lois diminueraient 
significativement  s'il n'y avait pas d'utilisation de drogues illicites parce que les lois visent 
tout usage de drogues, pas seulement celles qui ont un impact économique.  Toutefois la 
majorité des coûts associés aux drogues illicites sont la perte de productivité due aux 
décès prématurés, alors nous concluons que les coûts reliés aux drogues illicites peuvent 
être évitables.<P>
<H3>Analyse de sensibilité des outils de mesures</H3>
Les résultats des études sur les coûts varient selon la méthode utilisée pour estimer les 
composantes.  L'analyse de sensibilité est réalisée pour examiner dans quelle mesure 
l'utilisation de méthodes particulières modifie les résultats.  Cette étude a porté une 
attention à trois considérations méthodologiques:<P>
<UL>
<LI>L'importance relative des coûts d'hospitalisation selon les diagnostics
<LI>L'utilisation des taux de réduction pour estimer la perte de productivité
<LI>L'utilisation des méthodes alternatives pour mesurer la prévalence de l'abus.
</UL>
<H4>Coûts d'hospitalisation</H4>
Les études précédentes ont généralement estimé le coût des hospitalisations en utilisant un 
taux moyen journalier pour les séjours en hôpital.  Cette façon de faire ne tient pas compte 
que certains problèmes impliquent des coûts plus élevés et d'autres des coûts moins 
élevés.  Par exemple, les coûts journaliers pour traiter un patient atteint du SIDA sont 
considérés être considérablement plus élevés que pour d'autres types de patients.  La 
question est de savoir si l'utilisation d'un taux journalier moyen diminue les résultats dans 
un sens ou dans l'autre, amenant des estimations qui sont trop élevées ou trop basses.  
Une analyse spéciale a été réalisée dans cette étude, dans laquelle les coûts 
d'hospitalisation ont été calculé selon la Pondération de la consommation des ressources 
(PCR) développée par l'Institut canadien d'information sur la santé.  Cette analyse 
démontre que les coûts d'hospitalisation varient selon le diagnostic, mais pas de façon 
considérable.  Il y a sans aucun doute plusieurs conditions reliées aux substances qui 
impliquent des coûts au dessus de la moyenne, mais de la même façon, il y en a aussi 
plusieurs qui sont au dessous de la moyenne.  L'analyse sur la sensibilité confirme que 
l'utilisation d'un taux moyen journalier est une approximation raisonnable des coûts 
d'hospitalisation.<P>
<H4>Taux alternatifs réduits</H4>
L'estimation de la valeur de la perte de productivité due aux décès prématurés est très 
fortement influencée par la façon dont nous compilons la valeur présente des gains futurs 
(le taux réduit).  Plus le taux choisi est élevé, plus basse est la valeur des gains au cours de 
la vie.  Dans cette étude, les estimations des pertes de productivité dues aux décès 
prématurés sont basées sur des taux  réduits de  4 %, 5 %, 6 % et 10 %.  Les  coûts  
rapportés  sont basés sur des taux réduits de 6 %; en calculant un taux d'accroissement de 
productivité de 1% par année, ceci représente un taux réduit réel de 5 %.<P>
Les estimations totales des gains au cours d'une vie des personnes qui sont décédées 
prématurément à cause  de conditions reliées aux substances varient entre 7,17 milliards en 
utilisant un taux réduit de 10 % et 12,35 milliards en utilisant un taux réduit de  4 %. Les 
estimations sur les pertes de productivité dues à l'alcool sont de 1,82 milliards avec un 
taux réduit de 10 % et de 3,57 milliards avec un taux réduit de 4 %.  La variation pour le 
tabac est de 5,0 milliards à 8,06 milliards, et la variation pour les drogues illicites 
concernant la perte de productivité est de 354 millions à 724 millions. Le choix du taux 
réduit a un impact considérable sur l'estimation des pertes de productivité, et 
conséquemment sur les coûts totaux pour l'estimation concernant l'abus de 
substances.<P>
<H4>Mesures alternatives</H4>
Une analyse de sensibilité a été réalisée afin d'estimer l'influence de trois différentes 
mesures concernant la consommation d'alcool : quantité-fréquence (QF), fréquence-
progressive (FP), et consommation hebdomadaire (CH). La QF mesure la consommation 
moyenne basée sur les questions concernant la fréquence des occasions de  consommation 
et le nombre habituel ou moyen de consommations à chaque occasion.  L'étude de la QF 
nécessite seulement deux questions, mais en donnant des réponses correspondant à la 
moyenne, les sujets de l'étude tendent à ne pas tenir compte des épisodes de fortes et 
dangereuses consommations.  <P>
La mesure FP débute avec une question sur le grand nombre de consommations en une 
occasion au cours de la dernière année.  Par la suite, il y a une série de questions afin de 
déterminer combien de fois le répondant a consommé des nombres spécifiques de 
consommations en une occasion, en commençant par le plus grand nombre et en diminuant 
jusqu'à une ou deux consommations.<P>
La consommation hebdomadaire (CH) est généralement mesurée en demandant le nombre 
de consommations qu'un individu a consommé huit jours précédents l'étude, et après en 
poursuivant avec chaque jour de la semaine jusqu'au jour précédent l'étude.  En utilisant 
cette mesure il y a une tendance à surévaluer les abstinents.<P>
Ces mesures sur la consommation produisent différentes estimations sur les coûts 
économiques reliés à l'alcool.  Les jours d'hospitalisation, le coût des médicaments, les 
honoraires des médecins et les pertes de productivité dues à la maladie ou aux décès 
prématurés sont les plus élevés en utilisant la mesure de la fréquence-progressive (FP) et 
plus bas en utilisant la mesure de la consommation hebdomadaire (CH) avec des 
estimations se situant entre les deux lorsque la mesure quantité-fréquence (QF) est utilisée.  
L'estimation totale des coûts reliés à l'abus d'alcool est de 7 734 milliards, ceci en utilisant 
la mesure de la fréquence progressive (FP), de 7 522 milliards en utilisant la mesure 
quantité fréquence (QF) et de 7 225 milliards en utilisant la mesure de la consommation 
hebdomadaire. <P>
L'analyse de sensibilité indique que la méthode pour mesurer la consommation d'alcool a 
une influence très importante sur l'estimation de la prévalence pour la consommation à 
risque et dommageable.  L'influence sur la mortalité et les autres mesures dérivées est 
moins dramatique.  Étant donné que presque toutes les études épidémiologiques utilisent 
la mesure quantité-fréquence afin de documenter l'utilisation d'alcool, il a été décidé 
d'utiliser cette mesure dans cette étude afin d'estimer les coûts.  <P>
<H3>Variation de l'estimation des coûts</H3>
Les résultats des analyses de sensibilité des données indiquent l'étendue des variations de 
l'estimation des coûts économiques pour l'alcool, le tabac et les drogues illicites.  Selon 
ces hypothèses extrêmes, les coûts estimés pour l'alcool varient entre 6,3 milliards et 8,6 
milliards.  Ces résultats se comparent avec notre meilleure estimation de 7,5 milliards.<P>
Selon ces hypothèses extrêmes, les coûts estimés relatifs au tabac varieraient entre  7,8 
milliards et 11,1 milliards.  Notre estimation de 9,6 milliards se situe au centre de ces 
estimations.  Les coûts estimés relatifs aux drogues illicites varieraient entre 1,2 milliards 
et 1,5 milliards.  Notre estimation de 1,32 milliards se situe près du centre de ces deux 
estimations.<P>

<H2>Estimations par province</H2>
Les coûts économiques reliés à l'abus de substances ont également été estimés pour 
chacune des dix provinces canadiennes.  Les estimations des décès et des maladies dûs à 
l'alcool, au tabac et aux drogues reposent sur les données provinciales en regard de la 
prévalence de l'utilisation et du nombre de décès et d'hospitalisations.  Là où des données 
spécifiques provinciales étaient disponibles sur les différentes composantes, elles ont été 
utilisées.  Là où les données ne sont pas disponibles, les per capita nationaux moyens ont 
été utilisés.<P>
<H3>Différence entre mortalité et morbidité</H3>
<H4><I>Le nombre de décès reliés aux drogues illicites en Ontario 
est près de la moyenne nationale en dépit de la concentration des 
consommateurs de drogues dans la métropole de Toronto</I></H4>
Le taux général de mortalité dû à l'abus de substances est plus élevé à l'Île-du-Prince-
Édouard (180 décès par 100 000 de population) et en Nouvelle-Écosse (128 décès par 
100 000 de population).  Ces différences entre les provinces concernant les décès reliés en 
général aux substances sont majoritairement dues au nombre de décès reliés au tabac, qui 
est plus élevé en Nouvelle-Écosse (154 décès par 100 000) et à l'Île du Prince-Édouard 
(153 décès par 100 000).  L'Alberta, d'autre part, a le taux le plus bas de mortalité due au 
tabagisme (89 décès par 100 000 de population).  L'Ontario  (110 par 100 000), Terre-
Neuve (112 par 100 000) et la Saskatchewan (116 par 100 000) ont également des taux 
relativement plus élevés de mortalité reliés au tabac, alors que le Québec (132 par 
100 000) et le Nouveau-Brunswick (131 par 100 000) sont au dessus de la moyenne 
nationale.<P>
Les différences entre les provinces concernant les pertes d'années de vie potentielles, et les 
hospitalisations dues  à l'utilisation du tabac reflètent les tendances relatives aux décès, 
avec les plus hauts per capita à l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard et en Nouvelle-Écosse et les plus 
bas en Alberta.  Toutefois, les plus haut taux de jours en milieu hospitalier dûs aux 
maladies reliées au tabac sont attribuable au Nouveau-Brunswick (13 493 jours pour 
100 000 de population) et au Québec (13 225 par 100 000).  Le taux de mortalité le plus 
bas en lien avec les problèmes dûs à l'alcool est à Terre-Neuve (15 décès par 100 000 de 
population).  <P>
Parmi les autres provinces, il y a relativement peu de variation dans les taux de décès reliés 
à l'alcool, variant  de 23 par 100 000 de population en Ontario, au Québec et au Nouveau-
Brunswick à 27 par 100 000 en Colombie-Britannique.  Terre-Neuve et l'Ontario ont les 
taux les plus bas sur la perte des années de vie potentielles, alors que l'Alberta a les taux 
les plus élevés.  Le nombre d'hospitalisations et de jours en  milieu hospitalier, reliés à 
l'alcool  est moins élevé au Nouveau-Brunswick.  La Saskatchewan a les taux les plus 
élevés concernant les hospitalisations dues aux problèmes reliés à l'alcool alors que la 
Colombie-Britannique a le plus grand nombre de jours en milieu hospitalier per capita, 
reliés aux problèmes d'alcool.<P>
Les situations reliées aux drogues illicites sont responsables de beaucoup moins de décès 
en général que les situations reliées au tabac.  Les taux de décès dûs aux drogues illicites 
varient considérablement d'une province à l'autre.  De loin, on compte le plus grand 
nombre de décès per capita en Colombie Britannique (4,7 par 100 000 de population) et 
les taux les plus bas à Terre-Neuve (1,0 par 100 000).  L'Alberta (3,1) et le Québec (2,8) 
ont des taux de décès reliés aux drogues illicites supérieurs à la moyenne.  Il y a 
relativement peu de variation parmi les autres provinces, avec un taux de variation de 1,5 
au Nouveau-Brunswick à 2,0 en Saskatchewan et en Ontario.  Quelque peu surprenant, le 
nombre de décès reliés aux drogues illicites en Ontario est près de la moyenne nationale en 
dépit de la concentration des consommateurs de drogues dans la métropole de Toronto.  
Les différences au niveau des provinces quant au nombre d'années de vie potentielles 
perdues, aux hospitalisations et aux jours en milieu hospitalier suivent généralement les 
taux de mortalité. Toutefois, Terre-Neuve a un taux relativement élevé quant aux jours en 
milieu hospitalier, reliés aux drogues illicites, en dépit de taux relativement peu élevés de 
décès et d'hospitalisation. <P>
<H3>Différences dans les coûts économiques</H3>
Le rapport démontre que les coûts per capita reliés à l'abus d'alcool sont plus élevés en 
Alberta (285 $). Les per capita les moins élevés sont à Terre-Neuve (199 $). Parmi les 
autres provinces, le per capita varie de 242 $ au Québec à 283 $ à l'Île du Prince-
Édouard.<P>
La Nouvelle-Écosse encourt  les  plus importants coûts reliés au tabac (398 $), suivie par 
l'Île du Prince-Édouard (361 $), le Nouveau-Brunswick (354 $) et l'Ontario (346 $).  Les 
coûts les moins élevés per capita attribuables au tabac sont en Alberta (277 $), 
Saskatchewan (281 $) et Terre-Neuve (294 $).<P>
Les coûts per capita pour les drogues illicites varient de 31 $ à Terre-Neuve à 60 $ en 
Colombie Britannique.  Il est estimé que les drogues illicites ont généré des coûts de 207 
millions à la Colombie Britannique en 1992.  Des coûts économiques relativement élevés 
sont également attribués aux drogues illicites en Alberta (135 millions ou 51 $ per capita), 
en Ontario (507 millions ou 48 $ per capita), au Québec (334 millions ou 47 $ per capita) 
et à l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard (4,7 millions ou 36 $ per capita).  Le tableau suivant présente 
les coûts de l'abus de substances dans les provinces en regard du Produit intérieur brut 
(PIB) et comme dépense per capita.  Le coût per capita est le plus élevé en Nouvelle-
Écosse (699 $) et à l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard  (681 $) et le moins élevé à Terre-Neuve (524 
$).  En relation avec le Produit intérieur brut, les coûts reliés à l'abus de substances sont 
plus élevés à l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard (88,7 millions ou 4,03 % du PIB) et moins élevés en 
Alberta (1,6 milliards ou 2,2 % du PIB).  Le coût de l'abus de substances dans les autres 
provinces varie de 2,5 % du PIB en Ontario à 3,6 % en Nouvelle-Écosse.<P>
<H4><A HREF="/econtotf.htm">Le total des coûts de l'abus de substances dans les provinces canadiennes en 1992</A></H4><P>
<H2>Sommaire et conclusions</H2>
<H3>Un très lourd bilan</H3>
Un nombre de 40 930 décès est attribuable à l'abus de substances au Canada en 1992.  Le tabac est responsable de 33 498 de ces décès, l'alcool de 6 701 et les drogues illicites de 732.  Ceci représente 21 % du total des décès pour cette même année.  Les décès reliés au tabac comptent à eux seuls pour 17 % de l'ensemble des décès en 1992.  La perte d'années de vie potentielles due à l'abus de substances constitue 23 % du total des années perdues pour toutes causes - 16 % due au tabac, 6 % due à l'alcool et 1 % due à l'utilisation des drogues illicites.  Le nombre d'hospitalisations dues à l'abus de substances constitue 8 % du nombre total des hospitalisations et 10 % des jours en milieu hospitalier pour toutes causes.<P>
Il est estimé que les coûts reliés à l'abus de substances sont de 18,45 milliards au Canada en 1992.  Ceci représente un per capita de 649 $, ou pres de 2,7 % de total du Produit intérieur brut.  L'alcool est responsable de plus de 7,5 milliards de ces coûts, représentant 265 $ per capita.  Le tabac est responsable de plus de 9,6 milliards de ces coûts ou 340 $ per capita.  Le coût économique des drogues illicites est estimé à 1,37 milliards, ou 48 $ par personne.
<H3>Meilleures estimations</H3>
Dans la présente étude, l'estimation des décès et de la maladie attribuables à l'abus de substances est moins élevée que dans des études antérieures.  Ceci est grandement dû à l'accessibilité d'informations beaucoup plus précises sur les fractions attribuables aux catégories de maladies spécifiques (en regard de catégories plus larges) avec l'âge, le genre et la province, toutes prises en compte.  En regard du tabac, l'estimation moins élevée de la maladie et des décès est largement attribuable à l'utilisation de nombreuses sources d'estimation provenant de différentes études plutôt que d'une seule.
<H3>Décès évités</H3>
Il a été trouvé que l'alcool a contribué à prévenir 7 401 décès en 1992, en grande partie à cause des impacts bénéfiques de la consommation d'alcool sur les maladies du coeur et les arrêts cardiaques.  Toutefois, les années potentielles de vie perdues à cause de l'alcool (186 257) sont beaucoup plus importantes que le nombre d'années potentielles de vie sauvées par ces effets bénéfiques (88 656).  De plus, le nombre d'hospitalisations causées par l'alcool (86 076) dépasse de loin le nombre que l'alcool a contribué à éviter (45 414).
<H3>Décès accidentels</H3>
Les décès accidentels sont responsables d'un beaucoup plus grand nombre de l'ensemble des situations de morbidité et de mortalité reliés à l'alcool que démontré dans les études précédentes.  Ceci est le résultat de maladies chroniques contribuant une proportion moindre des maladies et des décès sur l'ensemble des cas reliés à l'alcool que dans les études antérieures.  Par exemple, des estimations antérieures attribuaient 10 % de tous les cancers à l'alcool, mais des calculs plus détaillés indiquent que seulement 2,1 % des décès reliés au cancer sont dûs à l'alcool.
<H3>Coûts évitables</H3>
En 1992, le coût des politiques, application des lois, prévention et recherche était plus bas pour le tabac, la substance psychoactive qui afflige la société des coûts les plus élevés.  On en conclut que la majorité des coûts associés à l'alcool et aux drogues illicites sont évitables, mais ceci est moins vrai pour le tabac.
<H3>Variation des coûts</H3>
Enfin, on conclut que les coûts reliés à l'abus de substances varient considérablement d'une province à l'autre au Canada.

<UL>
<LI>La consommation d'alcool continue de régresser. En 1993, 74,4 % des Canadiens ont 
déclaré en avoir consommé contre 79 % en 1990, et le Canadien moyen de 15 ans et plus a 
consommé l'équivalent de 7,97 litres d'alcool pur en 1991-1992, soit une baisse de 4,3 % par 
rapport à l'année précédente. Les plus hauts taux de consommation visent les jeunes adultes, les 
hommes, et ceux qui disposent d'un revenu relativement élevé.
<LI>Selon l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, près de un Canadien de 15 ans et plus sur dix 
(9,2 %) a déclaré un problème de consommation. Les problèmes les plus courants étaient les 
effets nocifs sur la santé physique (5,1 %) et les répercussions sur la situation financière (4,7 %). 
De plus, 43,9 % ont déclaré avoir souffert de la consommation d'autres personnes. Le plus 
souvent, ils ont été incommodés par le comportement bruyant de fêtards ou d'autres 
comportements (23,8 %), été insultés ou humiliés par une personne ayant trop bu (20,9 %), et 
se sont disputés ou même querellés à cause de la consommation excessive d'une autre personne 
(15,6 %).
<LI>En ce qui concerne les diagnostics médicaux reliés à l'alcool, en 1990-1991, on a relevé 
38 261 congés dans les hôpitaux généraux et psychiatriques. Malgré le recul de la 
consommation globale de l'alcool, la mortalité associée à ce produit a augmenté. En 1991, 3 
183 décès ont été directement imputés à l'alcool et 15 980, indirectement.
<LI>L'alcool au volant demeure une cause majeure de décès chez les jeunes; parmi les 
conducteurs blessés mortellement, 46 % présentaient desstraces d'alcool dans le sang, dont 39 
% un taux supérieur à la limite autorisée de 0,08 mg
</UL>
<H3>Tendances et profils de consommation</H3>
APERÇU: La consommation d'alcool continue de régresser dans tout le pays. Parmi les 
participants à l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, le taux des Canadiens de 15 ans et plus qui 
ont déclaré avoir consommé l'année précédente s'établissait à 74,4 % comparativement à 79,0 
% en 1991. La consommation par habitant représentait 7,97 litres d'alcool pur en 1991, soit 
4,4 % de moins qu'en 1990.<P>
TAUX ET CARACTÉRISTIQUES DES BUVEURS: La proportion des Canadièns qui se 
sont déclarés buveurs lors des diverses enquêtes nationales atteignait quelque 80 % en 1979, 
81 % en 1985, 78 % en 1989, 79 % en 1991, et 74,4 % en 1993 (Tableau 2.1). Des 10 385 
participants à l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, 74,4 % ont déclarés être buveurs; 18,0 %, 
anciens buveurs; et 7,7 %, n'avoir jamais bu (Tableau 2.2). Le premier groupe comportait plus 
d'hommes que de femmes (81 % contre 68 %), et le taux de ceux qui ont déclaré consommer 
de l'alcool est passé de 85 % chez les 20 à 24 ans à 43 % chez les 75 ans et plus (Tableau 
2.2). L'Ontario compte le plus haut taux de consommateurs (79 %) et la Colombie-Britannique, 
le plus faible (71 %). On observe des taux relativement élevés de buveurs chez ceux qui ont un 
revenu supérieur, un niveau d'instruction postsecondaire et un emploi, et chez ceux qui vivent 
dans des centres urbains de 500 000 à 1 000 000 d'habitants (Tableau 2.3).<P>
SOURCES DES DONNÉES SUR LA CONSOMMATION D'ALCOOL: Les données sur 
la consommation d'alcool et les problèmes connexes proviennent de plusieurs sources. Les 
rapports de ventes des régies provinciales monopolistes fournissent une estimation facilement 
accessible de la consommation. Statistique Canada rassemble et publie ces données dans un 
rapport annuel intitulé, <I>Le contrôle et la vente des boissons alcooliques </I>au Canada. 
Ces données font toutefois exclusion des sources de consommation non enregistrées telles les 
vins et bières maison, les boissons alcoolisées artisanales confectionnées au moyen de trousses 
«à faire soi-même» vendues par certains commerces spécialisés, ainsi que de la production et 
de l'importation illégales, ou de l'importation légale de petites quantités pour consommation 
personnelle. Il conviendrait d'effectuer des études pour établir dans quelle mesure les données 
des ventes reflètent la consommation globale. A ce jour, on en compte pratiquement aucune. La 
plus récente remonte à 1978 et visait strictement l'Ontario (Single et Giesbrecht, 1979). Ses 
auteurs avaient conclu que la consommation réelle était supérieure de 6 à 7 % à celle établie 
selon les données des ventes, principalement en raison des grandes quantités de vin alors fait 
maison dans la province. Par ailleurs, les facteurs de conversion utilisés pour la teneur en alcool 
de la bière, du vin et des spiritueux dans les estimations fondées sur les données des ventes ne 
reflètent pas toujours la réalité et constituent donc une source d'erreurs. Les facteurs de 
conversion utilisés dans le présent rapport ont été mis à jour en 1994, conformément à des 
consultations tenues avec les représentants de l'industrie, de manière à mieux rendre compte des 
profils de consommation actuels à l'échelle nationale. En 1991, la teneur en alcool des spiritueux 
a été évaluée à 36,9 %, celle de la bière à 4,9 %, et celle du vin à 11,7 %.<P>
Malgré ces sources d'erreurs possibles, les données des ventes demeurent la meilleure 
estimation disponible de la consommation annuelle globale d'alcool. La plus grave limitation de 
ces données est qu'elles ne permettent pas d'examiner les caractéristiques individuelles des 
buveurs. Par ailleurs, les enquêtes générales sur la population nous renseignent quant au nombre 
et aux caractéristiques sociodémographiques des abstinents et des buveurs, mais elles tendent à 
sous-estimer la consommation (Pernanen, 1974). Ainsi, le nombre des consommations 
hebdomadaires déclarées par les buveurs ayant participé à la plus récente enquête nationale, 
l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, était de 4,2 (Tableau 2.8), soit près de la moitié de la 
moyenne de 9,0 consommations hebdomadaires par habitant indiquée par les données des 
ventes (Tableau 2.7). Cet écart s'explique de plusieurs façons. Les plus gros buveurs d'alcool 
sont normalement sous-représentés dans les échantillons et ceux qui participent ont davantage 
tendance que les buveurs légers à déclarer une consommation inférieure à la réalité (Pernanen, 
1974). Les données des enquêtes constituent donc une importante source d'information sur les 
divers corrélats de la consommation et des fortes consommations, mais elles ne sont pas 
utilisées pour évaluer la consommation globale d'alcool.<P>
NIVEAU DE CONSOMMATION: Selon les données des ventes, en 1991-1992, les 
Canadiens ont bu un peu plus que 2 milliards de litres de bière, 231 millions de litres de vin et 
136 millions de litres de spiritueux (Tableau 2.4), ce qui représente 7,97 litres d'alcool pur par 
personne de 15 ans et plus. En termes de consommations standards, le Canadien moyen a pris 
environ 9 consommations par semaine en 1991-1992 (Tableau 2.7). <A HREF="/cpfig25.htm">La bière a compté pour 
56,4 % de la consommation globale d'alcool, les spiritueux pour 28,4 %, et le vin pour 15,2 %</A> 
(Tableau 2.5).<P>
Comme l'indique la <A HREF="/cpfig21.htm">Figure 2.1, en 1991-1992, les plus hauts taux de consommation globale 
revenaient au Yukon (14,4 litres par personne de 15 ans ou plus), aux Territoires du Nord-
Ouest (9,6 litres) et à la Colombie-Britannique (9,4 litres), et les plus faibles, au Nouveau-
Brunswick (6,2 litres), à la Saskatchewan (7,1 litres) et au Québec (7,1 litres).</A> On croit que le 
volume exceptionnellement élevé des ventes enregistrées au Yukon est en partie imputable au 
tourisme. La consommation globale d'alcool, de la bière, du vin et des spiritueux varie d'une 
province à l'autre, celle de la bière étant relativement élevée au Québec, celle du vin au Québec 
et en Colombie-Britannique, et celle des spiritueux dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest et en 
Saskatchewan.<P>
TENDANCES DE LA CONSOMMATION D ALCOOL: En 1991-1992, la vente d'alcool 
pur par adulte s'est établie à 8,0 litres, soit 4,3 % de moins que l'année précédente (Tableau 
2.7). Comme l'indique la Figure 2.2, les ventes de boissons alcoolisées ont constamment 
régressé, passant de 10,9 litres par personne de 15 ans ou plus en 1981-1982 à 8,0 litres en 
1991-1992. On ne constate aucune tendance nette à long terme pour la consommation globale 
de la bière, du vin et des spiritueux. Une tendance à la hausse de la consommation relative du 
vin et une tendance à la baisse de celle de la bière avaient pu être observées durant les années 
50 et 60, mais elles ne se sont pas maintenues, et celle de la bière a même subi une légère 
augmentation au cours des cinq dernières années tandis que celle des spiritueux a diminué.<P>
CARACTÉRISTIQUES DES GROS BUVEURS: Le profil du buveur à consommation 
relativement élevée correspond au jeune homme financièrement à l'aise (Tableau 2.8). Les 
hommes consomment au moins deux fois plus que les femmes (ils ont déclaré 5,9 
consommations lors de l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993 contre 2,3 chez les femmes), et les 
taux de consommation sont particulièrement élevés chez ceux au début de la vingtaine et les 
célibataires. Les jeunes adultes, les hommes et les célibataires sont en général plus nombreux 
que les autres à déclarer de cinq à six consommations pour une même occasion. Il existe une 
corrélation positive entre le revenu et le niveau de consommation déclaré. Par contre, le niveau 
d'instruction présente une corrélation positive avec la consommation, mais toutefois négative par 
rapport au niveau de consommation; les diplômés universitaires sont plus susceptibles de 
consommer de l'alcool que les autres, mais tendent à consommer moins à chaque fois. Les 
personnes qui déclarent les plus hauts taux de consommation sont celles qui cherchent un travail. 
Les étudiants consomment relativement peu, mais sont plus nombreux à déclarer cinq 
consommations ou plus par occasion (63 %). On ne constate aucun lien évident entre la taille de 
la collectivité et le niveau de consommation ni le nombre des occasions de forte 
consommation.<P>
L'Enquête nationale sur l'alcool et les autres drogues réalisée en 1989 fournit de l'information 
détaillée sur les contextes de consommation. On avait alors demandé aux participants d'indiquer 
combien de fois notamment ils passaient une soirée tranquille à la maison, allaient dans les bars 
ou les tavernes, visitaient des amis, et combien souvent et quelles quantités ils consommaient à 
ces occasions. L'analyse des résultats permit d'évaluer <A HREF="/cpfig23.htm">la proportion de la consommation 
globale d'alcool dans les divers contextes. Or, tel qu'il est indiqué à la Figure 2.3,</A> on consomme 
surtout dans des lieux privés, notamment lors de soirées tranquilles à la maison (18 %), de 
réceptions ou d'autres fêtes sociales (16 %), de visites d'amis (16 %) ou à des amis (15 %). 
L'alcool pris dans les bars et les tavernes représente 12 % et dans les restaurants, 13 %. Le 
reste de la consommation est ventilée entre les activités de plein air (5 %), les activités sportives 
(2 %), les rencontres de clubs ou d'organismes 2 %, et les concerts et les événements sportifs 
(1 %). Il existe une forte corrélation entre les caractéristiques des buveurs et le niveau de 
consommation (Tableau 2.10). On associe par exemple la prise d'alcool dans les bars et les 
tavernes à de hauts niveaux de consommation et aux problèmes connexes.<P>
<H3>Problèmes associés à la consommation d'alcool</H3>
PROBLÈMES AUTO-DÉCLARÉS: Lors de l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, on avait 
demandé aux participants si leur consommation d'alcool avait eu, les douze mois précédents, 
des répercussions sur leur vie sociale, leur santé physique, leur bien-être, leur vie familiale ou 
conjugale, leur travail ou leur situation financière. Le Tableau 2.9 indique le taux des buveurs de 
chaque catégorie démographique ayant déclaré un problème, le nombre moyen des problèmes 
déclarés, et le taux des participants ayant déclaré chaque problème spécifique. Dans l'ensemble, 
9,2 % des buveurs ont éprouvé au moins un des problèmes indiqués. Les problèmes les plus 
souvent mentionnés étaient les effets négatifs sur la santé physique (5,1 %) et sur la situation 
financière (4,7 %).<P>
Les hommes ont davantage tendance que les femmes à déclarer des problèmes découlant de 
leur consommation (11,9 % contre 6,2 % chez les femmes), surtout en ce qui concerne leur 
situation financière (6,7 % contre 2,5 %), leur travail ou leurs études (2,0 % contre 0,8 %), leur 
vie familiale et conjugale (2,4 % contre 1,1 %) et leur santé physique (6,7 % contre 3,2 %). Les 
plus nombreux à le faire sont les 15 à 24 ans, leur nombre diminuant progressivement après 19 
ans. Les adolescents et les jeunes adultes sont particulièrement susceptibles de déclarer des 
difficultés financières. Vu les taux supérieurs de consommation des célibataires ou des divorcés, 
il ne faut sans doute pas s'étonner que ceux-ci soient généralement plus nombreux à déclarer un 
problème (17,9 % comparativement à 7,9 % chez ceux du groupe de revenu supérieur). On 
associe le faible revenu non seulement aux difficultés financières mais aussi à d'autres problèmes 
reliés à l'alcool. Il n'existe aucune corrélation évidente entre le niveau d'instruction et les 
problèmes de consommation.<P>
Les étudiants et les personnes à la recherche d'un emploi sont les plus susceptibles de déclarer 
un problème lié à leur consommation (16,9 %), surtout d'ordre financier, les moins susceptibles 
étant les personnes au foyer (4,7 %), les retraités (5,2 %) et les professionnels (5,8 %). Le taux 
plus haut de personnes ayant déclaré un problème va aux Maritimes (13,0 %), et le plus bas, à 
l'Ontario (7,5 %). Même s'il n'existe aucune corrélation entre la taille de la collectivité et le 
niveau de consommation, les participants des régions rurales sont plus nombreux à déclarer un 
problème (10,8 % contre 8,1 % chez ceux des agglomérations d'un million d'habitants ou 
plus).<P>
PROBLÈMES DUS À LA CONSOMMATION D ALCOOL D UNE AUTRE PERSONNE: 
Lors de l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, on avait demandé aux participants d'indiquer si, par 
suite de la consommation d'alcool d'une autre personne, ils avaient déjà:<P>
<UL>
<LI>été insultés;
<LI>eu une grave dispute;
<LI>perdu une amitié;
<LI>éprouvé des problèmes conjugaux ou familiaux;
<LI>été passager dans un véhicule conduit par une personne aux facultés affaiblies;
<LI>subi un accident;
<LI>été victimes de vandalisme;
<LI>été agressés;
<LI>été incommodés par des fêtes bruyantes;
<LI>éprouvé des difficultés financières.
</UL>
Le Tableau 2.10 indique la proportion des participants ayant déclaré un problème donné, le 
nombre moyen des problèmes déclarés, ainsi que la proportion des participants ayant déclaré 
l'un ou l'autre des dix problèmes énumérés, selon les diverses catégories démographiques. Dans 
l'ensemble, 43,9 % des participants ont déclaré avoir éprouvé certains problèmes en raison de 
la consommation d'une autre personne. Les problèmes les plus souvent déclarés étaient le 
comportement bruyant des fêtards ou d'autres comportements (23,8 %), les insultes ou 
humiliations (20,9 %), et les disputes ou querelles importantes (15,6 %).<P>
Les hommes (45,5 %) et les femmes (42,5 %) sont aussi nombreux les uns que les autres à 
déclarer des problèmes causés par la consommation d'alcool d'une autre personne. Les 
hommes sont plus nombreux à déclarer des problèmes causés par des incidents ou des 
accidents imputables à la consommation d'alcool d'une autre personne, et les femmes, des 
problèmes familiaux ou conjugaux. En ce qui concerne l'âge, la proportion des participants 
déclarant des problèmes dus à la consommation d'une autre personne passe de 43,4 % chez les 
15 à 17 ans à 66,0 % chez les 20 à 24 ans. La proportion des participants déclarant des 
problèmes diminue ensuite après 24 ans pour atteindre 12,4 % chez les plus de 75 ans. Ce 
profil d'âge s'applique généralement à chacune des dix situations susmentionnées résultant de la 
consommation d'alcool par une autre personne, quoique l'on observe un plus haut taux de 
problèmes familiaux et conjugaux chez les 35 à 54 ans.<P>
La majorité des Canadiens célibataires ou divorcés (55,6 % et 58,8 % respectivement) 
éprouvent des problèmes dus à la consommation des autres. Les moins touchés sont les 
personnes veuves (19,4 %). Ce profil demeure sensiblement le même pour chacun des 
problèmes énumérés, à la seule exception que les personnes séparées ou divorcées sont plus 
nombreuses à avoir déclaré des problèmes familiaux ou conjugaux (19,5 %) ou la perte d'une 
amitié (13,9 %).<P>
Il n'est apparu aucune corrélation cohérente entre les niveaux de revenu et la probabilité 
d'éprouver un problème dû à la consommation d'alcool par une autre personne. Les répondants 
à faible revenu ont cependant déclaré un plus grand nombre de problèmes dus à ce facteur, et 
ceux des tranches de revenu les plus faibles étaient plus nombreux à déclarer plusieurs 
problèmes spécifiques (dispute ou querelle résultant de la consommation d'une autre personne; 
perte d'une amitié; problèmes familiaux ou conjugaux; avoir été conduit par une personne aux 
facultés affaiblies; avoir été agressé par une personne ayant trop bu; problèmes financiers). La 
proportion des répondants ayant déclaré de tels problèmes diminue au fur et à mesure que le 
niveau de revenu augmente.<P>
Les participants du groupe ayant fait des études postsecondaires étaient plus susceptibles que 
les autres de déclarer avoir éprouvé des problèmes dus à la consommation d'alcool d'une autre 
personne (55,1 %). Les moins nombreux à déclarer de tels problèmes étaient ceux du groupe 
n'ayant pas atteint le secondaire (35,1 %). Les répondants du premier groupe ont déclaré 
beaucoup plus souvent que les autres les problèmes suivants: insultes (28,4 %); grave dispute 
ou querelle (23,2 %); problèmes familiaux et conjugaux (11,9 %); avoir été conduit par une 
personne aux facultés affaiblies (13,4 %); avoir été agressé (9,5 %). Le fait d'avoir été 
incommodé par des fêtes bruyantes ou d'autres comportements a surtout été déclaré par ceux 
ayant terminé l'université (29,4 %), ce pourcentage diminuant avec le niveau d'instruction pour 
atteindre 16,8 % chez ceux du groupe n'ayant pas fait le secondaire.<P>
Les travailleurs semi-professionnels (53,7 %), les étudiants (53,7 %), ceux à la recherche d'un 
emploi (52,0 %) et les travailleurs non spécialisés (51,8 %) sont plus nombreux à déclarer un 
problème dû à la consommation d'alcool d'une autre personne, les moins nombreux étant les 
participants à la retraite (21,4 %). Ce profil s'applique généralement à chacun des problèmes 
spécifiques mentionnés, sauf en ce qui concerne les personnes au foyer, lesquelles sont plus 
susceptibles de déclarer des problèmes familiaux ou conjugaux (11,3 %), et les répondants 
inscrits dans les catégories avec emploi sont plus susceptibles d'être incommodés par les fêtes 
bruyantes que ceux qui sont exclus de la population active.<P>
C'est en Colombie-Britannique (57,8 %) que la consommation d'alcool des autres affecte le 
plus grand nombre de gens, et au Québec (39,6 %) le moins grand nombre. Les répondants 
des Prairies sont plus nombreux à déclarer avoir été conduits par une personne aux facultés 
affaiblies (10,8 %), et ceux du Québec, avoir éprouvé des problèmes financiers (2,9 %). 
L'incidence des problèmes découlant de la consommation d'alcool d'une autre personne ne 
présente aucune corrélation nette avec la taille de la collectivité. Les résidants des régions rurale 
sont en fait moins susceptibles de déclarer un tel problème, mais ont par contre tendance, 
lorsqu'ils le font, à déclarer un nombre de problèmes légèrement supérieur.<P>
MORBIDITÉ RELIÉES A L'ALCOOL: La prévalence estimative de l'alcoolisme au Canada, 
en 1990, s'établissait à 490 700 personnes, soit à 1 800 par 100 000 habitants (Tableau 2.11). 
Il conviendrait cependant de noter que ces estimations sont calculées à partir du nombre des 
décès par cirrhose, selon la formule Jellinek, qui s'appuie sur des estimations quelque peu 
dépassées de la proportion des décès par cirrhose imputable à l'alcoolisme. Par conséquent, il 
importe pour le lecteur d'interpréter ces estimations avec réserve, car elles ne sont en fait que 
des estimations brutes du nombre de Canadiens dépendants de l'alcool.<P>
En 1990-1991, on a dénombré au Canada 38 261 congés des hôpitaux psychiatriques et 
généraux associés à l'alcool (Tabieau 2.12). Les hommes représentaient 27 249 ou 71,2 % de 
ces cas. Tant chez les hommes que chez les femmes, les cas les plus nombreux visaient la 
tranche des 45 à 64 ans, celle-ci comptant pour 13 629 cas ou 35,6 % de la morbidité totale. 
L'âge médian des personnes traitées dans un hôpital, général, ou psychiatrique pour un 
problème relié à l'alcool était de 46,9 ans. Le syndrome de dépendance à l'alcool constituait le 
diagnostic relié à l'alcool le plus souvent posé, représentant 17 080 cas ou 44,6 % de tous les 
cas reliés à l'alcool.<P>
En 1990-1991, le taux global des congés associés à l'alcool dans les hôpitaux généraux ou 
psychiatriques était de 137,7 par 100 000 habitants (Tableau 2.13). Le taux applicable aux 
hommes (197,7) était environ 2,5 fois celui applicable aux femmes (78,6). Les taux les plus 
élevés revenaient aux groupes des 45 à 64 ans et des 65 à 74 ans (256,2 et 254,2 
respectivement). Le plus grand nombre de congés des hôpitaux reliés à l'alcool, en 1990-1991, 
a été enregistré en Ontario, avec 13 917 cas ou 36,4 % du nombre total (Tableau 2.14). Ce 
chiffre correspond sensiblement au pourcentage de la population canadienne résidant en 
Ontario. Les plus hauts taux de cas par 100 000 habitants revenaient à l'Ile-du-Prince-Édouard 
(406,1) et à la Saskatchewan (215,4), et les plus bas, au Québec (109,2) et au Nouveau-
Brunswick (129,7).<P>
Les hôpitaux psychiatriques ont déclaré 8,8 % de l'ensemble des congés des hôpitaux reliés à 
l'alcool (Tableau 2.15). Les écarts enregistrés entre les provinces étaient considérables. Les 
hôpitaux psychiatriques de la Nouvelle-Ecosse et de Terre-Neuve ont déclaré 22,4 % et 17,2 
% respectivement de tous ces congés, tandis que ceux du Nouveau-Brunswick et du Manitoba 
n'ont déclaré aucun cas. Dans l'ensemble, les diagnostics associés à l'alcool ont représenté 11,0 
% de tous les congés des hôpitaux psychiatriques au Canada.<P>
MORTALITÉ RELLÉE A L ALcOOL: En 1991, le Canada a enregistré 3 183 décès 
directement imputables à l'alcool, soit une hausse de 7,6 % par rapport à l'année précédente 
(Tableau 2.16). Les décès par cirrhose et autres affections du foie ont représenté 2 200 cas, ou 
69,1 % de tous les décès directement imputables à l'alcool, et les troubles mentaux reliés à 
l'alcool, 647 cas ou 20,3 %. On a dénombré 2 252 hommes ou 70,8 %. Le taux des décès 
directement imputables à l'alcool par 100 000 habitants pour le Canada était de 11,6 (Tableau 
2.17). Il s'établissait à 16,6 chez les hommes contre 6,7 chez les femmes et était supérieur chez 
les groupes des plus âgés. C'est le Yukon qui a enregistré le plus haut avec 44,7 (Tableau 
2.18).<P>
Le nombre estimatif des décès indirectement imputables à l'alcool au Canada, en 1991, 
atteignait 15 980, une hausse de 2,0 % sur 1990 (Tableau 2.19). Ce chiffre est basé sur une 
proportion des décès imputables à l'alcool pour les cause suivantes: tumeurs, 10 %; maladies de 
l'appareil circulatoire, 5 %; maladies de l'appareil respiratoire, 15 %; accidents de la route, 45 
%; chutes accidentelles, 40 %; accidents dus au feu, 30 %; noyades accidentelles, 30 %; 
suicides, 30 %; homicides, 60 %. Nous rappelons ici au lecteur que ces facteurs d'imputation ne 
sont pas toujours actuels ni ne sont toujours fondés sur des études canadiennes. Les décès 
indirectement imputables à l'alcool incluaient 5 475 décès dus à des tumeurs (34,3 % de tous 
les décès indirectement imputables à l'alcool); 3 800 décès dus aux maladies de l'appareil 
circulatoire (23,8 %); 2 250 décès dus à des maladies de l'appareil respiratoire (15,8 %); 1 
695 décès dus à des accidents de la route (10,6 %); et 820 décès dus à des chutes 
accidentelles (5,1 %). Le taux des décès indirectement imputables à l'alcool en 1991 
s'établissait à 56,8 par 100 000 habitants, les plus hauts taux revenant, dans l'ordre, à l'Ile-du-
Prince-Edouard (76,5), à la Saskatchewan (65,5), à la Nouvelle-Ecosse (64,8), au Manitoba 
(62,4) et à la Colombie-Britannique (61,3).<P>
ACCIDENTS RELIÉS A L'ALCOOL: A l'exception des blessures et des décès dus aux 
accidents de la route, il existe peu de données nationales sur les autres genres d'accidents reliés 
à l'alcool, notamment les accidents de navigation, les feux et les agressions. Des progrès 
considérables ont été réalisés en vue de réduire l'alcool au volant, mais les accidents de la route 
demeurent une cause de problèmes de santé et de société majeurs au Canada. En fait, la 
conduite avec facultés affaiblies constitue la principale cause de mortalité chez les jeunes 
Canadiens. Comme l'indique le Tableau 2.20, en 1991, 46 % des conducteurs mortellement 
blessés présentaient des traces d'alcool dans le sang, 39 % une alcoolémie excédant le taux 
permis de 0,08 % et 30 %, une alcoolémie supérieure à 0,15 % . Ces chiffres représentent une 
hausse de l'alcoolémie chez les conducteurs mortellement blessés, alors que depuis dix ans, elle 
était à la baisse. Elle est particulièrement élevée chez les jeunes conducteurs mortellement 
blessés, soit les 26 à 35 ans (Tableau 2.21).<P>
Lors de l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993, environ un répondant sur huit de 15 ans ou plus 
(12,9 %) a déclaré avoir conduit après avoir pris deux consommations ou plus l'année 
précédente (Tableau 2.22). Le taux de ceux qui ont déclaré avoir conduit avec les facultés 
affaiblies est particulièrement élevé chez les hommes, soit les répondants de 18 à 45 ans et ceux 
à revenu élevé (Tableau 2.22). Les personnes au foyer, les retraités et les professionnels sont 
moins nombreux à déclarer avoir conduit après avoir consommé. Les plus nombreux à déclarer 
avoir conduit après avoir bu de l'alcool étaient les Québécois (19,4 % contre 13,4 % dans les 
Prairies, 13,1 % en Colombie-Britannique, 10,7 % dans les Maritimes et 9,2 % en Ontario), et 
les moins nombreux, les répondants des régions rurales.<P>

<H3>Points saillants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>De 1981 à 1991, les ventes de tabac au Canada ont constamment diminué, passant en 
moyenne de 3 728 à 2 103 cigarettes par personne chez les 15 ans et plus, et représentant une 
diminution globale de 37 %. Les ventes de cigarettes usinées ont baissé d'environ 42 %, mais 
celles du tabac fine coupe ont augmenté de 14,6 %.
<LI>Selon l'enquête nationale de 1994 sur le tabagisme, 30 % des 15 ans et plus fument la 
cigarette. Les plus hauts taux d'usage se retrouvent chez les 20 à 24 ans (38 %) et les plus bas, 
chez les plus de 65 ans (16 %).
<LI>En 1990, quelque 36 325 décès ont été indirectement imputés au tabagisme. Les plus 
hauts taux sort à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard et la Nouvelle-Ecosse, et à les plus bas, au Yukon et 
aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest.
</UL>
<H3>Sources des données</H3>
Les données sur la consommation du tabac et les problèmes associés au tabagisme proviennent 
de plusieurs sources. Les estimations les plus fiables sur la consommation du tabac sont tirées 
des rapports de distribution fournis par les sources agricoles, les rapports des manufacturiers et 
de la douane. Statistique Canada publient ces données dans le rapport mensuel <I>Production 
et disposition des produits du tabac. </I>Ce sont les manufacturiers qui nous offrent 
l'estimation la plus juste de la consommation annuelle globale du tabac.<P>
Les estimations de la production de tabac sont limitées et font exclusion des sources non 
consignées de consommation, par exemple le tabac importé, les achats outre-frontière, la 
production illicite et l'importation illégale. La consommation des produits du tabac obtenue par 
les sources non consignées a sensiblement augmenté en 1991 avec l'introduction de la taxe 
fédérale sur les produits et services (TPS) et d'une seconde taxe fédérale de 3 cents par 
cigarette. Cette majoration du prix a soulevé un tollé de protestations chez les consommateurs 
canadiens, qui ont réagi en achetant de plus en plus de produits de tabac aux Etats-Unis 
(Kaiserman, 1992). On estime ainsi que 6,4 milliards de cigarettes sont entrées illégalement au 
Canada en 1991, soit quelque 11 % du marché global.<P>
Tout comme l'estimation des ventes d'alcool, celle des ventes de tabac repose aussi sur divers 
facteurs de conversion. Les produits du tabac se divisent en plusieurs catégories: cigarettes, 
tabac fine coupe, cigares, tabac à pipe et tabac à priser ou à chiquer. Aussi, Statistique Canada 
calcule les unités de tabac au moyen des facteurs de conversion suivants: 0,86S g (1 cigarette) 
pour les cigarettes usinées; 0,77 g (1 cigarette) pour le tabac fine coupe; 3,72 g (1 cigare) pour 
les cigares (Kaiserman, 1992).<P>
Les problèmes et la taille du marché illégal du tabac ont continué de croître en 1993. Comme le 
montre le Tableau 10.10, les exportations de cigarettes canadiennes ont considérablement 
augmenté au début des années 90, et une bonne part de ces dernières ont plus tard été 
réintroduites illégalement au pays. Dans le but de contrecarrer le marché illégal du tabac, le 
gouvernement fédéral a lancé, en 1994, une opération anti-contrebande. Il a alors abaissé les 
taxes fédérales sur les produits du tabac et par ailleurs annoncé la stratégie de réduction de la 
demande du tabac, un programme de trois ans pour le financement des modifications 
législatives, de même que des travaux de recherche et la sensibilisation du public. C'est dans 
cette optique que le Parlement a par la suite haussé l'âge légal de fumer et augmenté 
sensiblement les amendes pour vente de tabac aux mineurs. En 1994-1995, plusieurs enquêtes 
nationales ont aussi été effectuées dans le cadre d'une stratégie visant à vérifier l'impact des 
réductions de taxe sur le tabac et d'autres initiatives. Plusieurs provinces ont emboîté le pas, en 
abaissant de leur côté les taxes provinciales (principalement au Québec et en Ontario). Les taux 
des taxes sur les cigarettes paraissent au Tableau 10.9.<P>
Comparativement à ce que nous savons sur les profils individuels de la consommation d'alcool 
et les caractéristiques des buveurs, nos connaissances sur l'usage du tabac sont plutôt limitées. 
Les enquêtes sur l'ensemble de la population nous fournissent de l'information quant au nombre 
et aux caractéristiques sociodémographiques des abstinents, des anciens fumeurs et des 
fumeurs. Cependant, nous disposons de peu de données sur la quantité, la fréquence et les 
profils de l'usage, éléments qui nous permettent de mesurer l'effet global des profils de la 
consommation individuelle. Il est par conséquent difficile d'examiner les corrélats des fortes 
consommations et des comportements des fumeurs invétérés, c'est-à-dire ceux qui ne 
répondent pas aux habituels programmes de prévention anti-tabac.<P>
<H3>Aperçu des tendances et des profils de la 
consommation du tabac</H3>
Les profils et les niveaux de l'usage du tabac se sont sensiblement modifiés depuis le milieu des 
années 60. En 1994, on a dénombré quelque 6,5 millions (30 %) de fumeurs (fumeurs 
quotidiens et occasionnels) chez les 15 ans et plus. La proportion de la population qui fume a 
diminué de près de la moitié depuis 1965, mais il n'y a eu aucun changement depuis 1990. Le 
nombre de cigarettes fumées par adulte a baissé de presque autant sur la même période.<P>
TAUX ET CARACTÉRISTIQUES DES FUMEURS: La proportion des Canadiens qui ont 
déclaré fumer lors des diverses enquêtes nationales s'élevait à près de 50% en 1965,à 44 % en 
1975, à 40 % en 1981 et à 32 % en 1989 (Tableau 3.1). De ceux qui ont participé à l'Enquête 
sociale générale de 1991, 31 % ont déclaré être fumeurs; 23 %, anciens fumeurs quotidiens; et 
45 %, n'avoir jamais fumé la cigarette quotidiennement (Tableau 3.2). Les femmes et les 
hommes étaient presque aussi nombreux à fumer (30 % contre 32 %), mais les hommes 
comptaient davantage d'anciens fumeurs quotidiens (28 % contre 19 %). La plus forte 
proportion des participants ayant déclaré être fumeurs vise les 20 à 24 ans (40 %) et la plus 
faible, les 65 ans et plus(16%). La proportion de la population qui fume varie d'une province à 
l'autre (Tableau 3.3). La Nouvelle-Ecosse (35 %), Terre-Neuve (35 %), l'Alberta (34 %), et le 
Québec (33 %) présentaient des taux supérieurs au taux national. On associe le fait d'être 
fumeur actuel au niveau d'instruction inférieur et au mode de vie sédentaire (Tableau 3.4). 
Comme l'indique le Tableau 3.6, près des deux tiers (63 %) de tous les fumeurs quotidiens ont 
commencé à fumer quotidiennement avant d'avoir eu dix-huit ans. Parmi les plus jeunes fumeurs 
du groupe des 20 à 24 ans, 51 % avaient commencé à fumer sur une base quotidienne avant 16 
ans.<P>
<A HREF="/cpfig32.htm">NIVEAU DE CONSOMMATION:</A> Les données des ventes indiquent que les Canadiens ont 
consommé environ 48,0 milliards de cigarettes en 1993 (Tableau 3.7), soit 2 103 cigarettes par 
personne par année chez les 15 ans et plus. Chaque fumeur consommant quelque 19 cigarettes 
par jour, on estime qu'il en coûte par année au fumeur moyen entre 821 dollars au Québec et 2 
025 dollars à Terre-Neuve. Les cigarettes usinées constituent environ 85 % de la 
consommation globale et le tabac fine coupe, 14 %. Les cigares, le tabac à pipe et le tabac à 
priser ou à chiquer représentent moins de 2 % des ventes globales.<P>
Dans l'ensemble, 65 % des fumeurs quotidiens fument entre 11 et 25 cigarettes par jour et un 
autre 12 %, plus de 25 (Tableau 3.2). Les hommes fument davantage chaque jour que les 
femmes; ils sont 12 % à consommer 26 cigarettes ou plus chaque jour contre 8 % seulement 
chez les femmes. Côté profils d'âge, la majorité des fumeurs quotidiens de tous les groupes 
d'âge fument entre 11 et 25 cigarettes par jour, leurs taux variant entre 56 % chez les 15 à 19 
ans et 71 % chez les 25 à 44 ans. Les plus gros fumeurs sont des hommes de plus de 45 ans, 
20 % consommant plus de 25 cigarettes par jour.<P>
CARACTÉRlSTlQUES DES GROS FUMEURS: Selon les profils tirés des données 
d'enquête, les gros fumeurs quotidiens sont des hommes et des femmes d'âge moyen, biens 
nantis, possédant une instruction de niveau collégial. Les personnes plus instruites et jouissant 
d'un revenu suffisant sont moins susceptibles de fumer que les autres, mais elles ont par contre 
tendance à fumer davantage que les moins favorisés (Santé Canada, 1993). En règle générale, 
les fumeurs déclarent consommer davantage d'alcool que les nonfumeurs (5,2 consommations 
par semaine contre 3,2) et chez les fumeurs, les hommes boivent deux fois plus que les femmes 
(7,3 consommations par semaine contre 2,7). La majorité des femmes qui fument (51,8 %) 
déclarent ne pas consommer d'alcool durant la semaine (Tableau 3.5).<P>
<H3>Problèmes associés à l'usage du tabac</H3>
MORTALITÉ RELIÉE AU TABAC: Au Canada, 36 325 décès ont été indirectement imputés 
au tabagisme en 1991 (Tableau 3.8). Ce chiffre représente une baisse négligeable par rapport à 
1989, mais une hausse de 3,4 % par rapport à 1984. Les taux des décès reliés au tabac par 
100 000 habitants varient d'une province à l'autre. Les taux les plus élevés ont été enregistrés à 
l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (158,3) et en Nouvelle-Ecosse (151,2) et les plus bas, au Territoire du 
Yukon (56,4) et dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest (35,0). On évalue le nombre de ces à 
partir du nombre des décès causés par la bronchite chronique, l'asthme, l'emphysème et de 30 
% de tous les décès dus aux tumeurs, aux hémorragies cérébrales, à l'hypertension et aux 
maladies du coeur.<P>

<H3>Points saillants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>L'Enquête sociale générale indique que 69,8 % of Canadiens utilisent de l'aspirine, 8,2 % 
des narcotiques, 3,8 % des tranquillisants, 4,2 % des somniferes, et 2,5 % des antidépresseurs. 
En 1994, le nombre des prescriptions émises pour des drogues psychothérapeutiques a 
augmenté de 4,0 % et celui des prescriptions d'analgésiques de 0,7 % par rapport à l'année 
précédente.
<LI>Entre 1989 et 1993, la proportion des Canadiens qui ont utilisé des stupéfiants a reculé de 
6,5 % à 4,2 % dans le cas du cannabis et de 1,4 % à 0,3 % dans le cas de la cocaine, alors 
qu'elle est demeuré relativement stable dans le cas du LSD, du speed ou de l'héroïne (0,4 % en 
1989 contre 0,3 % en 1993).
<LI>En 1992, les forces policières canadiennes ont saisi 115 081 kg de cannabis, 5 285 kg de 
cocaïne et 85 kg d'héroïne. On a déclaré 1 321 vols et autres pertes concernant les narcotiques 
et les drogues contrôlées et détecté 2 170 fausses ordonnances.
<LI>En 1990-1991, les hôpitaux généraux et psychiatriques ont traité 21 746 cas reliés à la 
drogue (78,2 congés par 100 000 habitants).
<LI>En 1991, on a dénombré 510 décès reliés à la drogue au Canada; 10,8 % imputables à 
des troubles mentaux associés à la drogue et les autres à divers types d'empoisonnement.
</UL>
SOURCES D INFORMATION: Au Canada, contrairement à l'alcool, l'usage des drogues 
licites et illicites demeure mal documenté, ce qui pose des difficultés pour l'analyse des profils et 
des problèmes. Les ventes des drogues d'ordonnance ne sont pas contrôlées sur une base 
nationale, et peu d'informations existent sur la disponibilité des drogues illégales. Les enquêtes 
apparaissent donc comme la meilleure source d'information. <P>
Les enquêtes sur l'usage de la drogue sont cependant limitées, car les mesures d'«utilisation» 
ayant cours compliquent la quantification et partant, la précision des profils et des niveaux de 
consommation (p. ex., quantité et fréquence de l'utilisation, pureté de la drogue, importance de 
la dose et problèmes) ou encore leur lien avec les problèmes éprouvés par les divers segments 
de la société. Alors que le concept de la consommation standard (c.-à-d. une bouteille de bière; 
une consommation d'une boisson fortement alcoolisée, pure ou mélangée; ou un verre de vin) 
constitue un trait commun des enquêtes sur l'alcool, on ne dispose d'aucune unité de mesure 
analogue pour l'usage des drogues illicites ou des drogues d'ordonnance. Il n'existe pas 
suffisamment non plus d'indicateurs directs des ventes ni des profils de distribution. Le contrôle 
de la disponibilité des drogues et de leurs effets sur les usagers s'appuie presque uniquement sur 
des mesures indirectes. Les outils à l'appui, soit les enquêtes sur la prévalence, les registres de 
toxicomanes, les rapports des médecins légistes sur les décès imputables aux drogues, la 
criminalité en matière de stupéfiants, les saisies de drogues, et les enquêtes auprès des victimes, 
ne permettent de développer que des profils limités de l'usage des drogues illicites.<P>
L'NFORMATION PRÉSENTÉE CI-APRÈS PROVIENT DE QUATRE SOURCES: (1) 
l'Enquête sociale générale de 1993; (2) les statistiques sur les saisies et les détournements, du 
Bureau de la surveillance des médicaments; (3) les congés des hôpitaux, du Centre canadien de 
l'information sur la santé; et (4) les causes des décès, de Statistique Canada.<P>
<H3>Les drogues licites</H3>
PROFLLS D'UTILISATION: L'Enquête sociale générale de 1993 a permis de recueillir de 
l'information sur l'aspirine et d'autres analgésiques, et sur cinq catégories de drogues 
d'ordonnance: somnifères, tranquillisants, amphétamines et stimulants, antidépresseurs, et 
analgésiques narcotiques (Single et coll., 1994). Dans le cadre de cette enquête, on avait posé 
aux participants diverses questions sur leur usage de ces substances durant le mois précédent. 
Or les résultats ont démontré que l'usage des drogues licites est plus faible chez les groupes des 
niveaux d'instruction et de revenu supérieurs (Tableau 4.1). Les tranquillisants, les somnifères et 
les antidépresseurs ont davantage utilisés par les Canadiens au plus faible revenu et les moins 
instruits. Ceux qui jouissent d'un niveau d'instruction ou d'un revenu supérieur tendent utiliser 
davantage de narcotiques d'ordonnance et l'aspirine. L'usage des drogues licites ne révèle 
aucune tendance précise quant à la profession.<P>
ASPIRINE: La drogue licite la plus largement utilisée par les Canadiens, soit 69,8 % des 
adultes, est l'aspirine (Tableau 4.1). Les femmes sont plus nombreuses à en faire usage que les 
hommes (75,1 % contre 64,2 %). Les plus hauts taux d'utilisation vont aux groupes des 18 et 
19 ans (74,5 %) et des 35 à 44 ans (72,9).  Les plus susceptibles d'en faire usage sont les 
personnes divorcées ou séparées (71,3 %) et les moins susceptibles, celles qui sont veuves 
(65,2 %). Le plus faible taux d'utilisation au cours du mois précédent revenait à ceux possédant 
un niveau d'instruction inférieur au secondaire (66 %) et le plus haut, à ceux qui avaient terminé 
l'université (73,0 %). Sur le plan régional, c'est le Québec qui a déclaré le plus faible taux 
d'utilisation d'aspirine avec 59,1 %, contre 74,0 % et 72,3 % respectivement dans les Prairies 
et en Colombie-Britannique.<P>
CODÉINE, DEMEROL ET MORPHINE: Dans 1'ensemble, 8,2 % des Canadiens adultes ont 
utilisé un narcotique (c.-à-d. codéine, Demerol, et morphine) le mois précédant l'Enquête 
sociale générale (Tableau 4.1). Ils sont moins nombreux à utiliser les narcotiques en bas de 55 
ans, principalement entre 25 et 34 ans (11,0 %). La codéine, le Demerol et la morphine sont 
surtout utilisés par les personnes divorcées ou séparées (9,1 %) et le moins utilisés par les 
personnes veuves (6,0 %). Les groupes les plus nombreux à en faire usage sont ceux à revenus 
faible et moyen (10,3 %), et les moins nombreux, ceux à revenus supérieurs (7,3 %). Les 
femmes (9,0 %) sont plus nombreuses à les utiliser que les hommes (7,4 %). C'est en 
Colombie-Britannique (12,4 %) que lton consomme le plus de narcotiques et au Québec, le 
moins (3,2 %).<P>
TRANQUILLISANTS SOMNIFÈRES ET ANTIDÉPRESSEURS: Au Canada, on utilise peu 
de tranquillisants (3,8 %), de somnifères (4,2 %) et d'antidépresseurs (2,5 %) <A HREF="/cpfig41.htm">(Figure 4.1).</A>
L'usage des tranquillisants et des somnifères tend à croître avec l'âge des usagers: ce sont les 
plus de 75 ans qui en utilisent le plus (10,6 % des tranquillisants; 20,1 % des somniferes). Il 
n'existe aucun profil d'âge précis quant à l'usage des antidépresseurs, le plus haut taux 
d'utilisation revenant au groupe des 45 à 54 ans (4,0 %). Les femmes (3,4 %) sont plus 
susceptibles que les hommes (1,6 %) d'en faire usage.<P>
L'usage des tranquillisants, des somnifères et des antidépresseurs diminue au fur et à mesure que 
les revenus augmentent. Le plus haut taux d'utilisation des tranquillisants (7,8 %) et des 
antidépresseurs (5,5 %) revient aux groupes au revenu le plus faible et celui des somniferes à 
ceux qui affichent la tranche de revenu faible à moyen. Les plus hauts taux vont à ceux dont le 
niveau d'instruction est inférieur au secondaire (6,2 % pour les tranquillisants, 6,5 % pour les 
somnifères et 3,0 % pour les antidépresseurs). A l'échelle régionale, on fait un plus grand usage 
de tranquillisants (7,1 %) et de somniferes (6,1 %) au Québec qu'ailleurs au pays. Quant aux 
antidépresseurs, leur usage demeure sensiblement le même d'une région à l'autre.<P>
AMPHÉTAMINES: Moins de 1 % de la population canadienne (0,6 %) utilise des 
amphétamines (Tableau 4.1). Ces drogues attirent les jeunes de 15 à 17 ans (1,0 %) et de 20 à 
24 ans (1,3%), les célibataires (1,0 %), les personnes de revenu moyen (1,0 %), les personnes 
semi-spécialisées (1,0 %), et celles qui cherchent un travail (1,3 %). Sur le plan régional, les 
plus hauts taux d'utilisateurs vont aux Maritimes (1,1 %) et à la Colombie-Britannique (1,0 
%).<P>
TAUX D'UTILISATION: Les chiffres réels quant au nombre des prescriptions et des ventes 
globales des drogues d'ordonnance ne sont pas disponibles, mais il existe en revanche de 
l'information sur les proportions des drogues prescrites par le corps médical (Therriault, 1994). 
On sait ainsi que parmi les <A HREF="/cpfig42.htm">dix grandes catégories de drogues thérapeutiques d'ordonnance,</A> ce 
sont les cardio-vasculaires qui sont les plus prescrites (12,7 % de toutes les prescriptions), 
suivies par les anti-infectueux (12,1 %), les psychothérapeutiques (9,7 %), les analgésiques (8,6 
%), les hormones (7,5 %), les bronchothérapeutiques (5,1 %), les antirhumatismaux (4,8 %), 
les antiarthritiques (4,5 %), les contraceptifs (4,1 %) et les diurétiques (4,0 %) (Figure 4.2). En 
1993-1994, ces dix classes de drogues ont représenté 73,1 % de toutes les prescriptions 
émises et 65,5 % des ventes de drogues globales (Therriault, 1994). Pour la période de douze 
mois prenant fin en juillet 1994, le total des ordonnances émises au Canada a augmenté de 1,4 
%. Le nombre émis pour les hormones (+6,0 %), les anti-infectueux (+4,3 %), les 
bronchothérapeutiques (+4,3 %), les antispasmodiques (+4,1 %) et les psychothérapeutiques 
(+4,0 %) a augmenté par rapport à l'année précédente.<P>
<H3>Les drogues illicites</H3>
PROFILS D'UTILISATION: Une importante proportion de Canadiens admettent utiliser des 
drogues illicites. En fait, un adulte sur cinq, soit quatre millions deux cent mille personnes, a 
utilisé une substance illicite au moins une fois dans sa vie. La plus populaire est le cannabis 
(marihuana ou haschich); 20 % (4 250 000) des adultes ont déclaré en avoir déjà consommé 
(Adlaf, 1993). Trois pour cent (640 000) ont déjà utilisé de la cocaine ou du «crack», 3 % du 
LSD, 2 % (427 000) des amphétamines (speed) et moins de 1 % (213 400) de l'héroine. Au 
cours des cinq dernières années, les Canadiens ont utilisé moins de toutes les drogues chaque 
année, principalement le cannabis et la cocaïne (Tableau 4.2).<P>
CANNABIS: L'usage du cannabis est tombé de 6,5 % en 1989 à 4,2 % en 1993 (Tableau 
4.2). Ce recul ressort nettement chez les adultes, malgré que l'usage chez les jeunes de 15 à 19 
ans ait augmenté, passant de 9 % en 1990 à 10,3 % en 1993 (Tableau 4.3). A l'échelle du 
pays, la tendance à la baisse a marqué toutes les régions (Tableau 4.4). Elle s'est révélée 
particulièrement importante en Colombie-Britannique où l'usage est passé de 9,6 % en 1989 à 
6,0 % en 1993. La seule exception observée concerne l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard, où l'usage a 
augmenté à 5,4 % alors qu'il était de 4,0 % en 1990.<P>
COCAINE: Les autres drogues illicites telles la cocaïne sont nettement moins populaires auprès 
des Canadiens que ne l'est le cannabis. En 1990, seulement 3 % environ de tous les Canadiens 
avaient déjà essayé la cocaïne. (Adlaf, 1993). Entre 1989 et 1993, la proportion de ceux qui 
ont utilisé de la cocaïne l'année précédente est tombée de 1,4 % à 0,3 % (Tableau 4.2). Ce 
recul était évident chez les moins de 19 ans (1,9 % en 1989 contre 0,9 % en 1993), les 20 à 24 
ans (3,1 % en 1989 contre 1,0 % en 1993) et les 25 à 34 ans (3,3 % en 1989 contre 0,6 % en 
1993) (Tableau 4.3). Sur le plan régional, on observe que moins de gens utilisaient de la 
cocaïne au Québec (2,0 % en 1990 contre 0,6 % en 1993), en Ontario (1,1 % en 1990 contre 
0,1 % en 1993), en Alberta (1,1 % en 1990 contre 0,1 % en 1993) et en Colombie-
Britannique (2,1 % en 1990 contre 0,8 % en 1993) (Tableau 4.4).<P>
LSD, SPEED ET HÉROÏNE: Malgré quelques changements, la proportion des Canadiens qui 
avait utilisé du LSD, du speed ou de l'héroïne l'année précédente est demeurée pratiquement 
inchangée entre 1989 (0,4 %) et 1993 (0,3 %) (Tableau 4,2). Les 15 à 19 ans ont été moins 
nombreux à en utiliser en 1993 (1,7 %) par rapport à 1989 (2,1 %), contrairement aux 20 à 24 
ans dont les taux sont passés de 0,0 % en 1989 à 1,0 % en 1993 (Tableau 4.3). Ces drogues 
sont relativement peu populaires dans tout le pays, mais leur usage est plus élevé en Nouvelle-
Ecosse (0,8 %), à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (0,6 %) et en Colombie-Britannique (0,6 %). Terre-
Neuve est la seule province où aucun usage de LSD, de speed ou d'héroine n'a été déclaré 
(Tableau 4.4).<P>
En règle générale, les drogues illicites ont surtout la faveur des Canadiens aux revenus les plus 
faibles, hors du marché du travail (notamment ceux qui cherchent un emploi ou les étudiants), 
qui vivent dans les grands centres urbains et qui habitent la côte ouest du pays (Tableau 4.5). 
Au Canada, les principaux consommateurs de drogues illicites sont normalement les jeunes. 
Bien que ces drogues soient surtout consommées par les 16 et 17 ans, les jeunes commencent à 
en faire usage dès qu'ils ont entre 12 et 15 ans. En Ontario, 12,7 % des élèves des 7e, 9e, 11e, 
et 13e années déclarent avoir fait l'expérience du cannabis au moins une fois (Adlaf et coll. 
1993). En Colombie-Britannique, 23,1 % avaient utilisé ce produit l'année précédente (British 
Columbia Ministry of Health and Ministry Responsible for Seniors, 1992). En Alberta, plus de 
un adolescent sur cinq (19,3 %) a déclaré avoir essayé le cannabis, un sur dix (10,5 %) des 
hallucinogènes, et un sur neuf (8,9 %) des amphétamines ou des stimulants (Bertrand et coll., 
1994). Moins de 3 % des élèves déclarent avoir utilisé des narcotiques au moins une fois et 
près de 6 % de la colle et des solvants.<P>
<H3>Approvisionnement et distribution des drogues 
illicites</H3>
L'usage des drogues illicites par la population en général peut découler directement de leur 
disponibilité dans la société (ONU, 1994). Les statistiques sur les saisies de drogues présentées 
ci-après représentent du mesures indirectes de leur trafic, telles qu'elles sont déclarées par le 
Bureau de la surveillance des médicaments (BSM, 1994) et la Gendarmerie royale du 
Canada(GRC, 1994).<P>
CANNABIS: Le cannabis, sous ses diverses formes, constitue la drogue la plus largement 
répandue au Canada. En 1992, les forces policières du pays ont saisi un total de 115 081 kg de 
cannabis, une baisse de 14 % depuis 1991 (134 296 kg) (Tableau 4.6). Elles ont aussi saisi 
quelque 98 865 kg de marihuana, 15 797 kg de haschich et 419 kg de haschich liquide. La 
marihuana était disponible dans toutes les régions du pays, surtout au Québec (37 905 kg), plus 
particulièrement à Montréal, Trois-Rivières, Sherbrooke et Québec (Tableau 4.7), en 
ColombieBritannique (33 659 kg), où les plus importantes ont eu lieu à Vancouver et à 
Victoria, et en Ontario (20 108 kg), où des saisies ont été effectuées à Toronto, Hamilton, 
London et St. Catharines. On a aussi procédé à d'importantes saisies en Nouvelle-Ecosse (2 
085 kg) et au Nouveau-Branswick (1 210 kg). Quelque 871 kg de marihuana ont par ailleurs 
été saisis à Calgary.<P>
Même si la quantité globale de cannabis saisie a régressé en 1992, le nombre total des saisies a 
en revanche accusé une hausse (31 416 en 1991 contre 32 630 en 1992). Les niveaux de THC 
du cannabis ont également augmenté, le niveau le plus élevé de la marihuana s'établissant à 12 
%, avec une moyenne de 3,1 %. Pour ce qui est du haschich, le niveau de THC le plus élevé 
atteignait alors 15 %, avec une moyenne de 6,3 %, et celui du haschich liquide 35 %, avec une 
moyenne de 12 % (GRC, 1994).<P>
COCAÏNE: En 1992, la quantité de cocaine saisie (5 285 kg) a considérablement augmenté 
par rapport à 1991 (1 696 kg). Sur le plan régional, les plus importantes saisies ont eu lieu au 
Québec (4 901 kg) et en Ontario (226 kg) (Tableau 4.6). Les grands centres les plus touchés 
par le trafic de la drogue en 1992 furent Trois-Rivières (3 920 kg), Montréal (345 kg), Toronto 
(191 kg) et Vancouver (58 kg) (Tableau 4.7). La pureté de la cocaïne est demeurée stable, 
mais les prix de la rue sont tombés de 25 % à certains endroits. En 1992, le prix de 1 
kilogramme de cocaine pure variait entre 25 000 $ et 65 000 $. Le prix de détail d'une once de 
cocaine (pureté de 60 %) se situait entre 1 000 $ et 3 000 $ (Tableau 7.13).<P>
HÉROÏNE: Les saisies d'héroïne ont sensiblement diminué en 1992 (85 kg) par rapport à 1991 
(119 kg). Elles ont été effectuées presque exclusivement en Ontario (32 kg), au Québec (26 
kg) et en Colombie-Britannique (26 kg) (Tableau 4.6). La baisse la plus notable visait l'Ontario, 
où les quantités saisies ont atteint plus de 65 kg en 1991. La majorité des saisies ont eu lieu à 
Montréal, Toronto et Vancouver (Tableau 4.7). La pureté de l'héroïne s'est maintenue entre 
1991 et 1992. En fait elle est demeurée élevée, soit entre 50 % et 97 % sur le marché de gros 
et entre 10 % et 18 % sur le marché de détail (GRC, 1994).<P>
DROGUES CHIMIQUES: En 1992, d'importantes quantités de stimulants, d'hallucinogènes, 
de stéroides anabolisants et de produits pharmaceutiques détournés ont été saisies (Tableau 
4.6, Tableau 4.7). Le LSD est largement disponible dans tout le Canada, surtout au Québec 
(23,5 kg), en Ontario (5,5 kg), et en Colombie-Britannique (7,59 kg). Les plus importantes 
saisies de LSD ont eu lieu au Québec, principalement à Chicoutimi-Jonquière (6,3 kg), à 
Québec (6,5 kg), et à Montréal (9,4 kg) (Tableau 4.7). La phencyclidine (PCP) était plus 
accessible en 1992, surtout dans les provinces de l'ouest. D'importantes saisies ont été 
effectuées en Colombie-Britannique, en Saskatchewan et en Alberta (GRC, 1994). Le centre 
de production et de distribution de la PCP se situait au Québec.<P>
<H3>Détournement des drogues licites vers les marchés 
illicites</H3>
APERÇU: Le détournement des drogues licites désigne toute action illégale visant à obtenir des 
drogues à partir du réseau officiel de distribution (Clark, 1992; Archer, 1984). Les pertes de 
produits en transit subies par les fabricants légaux de drogues, les vols par effraction, les vols à 
la sauvette, les vols à mains armées et le chapardage par le personnel des pharmacies sont 
autant de sources de détournement (Clark, 1992). Les médecins et les patients participent aussi 
à cette activité lorsque ces derniers obtiennent illégalement des médecins des drogues pour 
usage personnel ou pour revente sur le marché illicite (Clark, 1992).<P>
En 1992, on a déclaré 1 321 <A HREF="/cpfig43.htm">vols et autres pertes de narcotiques et de drogues contrôlées 
(Figure 4.3).</A> Plus de la moitié (55,9 %) de ces vols concernaient des pharmacies, près de un 
tiers (30,7 %) des hôpitaux et 10,4 % des revendeurs autorisés. Les plus gros vols de 
narcotiques incluent les comprimés de codéine (915 014) et la codéine liquide (219 335 ml), 
l'hydrocodone liquide (300 793 ml), les comprimés de mépéridine (70 084), les comprimés de 
morphine (97 568) et la morphine liquide (65 189 ml), ainsi que les comprimés d'oxycodone 
(307 248). Les plus grandes quantités de drogues contrôlées volées en 1992 visaient les 
comprimés de méthylphénidate (51 356), les capsules de phentermine (17 162), les comprimés 
de barbituriques (150 592), et les comprimés de stéroïdes (4 800) (voir le Tableau 12.24). Sur 
le plan régional, les vols les plus importants se sont produits en Ontario (47,3 %), puis en 
Alberta (17,2 56), au Québec (15,3 96) et en Colombie-Britannique (8,7 %) (voir le Tableau 
12.23).<P>
Les ordonnances falsifiées constituent un autre aspect du détournement des drogues. En 1992, 
2 170 fausses ordonnances ont été relevées à travers le pays, 2 018 pour des narcotiques et 
152 pour des drogues contrôlées (voir le Tableau 12.25). Celles établies pour les narcotiques 
concernaient principalement la codéine (n=994),1'oxycodone (n=495) et l'hydromorphone 
(n=159), et pour les drogues contrôlées, la phentermine (n=37), les amphétamines (n=34) et le 
secobarbital (n=29).<P>
<H3>Problèmes associés à l'usage des drogues licites et 
illicites</H3>
MORBIDITÉ: La présente partie fournit de l'information sur les personnes traitées dans les 
hôpitaux généraux ou psychiatriques et dont le diagnostic premier est associé à la drogue. Au 
Canada, la classification des maladies adoptée par les hôpitaux (Classification internationale des 
maladies, 9e édition) n'établit aucune distinction entre les problèmes dus aux drogues licites et 
aux drogues illicites. Elle indique uniquement la catégorie de la drogue utilisée. Dans certains 
cas, elle présente les problèmes dus aux drogues licites et illicites sous une même catégorie. Elle 
fait aussi abstraction des cas où les problèmes de drogue constituent des facteurs de 
complication à d'autres problèmes plus graves (non reliés à la drogue).<P>
Ainsi, un cas d'empoisonnement dû à l'héroine serait classifié dans la catégorie des 
empoisonnements dus aux analgésiques, aux antipyrétiques et aux antirhurnatismaux comprenant 
opiats et narcotiques connexes (ICD-9 965.0). Cette catégorie inclut non seulement l'héroïne 
mais aussi les drogues telles la codéine, la morphine, la méthadone et l'opium. En fondant les 
rapports sur cette classification, il devient impossible d'établir une distinction entre les problèmes 
de santé imputables aux drogues licites et ceux imputables aux drogues illicites.<P>
Au Canada, cette difficulté d'établir une distinction entre les problèmes de santé reliés à la 
drogue est accrue du fait que les ressources en traitement n'appliquent pas le même système de 
déclaration que dans les hôpitaux généraux. Dans certaines provinces, l'information sur le 
traitement n'est pas disponible. En Ontario, on réalise une enquête sur les services de traitement 
à tous les trois ans pour vérifier le nombre et la nature des problèmes éprouvés par les usagers 
du système. Cette étude porte aussi sur la capacité du système de santé de répondre 
adéquatement aux besoins de la population.<P>
En 1990-1991, on a dénombré 21 746 congés des hôpitaux généraux et psychiatriques de 
patients souffrant de troubles reliés à la drogue, soit 78,2 congés par 100 000 habitants 
(Tableaux 4.8 et 4.9). Ce taux est légèrement inférieur à celui des années passées, étant de 82,2 
en 1987-1988 et de 78,6 en 1990-1991 (Tableau 4.9). Un tiers environ (33,5 %) (7 290 
congés) de tous les congés des cas associés à la drogue concernent des cas de troubles 
mentaux (psychoses, syndrome de dépendance à la drogue et abus de drogue sans 
dépendance). La dépendance à la drogue était un facteur dans plus de la moitié (60,0 %) des 
congés associés aux troubles mentaux. Seulement 6,9 % de tous les cas reliés à la drogue sont 
traités dans les hôpitaux psychiatriques (Tableau 4.11).<P>
Les 66,5 % restants des congés des hôpitaux reliés à la drogue étaient des cas traités pour 
empoisonnements dus à des drogues d'ordonnance. Sur tous les congés, 29,3 % concernaient 
des empoisonnements dus aux analgésiques, aux antipyrétiques et aux antirhumatismaux, et 28,7 
%, des empoisonnements dus aux agents psychotropes.<P>
En 1990-1991, les femmes représentaient 56,4 % de tous les congés des hôpitaux associés à 
des cas de drogue. Elles affichaient dans l'ensemble des taux de congés plus élevés pour les 
empoisonnements reliés à la drogue, tandis que les hommes présentaient des taux plus élevés 
pour les troubles mentaux reliés à la drogue.<P>
Les plus hauts taux de congés des cas associés à la drogue revenaient aux 15 à 19 ans (162,5 
par 100 000), puis aux 20 à 24 ans (122,8 par 100 000) et aux 25 à 34 ans (117,9 par 100 
000) (Figure 4.4). Les congés concernant les cas de drogue ont régressé chez les moins de 15 
ans et chez les plus de 65 ans. Les personnes de plus de 75 ans affichent les plus hauts taux de 
congés pour psychoses dues à la drogue (9,7 par 100 000), empoisonnements dus aux 
analgésiques, aux antipyrétiques et aux antirhumatismaux (10,2 par 100 000), aux sédatifs et 
aux hypnotiques (7,0 par 100 000). <P>
Les taux de congés des hôpitaux reliés à la drogue varient d'une région à l'autre du pays. En 
1990-1991, le plus bas taux des congés associés aux psychoses toxicomaniaques revenait au 
Québec (2,4 par 100 000) et le plus haut, à l'Alberta (10,0 par 100 000). Les plus hauts taux 
de congés associés à la dépendance de la drogue allaient à la Nouvelle-Ecosse (24,1 par 100 
000) et au Québec (23,5 par 100 000) et les plus bas, au Manitoba (4,2 par 100 000). Pour 
ce qui est de l'abus de drogue sans dépendance, les plus hauts taux étaient imputables à la 
Nouvelle-Ecosse (14,1 par 100 000), et les plus bas, au Québec (3,9 par 100 000) (Tableau 
4.10).<P>
Bien que le taux global des congés dus à des complications de grossesse et d'accouchement soit 
faible dans tout le pays, les taux sont nettement plus élevés en Colombie-Britannique qu'ailleurs 
au Canada (1,7 par 100 000). Les taux des empoisonnements dus aux analgésiques, aux 
antipyrétiques et aux antirhumatismaux sont considérablement plus élevés dans les provinces de 
l'ouest, nommément en Saskatchewan (34,8 par 100 000), en Alberta (33,9 par 100 000) et en 
Colombie-Britannique (32,8 par 100 000), que dans les autres régions du pays. Quant aux taux 
applicables aux cas d'empoisonnement dû aux sédatifs et aux hypnotiques, ils sont plus faibles 
que pour les autres catégories, mais néanmoins plus élevés en Saskatchewan (10,1 par 100 
000) et à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (9,9 par 100 000). Ceux des empoisonnements dus aux 
agents psychotropes sont plus élevés à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (35,1 par 100 000), au 
Nouveau-Brunswick (34,6 par 100 000) et en Colombie-Britannique (31,6 par 100 000). Le 
plus bas taux revient au Québec, avec 12,0 congés par 100 000 habitants.<P>
MORTALITÉ: Il n'est pas simple d'évaluer la mortalité reliée aux drogues. Même s'il existe 
diverses méthodes épidémiologiques permettant de déterminer les décès indirectement 
imputables à l'usage de l'alcool et du tabac, il existe peu de méthodes analogues pour les autres 
substances. Deux mesures de la mortalité sont présentées ci-après. Bien que les deux s'appuient 
sur les critères servant à établir la «cause sous-jacente du décès», la première se fonde sur la 
nature du traumatisme et la seconde, sur la cause extrinsèque du décès.<P>
En 1991, on a dénombré 510 décès reliés aux drogues (licites et illicites) au Canada (Tableau 
4.12), 10,8 % (55 décès) étant imputables aux troubles mentaux, et le reste à divers types 
d'empoisonnement, dont 46,1 % aux empoisonnements par les analgésiques, les antipyrétiques 
et les antirhumatismaux. Un décès sur trois (33,3 %) était imputable aux empoisonnements dus 
aux agents psychotropes et un sur dix (9,8 %), à ceux causés par les sédatifs et les hypnotiques. 
La plus forte hausse enregistrée entre 1990 (82 décès) et 1991 (133 décès) était imputable aux 
empoisonnements dus aux opiacés et aux narcotiques connexes. En 1991, 60,4 % des cas de 
décès imputables aux drogues étaient des hommes (Tableau 4.12). Ces derniers ont accusé un 
plus grand nombre d'empoisonnements dus aux drogues, mais les femmes ont été plus 
nombreuses à décéder d'empoisonnements dus aux salicylates et aux analgésiques aromatiques. 
Quant au nombre de décès imputables aux empoisonnements dus aux antidépresseurs, il était 
sensiblement le même chez les hommes (59 décès) et chez les femmes (62 décès).<P>
Les plus hauts taux de décès reliés aux drogues visent les 35 à 44 ans (3,7 par 100 000), puis 
les 25 à 34 ans (2,6 par 100 000) et les 45 à 54 (2,3 par 100 000) (Tableau 4.13). Le profil 
d'âge des hommes suit celui de l'ensemble de la population, mais celui des femmes diffère, les 
plus hauts taux s'appliquant aux 35 à 44 ans (2,9 par 100 000), puis aux 55 à 59 ans (2,6 par 
100 000) et aux plus de 75 ans (2,1 par 100 000) (Tableau 4.13). Sur le plan régional, c'est en 
Colombie-Britannique (173 décès) que l'on enregistre le plus grand nombre de décès reliés à la 
drogue, puis en Ontario (142 décès), en Alberta (98 décès) et au Québec (36 décès) (Tableau 
4.14).<P>
En 1991, on a relevé 438 cas où la drogue constituait la cause extrinsèque du décès, soit une 
hausse de 20,0 % sur 1990 (Tableau 4.15). Près de la moitié (46,8 %) de ces décès étaient 
imputables au suicide et 44,5 %, à une cause accidentelle. Un décès sur onze (8,7 %) n'a pu 
être classé comme le fait d'un accident ou d'un geste volontaire.<P>
Sept décès attribuables à une cause accidentelle sur dix (69,7 %) étaient causés par un 
empoisonnement dû aux analgésiques, aux antipyrétiques et aux antirhumatismaux, 23,1 % par 
un empoisonnement aux agents psychotropes et 7,2 %, à un empoisonnement dû aux sédatifs et 
aux hypnotiques. Dans l'ensemble, la proportion des décès ayant les drogues comme cause 
extrinsèque était plus élevée chez les hommes (60,5 %) que chez les femmes (39,5 %). Le 
facteur drogue était plus présent chez les 35 à 44 ans (31,7 %), les 25 à 34 ans (25,3 %) et les 
45 à 54 ans (14,2 %) que chez les autres groupes (Tableau 4.15; Tableau 4.16). La plus forte 
proportion des décès reliés aux drogues imputables à une cause extrinsèque revenait à la 
Colombie-Britannique (34,0 %), puis à l'Ontario (29,2 %) et à l'Alberta (16,7 %) (Tableau 
4.17).<P>

<UL>
<LI>Les jeunes Autochtones sont de 2 à 6 fois plus vulnérables aux problèmes reliés à l'alcool 
que les autres jeunes.
<LI>La majorité des Autochtones canadiens fument, dont la moitié quotidiennement.
<LI>Un jeune Autochtone sur cinq a déjà utilisé des solvants. Un tiers de ces usagers ont moins 
de 15 ans et plus de la moitié ont commencé avant l'âge de 11 ans.

Il n'est pas facile de brosser un tableau national de l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues chez 
les Autochtones. Les affiliations tribales, la répartition régionale, le contact européen et la 
structure communautaire compliquent les études d'épidémiologie traditionnelles (Scott, 1994). 
Quantité de données existent sur les Autochtones des réserves, mais 40 % environ des 
Autochtones vivent hors réserve et sont ainsi exclus des services de santé et de toxicomanie 
gouvernementaux. Il est donc impossible d'obtenir un tableau complet de leur situation. Les 
données sur leur usage des substances proviennent surtout d'enquêtes, lesquelles ils 
désapprouvent puisqu'elles constituent une intrusion dans leur vie privée et que l'information 
recueillie sert rarement à améliorer leur sort (Scott, 1994; LeCavalier et McKenzie, 1993).<P>
Par ailleurs, vu l'isolement et la diversité des comportements à haut risque qui caractérisent ces 
collectivités, les méthodes traditionnellement utilisées pour évaluer les problèmes d'alcool et de 
drogue conviennent peu à leur étude. Selon Scott (1994), cela serait le cas notamment de la 
mesure Jellinek, qui fonde le dénombrement des alcooliques au sein d'une population donnée 
sur les décès dus à la cirrhose du foie; or, les Autochtones ne vivent pas suffisamment vieux 
pour mourir de cette affection. Il recommande plutôt la méthode Fiddler (1985), qui pose 
comme premier indicateur d'abus la mort violente.<P>
Il existe néanmoins de nombreuses données nationales. C'est le cas de l'information sur la 
morbidité reliée à l'alcool recueillie au moyen du Système de production de rapports sur les 
activités de traitement (SPRAT) des Autochtones, exploité par la Direction générale des 
services médicaux de Santé Canada. Les centres participant sont non médicaux, résidentiels, et 
sensibles aux besoins culturels (Scott, 1994). Cette base exclut les Autochtones hors réserves. 
L'enquête de Statistique Canada <I>Langue, tradition, santé. habitudes de vie et 
préocupations sociales </I>réalisée auprès des peuples autochtones des réserves, en 1991, 
constitue une autre source d'information. Selon Statistique Canada, même si le taux de réponse 
à l'enquête a atteint 77 % (135 600 suiets), la fréquence de la consommation d'alcool déclarée 
serait inférieure à la réalité (Douglas, 1993). Hormis le fait que la consommation des plus gros 
buveurs est normalement sous-évaluée à cause de leur tendance à ne pas tout déclarer, le taux 
de non-réponse de 23 % et l'exclusion de l'échantillon de soixante-dix-huit collectivités minent la 
valeur de l'enquête. Ainsi, les estimations de la consommation seront vraisemblablement assez 
faibles.<P>
L'enquête de 1993 sur l'abus des solvants par les jeunes des Premières Nations et les jeunes 
Inuit représente aussi une source majeure d'information. Ses données favorisent le 
développement de programmes de traitement appropriés (Kaweionnehta Human Resource 
Group, 1993). On a par ailleurs établi des profils communautaires des jeunes connus pour leur 
abus de ces substances, et des comités d'informateurs ont préparé des listes des moins de 25 
ans vivant dans la collectivité et faisant abus de ces produits. Les données sont ventilée selon 
l'utilisation, l'âge, le sexe, les autres substances utilisées et d'autres problèmes et caratéristiques 
(Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). Des 631 collectivités des Premières Nations 
invitées à participer, seulement un tiers ont répondu, fournissant de l'information sur 1 248 
utilisateurs connus de solvents. L'information ci-après s'appuie sur ces trois sources.<P>
L'USAGE DE L'ALCOOL: Selon une enquête de 1991 auprès des habitants des réserves, 67 
% de ceux qui se réclament d'identité autochtone étaient buveurs; 14,4 %, anciens buveurs; et 
14,8 %, n'avaient jamais bu (Statistique Canada, 1993). Sur le plan régional, le plus haut taux 
des buveurs a été enregistré à Terre-Neuve (71 %), et les plus bas à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard 
(54,8 %) et en Nouvelle-Ecosse (56,9 %) (Tableau 5.1).<P>
Plus de 60 % des buveurs ont déclaré consommer moins de deux fois par mois, mais 35 %, 
régulièrement (Statistique Canada, 1993). Quelque 19 % ont déclaré consommer une fois par 
semaine environ; 11 %, de 2 à 3 fois; et 3 %, de 4 à 6 fois. Moins de 2 % consommaient à tous 
les jours. On ignore la quantité d'alcool consommée par occasion et les contextes de 
consommation. C'est en Colombie-Britannique et en Ontario que l'on a observé les plus hauts 
taux de buveurs quotidiens avec (21 %) et (19 %) respectivement.<P>
L'USAGE DU TABAC: La majorité des Autochtones vivant dans les réserves (55 %) fument; 
42 % environ sont anciens fumeurs ou n'ont jamais fumé (Tableau 5.2). Quelque 44 % fument 
quotidiennement. Les plus hauts taux de fumeurs quotidiens vont aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest 
(59,3 %) et à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (55 %), et les plus bas, à la Colombie-Britannique (33,7 
%) et à l'Ontario (40,7 %). Trente-deux pour cent des fumeurs quotidiens fument de 1 à 10 
cigarettes par jour; 40 %, de 11 à 20; et 27 %, plus de 21.<P>
L'USAGE DES DROGUES: Très peu de données existent sur l'usage des drogues chez les 
Autochtones canadiens. La source la plus complète dont on dispose à ce jour est l'enquête 
réalisée par le Yukon en 1990 sur l'usage de l'alcool et des drogues. Ce territoire connaît le plus 
haut taux d'usage d'alcool et d'autres drogues au pays et, selon cette enquête, 47 %, ou près de 
la moitié des Autochtones y ont déclaré avoir déjà utilisé de la marijuana, dont 16 % l'année 
précédente, soit près de deux fois plus que dans le reste du Canada (23 % et 7 % 
respectivement). La grande majorité des usagers de marijuana (90 %) consomment aussi de 
l'alcool, et les gros buveurs font un usage plus fréquent de marijuana que les buveurs légers. 
Seize pour cent des Autochtones déclarent avoir déjà utilisé de la cocaïne contre 4 % chez les 
non-Autochtones. Au Yukon, 18 % des Autochtones ont utilisé du LSD ou d'autres 
hallucinogènes, contre 4 % chez les non-Autochtones. Ce profil peut toutefois ne pas 
s'appliquer aux collectivités autochtones du reste du pays.<P>
L'USAGE DES SOLVANTS: Au Canada, de nombreux Autochtones utilisent des solvants, en 
particulier les jeunes. Selon l'enquête de 1993 sur l'abus des solvants par les jeunes des 
Premières Nations et les jeunes Inuit, ces usagers sont le plus souvent des garçons (68,6 %) de 
12 à 15 ans (36,0 %) ou de 16 à 19 ans (28,5 %) (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 
1993). Les filles (31,4 %) tendent à être un peu plus jeunes, près de la moitié (45,2 %) ayant 
entre 12 et 15 ans. Ce profil d'âge varie à travers le Canada. En Colombie-Britannique, par 
exemple, 40 % ont aussi peu qu'entre 4 et 11 ans, tandis qu'à Terre-Neuve et au Labrador, ils 
sont plus âgés, 30 % ayant entre 20 et 25 ans et un autre 30 %, 26 ans et plus. Chez les filles, 
les plus hauts taux reviennent au Québec (40,7 %), puis au Yukon (38,5 %), au Manitoba 
(36,0 %) et à la Colombie-Britannique (35,6 %).<P>
Plus de la moitié des usagers de solvants (50,8 %) ont commencé à utiliser ces produits avant 
11 ans (Tableau 5.3). C'est en fait le cas d'un usager autochtone sur trois au Manitoba (36,6 
%), en Nouvelle-Ecosse (36,0 %), à Terre-Neuve et au Labrador (40,0 %), ainsi qu'au Yukon 
(44,4 %) (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). En Ontario, on commence un peu 
plus vieux, soit entre 16 et 19 ans (35 %). La majorité des jeunes utilisent des solvants pour 
l'expérience (42,3 %) ou pour des motifs sociaux (37,5 %) (Kaweionnehta Human Resource 
Group, 1993).<P>
Ces jeunes viennent de familles troublées, au contexte orageux (Kaweionnehta Human 
Resource Group, 1993). Près de la moitié souffrent de situations financières difficiles (42,8 %), 
de négligence ou de malnutntion (49,0 %), ou du chômage de leurs parents (51,8 %). Les deux 
tiers sont affectés par des conflits familiaux (66,3 %) ou l'abus d'alcool et d'autres drogues 
(66,3 %) (Tableau 5.5).<P>
La nature des difficultés diffère à travers le pays (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 
1993) (Tableau 5.6). Ainsi, la fréquence des conflits familiaux est supérieure à la moyenne (66,3 
%) en Colombie-Britannique (80,4 %), mais inférieure au Manitoba (38,5%), au Québec (46,0 
%), ainsi qu'à Terre-Neuve et au Labrador (40,0 %). La négligence et la malnutrition sont 
inférieures à la moyenne nationale (49,0 %) en Ontario (15,2 %), au Québec (10,3 %), en 
Nouvelle-Ecosse (7,7 %) ainsi qu'à Terre-Neuve et au Labrador (10,0 %). L'abus d'alcool et 
de drogue au foyer est inférieure à la moyenne nationale (66,3 %) au Québec (32,3 %), à 
Terre-Neuve et au Labrador '40,0 %), ainsi que dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest '45,5 %). 
Par ailleurs, la région de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador comptait un plus grand nombre de jeunes 
dont un des parents était décédé (40,0 % contre une moyenne de 15,8 %), et le Yukon et les 
Territoires du Nord-Ouest, un nombre supérieur de jeunes ayant perdu un autre être cher, soit 
61,5 % et 45,5 % respectivement contre 24,1 %.<P>
Les usagers de solvants tendent aussi à consommer d'autres substances (Kaweionnehta Human 
Resource Group, 1993). En fait, 54,1 % prennent alcool et solvants en association, et 76 % des 
consommateurs d'alcool utilisent aussi des solvants.<P>
PROBLÈMES RELIÉS A L'USAGE DES SUBSTANCES: Les Autochtones sont en général 
plus jeunes et affichent des taux de mortalité et de morbidité supérieurs à ceux des non-
Autochtones (Scott, 1994). Les premiers sont de deux à six fois plus vulnérables que les autres 
à chaque problème relié à l'alcool, sauf au cancer. lls sont aussi de trois à quatre fois plus 
susceptibles de décéder de mort accidentelle (Scott, 1994).<P>
Les accidents graves et les morts violentes observés chez les Autochtones semblent 
correspondre à un profil géographique, ceux de l'ouest étant de trois à quatre fois plus 
susceptibles de décéder de telles causes que ceux de l'est, et ceux des collectivités isolées du 
Nord, davantage que ceux du sud (Scott, 1994). Les hommes sont plus nombreux que les 
femmes à abuser d'alcool, mais celles-ci tendent à consommer davantage de drogues 
d'ordonnance. Les hommes de 25 à 44 ans éprouvent la majorité des problèmes d'alcool et de 
drogue relevés parmi la population autochtone (Scott, 1994).<P>
La plupart des Autochtones sont traités, dans l'ordre, pour abus d'alcool, de stupéfiants, et 
d'hallucinogènes (Scott, 1994). L'abus d'alcool est généralement quatre fois supérieur à celui 
des autres substances. Les toxicomanies mixtes les plus fréquentes sont, aussi dans l'ordre, 
l'alcool et les stupéfiants; l'alcool et les hallucinogènes; I'alcool et les drogues d'ordonnance; puis 
les stupéfiants et les hallucinogènes.<P>
Au Canada, plus de 1 500 Autochtones par année vont en traitement (Scott, 1994). <A HREF="/cpfig51.htm">La plupart 
ont entre 25 et 34 ans (Figure 5.1).</A> Quelque 40 % de ces patients sont des femmes; l'écart 
entre les deux sexes régresse dans tout le pays, sauf au Québec. Les centres de traitement 
autochtones y étant plus récents, les femmes hésitent encore à s'y présenter. Mais partout au 
pays, les femmes craignent d'aller en maison de traitement, surtout à cause de l'absence de 
garderies sur les lieux. Elles doivent payer pour faire garder leurs enfants, ce qui est tout à fait 
inconciliable avec leurs besoins en traitement.<P>
Dans les hôpitaux, les taux de départ des Autochtones pour cause de toxicomanie sont trois fois 
supérieur aux taux nationaux (Scott, 1994). Ainsi, le taux pour psychoses alcooliques est quatre 
fois supérieur; pour affections alcooliques du foie, trois fois et demie; et pour alcoolisme deux 
fois et demie. Les beuveries constituent sans doute la caractéristique dominante des individus 
qui se présentent en traitement.<P>
Les problèmes associés à l'abus des solvants sont moins bien documentés que ceux reliés aux 
autres substances. On connaît mal les effets des divers solvants sur l'organisme, et encore moins 
ceux de ces produits pris en combinaison (Kaweionnehta Human Resource Group, 1993). 
Parmi les maux affligeant les renifleurs chroniques, notons les troubles respiratoires, le 
dérèglement du foie, les affections rénales, les perturbations du métabolisme et de l'électrolyte, 
les troubles sanguins, ainsi que le dérèglement des systèmes nerveux central et périphérique. 
Bien que certains troubles soient réversibles avec l'arrêt de l'usage, d'autres sont irréversibles (p. 
ex., l'atrophie du cerveau et du cervelet).<P>
Plusieurs problèmes sont étroitement liés à l'usage des solvants (Kaweionnehta Human 
Resource Group, 1993). Mentionnons la mort subite après inhalation volontaire, l'euphorie, la 
panique, la violence et l'agressivité (p. ex., homicide et suicide), la suffocation, les brulûres, 
l'asphyxie, la mort par le froid et le syndrome prénatal de l'usage des solvants.<P>
LE TRAITEMENT: Les Autochtones en traitement souffrent de multiples problèmes complexes 
qu'il conviendrait de traiter simultanément à la toxicomanie. Dans cette optique, il importe de 
tenir compte des trois facteurs suivants (McKenzie, 1994), à savoir que certains abus de 
substance supposent qu'il y a aussi autodestruction, surtout chez les enfants; que les enfants des 
familles troublées tendent à commencer l'usage des solvants très tôt, parfois même avant cinq ou 
dix ans; et que ces problèmes aggravent en retour la toxicomanie des parents, ce qui les lie à un 
cycle d'abus perpétuel.<P>
Notons, parmi d'autres éléments à considérer, la place qu'occupent la violence et le suicide dans 
le traitement (McKenzie, 1994). De nombreux Autochtones choisissent d'aller en traitement à 
cause de la violence qu'entraîne une situation familiale. Chez certains, l'abus de drogue éveille un 
désir suicidaire, lequel n'est pas seulement un indicateur de maladie mentale, mais aussi de 
troubles psychiques. II convient donc de traiter adéquatement les tendances à l'autodestruction, 
à la violence, et au suicide, ainsi que les troubles psychiques.<P>
Dans un récent rapport soumis au Programme national de lutte contre l'abus de l'alcool et des 
drogues chez les Autochtones (PNLAADA), les auteurs présentent le traitement idéal des 
toxicomanies pour une réserve de l'Alberta (Wong, 1994). Le programme de santé mentale 
Alexis préconise le traitement intégral de la personne fondé sur quatre démarches: 1) 
l'orientation et la guérison spirituelles; 2) le traitement de la toxicomanie; 3) l'assistance à la 
famille; 4) la psychothérapie en externe. Il s'appuie sur le principe voulant que les toxicomanes 
de la réserve souffrent de multiples problèmes qu'il convient de traiter simultanément à la 
toxicomanie.<P>
Le programme (Figure 5.2) favorise par ailleurs l'intégration des services de traitement à 
plusieurs étapes, notamment celles de l'accueil, de l'orientation, de l'évaluation préliminaire, du 
traitement et de l'évaluation finale (Wong, 1994). Quant à l'évaluation des demandes de 
traitement, elle devrait s'appuyer sur un processus d'accueil centralisé engageant des thérapeutes 
professionnels, des aînés et du personnel des soins de la santé. Les clients sont orientés vers un 
ou plusieurs des sept programmes d'aide au traitement, dont un programme de traitement de la 
dépendance. Enfin, les demandes de traitement pour toxicomanie peuvent venir de quatre 
sources (1) : l'individu ou sa famille, le service d'aide à l'enfance, les services sociaux, et les 
tribunaux.<P>
PROBLEMES SOCIAUX: A la question de savoir quels étaient les plus graves problèmes 
marquant leur collectivité, les Autochtones ont répondu, par ordre d'importance, le chômage 
(67 %), l'abus d'alcool (61 %), l'abus de drogue (48 %), le suicide (25 %), la violence familiale 
(39 %) et l'abus sexuel (25 %) (Statistique Canada, 1993) (Tableau 5.7). Ils ont aussi indiqué 
plusieurs mesures susceptibles d'améliorer leurs conditions, soit un plus haut niveau d'instruction 
(7,4 %), une plus grande activité policière (10,1 %), des services de counseling familial (10,5 
%), d'autres services de counseling (9,0 %), de meilleurs services communautaires (9,8 %) et 
un plus grand nombre d'emplois (7,8 %) (Tableau 5.8).<P>
En somme, il existe de graves lacunes d'information quant à l'usage de l'alcool et des autres 
drogues dans les collectivités autochtones, aux méfaits de l'alcool, et aux programmes de 
traitement pertinents (McKenzie, 1994). Il convient enfin de pousser la recherche en ce qui 
concerne l'incidence de l'âge, du sexe, de la culture, et de l'économie sur l'abus des drogues. 
Cette information devrait être normalisée au moyen de méthodes et d'outils valides et fiables. La 
tâche de rassembler cette information tout en demeurant sensible aux questions autochtones et 
tout en développant une stratégie d'application communautaire capable de résoudre les 
problèmes pratiques représente cependant un véritable défi (LeCavalier et McKenzie, 1993; 
McKenzie, 1994).<P>

<H2>Attitudes sociales concernant l'usage et l'abus

<H3>Points saillants </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Quatre-vingt pour cent des fumeurs croient qu'ils pourraient améliorer leur santé en cessant 
de fumer, mais 16 % seulement des buveurs admettent l'avantage de réduire leur consommation.
<LI>Une majorité de Canadiens croient en l'urgence d'une action gouvernementale face à 
l'usage des drogues (79 %), au sida (78 %), aux problèmes d'alcool (63 %) et au tabagisme 
(53 %).

</UL>
L'enquête sert souvent à estimer les valeurs individuelles et l'utilité des politiques 
gouvernementales, ainsi qu'à voir dans quelle mesure les gens perçoivent les bienfaits et les 
méfaits de leurs comportements sur leur santé. Le présent chapitre s'appuie donc sur les 
données de l'Enquête Promotion de la santé de 1990 et de l'Enquête nationale sur l'alcool et les 
autres drogues de 1989 (1).<P>
<H3>Perception des bienfaits pour la santé</H3>
A la question posée aux participants dans le cadre de l'Enquête Promotion de la santé de 1990, 
à savoir s'ils pouvaient, par certaines mesures sanitaires, améliorer leur santé et leur bien-être 
général, la vaste majorité des fumeurs (2) (81 %, Tableau 9.1) ont répondu qu'ils auraient 
intérêt à cesser de fumer et 16 % des buveurs, à moins consommer. Les plus âgés ont en 
général moins tendance à saisir l'avantage de réduire leur usage du tabac, de l'alcool ou des 
autres drogues, et les hommes sont deux fois plus nombreux que les femmes à croire au bienfait 
de diminuer leur consommation d'alcool.<P>
<H3>L'urgence d'une action gouvernementale</H3>
On avait aussi demandé aux participants de coter dans un ordre croissant de 1 à 10 l'urgence 
d'une action gouvernementale face à certaines questions de santé. Les résultats présentés 
reflètent le taux des Canadiens qui ont attribué une cote 7 ou supérieure aux différentes 
questions. De celles reliées à l'abus des substances, ils ont classé comme étant les plus urgentes 
: la drogue (79 %) (Tableau 9.2), puis le sida (78 %), l'alcool (63 %), et le tabagisme (53 %). 
Les femmes sont plus nombreuses que les hommes à souhaiter une action gouvernementale pour 
tous les sujets concernant les drogues. Les plus jeunes se préoccupent surtout du sida, et les 
plus âgés, de la drogue (Figure 9.1).<P>
Les habitants des Maritimes accordent plus d'importance à l'action gouvernementale qu'ailleurs 
au pays. En fait, cette importance diminue au fur et à mesure que l'on traverse le pays. Aucun 
écart évident n'est observable entre les différents groupes de revenu et de niveau 
d'instruction.<P>
<H3>La consommation d'alcool en société</H3>
La plupart des Canadiens estiment normal de prendre un verre lors d'une réception chez 
quelqu'un (80,8 %, Tableau 9.3), entre amis dans un bar (80,3 % d'hommes le font contre 76,7 
% de femmes), lors d'un dîner en tête-à-tête au foyer (76,8 %) ou lors de la visite d'amis (77,3 
%). Dans tous ces cas, la majorité préferent se limiter à un verre ou deux plutôt que de boire 
jusqu'à en ressentir les effets. L'opinion est cependant partagée quant à la pertinence de 
consommer lors d'événements sportifs ou avec des amis après le travail, et la majorité (59 %) 
croient inapproprié de boire avec les collègues au déjeûner. Les femmes font preuve d'une plus 
grande modération que les hommes, préférant s'abstenir ou se limiter à une ou deux 
consommations plutôt que de boire jusqu'à en ressentir les effets.<P>
<H3><A HREF="/cpfig92.htm">Les politiques concernant l'alcool et les autres 
drogues</A></H3>
Les Canadiens appuient généralement les contrôles imposés quant à l'accessibilité de l'alcool. 
La plupart (70 % Tableau 9.4) approuvent les heures d'exploitation actuelles des magasins de 
bières et de spiritueux, et 74 % souhaitent l'interdiction de la vente d'alcool dans les dépanneurs 
et l'apposition d'une mise en garde sur les contenants (Figure 9.2, Tableau 9.5).<P>
Les Canadiens s'opposent à l'idée d'abaisser l'âge légal de boire, mais sont partagés devant la 
possibilité de le hausser ou de le maintenir. Cinquante pour cent (50 %) croient qu'ils faudrait le 
hausser, tandis que 45 % favorisent le statut quo. Cinquante-et-un pour cent (51 %) dénoncent 
les publicités télévisées sur les boissons alcoolisées; mais 41 % seulement souhaitent 
l'interdiction des commandites d'événements sportifs par les sociétés d'alcools.<P>
La plupart demandent que le gouvernement fasse davantage pour promouvoir la santé et les 
services de traitement de l'alcoolisme et des autres toxicomanies, par exemple en interdisant de 
servir les personnes déjà intoxiquées, en soutenant les programmes de prévention et de 
traitement et en intensifiant sa publicité anti-alcool.<P>
Une légère majorité de Canadiens (54 %) soutiennent qu'il y aurait lieu de criminaliser la 
possession de la marijuana, alors que 35 % croient le contraire.<P>
<H3>Les programmes de réduction de l'abus des 
drogues</H3>
La plupart des Canadiens estiment que les programmes d'entraide tels les Alcooliques 
anonymes (A.A.), les lignes secours, les efforts de prévention communautaires, et le traitement 
assuré par les travailleurs sociaux ou le personnel médical contribuent modérément ou très 
efficacement à réduire les problèmes d'abus de drogues (Tableau 9.6). Les actions jugées les 
plus efficaces sont, dans l'ordre, celles des groupes d'entraide tels les A.A. (jugées modérément 
ou très efficaces par 79,2 %), les efforts de prévention communautaires (64,0 %), les lignes 
secours (63,2 %), et le traitement par les travailleurs sociaux ou le personnel médical (60,3 
%).<P>

dernière édition de Profil canadien. Depuis l'Enquête Promotion de la santé de 1990, aucune 
autre enquête nationale publique n'a été consacrée aux politiques et aux questions sociales 
associées à l'usage et à l'abus des drogues. L'enquête canadienne sur l'alcool et les autres 
drogues (CADS) effectuée en 1994 y consacrait toutefois un nombre important de questions,

de la présente édition, une importante mise à jour sera incorporée à l'édition de 1996. (2) Les 
questions sur l'avantage de "cesser de fumer" et de «moins boire» ont été posées respectivement

<UL>
<LI>Le Canadien moyen de 15 ans et plus a dépensé 462 dollars en boissons alcooliques en 1992-1993, et 
la valeur des ventes d'alcool ont atteint plus de 10,4 milliards de dollars.
<LI>Le secteur des boissons alcooliques a fourni 15 741 emplois et représenté près de 4,2 milliards de 
dollars de recettes gouvernementales en 1992-1993.
<LI>La réduction des taxes sur le tabac a eu un impact majeur sur l'économie. Après une période de 
hausses substantielles des recettes fiscales en dépit d'un baisse du tabagisme, les recettes 
gouvernementales tirées des produits du tabac ont diminué de 896,5 millions de dollars, soit de 16,2 % en 
1993-1994, par rapport à l'année précédente. Parallèlement, les exportations de cigarettes (pour la plupart 
potentiellement réintroduites en fraude au pays) sont tombées de 814 millions en 1993 à 190 millions en 
1994.
<LI>Le marché national de l'industrie pharmaceutique, qui emploie plus de 21 000 Canadiens, est évalué 
à 4,3 milliards de dollars.
</UL>
<HR>

<H2>Les aspects économiques de l'alcool</H2>
Pendant trois décennies, les prix de l'alcool ont sensiblement augmenté, mais à des taux se 
rapprochant sensiblement de ceux des autres biens de consommation. Mais depuis 1986, ils ont 
progressé à un rythme légèrement plus rapide. En 1992-1993, considéré en pourcentage du revenu 
personnel net, le coût de 10 litres d'alcool absolu a augmenté de 2,79 % comparativement à 2,68 % 
l'année précédente.<P>
En 1992-1993, les ventes globales des boissons alcooliques ont atteint 10,43 milliards de dollars. 
En fait, malgré une régression de la consommation, la valeur monétaire des ventes a enregistré des 
hausses légères mais constantes au cours des récentes années (en terme de dollars courants). La 
valeur monétaire des spiritueux a en revanche diminué, indépendamment de l'inflation. Cette même 
année, les 15 ans et plus ont en moyenne déboursé 246 dollars pour la bière, 83 dollars pour le vin 
et 133 dollars pour les spiritueux. La plus forte dépense par habitant en matière d'alcool revient au 
Yukon (947 $) puis aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest (722 $), ce qui reflète les taux plus élevés de 
consommation d'alcool dans ces régions.<P>
L'alcool a rapporté plus de 3,1 milliards de dollars de recettes aux gouvernements provinciaux en 
1992-1993, tirées en majeure partie des ventes. Cela constitue 2,2 % des recettes provinciales 
globales. Les recettes fédérales provenant des ventes d'alcool ne sont plus déclarées, mais le 
ministère fédéral du Revenu a établi les recettes fédérales provenant des droits et taxes d'accise 
associées à l'alcool (excluant les recettes provenant des taxes de vente ou de l'impôt sur les 
sociétés) à plus de 1,1 milliard de dollars en 1992-1993.<P>
Les boissons alcooliques ont un léger impact, mais néanmoins positif, sur la balance commerciale 
canadienne. La valeur des exportations de ces produits en 1992-1993 s'établissait à 680 millions de 
dollars, contre 631 millions pour les importations. Quant à la valeur des exportations de bière, elle 
a atteint 185,9 millions de dollars comparativement à 192,8 millions l'année précédente.<P>
En 1993, 15 741 personnes travaillaient à la production des boissons alcooliques, représentant des 
traitements et salaires globaux d'environ 744 millions de dollars. Après plus de dix ans de stabilité 
de l'emploi, le nombre des employés du secteur de la production des boissons alcooliques a diminué 
à tous les ans depuis 1988, alors que l'industrie des boissons alcooliques employait 19 754 
Canadiens. <P>
<H2>Les aspects économique du tabac</H2>
Par rapport aux autres biens de consommation, le prix des cigarettes a généralement diminué entre 
la fin des années 40 et 1980, mais de 1980 jusqu'à la réduction majeure des taxes fédérales en 
1994, leur prix a accusé des hausses nettement supérieures à ceux des autres produits. En 1994, les 
prix des cigarettes ont chuté de plus de 40 %, tandis que l'indice des prix à la consommation a 
augmenté de 0,9 %.<P>
En 1993-1994, les recettes gouvernementales sur les produits du tabac étaient de 4,65 milliards de 
dollars, soit 2,24 milliards pour le fédéral et 2,42 pour les provinces, représentant une baisse de 
896,5 millions de dollars, ou de 16,2 %, par rapport à l'année précédente. En 1993-1994, les taxes 
sur le tabac représentaient 1,7 % des recettes fédérales globales, soit 2,2 % de moins que l'année 
précédente, et 1,6 % des recettes provinciales, soit 1,9 % de moins que l'année précédente, En avril 
1994, les taxes sur le paquet de 25 cigarettes variaient entre 1,48 $ (Québec) et 5,14 $ (Terre-
Neuve).<P>
En 1994, les exportations du tabac ont considérablement diminué, laissant croire que la majeure 
partie des cigarettes exportées étaient réintroduites en fraude au Canada. Considérant que les 
exportations de tabac se chiffraient à 814 millions de dollars en 1993, elles sont passées à 
189,7 millions en 1994. La valeur des produits du tabac importés est passée de près de 60 millions 
de dollars en 1993 à 70,5 millions en 1994. Quant à celle des produits exportés, elle était de huit 
fois supérieure en 1993 à ce qu'elle était en 1989, et l'on a de fortes raisons de croire qu'une bonne 
part de ces exportations étaient illégalement réintroduites au pays.<P>
Le nombre des personnes travaillant au traitement et à la fabrication des produits du tabac 
atteignait 4 778 en 1993, représentant des salaires et traitements globaux de plus de 258 millions 
de dollars. Les employés de ce secteur ont sensiblement diminué, passant de près de 10 000 en 
1977 à moins de 5,000 dans les années 90.<P>
<H2>Les aspects économiques des autres 
drogues</H2>
Plus de 21 000 Canadiens travaillaient dans le secteur de la production pharmaceutique en 1992, 
représentant des salaires et traitements globaux de plus de 851 millions de dollars. Le marché 
national de cette industrie s'établissait à quelque 4,3 milliards en 1990.<P>
Il n'existe pas suffisamment d'estimations fiables en ce qui concerne la taille et la valeur du marché 
des drogues illicites. La GRC nous renseigne toutefois quant aux prix de ces produits dans la rue à 
différentes étapes de leur trafic. Ainsi, on estime qu'en 1992 il en coûtait de 35 à 50 dollars le 0,1 
gramme d'héroïne injectable (concentration de 5 % à 6 %); de 70 à 200 dollars le gramme de 
chlorhydrate de cocaïne (concentration de 60 %); de 10 à 50 dollars le gramme de haschich 
libanais; et de 30 à 50 dollars le gramme de haschich jamaïquain.<P>
La GRC fournit aussi des données sur les quantités de drogues illicites saisies. Or ces quantités ont 
nettement augmenté et cela, dans la plupart des catégories. Par exemple, en 1993, on a saisi 
144 548 kilogrammes de cannabis, ce qui représente 25 % de plus que l'année précédente.<P>

par Bob Williams, Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie, et Eric Single, Centre canadien 
de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies<P>
<H3>Points saillants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>En 1992, on a relevé, au Canada, 208 165 infractions aux lois sur les boissons 
alcooliques, représentant 6S % des infractions déclarées en vertu des lois provinciales (sauf les 
infractions au code de la route).
<LI>En 1992, on a relevé 142 377 infractions fédérales pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies. 
Le nombre de telles infractions à travers le Canada a généralement régressé depuis 1983, et le 
taux de 100 000 habitants de 16 ans et plus a baissé en moyenne de 3,1 % par année de 1984 à 
1992.
<LI>En 1992, on a relevé 56 490 infractions liées à la drogue, soit une hausse de 0,7 % par 
rapport à 1991. De ces infractions, 60 % concernaient le cannabis et 24 %, la cocaïne.
</UL>
Le présent chapitre comporte trois grandes subdivisions, chacune traitant: 1) des infractions aux 
lois sur les boissons alcooliques; 2) des infractions aux lois fédérales régissant l'alcool au volant; 
et 3) des infractions fédérales en matière de drogue relevant de la <I>Loi sur les stupéfiants 
</I>et de la <I>Loi sur les drogues et aliments. </I>Pour une description des lois, des 
genres d'infractions et des peines s'y rapportant, consulter le Chapitre 11.<P>
L'information exposée dans le présent chapitre s'appuie principalement sur les infractions et les 
accusations déclarées par la police dans le cadre du Programme de déclaration uniforme de la 
criminalité (DUC). Les données des infractions correspondent au compte des infractions légales 
identifiées, tandis que les accusations correspondent au nombre de personnes réellement 
accusées en rapport avec les infractions. Normalement, lorsqu'une personne est accusée de 
plusieurs infractions, seule l'infraction ou l'accusation la plus grave est déclarée. Cette mesure 
donne lieu à un nombre d'accusations inférieur à celui des infractions, ainsi qu'à la sous-
déclaration des accusations en ce qui concerne maintes infractions moins graves.<P>
<H3>Les lois sur les boissons alcooliques</H3>
Au Canada, le contrôle et la vente des boissons alcooliques sont de compétence et 
d'application provinciales. Il convient donc de faire preuve de prudence au moment de 
comparer les données entre les provinces.<P>
En 1992, on a relevé, au Canada, 208 165 infractions aux lois sur les boissons alcooliques, 
représentant 65 % des infractions déclarées en vertu des lois provinciales (sauf les infractions au 
code de la route). Depuis 1984, le nombre global des infractions a diminué de 24 % (Tableau 
12.1).<P>
A l'échelle nationale, le rapport des infractions aux lois sur les boissons alcooliques par 100 000 
habitants s'établissait à 732:1, soit une baisse de 6,9 % depuis 1991. <A HREF="/cpfig121.htm">Sur le plan régional, c'est 
dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest que l'on a constaté le plus haut taux d'infractions (3 967,9 
par 100 000), puis à l'Ile-du-Prince-Edouard (2 717,6) et au Yukon (2 586,1), et au Québec 
que l'on a observé le plus bas, soit 29,5 infractions par 100 000 habitants (Figure 12.1).</A><P>
Le nombre des jeunes contrevenants ayant commis des infractions aux lois provinciales sur les 
boissons alcooliques a diminué de 24 % pour passer à 16 616 en 1992, poursuivant ainsi une 
tendance à la baisse devenue évidente depuis 1988 (Tableau 12.2). En tout, 128 800 adultes 
(602,0 accusations par 100,000 adultes) ont été accusés en vertu des lois provinciales sur les 
boissons alcooliques en 1992. Le nombre des ces adultes a régressé de 11,3 % en 1992, 
comparativement à une baisse moyenne annuelle de 5,7 % entre 1984 et 1992 (Tableau 12.3). 
Dans l'ensemble, à peu près 90 % des adultes accusés au cours de chaque année étaient des 
hommes.<P>
En 1991-1992, on a dénombré 5,766 admissions de personnes condamnées dans les prisons 
provinciales pour adultes, pour infractions aux lois provinciales sur les boissons alcooliques 
(Tableau 12.5). Ces infractions représentaient alors 8 % de toutes les admissions des personnes 
condamnées dans ces établissements (Tableau 12.5).<P>
<H3>Les infractions pour conduite avec facultés 
affaiblies</H3>
<A HREF="/cpfig122.htm">Le nombre des infractions pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies au Canada a généralement 
régressé depuis 1984, et leur taux par 100 000 habitants chez les 16 ans et plus a diminué en 
moyenne de 3,3 % par année de 1984 à 1992 (Tableau 12.6, Figure 12.2).</A> Dans toutes les 
régions du Canada, sauf aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest et en Saskatchewan, le taux de ces 
infractions a sensiblement reculé.<P>
En 1992, on a relevé 132 377 infractions pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies, soit 597 
infractions par 100 000 habitants chez les 16 ans et plus (Tableau 12.6). Les plus haut taux 
revenaient au Yukon (2 524), aux Territoires du Nord-Ouest (2 429), à la Saskatchewan (1 
381) puis à l'Alberta (1 304), et les plus bas, de nouveau à l'Ontario et au Québec, avec 406 et 
451 infractions respectivement.<P>
En 1991, la conduite dangereuse d'un véhicule représentait 91 % environ (120 094 infractions) 
de toutes les infractions pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies (Tableau 12.7, Figure 12.3); le 
défaut ou le refus de fournir un échantillon d'haleine ou de sang, un autre 8 % (10 279 
infractions); et les infractions plus graves, soit pour conduite avec facultés affaiblies causant des 
lésions corporelles ou la mort, 1 % (1 623 infractions).<P>
En 1992, on a dénombré 105 766 personnes accusées d'infractions liées à l'alcool (Selon les 
premières données publiées pour 1993, 92 539 personnes avaient été accusées de conduite 
avec facultés affaiblies, ce qui représente une nouvelle diminution de 13 % entre 1992 et 1993 
Statistique Canada, <I>Juristat, Vol. 14, no 14, Statistique de la criminalité du Canada, 
1993</I>, Ottawa: Statistique Canada, Catalogue no 85-002, août 1994) ou 477 accusations 
par 100 000 habitants chez les 16 ans et plus (Tableaux 12.8 et 12.9). De 1990 à 1992, les 
hommes constituaient chaque année 91 % de toutes les personnes accusées (Tableau 
12.8).<P>
Exception faite de l'Ontario (où les données n'étaient pas disponibles), les prisons provinciales 
pour adultes ont enregistré 13 054 admissions de personnes condamnées pour conduite avec 
faculté affaiblies en 1991-1992 (Tableau 12.10), soit 17 % des admissions dans toutes les 
prisons.<P>
<H3>La criminalité reliée à la drogue</H3>
Il n'est pas facile d'interpréter les données statistiques de la criminalité reliée à la drogue. 
Comme le précise le document original, un changement du nombre des infractions déclarées par 
la police en matière de drogue ne signifie pas nécessairement une hausse ou une baisse 
correspondante quant à l'usage de drogue, mais peut tout simplement refléter une modification 
des activités policières (Statistique Canada, Statistique de la criminalité canadienne, 1990).<P>
En 1992, on a relevé 56 490 infractions reliées à la drogue, soit 0,7 % de plus qu'en 1991 
(Tableau 12.11) et un rapport de 198,7 sur 100 000 habitants (Tableau 12.12). Les infractions 
visant le cannabis constituaient 60 % de toutes les infractions, et celles concernant la cocaine, un 
autre 24 %. Après une hausse constante de 1988 à 1991, les infractions touchant l'héroïne ont 
diminué en 1992 pour représenter alors 2,2 % de toutes les infractions reliées à la drogue. <A HREF="/cpfig124.htm">Les 
plus hauts taux de ces infractions ont été enregistrés au Yukon (569 par 100 000) puis dans les 
Territoires du Nord-Ouest (549 par 100 000, Figure 12.4).</A> A l'échelle provinciale, le taux le 
plus élevé revenait à la Colombie-Britannique (443 par 100,000) et le plus bas, au Québec 
(136).<P>
De 1986 à 1992, le nombre des jeunes contrevenants ayant commis des infractions reliées à la 
drogue en vertu de la législation fédérale a diminué en moyenne de 7,6 % par année (Tableau 
12.13). En 1992, le nombre total de ces jeunes était inférieur de 18,9 % au taux de 1991. En 
1992, 2 634 jeunes contrevenants avaient commis des infractions reliées à la drogue, dont 94 % 
en vertu de la Loi sur les stupéfiants.<P>
En 1992, 41 629 adultes ont été accusées pour des infractions reliées à la drogue en vertu des 
lois fédérales (Tableau 12.14). Le nombre des accusations par 100 000 adultes s'établissait 
alors à 195, soit légèrement plus qu'en 1991 (Tableau 12.15). Les territoires continuaient 
d'enregistrer les taux les plus élevés (541 et 410 accusations par 100 000 adultes 
respectivement aux T.-N.-O. et au Yukon), tandis que le taux le plus bas revenait au Nouveau-
Brunswick (88 par 100 000 adultes). Comme c'était le cas pour l'alcool, les hommes 
constituaient la majorité des personnes accusées (86 %).<P>
Notons que les données sur le règlement des accusations et des condamnations proviennent du 
Bureau de la surveillance des médicaments (antérieurement le Bureau des drogues dangereuses) 
(Santé Canada), et qu'elles n'incluent pas les condamnations pour les infractions visant le 
cannabis. Toutes les données de 1993 des tableaux 12.16 à 12.20 constituent des estimations 
préliminaires.<P>
Selon ces estimations préliminaires, 10 227 (74 %) des 13 781 accusations qui ont été réglées 
en 1993 ont donné lieu à des condamnations (Tableau 12.16). Plus de la moitié (63 % ou 
6,392) de ces condamnations ont entrai`né une peine d'emprisonnement, alors que 26 % firent 
l'objet d'amendes et 9 %, d'une condamnation avec sursis ou d'une peine avec probation.<P>
Les accusations en vertu de la Loi sur les stupéfiants ont donné lieu à 91 % de toutes les 
condamnations fédérales en matière de drogue, tandis que les condamnations visant les drogues 
contrôlées régies par la Loi sur les aliments et drogues ont compté pour 9 % (Tableau 12.17). 
Quarante-cinq pour cent (45 %) de toutes les condamnations concernaient la possession; 34 %, 
le trafic; 19 %, la possession pour fin de trafic; 1 %, l'obtention illégale d'ordonnances muliples; 
et 1 %, l'importation (Tableau 12.18). Les hommes avaient commis 86 % de toutes les 
condamnations reliées à la drogue (Tableau 12.19). Les personnes de moins de 30 ans étaient 
responsables de 53 % des condamnations reliées à la drogue, et les 30 à 39 ans, d'un autre 32 
% (Tableau 12.19).<P>
En 1991-1992, 732 personnes ont été admises dans les pénitenciers fédéraux pour des 
infractions reliées à la drogue, soit 13,7 % de plus que l'année précédente (Tableau 12.21). 
Elles représentaient 15 % de toutes les admissions enregistrées dans les pénitenciers 
fëdéraux.<P>
En 1993, on a dénombré 1 104 vols et autres pertes reliés aux drogues contrôlées régies par la 
Loi sur les stupéfiants et la Loi sur les aliments et drogues (Tableau 12.23). La majorité visaient 
les pharmacies (54 %), mais depuis 1985, les hôpitaux ont accusé un nombre croissant de 
pertes, soit 33 % des pertes déclarées en 1993 (Tableau 12.23). Le Tableau 12.24 indique les 
drogues et les quantités déclarées disparues pour la période de 1987 à 1993.<P>
Le nombre des fausses ordonnances déclarées a diminué de 20 % pour passer à 1 733 en 
1992 (Tableau 12.25). En 1992, 42 % de ces ordonnances concernaient la codéine.<P>

recherche</TITLE>

<H1>Profil canadien</H1>
<H3>L'alcool, le tabac et les autres drogues</H3>
<HR>
<H2>Epilogue : Les lacunes d'information et leurs 
incidences sur la recherche</H2>
par Eric Single, Centre canadien de lutte contre l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies; Bob Williams, 
Fondation de la recherche sur la toxicomanie; Diane McKenzie, Centre canadien de lutte contre 
l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies<P>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
Le présent ouvrage sur l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues au Canada renferme plusieurs 
tableaux et figures, dont l'information provient d'une quantité considérable de données puisées à 
de multiples sources, notamment les enquêtes sur l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues, 
divers systèmes déjà bien établis de saisie et de déclaration de données sur la morbidité et la 
mortalité, les statistiques sur la criminalité et, dans certaines provinces, les ventes de drogues 
licites.<P>
L'information disponible accuse néanmoins d'importantes lacunes, puisque l'on ne dispose que 
de peu de données, voire même aucune, sur les dosages typiques des drogues illicites, les profils 
temporels de l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues, et sur les contextes de consommation. 
Ce que nous savons de la disponibilité des drogues illicites est strictement anecdotique.<P>
Aussi, une information détaillée sur les méthodes de diagnostic utilisées, susceptibles d'influencer 
les données sur le traitement, fait parfois défaut. La proportion des conditions particulières 
pouvant être justement imputée à l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues s'appuie souvent sur 
des données périmées ou des recherches d'autres pays. Quant aux données sur le traitement, 
elles se limitent aux cas déclarés par les régimes de soin de santé, et font ainsi abstraction des 
données des groupes d'entraide.<P>
En partie à cause de ces problèmes et aussi de l'absence d'un consensus quant à la pertinence 
des méthodologies à utiliser pour évaluer les coûts socioéconomiques de l'usage de l'alcool, du 
tabac et des autres drogues, l'information sur ces coûts demeure fort limitée. Or, à défaut de 
pouvoir compter sur des estimations fiables et précises de ces coûts pour la société canadienne, 
l'abus des substances ne peut recevoir la priorité qui lui revient dans le cadre des programmes 
sociaux et politiques.<P>
<H3>Causes profondes des lacunes d'information</H3>
Les lacunes relevées au titre de l'information s'expliquent par plusieurs causes sous-
jacentes:<P>
LA STIGMATISATION: Compte tenu de la nécessité de réintégrer les alcooliques et les 
toxicomanes dans la société, il arrive souvent, au moment de poser un diagnostic, que l'on 
considère les problèmes reliés à l'abus de l'alcool ou des autres drogues comme les problèmes 
en cause plutôt que les causes profondes de l'abus même. En ce qui concerne les stupéfiants, les 
usagers hésitent, en raison de leur caractère illégal, à aller chercher les services de traitement 
dont ils ont besoin. Cette caractéristique empêche aussi la compilation de données statistiques 
fiables sur leur production et leur commerce.<P>
L'INSUFFISANCE DES SYSTÈMES DE DÉCLARATION: L'information dont nous 
disposons est en partie inadéquate, à cause de certaines lacunes marquant les systèmes de 
déclaration. Par exemple, les provinces qui ne possèdent pas de système d'ordonnances en trois 
exemplaires ne bénéficient pas de données aussi complètes que les autres sur l'usage des 
médicaments. Dans un même ordre d'idée, les statistiques sur la morbidité reliée à l'alcool et aux 
autres drogues se fondent uniquement sur les traitements offerts par les hôpitaux. Quant aux 
systèmes de déclaration, ils ne fournissent pas toujours une information complète sur les critères 
de classification et les procédés suivis pour la cueillette des données. Les données statistiques 
recueillies régulièrement peuvent être fortement influencées par une modification de ces 
procédés même si les facteurs prévalence ou incidence n'accusent en réalité que très peu de 
changement, voire aucun. C'est le cas notamment des statistiques sur la conduite avec facultés 
affaiblies, qui ont été influencées par l'introduction de l'alcootest. I1 importe que l'utilisateur de 
ces statistiques connaisse les procédés de cueillette et soit informé de tout progrès 
technologique ou de tout autre changement susceptible d'influer sur les résultats. Mais le plus 
important est peut-être de se rappeler que les données statistiques recueillies régulièrement, ainsi 
que les enquêtes, sont limitées en ce sens qu'elles ne tiennent pas compte des caractéristiques 
contextuelles ou interactionnelles de l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues.<P>
LA PRÉDOMINANCE DE CERTAINS CONCEPTS FACE AUX PROBLÈMES 
D'ALCOOLISME ET DE TOXICOMANIE: Une autre cause première des lacunes de 
données vient de la façon dont on perçoit le problème de l'abus. Nos concepts de la 
dépendance ont évolué tout comme ceux de leur contribution aux différents aspects du 
problème. II y a trente ans, on percevait "l'alcoolisme" comme le principal problème d'alcool, 
alors qu'aujourd'hui, on admet généralement que la consommation d'alcool présente plusieurs 
problèmes bien avant même qu'il y ait dépendance. De façon similaire, le manque de données 
sur le dosage des drogues illicites s'explique en partie par le fait qu'elles soient juridiquement 
considérées comme activité criminelle. Etant donné leur caractère illégal, toute utilisation est 
d'office perçue comme un problème, et l'on néglige donc souvent de recueillir une information 
précise quant au profil d'usage et de dosage. Même notre choix d'inclure telles ou telles 
substances dans les rapports pertinents évolue constamment. Il y a trente ans, le présent rapport 
n'aurait contenu aucune information sur l'usage du tabac. Or, nous savons aujourd'hui que le 
tabac est responsable de plus de décès que toute autre substance psychotrope.<P>
Dans cette même veine, mentionnons que le présent rapport n'inclut aucune information sur 
l'usage de la caféine, alors que dans trente ans, il pourrait bien le faire.<P>
<H3>Incidences sur les recherches futures</H3>
Compte tenu de ces manques d'information et de leurs causes profondes, il est recommandé 
d'améliorer la base de données en adoptant les mesures suivantes:<P>
AMÉLIORER LES COMMUNICATIONS: I1 convient d'améliorer les communications parmi 
les spécialistes et les organismes des secteurs de la recherche, du traitement et de la justice. Le 
récent développement du Centre national de documentation sur l'alcoolisme et les toxicomanies 
a permis de réseauter électroniquement les centres de ressources à travers le Canada. I1 y a 
lieu de favoriser l'expansion de ce réseau. D'autres formules d'amélioration ont été avancées par 
un comité d'experts chargé de l'abus des substances dans un rapport d'étude commandé par le 
Programme national de développement de la recherche en matière de santé:<P>
"Il faut s'attacher tout particulièrement à établir des archives et des banques de données, afin de 
conserver, de classer et de repérer les données des enquêtes et des autres études portant sur 
l'usage et l'abus des substances. Une telle documentation peut servir à des fins d'analyse 
secondaire, y compris la recherche méta-analytique. Dans cette optique, et chaque fois que cela 
est possible, il y aurait lieu de demander, en même temps que le rapport final des études 
subventionnées, des ensembles de données informatisés.<P>
I1 convient par ailleurs d'envisager l'établissement d'une communauté de chercheurs canadiens 
se consacrant au domaine de la drogue et de l'alcool. Une telle communauté peut être créée et 
soutenue au moyen de divers instruments, à savoir des conférences générales ou thématiques et 
des ateliers, des réseaux électroniques, des bulletins, ou une revue savante. Les gouvernements 
fédéral et provinciaux devraient pour leur part considérer la création d'un répertoire des sources 
de données existantes, des chercheurs et des projets de recherche dans le domaine de l'abus 
des substances au Canada." (Andrews et Single, 1993: 2).<P>
ELARGIR LES PROTOCOLES DE RECHERCHE: Tel qu il a été souligné à plusieurs 
reprises dans le présent rapport, il importe de puiser à plusieurs sources de données si l'on veut 
brosser un tableau complet de l'usage de l'alcool et des autres drogues au Canada. Pour parer 
aux lacunes d'information, il faudra souvent compléter les données statistiques d'ensemble et les 
données des enquêtes en recourant à des méthodes non traditionnelles. Or, il convient à ce 
chapitre de favoriser les méthodes ethnographiques, observationnelles et non traditionnelles, en 
particulier lorsque l'on ne dispose pas d'un énoncé fondamental complet de la nature et de 
l'étendue des problèmes. Il y a également lieu d'évaluer les répercussions des changements 
naturels (soit les grandes transformations sociales) ainsi que des "changements planifiée" (soit 
ceux des politiques sociales), de façon à rendre l'information mieux adaptée à la formulation des 
politiques. Il importe enfin d'effectuer des études spéciales sur la consommation non enregistrée 
des drogues licites, telles l'alcool et le tabac.<P>
S'INTÉRESSER DAVANTAGE AUX POPULATIONS SPÉCIALES: Il convient tout 
spécialement d'obtenir une meilleure information sur la nature et l'étendue de l'abus des 
substances chez les populations spéciales. Nous pensons en particulier aux jeunes de la rue, aux 
femmes, aux Autochtones, aux aînés et aux usagers de drogues illicites. <P>
En ce qui concerne la prochaine édition de Profil canadien, diverses initiatives sont déjà en 
cours qui permettront de fournir de nouvelles données. Durant 1994, le gouvernement fédéral a 
amorcé l'Enquête nationale sur l'alcool et les autres drogues, laquelle apportera des données 
courantes non seulement sur l'usage, mais aussi sur l'opinion publique face aux questions 
sociales et politiques associées à l'abus des substances. Par ailleurs, le CCLAT coordonne 
actuellement un projet visant à examiner plus en profondeur les coûts de l'usage et de l'abus des 
substances pour la société. D'autres projets en cours visent à développer un réseau des groupes 
qui suivront l'évolution de la problématique des drogues dans les principaux centres urbains du 
Canada.<P>
Le défi à relever est clair. La présente publication sera mise à jour périodiquement. Il sera 
intéressant de constater à l'avenir si notre connaissance de l'abus des substances se sera 
améliorée et le cas échéant, comment.<P>

<TITLE>Standing Committee on Health - Substance Abuse Policy Review</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H3>House of Commons</H3>
<H2>Standing Committee on Health</H2>
<H1>Substance Abuse Policy Review</H1>
<HR>
The Standing Committee on Health is beginning a review of Policies on the Misuse and Abuse of 
Substances.  The review will commence October 1996, to be completed in June 1997.  The following is 
taken from a letter sent to the CCSA by the Clerk of the Committee:<P>
"As you may be aware, the federal initiative called Canada's Drug Strategy was launched in 1987 and 
renewed in 1992.  In May, 1996, pursuant to a recommendation from the Sub-Committee that had studied 
Bill C-7 (now C-8) (Controlled Drugs and Substances Act), the Minister of Health encouraged the Health 
Committee to review Canada's drug policy.  The Minister suggested that the review focus on the demand 
reduction rather than the supply reduction side of the existing Drug Strategy. This demand reduction 
component falling within the broader "harm reduction" concept focused on education, prevention, 
treatment and rehabilitation.<P>
"At a recent meeting of the Health Committee, Members agreed on the following <B>Terms of 
Reference:</B><P>
<OL>
<LI>To receive evidence about the harmful impact of misuse and abuse of legal and illegal drugs on the 
social behaviour and physical health of Canadians;
<LI>To identify the relevance of variables such as age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and 
geographic area on the demand for and effect of such substances;
<LI>To examine effective measures for reducing the demand for and use of such substances through 
education, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation;
<LI>To make appropriate recommendations on future policy actions to reduce the demand for such 
substances.
</OL>
"The Committee plans to study substances that have the potential to cause harm to individuals when 
abused or misused, including legal drugs such as those contained in alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, 
solvents and prescription drugs as well as illegal drugs such as cannabis, heroin and LSD.<P>
"The Committee has decided that the study will be divided into a number of segments as follows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>overview of substance abuse policy issues,
<LI>specifics about relevant substances,
<LI>focus on affected individuals, families and communities,
<LI>overview of international policy and program experience,
<LI>assessment of provincial, territorial and municipal policy, programs and services,
<LI>and a final segment for filling any gaps in knowledge identified over the course of the study.
</UL>
"The Overview segment will focus on questions about the current Canadian system and will assess 
changes since the 1969 to 1973 review by the LeDain Commission of Inquiry into the Non-medical Use of 
Drugs as well as an identification of what substances are abused most frequently and are most harmful 
when used singly or in combination. We are hoping to obtain from witnesses an outline of the education, 
prevention, treatment and rehabilitation efforts that have been effective in the almost ten years of Canada's 
Drug Strategy, as well as an assessment of those efforts that have not worked.<P>
"We anticipate that the hearings on this study will commence in early October, and that the Overview 
segment of the hearings will run for the first two weeks in October."<P>
For further information, contact the Clerk of the Committee at (613) 992-1775; fax: (613) 996-1626, c/o 
Standing Committee on Health, 6th Floor, 180 Wellington Street, Ottawa, ON K1A 0A6.<P>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse will be presenting to the Committee early in the review, and 
information related to the progress of the Committee will be posted to our Web site, as it becomes 
available.<P>

<CENTER><H1><A NAME = exec></A>Executive Summary</H1></CENTER>
Substance abuse is one of Canada's most serious health and social problems. 
In an economic cost study of the year 1992, released by the Canadian Centre 
on Substance Abuse in June, 1996, alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug abuse 
accounted for 21% of total deaths in Canada, and 23% of years of potential life 
lost.<P>
Hospitalizations due to substance abuse constituted 8% of total hospitalizations 
and 10% of the total days spent in hospital for any cause.<P>
The CCSA estimated that substance abuse cost the Canadian economy more 
than $18.4 billion in 1992. This represents $649 per capita, or about 2.7% of the 
total Gross Domestic Product. <P>
<H2><A NAME = rising></A>Rising drug use<P></H2>
After more than a decade of decline, there are disturbing indications that illicit 
drug use is on the rise again. The proportion of Canadians who report using 
cannabis in the past year increased from 4.2% in 1993 to 7.4% in 1994. 
Increased cannabis use is particularly marked among youth and young adults. 
<P>
Cocaine use increased from 0.3% in 1993 to 0.7% in 1994, and the proportion 
of people who report using LSD, heroin or speed in the prior year increased 
from 0.3% in 1993 to 1.1% in 1994.<P>
The Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario has also reported significantly 
higher rates of smoking and drinking among youth in Grades 7, 9, 11, and 13 
between 1993 and 1995.<P>
<H2><A NAME = end></A>The end of Canada's Drug 
Strategy<P></H2>
Canada's Drug Strategy, launched in 1987 and renewed in 1992, is now due to 
sunset on March 31, 1997. Health programming developed under the Strategy 
is being merged with many other health and social issues under the label of 
population health. It is not clear what priority drug and alcohol programs will be 
given within this new framework, or what level of funding they will receive. 
Current indications are that they will be severely cut back.<P>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, created by an Act of Parliament to 
provide a national focus for substance abuse issues, will cease to exist on 
March 31, 1997, if no new commitment of funding is made in the months to 
come. The Standing Committee on Health is scheduled to make its report three 
months after Canada's Drug Strategy sunsets and the Centre closes its

The CCSA has occupied a unique position in the substance abuse field as a 
multi-disciplinary bridge between the private and public sectors, programmers 
and policy-makers, theorists and practitioners, epidemiologists and economists, 
information providers and consumers, Native researchers and mainstream 
academics, and prevention specialists and police. The CCSA has been 
particularly well supported by the justice and enforcement community, and 
especially by the Office of the Solicitor General and the RCMP.<P>
CCSA's role has become even more essential since the systematic dismantling 
of independent provincial/territorial drug and alcohol agencies began several 
years ago. Only three of these now remain in Canada. The resulting void in 
knowledge and expert counsel has created a growing demand for CCSA's many 
information products and services such as the Canadian Profile, the National 
Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse, and CCSA's national FAS/FAE information 
service.<P>
The CCSA has tried to cope with severe cuts to its funding by relying more and 
more on the World Wide Web to get information out, and by providing its 
products and services on a cost-recovery basis. However, many clients cannot 
pay and the CCSA must continue to rely at least to some degree on public 
funding.<P>
<H2><A NAME = federal></A>Federal leadership and 
commitment<P></H2>
The CCSA is asking the Standing Committee on Health to seek a strong re-
affirmation of the Government of Canada's leadership and commitment on the 
critical issues of substance abuse. There is a pressing need to assure the 
people of Canada that the federal government will not neglect its responsibility 
to protect the health and well-being of our most vulnerable citizens, including 
our children.<P>
We ask the Committee to urge Health Canada to dispel the confusion that 
exists around the population health approach and to state clearly to Canadians 
that their long-standing confidence in the preventive value of targeted drug and 
alcohol programs and policies is still justified.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = intro></A>Introduction and overview</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = about></A>About CCSA<P></H2>
CCSA was created by an Act of Parliament in August, 1988, to serve as a 
national focus for drug and alcohol issues in Canada. It has three broad 
goals:<P>
<UL>
<LI>to promote increased awareness by Canadians of issues related to alcohol and drug abuse;
<LI>to promote increased participation by Canadians in the reduction of harm associated with alcohol 
and drug abuse; and
<LI>to promote the use and effectiveness of programs of excellence relevant to alcohol and drug abuse.
</UL>
The Centre operates the National Clearinghouse on Substance Abuse which 
collects and disseminates information, compiles and maintains a variety of 
databases, and coordinates the Canadian Substance Abuse Information 
Network. CCSA also runs the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Information Service with 
financial assistance from Health Canada and the Brewers Association of 
Canada. The Centre provides free access to substance abuse information and 
"hot links" to many other knowledge providers around the world through its site 
on the World Wide Web. It also publishes a variety of directories, statistical 
profiles, pamphlets, research and policy papers, and special reports.<P>
The Centre is in a unique position to bring a variety of partners together from 
the public and private sectors to pursue projects that would be impossible to do 
unilaterally. As well, with the disappearance of all but three independent 
provincial drug and alcohol agencies in recent years, the Centre is being called 
on more and more to provide expert advice and counsel to our provincial clients, 
and to coordinate a variety of cross-jurisdictional activities.<P>
The following examples illustrate some of CCSA's accomplishments in joint 
project initiation and coordination:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Costs of Substance Abuse in Canada–a two-year study of the health, social and economic costs 
of substance abuse, involving the financial and/or in-kind participation of six provinces and two federal 
departments; published in June, 1996
<I><LI>Canadian Profile</I>–an annual compilation of statistics on alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug 
use, developed in partnership with the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario with financial assistance 
from Health Canada
<LI>The Canadian Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (CCENDU)–monitoring of drug use 
trends in six Canadian cities, bringing together experts from several fields, including public health and 
enforcement
<LI>Health and Enforcement in Partnership (HEP)–a study of alternative approaches to drug 
enforcement, involving the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the RCMP, and the office of the 
Solicitor General
<LI>Drug Awareness Week–national coordination of annual prevention and public education campaigns, 
involving a working group of drug awareness coordinators from all 12 provinces and territories
<LI>National Award Program–recognition of accomplishment in the substance abuse field with an annual 
award of excellence presented at Rideau Hall, and medallions of distinction presented in the provinces and 
territories
</UL>
<H2><A NAME = reviewing></A>Reviewing Canada's drug 
policy<P></H2>
Canada's most celebrated review of substance abuse policy, the LeDain 
Commission, spanned four years and generated several volumes of research 
and analysis. In some ways, this Committee has an easier job than LeDain's. By 
focusing exclusively on demand reduction strategies–prevention, education, 
treatment and rehabilitation–it may avoid some of the issues of law enforcement 
and supply reduction that split the ranks of the LeDain Commission.<P>
However, in another sense this Committee's job is actually more difficult than 
LeDain's. It will look at all psychoactive substances, licit and illicit, including 
alcohol and tobacco, and it must finish its work in only nine months. We 
commend the Committee for taking on this challenging mandate, and we are 
particularly pleased that Canada's two deadliest drugs–alcohol and tobacco–will 
be included in the review.<P>
It is important that we not allow the media and their love affair with illicit drug 
stories to dictate policy and to override issues related to smoking and drinking. 
To do so would be tantamount to looking down the wrong end of a telescope, 
and would seriously undermine the credibility of any group purporting to be 
conducting a serious study of substance abuse in this country.<P>
The LeDain Commission set the standard for every drug policy review that 
followed it, but in the end it failed to make a tangible impact on the drug problem 
itself. This was not the case with another substance abuse review in this country 
that began almost exactly 10 years ago. In December, 1986, the House of 
Commons Standing Committee on National Health and Welfare undertook a 
study of drug abuse in Canada, focusing initially on illegal drug use. At the 
insistence of witness after witness, the scope of the study soon expanded to 
encompass other forms of substance abuse, including the misuse of 
alcohol.<P>
<H2><A NAME = role></A>The role of the federal government 
</H2>
Across Canada, witnesses appearing before the Standing Committee called for 
a renewed role for the federal government in the area of alcohol and drug 
abuse. While acknowledging that health care, prevention services and 
educational programs fall under provincial jurisdiction, witnesses nonetheless 
saw the need for coordination and leadership at the federal level to ensure a 
balanced approach to tackling drug problems. The government was urged to 
"invest" in demand reduction measures that would complement existing efforts 
to contain the supply of drugs on the street.<P>
Through the development of appropriate funding and cost-sharing mechanisms, 
by providing coordination and leadership, by developing and disseminating 
model programs, and through improved legislation and enforcement, an active 
role for the federal government was suggested.<P>
On May 25, 1987, the Government of Canada announced a new "National Drug 
Strategy"–later Canada's Drug Strategy–involving a five-year commitment of 
additional funds amounting to $210 million to combat drug abuse. At that time, 
the federal government had been spending approximately $168 million a year 
on both supply and demand reduction programs.<P>
In 1992, Canada's Drug Strategy was renewed with additional funding and an 
expanded mandate that included Health Canada's existing Impaired Driving 
program. Total expenditures for the second five-year phase was set at $270 
million.<P>
The Strategy was a comprehensive societal response to a serious and complex 
problem, but it was deficient in one key area. It set no measurable goals for 
itself and therefore could not be evaluated in a meaningful way. If you ask if the 
Strategy was successful, most of us in the substance abuse field would 
probably say yes, but we can't prove it. Whatever measures this Committee 
recommends next June, top priority should be given to the setting of clearly 
defined targets by which these measures can be judged in the future.<P>
<H3>The future of CCSA</H3>
Included as part of the Strategy's budget for Phase I was a proposed $2 million 
annual expenditure to fund the operations of the Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse. It is worth noting that when the Centre's founding legislation 
came before Parliament, only one member rose to oppose it. The reason? The 
MP felt the Centre's ambitious goals could not be accomplished on a $2 million-
a-year budget. The legislation passed nonetheless with all-party support.<P>
Despite the injection of new money into Phase II of the Strategy, the Centre's 
allocation was incrementally reduced to a level of $1.4 million. Then, in April of 
this year, we learned that this figure was to be cut almost in half to $0.75 million 
for the 1996-97 fiscal year. CCSA was advised at the time that this would be the 
last year of funding with no further commitment for future years.<P>
<H2><A NAME = sunsetting></A>The "sunsetting" of Canada's Drug 
Strategy<P></H2>
By the time this Committee presents its recommendations in June, 1997, 
Canada's Drug Strategy will have sunset three months earlier, and unless there 
is a significant change in the current course of events, the Centre will have 
ceased to exist. As far as we have been able to determine, federal government 
expenditures on substance abuse will return to pre-1987 levels or worse. It is 
not at all clear what priority drug education and prevention will be given within 
the new and little understood population health framework.<P>
An outside observer might look at the direction this country is taking in its 
commitment to substance abuse prevention and conclude that we have 
successfully dealt with our problems and are ready to move on to other issues. 
Regrettably, as we will demonstrate elsewhere in this presentation, this is not 
the case.<P>
The same observer might be struck by the discrepancy between the billions of 
dollars collected every year in the form of federal alcohol and tobacco taxes, 
seized assets and proceeds of drug-related crime, and the comparatively 
minuscule amount the Government of Canada spends to reduce drug-related 
harm. As the government withdraws further from investment in demand 
reduction, the economics become even more skewed. The ounce of prevention 
that we fail to provide will take its toll in a ton of illness and death, health care 
costs, unsafe streets and crime-ridden communities, crowded courts and 
prisons, and a growing stain on Canada's international reputation.<P>
Canada has gone as far as public opinion and our overburdened justice system 
will tolerate on the supply reduction side. Bill C-8, the Controlled Drugs and 
Substance Act gives police unprecedented powers to stop the flow of drugs into 
our communities. But the police are the first to admit they cannot continue to 
plug the leaking dam of enforcement if more–much more–is not done to reduce 
demand. They are pleading with us to send in the reinforcements.<P>
<H2><A NAME = reaffirm></A>Re-affirming the need for 
leadership<P></H2>
We are confident this Committee will play a pivotal role in rekindling Canadian 
efforts to combat substance abuse. Our hope is that it will re-affirm the need for 
leadership and commitment by the Government of Canada in this area, and 
recommend continued investment in prevention, education and treatment. We 
are not merely asking for the automatic re-instatement of Canada's Drug 
Strategy. It may be that the specific initiatives of the Strategy have outlived their 
usefulness. However, in their absence, we hope and trust that this Committee 
will recommend equally bold and innovative measures to combat a growing 
problem.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = nature></A>Nature, extent and consequences of 
substance use</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = natintro></A>Introduction<P></H2>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse is involved in a number of projects–
including the publication of a variety of information products–which monitor 
trends in the use and misuse of licit and illicit drugs in Canada. For detailed 
information, the Committee is asked to refer to the <I>Canadian Profile: Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Other Drugs</I>. The most recent information on substance abuse 
is also available through the CCSA's website (http://www.ccsa.ca).<P>
The information provided in these sources indicates that the use of alcohol, 
tobacco, and other psychoactive drugs is a source of major health and social 
problems in Canada. Substance abuse is among the leading causes of 
preventable death and illness, and its impact on the economy is enormous.<P>
Alcohol continues to exact a heavy toll on the well-being of Canadians, 
particularly among youth and high-risk populations such as First Nations 
peoples, pregnant women, the disabled and the elderly. The use of alcohol in 
combination with other drugs, including pharmaceutical products, is largely 
unexplored. The disinhibiting effects of alcohol and other psychoactive 
substances contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS through risky activities such as 
unprotected sex and the use of contaminated needles.<P>
Tobacco use continues to decline within the general population (15 years and 
older), but has shown a significant increase among adolescents since 1993 in at 
least one major survey (Ontario Student Drug Use Survey, ARF, 1995). Some 
critics within the anti-tobacco lobby blame this rise on the lowering of taxes on 
cigarettes by the Government of Canada in 1994. The long-term implications of 
an upward trend in adolescent tobacco use are of great concern since we know 
that a high percentage of people who begin smoking before the age of 20 will 
become lifetime smokers.<P>
Illicit drug use is on the rise for the first time in more than a decade and the 
increase is being led by younger Canadians. The Ontario Student Drug Use 
Survey, for example, indicates sharp increases in the use of drugs such as 
cannabis, methamphetamine ("speed"), PCP, cocaine and ecstasy. Studies in 
the US have produced similar results, painting a disturbing picture of growing 
adolescent drug use across North America.<P>
<H3>Why is illicit drug use increasing?</H3>
The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse is often asked by the media why 
illicit drug use is growing after such a long period of decline. There is no clear 
answer. Rebellion against a decade of post-war materialism and conservative 
thinking fueled the drug revolution of the '60s. Today's economic despair, 
collapse of the family and community, and a general sense of hopelessness 
may be even more powerful engines of abuse, particularly when combined with 
greater availability and variety of drugs than we could have imagined 30 years 
ago, and, some have argued, more liberal parental attitudes.<P>
Social policy also has an impact on drug use, although its effects are extremely 
hard to measure and evaluate. We can observe that drug use declined 
significantly concomitant with the first five years of Canada's Drug Strategy, and 
started rising again during Phase II. Prevention and education efforts in Phase I 
targeted "mainstream" populations, especially youth who were still in school. In 
Phase II the focus shifted to street youth and other high-risk groups.<P>
The resurgence of drug use we are now witnessing is led largely by mainstream 
youth, indicating that we may have paid a heavy price for changing our focus 
and neglecting this group in Phase II. Ultimately we must aim our prevention 
messages at all youth. The Centre believes that all young people–drop-outs and 
A students alike–are vulnerable to drug use and should be viewed as an at-risk 
population.<P>
Although individual reasons for drug-taking may be hard to get at, one thing is 
clear: all things being equal, total drug use in a given population will rise and fall 
with the size of that group. We should be aware of the compelling fact that the 
children of the "baby boom" generation–often referred to as the "echo-boom" or 
"mini-boom"–have begun to move through adolescence when the lure of risk-
taking is at its strongest.<P>
The quantum leap in illicit drug use that began in the mid-1960s was in many 
respects a simple matter of numbers as the huge contingent of children born 
after 1946 reached their teenage years. Anyone who doubts the potential 
impact of the "echo-boom" on total drug use over the next decade should be 
reminded of the steady rise in demand that occurred from the mid-1960s until 
the late 1970s and early 1980s.<P>
<H2><A NAME = preval></A>Prevalence and trends in substance use 
and abuse in Canada<P></H2>
<UL>
<LI>The proportion of Canadians who report drinking in the past 12 months in national surveys has 
declined from 80% in 1979 to 72% in 1994. 
<LI>The proportion of Canadians who report smoking in national surveys decreased steadily from 50% in 
1960 to 44% in 1975, 40% in 1981, 32% in 1989 and 27% in 1995. Recent studies indicate that young 
females are now just as likely to smoke as young males. As well, the ARF has reported a significant 
increase in smoking (from 23.% in 1993 to 27.9% in 1995) among Ontario students in Grades 7, 9, 11 
and 13.
<LI>Approximately one in four adult Canadians report having used an illicit drug at some point in their 
lives. After more than a decade of decline, there are disturbing indications that illicit drug use is on the 
rise again. The proportion of Canadians who report using cannabis in the past year increased from 4.2% 
in 1993 to 7.4% in 1994. Increased cannabis use is particularly marked among youth and young adults. 
Cocaine use increased from 0.3% in 1993 to 0.7% in 1994, and the proportion who report using LSD, 
heroin or speed in the prior year increased from 0.3% in 1993 to 1.1% in 1994.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME = health></A>Health consequences and social 
harm<P></H2>
The use of psychoactive substances entails enormous adverse consequences 
to the health of Canadians. The misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs is also 
associated with adverse social consequences such as crime, violent behaviour, 
unemployment and poor productivity, family discord, as well as spousal and 
child abuse.<P>
<UL>
<LI>It is estimated that 6,701 Canadians lost their lives as a result of alcohol consumption in 1992, the 
year on which CCSA based its Canadian cost study. Many of these deaths involved relatively young 
Canadians. The number of potential years of life lost was estimated to be 186,257 years, representing 27.8 
years of life lost for every alcohol-related death. 
<LI>he 6,701 deaths attributed to alcohol in the CCSA study represented 3% of total mortality in Canada 
for 1992, the 186,257 years of potential life lost due to alcohol constituted 6% of the total years of 
potential life lost due to any cause, the 86,076 hospitalizations due to alcohol represented 2% of all 
hospitalizations, and the 1.15 million days of hospitalization due to alcohol represented 3% of the total 
days spent in hospital for any cause.
<LI>The CCSA estimated the total number deaths in Canada attributable to smoking to be 33,498 in 
1992. Cancer accounted for the largest number of tobacco-related deaths (11,704), representing 35% of all 
such deaths.
<LI>The 33,498 deaths due to tobacco estimated in the CCSA study represented 17% of total mortality in 
Canada for 1992. Smoking also accounted for 16% of the total years of potential life lost, 6% of all 
hospitalizations and 7% of all hospitalization days for any cause in Canada in 1992.
<LI>The CCSA estimated that there were 732 deaths attributable to illicit drugs in Canada in 1992. The 
vast majority (87%) of these deaths involved males and most of the victims were relatively young adults.
<LI>The largest proportion of drug-related deaths were due to suicide (42%), opiate poisoning (14%) or 
cocaine poisoning (9%). The use of contaminated needles by intravenous drug users accounted for 61 
AIDS deaths, representing 8% of all illicit drug-related deaths. The spread of HIV infection among illicit 
drugs users remains a major vehicle by which AIDS can spread to the general population.
<LI>Although the number of deaths attributed to illicit drug use is smaller than the number of deaths 
attributable to alcohol and tobacco, illicit drug deaths tend to involve younger victims. The 732 illicit 
drug-related deaths resulted in 31,147 potential years of life lost, representing 42.6 years for each death 
and about 1% of total years of life lost due to any cause. 
<LI>Taken together, substance abuse accounted for 21% of total mortality in 1992, and 23% of years of 
potential life lost. Hospitalizations due to substance abuse constituted 8% of total hospitalizations and 
10% of the total days spent in hospitals for any cause in Canada in 1992.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME = economic></A>Economic costs<P></H2>
<UL>
<LI>The CCSA estimated that substance abuse cost the Canadian economy more than $18.4 billion in 
1992. This represents $649 per capita, or about 2.7% of the total Gross Domestic Product. 
<LI>Alcohol accounted for approximately $7.5 billion in costs, or $265 per capita. The costs of smoking 
were $9.5 billion in 1992, or approximately $340 per capita. The economic costs of illicit drugs were 
estimated at over $1.4 billion.
</UL>
There are two key factors to keep in mind when considering the results of 
CCSA's economic cost study.<P>
First, the study was extremely conservative and measured only those harms 
which could be reliably linked to substance use. For example, it has been 
argued that a portion of property crime (i.e. theft) could be attributed to illicit 
drugs, but unfortunately we could find no studies indicating the attributable 
fraction of property crimes to illicit drugs.<P>
Second, drug use in 1992 appears in retrospect to have been at the lowest level 
since the late 1970s and early 1980s. We now know that this "bottoming out" 
was followed by an increase between 1993 and 1995. Therefore, 1992 presents 
us with the most optimistic picture of drug use in Canada. A similar study carried 
out in 1996 would undoubtedly reveal a much grimmer snapshot.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = societal></A>Societal response to substance 
use</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = public></A>Public policy<P></H2>
<H3>Alcohol</H3>
Today alcohol policy in Canada is a shared responsibility of the federal government, and the provinces 
and territories. The federal government has authority over the importing and exporting of alcohol 
products, alcohol-related excise taxes, and broadcast advertising. The broadcasting regulations, developed 
by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), and referred to as the 
"Code", prohibit a range of messages, including any that<P>
<UL>
<LI>attempt to influence non-drinkers to drink, 
<LI>appeal to minors, 
<LI>associate consumption with high-risk activities,
<LI>suggest consumption is associated with success or achievement, or 
<LI>violate the relevant provincial advertising law.
</UL>
In a public notice issued in August, 1996, the CRTC proposed a new regulatory 
framework that would hand over responsibility for the Code to the broadcast 
industry. This responsibility would include the pre-screening of alcohol 
advertisements previously done by the CRTC. The Canadian Centre on 
Substance Abuse has urged the CRTC not to abandon its responsibility for 
enforcing compliance with its own Code and to explain what mechanism it 
envisages for ensuring compliance under the new regulatory framework.<P>
In the same public notice, the CRTC said it "expected" broadcasters to present 
a balanced view of alcohol in our society by broadcasting messages about the 
dangers of alcohol abuse. However, there are no rules stipulating how much 
counter-measure advertising must be broadcast, and no definition of what 
constitutes a balanced view of alcohol. The CCSA has recommended that the 
CRTC involve public health representatives in a proposed annual performance 
review of counter-measure advertising.<P>
<H3>Tobacco</H3>
Two key developments in tobacco policy since 1994 have undermined efforts at 
convincing young Canadians not to smoke. The first was the lowering of federal 
tobacco taxes to counteract a serious cigarette smuggling problem. The second 
was the Supreme Court decision of September, 1995, striking down sections of 
the Tobacco Products Control Act prohibiting cigarette advertising.<P>
Canada desperately needs a bold new initiative to fill the tobacco policy gap that 
now exists. The Government of Canada has a powerful tool at its disposal in the 
form of taxation, yet it clearly wants to avoid raising cigarette prices to the point 
where smuggling once again becomes an attractive option. If higher taxes were 
reinstated, Canada might initiate negotiations with Washington to close the gap 
between Canadian and US prices. Or the use of specialized enforcement could 
be considered. Ultimately, however, adjustments to the supply side of the 
tobacco question–or, indeed, the alcohol and illicit drug situation–will have little 
impact if we cannot reduce the demand through effective programs of education 
and prevention.<P>
<H3>Illicit drugs</H3>
By now this Committee will be very familiar with Bill C-8, the Controlled Drugs 
and Substances Act. It was the Sub-Committee studying the bill that 
recommended the review process we are now engaged in. Clearly the Sub-
Committee believed that this new drug legislation–the first in more than 30 
years–needed to be seen in the larger context of Canadian efforts to combat 
substance abuse. The CCSA wholeheartedly shares that belief.<P>
CCSA presented its views on the new drug legislation two years ago when it 
was still known as Bill C-7. Some of our comments may be worth repeating 
here, although the opportunity to make changes to Bill C-8 has now passed.<P>
CCSA had asked that the legislation be prefaced with a clear statement of 
purpose–much in the same way that the Sub-Committee saw a need to put it in 
context by recommending a review of drug policy. A statement of purpose might 
have helped explain to the Canadian public why a piece of legislation sponsored 
by the Department of Health focuses exclusively on issues of police powers, 
enforcement and penalties.<P>
CCSA also argued that the bill did not take full advantage of the treatment 
options in lieu of prison permitted under the UN drug conventions. We were 
pleased to note the passage of Bill C-41 which makes allowance for alternate 
forms of sentencing for a vast array of offences, and we hope that the courts 
will make the link between the two pieces of legislation.<P>
At this point we need to sound a warning that we have received from our 
colleagues in the treatment field: although they strongly support the use of 
treatment in lieu of prison, their resources are already stretched to the breaking 
point. A further influx of treatment cases from the court system will need to be 
accompanied by a refocusing of resources. The money to be saved by 
streamlining our current "revolving-door" justice system should more than cover 
additional treatment costs.<P>
<H2><A NAME = scope></A>Scope and depth of program 
interventions<P></H2>
<H3>Population health: what is it?</H3>
Drug and alcohol programming in Canada has lost much of its focus in recent 
years because of shrinking budgets and shifting political philosophies. At the 
provincial/territorial level, a majority of independent provincial drug and alcohol 
agencies have been dismantled, and prevention, education and treatment 
activities have been absorbed into the overall provincial health care system. 
This has resulted in an erosion of specialized knowledge and expertise, and the 
loss of valuable personnel.<P>
At the federal level, the remnants of health programs developed under 
Canada's Drug Strategy are now destined to be merged with a host of other 
concerns under the label of population health. It is not clear at this time what 
priority Health Canada will give to substance abuse within this new framework, 
or what types of programming will emerge as a result.<P>
Population health, also known as the determinants of health model, was a 
concept first introduced to Canada more than 20 years ago by former Health 
Minister Marc Lalonde. The approach is attractive because it treats health in a 
holistic way and claims that people can improve their health by making sensible 
lifestyle choices. It has a strong cost-effectiveness appeal as well because it 
suggests that access to costly, high-tech medical services has little real impact 
on our health compared with simple, low-cost measures such as diet and 
exercise.<P>
However, from a programming perspective, population health presents us with a 
conundrum. For example, the literature on population health tells us that job 
status has a significant impact on an individual's health. The more senior the 
worker, the fewer health problems he or she experiences. What type of health 
programming do we devise to address this fact? Do we give everyone a 
promotion? A major study done in the UK a few years ago found that having 
access to a car had a marked influence on the health of people living in London. 
Are we really ready to deal with the implications of population health?<P>
Population health looks at a whole range of determinants that may or may not 
fall within the traditional health context. That makes sense. Perhaps substance 
abuse is not a cause of ill health, but only a symptom. The real determinants 
may be social, economic or biological, or a combination of these and many 
other root causes. These antecedents should be addressed, although we have 
yet to see how this will be done. However, we will still need to deal in a specific 
and focused way with the problems of substance abuse–symptom or 
otherwise.<P>
The CCSA believes that substance abuse is both a catalyst to poor health and 
an inhibitor of success in health and social programming. The population health 
approach will only be viable in an environment which simultaneously 
acknowledges such issues.<P>
Earlier in this paper, we referred to the absence of goals, and a mechanism for 
evaluating those targets in Canada's Drug Strategy. Goal setting and evaluation 
will be a much more complex process within the population health model. Again, 
we are anxiously awaiting word on how this will be done.<P>
We believe CCSA can be of assistance to programmers and policy-makers 
working to flesh out the population health vision. Addressing the health of 
individual population groups will depend heavily on the kind of detailed data we 
gather on those groups and on how each reacts to various health and social 
stressors. In other words, population health is grounded to a large degree in 
epidemiology. The Canadian Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use 
(CCENDU), currently monitoring drug use trends in six Canadian cities, can 
provide a wealth of information to support the implementation of population 
health.<P>
If properly implemented population health could allow us to look at addictions in 
a more holistic way. For example, the CCSA is coming under increasing 
pressure to be a national provider of information on gambling. Although we have 
started to accumulate material on gambling in the National Clearinghouse on 
Substance Abuse, we are somewhat limited by the fact that this is not officially 
part of our mandate. There is a need that clearly could be filled if the CCSA had 
the flexibility to do so.<P>

Canada is not alone in its struggle with substance abuse. Drug use in the US is 
also increasing and the same populations are leading the trend–adolescents 
and young adults. The Clinton administration has reacted by committing the US 
to a 10-year drug strategy with a new emphasis on demand reduction. President 
Clinton has pledged more than $15 billion in the first year alone.<P>
Drug trafficking and money laundering are huge global enterprises and no 
country can deal with its drug problems in isolation. Events halfway around the 
world are felt in a direct and usually devastating way on our city streets. Heroin 
purity rises, people die. Prices drop, people die. Drug deals turn sour, people 
die.<P>
Global free trade in legitimate goods has opened the door to trafficking in drugs. 
Organized crime has taken hold in many countries where the legitimate 
economy is in tatters. Parts of the former Soviet Union, now set adrift, have 
become open channels for drug trafficking. We know also that as drugs make 
their way to market, transit countries increasingly become consumer countries. 
Canada itself is a transit country.<P>
Legal drugs are also an international problem. There are many countries where 
alcohol consumption is at dangerous levels and the only options open to 
government are heavy-handed attempts at prohibition. This was tried in the 
Soviet Union with devastating results.<P>
Tobacco use is growing, especially in Third World countries and emerging 
Soviet bloc nations, as tobacco manufacturers exploit the kind of voracious 
demand for their products that no longer exists in North America. In such 
countries, there are no Health Canada-type warnings on cigarette packages, 
and no real awareness that smoking is deadly.<P>
Science and the information age have combined to create yet another new 
global drug hazard: potent synthetic stimulants are now promoted on the 
Internet, complete with easy-to-follow recipes that can be cooked up on kitchen 
tables around the world.<P>
The United Nations continues to view the fight against substance abuse as one 
of its top priorities, along with terrorism, peace-keeping and the environment. A 
special session of the UN General Assembly will be held in June, 1998, to look 
at the drug problem. It is critical that Canada have a strong presence at that 
meeting.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = issues></A>Issues and opportunities</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = right></A>Drug policy: Have we got it 
right?<P></H2>
Does Canada need to get "tougher on drugs" by moving to a US-style zero-
tolerance approach, or should we learn to accept some drug use as part of 
normal human existence as the Dutch have done, for example? It is tempting to 
view the problem in such clearly defined terms, but the truth is that Canada 
must find subtle and innovative solutions that work for Canadians.<P>
Some things are almost self-evident. As a society, we don't need freer access to 
more psychoactive substances. Do we really need to legalize marijuana, for 
instance? We are already inundated by drugs, both legal and illegal. Isn't the 
devastation caused by alcohol and tobacco a sufficient deterrent to making 
other intoxicants readily available? We are generally too quick to look for 
chemical solutions to problems that threaten to overwhelm us.<P>
On the other hand–and there is considerable irony here–we tend to stigmatize 
people who become drug-dependent, and where illicit drugs are involved, we 
often penalize them in ways that simply add to the harm they are already 
inflicting on themselves.<P>
Discussions of drug policy tend to polarize into support for prohibition at one of 
the spectrum and arguments for decriminalization or legalization at the other 
end. The first group contends that a more liberal approach will lead to a 
dramatic increase in drug use. The second believes that decriminalization or 
legalization will eliminate many drug-related problems by removing the profit 
motive from the drug trade. We aware of no hard evidence to substantiate either 
claim.<P>
The debate over prohibition versus legalization makes interesting newspaper 
copy, but it distracts us from the real issue, namely that no amount of tinkering 
with drug enforcement and supply reduction mechanisms can hope to be as 
effective as a strong, national demand reduction strategy based on prevention, 
education, treatment and rehabilitation.<P>
<H2><A NAME = focus></A>Focus on youth and high-risk 
groups<P></H2>
In its 1987 report, <I>Booze, Pills &amp  Dope: Reducing Substance Abuse in 
Canada</I>, the House Standing Committee on National Health and Welfare 
recommended that the Department of National Health and Welfare identify 
children and youth as the first priority for funding under a cost-shared substance 
abuse prevention program. That recommendation was made at a time when 
youth drug use was in decline, having peaked in the late 1970s and early 
1980s. It was a valid recommendation nonetheless, and it needs to be made 
again today all the more strongly as rates of drug use climb back up towards 
previous levels.<P>
We have learned much in the last decade about how to reach youth with 
credible prevention messages. We are learning to be more honest and 
pragmatic. We need to build on our knowledge as we enter what could be a 
decade of increasing drug use. Our biggest failing is that we have not been 
consistent. Prevention and education campaigns come and go as political 
interest and funding ebb and flow. We must find and support low-cost ways to 
incorporate these efforts into existing and ongoing educational programs.<P>
Policies and programs aimed at youth need to be individually tailored to address 
the specific needs of various youth sub-populations, including hard-to-reach 
street kids. Programs need to become part of the environment where children 
grow and learn, including school, the family, peer groups, and the 
community.<P>
<H3>A key strategy: building resiliency</H3>
In recent years, we have come to a greater appreciation of the role of protective 
factors in youth substance abuse prevention. We have learned that children and 
adolescents become more resilient to drug use if they have access to a 
significant source of social support, either from a sympathetic teacher, family 
member, or member of the community. It only takes one special person, or 
mentor, to provide that support and–just as important–to express high 
expectations of the individual.<P>
<H3>FAS and the labelling issue</H3>
Dwindling resources force us to rethink campaigns aimed at the general 
population and to focus instead on youth and other high-risk groups, including 
Aboriginal peoples, pregnant women, the disabled and the elderly. CCSA has 
done work in all of these areas, but one of our major concentrations at the 
moment is on the problem of fetal damage resulting from women who drink 
while pregnant. The Centre runs a national fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal 
alcohol effects information service in partnership with Health Canada and the 
Brewers Association of Canada.<P>
We raise this issue to draw attention once again to the strong support within the 
FAS/FAE community for warning labels on alcohol containers. We remind the 
Standing Committee that CCSA supported this demand in our appearance 
before the Sub-Committee studying Bill C-222 in April. We see this as a 
consumers' rights issue. But we repeat what we said at that time: warning labels 
and other isolated measures will have little or no effect unless they are part of 
an overall strategy aimed at reducing a wide range of health risks for women 
who abuse alcohol while pregnant, as well as for their developing fetus.<P>
<H2><A NAME = continuum></A>Continuum of cost-effective 
interventions<P></H2>
<H3>Abstinence and controlled use</H3>
Like the debate over prohibition and decriminalization, the arguments around 
abstinence and controlled use rage constantly. A huge battle arose over 
treatment of alcoholism more than 30 years ago when a British doctor reported 
that he had treated several severely alcoholic patients who later went on to 
become moderate "social drinkers". The doctor and his work were mercilessly 
attacked by those who believed in the abstinence approach (popularized by 
Alcoholics Anonymous) which does not acknowledge the possibility of an 
alcoholic learning to drink in a controlled manner.<P>
A similar kind of debate has at times surrounded the notion of maintaining 
heroin addicts on prescribed doses of methadone, or even heroin itself in some 
countries. Likewise, the battle lines are often drawn over the question of 
whether to issue clean needles and syringes to injection drug users in an effort 
to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.<P>
The CCSA believes the polarization of these issues is counterproductive. No 
single solution can be applied successfully to each and every drug abuse 
problem. Substance abuse problems must be seen within a continuum of 
severity demanding appropriate responses. People differ, situations change. 
Where alcohol is concerned, we know that 5-10% of the population may be 
severely dependent drinkers. For them, abstinence is clearly the safest 
route.<P>
<H3>Abstinence and harm reduction</H3>
However, another 15-20% of the population experience occasional problems 
with drinking that may range from skipping a day of work to nurse a hangover to 
causing a serious car accident. Many of these people would be considered 
moderate drinkers, but from time to time, they drink too much. They may not 
accept abstinence as an appropriate option. Our programs and policies must 
reflect this reality and attempt to more precisely target the real source of harm–
not the drinking itself, but the drinking to excess, or abusive drinking. We refer 
to this approach as "harm reduction".<P>
Harm reduction becomes a trickier proposition where illicit drugs are involved. 
The majority of Canadians support methadone and needle exchange programs, 
but within fairly strict limits. How do we feel about handing out clean needles to 
people in prison to stop the rampant spread of HIV/AIDS, for example? How do 
we react to the BC coroner's suggestion that prescribing heroin to addicts under 
a doctor's supervision would reduce the skyrocketing number of fatal overdoses 
on the streets of Vancouver?<P>
<H2><A NAME = supporting></A>Supporting evidence-based 
decisions<P></H2>
These questions are not easily answered. They put society's values to the test. 
When we look beyond the emotional issues, we see a need for rational 
decision-making based on solid information. This begins with an honest 
assessment of all the harms that surround a drug use problem and then 
attempts to put these in priority order. We then try to manage the risks by 
applying strategies that deal with the greatest threats first.<P>
As an approach to intervention, harm reduction has helped to focus attention 
where it appears to be needed most. Where harm reduction has been less 
successful is in the evaluation of its results, and in the clear demonstration of its 
benefits. This is not an easy task. Even if detailed data are gathered, they aren't 
always interpreted correctly.<P>
Earlier this year the <I>Globe and Mail</I> published an article about a needle 
exchange program in Montreal that the newspaper suggested was contributing 
to the spread of HIV/AIDS. The reporter had looked at a study of the program 
that showed the rate of HIV was higher among its clients than among injection 
drug users who did not attend the clinic. CCSA contacted the Montreal doctor 
who did the study for clarification and discovered that the reason for the high 
rate of HIV among clients of the exchange was that a large percentage of them 
started coming to the clinic only <I>after</I> they had already contracted the 
virus. The study actually concluded that the needle exchange was reducing the 
spread of HIV.<P>
<H2><A NAME = enhancing></A>Enhancing private sector and community 
involvement<P></H2>
In recent years, the private sector has emerged as an area of keen interest for 
those of us in the substance abuse field. Many organizations facing the spectre 
of defunding have turned to business and industry for sponsorship and support 
of their activities. CCSA has enjoyed some success in identifying sources of 
private sector funding, notably for our FAS/FAE information service. But the 
members of the Standing Committee should be aware that the delivery of 
substance abuse programs in this country can never hope to depend to any 
significant degree on the largesse of business and industry, unless government 
can devise innovative incentives–perhaps through the tax system–to stimulate 
private sector involvement. We strongly encourage consideration of these kinds 
of strategies.<P>
Where the private sector may be able to help us is in areas where we can help 
them. The need is certainly there for expert advice and counsel. Employee 
substance abuse is viewed by a majority of managers and executives as a 
serious problem and many businesses seem ill-equipped to deal with it. 
Employee assistance programs are springing up in more and more workplaces, 
drug testing of workers has stirred up controversy and a number of appeals to 
human rights tribunals, and many business owners–especially in small and 
medium-size sector–are looking for a place to turn for information.<P>
Canada does not do as well as we might hope when it comes to drugs and the 
workplace. The 1995 World Competitiveness Report showed that Canada had 
moved up to 12th place among 48 countries in overall competitiveness, but 
ranked a dismal 40th in the category of alcohol and drug abuse in the 
workforce.<P>
The CCSA has attempted to fill the knowledge gap around workplace substance 
abuse by publishing a variety of specialized resource materials, including 
Canada's first directory of employee assistance programs and services. The 
centre has worked with the RCMP to develop books and presentations that 
Drug Awareness Officers can take into the workplace. As well, the Centre has 
offered a series of workplace telephone seminars to examine vital issues such 
as the new US transport regulations requiring the testing of all commercial 
drivers entering the US.<P>
<H3>Finding ways to involve communities</H3>
Community involvement is critical to the success of substance abuse policy and 
programming. Programs devised at the national level are cost effective because 
they can serve many people. But they also must be flexible enough to meet the 
needs of individual populations and locations. Only strong input from those 
communities will produce the right kinds of strategies. Only an effective 
mechanism for national communication will ensure that input.<P>
Part of the job of the community development process, particularly within the 
population health framework, is to find ways of stimulating involvement by so-
called non-traditional groups, which like the private sector have not typically 
seen themselves as part of substance abuse prevention strategies. Examples 
would include groups and individuals concerned with issues of housing, 
unemployment and poverty. Even those whose main preoccupation is finance 
need to become involved. We must develop incentives that will draw these 
groups into the overall effort.<P>
<CENTER><H1><A NAME = summary></A>Summary and conclusions</H1></CENTER>
<H2><A NAME = problem></A>The problem<P></H2>
<UL>
<LI>The use of psychoactive substances entails enormous adverse consequences to the health of 
Canadians. The misuse of alcohol and illicit drugs is also associated with adverse social consequences 
such as crime, violent behaviour, unemployment and poor productivity, family discord, as well as spousal 
and child abuse.
<LI>Alcohol continues to exact a heavy toll on the well-being of Canadians, particularly among youth and 
high-risk populations such as First Nations peoples, pregnant women, the disabled and the elderly.
<LI>Tobacco use continues to decline within the general population (15 years and older), but there are 
indications of a significant increase among adolescents since 1993.
<LI>Illicit drug use is on the rise for the first time in more than a decade and the increase is being led by 
younger Canadians.
<LI>Taken together, substance abuse accounted for 21% of total mortality in 1992, and 23% of years of 
potential life lost. Hospitalizations due to substance abuse constituted 8% of total hospitalizations and 
10% of the total days spent in hospitals for any cause in Canada in 1992.
<LI>Substance abuse cost the Canadian economy more than $18.4 billion in 1992. This represents $649 
per capita, or about 2.7% of the total Gross Domestic Product.
</UL>
<H2><A NAME = response></A>The federal response<P></H2>
<UL>
<LI>At the federal level, the health of programs developed under Canada's Drug Strategy are now 
destined to be merged with a host of other concerns under the label of population health. It is not clear at 
this time what priority Health Canada will give to substance abuse within this new framework, or what 
types of programming will emerge as a result.
<LI>By the time this Committee presents its recommendations in June, 1997, Canada's Drug Strategy will 
have sunset three months earlier, and unless there is a significant change in the current course of events, 
the The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse will have ceased to exist.
<LI>Two key developments in tobacco policy since 1994–the lowering of cigarette taxes and the striking 
down of the ban on advertising–have undermined efforts at convincing young Canadians not to smoke. 
Canada needs a bold new initiative to fill the tobacco policy gap that now exists.
<LI>The resurgence of drug use we are now witnessing is led largely by mainstream youth, indicating 
that we may have paid a heavy price for changing our focus and neglecting this group in Phase II of 
Canada's Drug Strategy.
<LI>The Standing Committee can play a pivotal role in rekindling Canadian efforts to combat substance 
abuse. Our hope is that it will re-affirm the need for leadership and commitment by the Government of 
Canada in this area, and recommend continued investment in prevention, education and treatment.

</UL>
<H3>Population health</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The CCSA considers substance abuse to be both a catalyst to poor health and an inhibitor of success 
in health and social programming. The population health approach will only be viable in an environment 
which simultaneously acknowledges such issues.
<LI>If properly implemented population health could allow us to look at addictions in a more holistic 
way, such as gambling. There is a need that clearly could be filled if the CCSA had the flexibility to do so.
</UL>
<H3>Drug control policy</H3>

clear demonstration of its benefits.
<LI>Our alcohol prevention and education programs and policies must reflect the reality that abstinence 
is not for everyone and must attempt to more precisely target the real source of harm–not the drinking 
itself, but the drinking to excess, or abusive drinking.
</UL>
<H3>Alcohol advertising</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse has urged the CRTC not to abandon its responsibility for 
enforcing compliance with its own Code on the broadcasting of alcohol advertising, and has asked what 
mechanism it envisages for ensuring compliance with the Code under the CRTC's new regulatory 
framework. The CCSA has recommended that the CRTC involve public health representatives in a 
proposed annual performance review of counter-measure advertising in order to ensure a balanced view of 
alcohol in the electronic media.
</UL>
<H3>Alternate sentencing and treatment</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A further influx of drug treatment cases from the court system as a result of alternate sentencing will 
need to be accompanied by a refocusing of resources. The money to be saved by streamlining our current 
"revolving-door" justice system should more than cover additional treatment costs.
</UL>
<H3>Warning labels</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Warning labels on alcohol containers and other isolated measures will have little or no effect unless 
they are part of an overall strategy aimed at reducing a wide range of health risks for women who abuse
