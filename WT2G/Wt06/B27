                    ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT
                               - GLAUCOMA


Findings of Fact

     The preponderance of the evidence establishes the following facts 
with respect to the accepted medical use of marijuana in the treatment of
glaucoma.

          1.  Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by the 
excessive accumulation of fluid causing increased intraocular pressure, 
distorted vision and, ultimately, blindness.  In its early stages this 
pressure can sometimes be relieved by the administration of drugs.  When 
such medical treatment fails adequately to reduce the intraocular 
pressure (IOP), surgery is generally resorted to.  Although useful in 
many cases, there is a high incidence of failure with some types of 
surgery.  Further, serious complications can occur as a result of 
invasive surgery.  Newer, non-invasive procedures such as laser 
trabeculoplasty are thought by some to offer much greater efficacy with 
fewer complications.  Unless the IOP is relieved and brought to a 
satisfactory level by one means or another, the patient will go blind.

          2.  Two highly qualified and experienced ophthalmologists in 
the United States have accepted marijuana as having a medical use in 
treatment for glaucoma.  They are John C. Merritt, M.D. and Richard D. 
North, M.D.  Each of them is both a clinician, treating patients, and a 
researcher.  Dr. Merritt is also a professor of ophthalmology.  Dr. North 
has served as a medical officer in ophthalmology for the Department of 
Health, Education and Welfare and has worked with the Public Health 
Service and FDA.
                                 - 35 -
<hr>
          3.  Dr. Merritt's experience with glaucoma patients using 
marijuana medicinally includes one Robert Randall and, insofar as the 
evidence here establishes per petitioners' briefs, an unspecified number 
of other patients, something in excess of 40.

          4.  Dr. North has treated only one glaucoma patient using 
marijuana medicinally - the same Robert Randall mentioned immediately 
above.  Dr. North had monitored Mr. Randall's medicinal use of marijuana 
for nine years as of May 1987

          5.  Dr. Merritt has accepted marijuana as having an important 
place in the treatment of "End Stage" glaucoma.  "End Stage" glaucoma, 
essentially, defines a patient who has already lost substantial amounts 
of vision; available glaucoma control drugs are no longer able adequately 
to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) to prevent further, progressive 
sight loss; the patient, lacking additional IOP reductions, will go 
blind.

          6.  Robert S. Hepler, M.D., is a highly qualified and 
experienced ophthalmologist.  He has done research with respect to the 
effect of smoking marijuana on glaucoma.  In December 1975 he prescribed 
marijuana for the same Robert Randall mentioned above as a research 
subject.  Dr. Hepler found that large dosages of smoked marijuana 
effectively reduced Robert Randall's IOP into the safe range over an 
entire test day.  He concluded that the only known alternative to 
preserve Randall's sight which would avoid the significant risks of 
surgery is to include marijuana as part of Randall's prescribed medical 
regimen.  He further concluded in 1977 that, if marijuana could have been 
legally prescribed, he would have prescribed it for Randall as part of 
Randall's regular glaucoma maintenance program had he been Randall's 
personal physician.
                                 - 36 -
<hr>
Nonetheless, in 1987 Dr. Hepler was of the opinion that marijuana did
not have a currently accepted medical use in the United States for the
treatment of glaucoma.

          7.  Four glaucoma patients testified in these proceedings.  
Each has found marijuana to be of help in controlling IOP.

          8.  In 1984 the treatment of glaucoma with Cannabis was the 
subject of an Ophthalmology Grand Rounds at the University of California, 
San Francisco.  A questionnaire was distributed which queried the 
ophthalmologists on cannabis therapy for glaucoma patients refractory to 
standard treatment.  Many of them have glaucoma patients who have asked 
about marijuana.  Most of the responding ophthalmologists believed that 
THC capsules or smoked marijuana need to be available for patients who 
have not benefited significantly from standard treatment.

          9.  In about 1978 an unspecified number of persons in the 
public health service sector in New Mexico, including some physicians, 
accepted marijuana as having medical use in treating glaucoma.

         10.  A majority of an unspecified number of ophthalmologists 
known to Arthur Kaufman, M.D., who was formerly in general practice but 
now is employed as a medical program administrator, accept marijuana as 
having medical use in treatment of glaucoma.

         11.  In addition to the physicians identified and referred to in 
the findings above, the testimony of patients in this record establishes 
that no more than three or four other physicians consider marijuana to be 
medically useful in the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.  One 
of those Physicians actually wrote a prescription for marijuana for a 
patient, which, of course, she was unable to have filled.

                                 - 37 -
<hr>
         12.  There are test results showing that smoking marijuana has 
reduced the IOP in some glaucoma patients.  There is continuing research 
underway in the United States as to the therapeutic effect of marijuana 
on glaucoma.


Discussion

     Petitioners' briefs fail to show that the preponderance of the 
evidence in the record with respect to marijuana and glaucoma establishes 
that a respectable minority of physicians accepts marijuana as being 
useful in the treatment of glaucoma in the United States.

     This conclusion is not to be taken in any way as criticism of the 
opinions of the ophthalmologists who testified that they accept marijuana 
for this purpose.  The failure lies with petitioners.  In their briefs 
they do not point out hard, specific evidence in this record sufficient 
to establish that a respectable minority of physicians has accepted their 
position.

     There is a great volume of evidence here, and much discussion in the 
briefs, about the protracted case of Robert Randall.  But when all is 
said and done, his experience presents but one case.  The record contains 
sworn testimony of three ophthalmologists who have treated Mr. Randall.  
One of them tells us of a relatively small number of other glaucoma 
patients whom he has treated with marijuana and whom he knows to have 
responded favorably.  Another of these three doctors has successfully 
treated only Randall with marijuana.  The third testifies, despite his 
successful experience in treating Randall, that marijuana does not have 
an accepted use in such treatment.

     In addition to Robert Randall, Petitioners point to the testimony of 
three other glaucoma patients.  Their case histories are impressive, but 
they contribute

                                 - 38 -
<hr>
little to the carrying of Petitioner's burden of showing that marijuana 
is accepted for medical treatment of glaucoma by a respectable minority 
of physicians.  See pages 26-29, above.

     Petitioners have in evidence copies of a number of newspaper 
clippings reporting statements by persons claiming that marijuana has 
helped their glaucoma.  The administrative law judge is unable to give 
significant weight to this evidence.  Had these persons testified so as 
to have been subject to cross-examination, a different situation would be 
presented.  But these newspaper reports of extra-judicial statements, 
neither tested by informed inquiry nor supported by a doctor's opinion, 
are not entitled to much weight.  They are of little, if any, 
materiality.

     Beyond the evidence referred to above there is a little other "hard" 
evidence, pointed out by petitioners, of Physicians accepting marijuana 
for treatment of glaucoma.  Such evidence as that concerning a survey of 
a group of San Francisco ophthalmologists is ambiguous, at best.  The 
relevant document establishes merely that most of the doctors on the 
grand round, who responded to an inquiry, believed that the THC capsules 
or marijuana ought to be available.

     In sum, the evidence here tending to show that marijuana is accepted 
for treatment of glaucoma falls far, far short of quantum of evidence 
tending to show that marijuana is accepted for treatment of emesis in 
cancer patients.  The preponderance of the evidence here, identified by 
petitioners in their briefs, does not establish that a respectable 
minority of physicians has accepted marijuana for glaucoma treatment.

                                  VII.

                   ACCEPTED MEDICAL USE IN TREATMENT
                    - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, SPASTICITY
                        AND HYPERPARATHYROIDISM


Findings Of Fact

     The preponderance of the evidence clearly establishes the following 
facts with respect to marijuana's use in connection with multiple 
sclerosis, spasticity and hyperparathyroidism.

          1.  Multiple sclerosis is the major cause of neurological 
disability among young and middle-aged adults in the United States today.  
It is a life-long disease.  It can be extremely debilitating to some of 
its victims but it does not shorten the life span of most of them.  Its 
cause is yet to be determined.  It attacks the myelin sheath, the coating 
or insulation surrounding the message-carrying nerve fibers in the brain 
and spinal cord.  Once the myelin sheath is destroyed, it is replaced by 
plaques of hardened tissue known as sclerosis.  During the initial stages 
of the disease nerve impulses are transmitted with only minor 
interruptions.  As the disease progresses, the plaques may completely 
obstruct the impulses along certain nerve systems.  These obstructions 
produce malfunctions.  The effects are sporadic in most individuals and 
the effects often occur episodically, triggered either by malfunction of 
the nerve impulses or by external factors.

          2.  Over time many patients develop spasticity, the involuntary 
and abnormal contraction of muscle or muscle fibers.  (Spasticity can 
also result from serious injuries to the spinal cord, not related to 
multiple sclerosis.)

          3.  The symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary according to the 
area of

                                 - 40 -
<hr>
the nervous system which is affected and according to the severity of the 
disease.  The symptoms can include one or more of the following:  
weakness, tingling, numbness, impaired sensation, lack of coordination, 
disturbances in equilibrium, double vision, loss of vision, involuntary 
rapid movement of the eyes (nystagmus), slurred speech, tremors, 
stiffness, spasticity, weakness of limbs, sexual dysfunction, paralysis, 
and impaired bladder and bowel functions.

          4.  Each person afflicted by multiple sclerosis is affected 
differently.  In some persons, the symptoms of the disease are barely 
detectable, even over long periods of time.  In these cases, the persons 
can live their lives as if they did not suffer from the disease.  In 
others, more of the symptoms are present and acute, thereby limiting 
their physical capabilities.  Moreover, others may experience sporadic, 
but acute, symptoms.

          5.  At this time, there is no known prevention or cure for 
multiple sclerosis.  Instead, there are only treatments for the symptoms 
of the disease.  There are very few drugs specifically designed to treat
spasticity.  These drugs often cause very serious side effects.  At the 
present time two drugs are approved by FDA as "safe" and "effective" for 
the specific indication of spasticity.  These drugs are Dantrium and 
Lioresal baclofen.

          6.  Unfortunately, neither Dantrium nor Lioresal is a very 
effective spasm control drug.  Their marginal medical utility, high 
toxicity and potential for serious adverse effects make these drugs 
difficult to use in spasticity therapy.

          7.  As a result, many physicians routinely prescribe 
tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, mood elevators and sedatives such as 
Valium to patients experiencing spasticity.  While these drugs do not 
directly reduce spasticity

                                 - 41 -
<hr>
they may weaken the patient's muscle tone, thus making the spasms less 
noticeable.  Alternatively, they may induce sleep or so tranquilize the 
patient that normal mental and physical functions are impossible.

          8.  A healthy, athletic young woman named Valerie Cover was 
stricken with multiple sclerosis while in her early twenties.  She 
consulted several medical specialists and followed all the customary 
regimens and prescribed methods for coping with this debilitating disease 
over a period of several years.  None of these proved availing.  Two 
years after first experiencing the symptoms of multiple sclerosis her 
active, productive life - as an athlete, Navy officer's wife and mother - 
was effectively over.  The Social Security Administration declared her 
totally disabled.  To move about her home she had to sit on a skateboard 
and push herself around.  She spent most of her time in bed or sitting in 
a wheelchair.

          9.  An occasional marijuana smoker in her teens, before her 
marriage, she had not smoked it for five years as of February 1986.  Then 
a neighbor suggested that marijuana just might help Mrs. Cover's multiple 
sclerosis, having read that it had helped cancer patient's control their 
emesis.  Mrs. Cover acceded to the suggestion.

         10.  Just before smoking the marijuana cigarette produced by her 
neighbor, Mrs. Cover had been throwing up and suffering from spasms.  
Within five minutes of smoking part of the marijuana cigarette she 
stopped vomiting, no longer felt nauseous and noticed that the intensity 
of her spasms was significantly reduced.  She stood up unaided.

         11.  Mrs. Cover began smoking marijuana whenever she felt 
nauseated.  When she did so it controlled her vomiting, stopped the 
nausea and increased her

                                 - 42 -
<hr>
appetite.  It helped ease and control her spasticity.  Her limbs were 
much easier to control.  After three months of smoking marijuana she 
could walk unassisted, had regained all of her lost weight, her seizures 
became almost nonexistent.  She could again care for her children.  She 
could drive an automobile again.  She regained the ability to lead a 
normal life.

         12.  Concerned that her use of this illegal substance might 
jeopardize the career of her Navy officer husband, Mrs. Cover stopped 
smoking marijuana several times.  Each time she did so, after about a 
month, she had retrogressed to the point that her multiple sclerosis 
again had her confined to bed and wheelchair or skateboard.  As of the 
Spring of 1987 Mrs. Cover had resumed smoking marijuana regularly on an 
"as needed" basis.  Her multiple sclerosis symptoms are under excellent
control.  She has obtained a full-time job.  She still needs a wheelchair 
on rare occasions, but generally has full use of her limbs and can walk 
around with relative ease.

         13.  Mrs. Cover's doctor has accepted the effectiveness of 
marijuana in her case.  He questioned her closely about her use of it, 
telling her that it is the most effective drug known in reducing 
vomiting.  Mrs. Cover and her doctor are now in the process of filing an 
Investigational New Drug (IND) application with FDA so that she can 
legally obtain the marijuana she needs to lead a reasonably normal life.

         14.  Martha Hirsch is a young woman in her mid-thirties.  She 
first exhibited symptoms of multiple sclerosis at age 19 and it was 
diagnosed at that time.  Her condition has grown progressively worse.  
She has been under the care of physicians and hospitalized for treatment.  
Many drugs have been prescribed for her by her doctors.  At one point in 
1983 she listed the drugs that had been

                                 - 43 -
<hr>
prescribed for her.  There were 17 on the list.  None of them has given 
her the relief from her multiple sclerosis symptoms that marijuana has.

         15.  During the early stages in the development of her illness 
Ms. Hirsch found that smoking marijuana improved the quality of her life, 
keeping her spasms under control.  Her balance improved.  She seldom 
needed to use her cane for support.  Her condition lately has 
deteriorated.  As of May l987 she was experiencing severe, painful 
spasms.  She had an indwelling catheter in her bladder.  She had lost her 
locomotive abilities and was wheelchair bound.  She could seldom find 
marijuana on the illegal market and, when she did, she often could not 
afford to purchase it.  When she did obtain some, however, and smoked it, 
her entire body seemed to relax, her spasms decreased or disappeared, she 
slept better and her dizzy spells vanished.  The relaxation of her leg 
muscles after smoking marijuana has been confirmed by her personal care 
attendant's examination of them.

         16.  The personal care attendant has told Ms. Hirsch that she, 
the attendant, treats a number of patients who smoke marijuana for relief 
of multiple sclerosis symptoms.  In about 1980 another patient told Ms. 
Hirsch that he knew many patients who smoke marijuana to relieve their 
spasms.  Through him she met other patients and found that marijuana was 
commonly used by many multiple sclerosis patients.  Most of these persons 
had told their doctors about their doing so.  None of those doctors 
advised against the practice and some encouraged it.

         17.  Among the drugs prescribed by doctors for Ms. Hirsch was 
ACTH.  This failed to give her any therapeutic benefit or to control her 
spasticity.  It did produce a number of adverse effects, including severe 
nausea and vomiting which, in turn, were partly controlled by rectally 
administered anti-emetic

                                 - 44 -
<hr>
drugs.

         18.  Another drug prescribed for her was Lioresal, intended to 
reduce her spasms.  It was not very effective in doing.  But it did cause 
Ms. Hirsch to have hallucinations.  On two occasions, while using this 
drug, Ms. Hirsch "saw" a large fire in her bedroom and called for help.  
There was no fire.  She stopped using that drug.  Ms. Hirsch has 
experienced no adverse reactions with marijuana.

         19.  Ms. Hirsch's doctor has accepted marijuana as beneficial 
for her.  He agreed to write her a prescription for it, if that would 
help her obtain it.  She has asked him if he would file an IND 
application with the FDA for her.  He replied that the paperwork was 
"overwhelming".  He indicated willingness to put the paper work together.

         20.  When Greg Paufler was in his early twenties, employed by 
Prudential Insurance Company, he began to experience the first symptoms 
of multiple sclerosis.  His condition worsened as the disease 
intensified.  He had to be hospitalized.  He lost the ability to walk, to 
stand.  Diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, a doctor prescribed ACTH 
for him, an intensive form of steroid therapy.  He lost all control over 
his limbs and experienced severe, painful spasms.  His arms and legs 
became numb.

         21.  ACTH had no beneficial effects.  The doctor continued to 
prescribe it many months.  ACTH made Paufler ravenously hungry and he 
began gaining a great deal of weight.  ACTH caused fluid retention and 
Paufler became bloated, rapidly gaining weight.  His doctor thought 
Paufler should continue this steroid therapy, even though it caused the 
adverse effects mentioned plus the possibility of sudden heart attack or 
death due to respiratory failure.  Increased dosages

                                 - 45 -
<hr>
of this FDA-approved drug caused fluid to press against Paufler's lungs 
making it difficult for him to breathe and causing his legs and feet to 
become swollen.  The steroid therapy caused severe, intense depression 
marked by abrupt mood shifts.  Throughout, the spasms continued and 
Paufler's limbs remained out of control.  The doctor insisted that ACTH 
was the only therapy likely to be of any help with the multiple 
sclerosis, despite its adverse effects.  Another, oral, steroid was 
eventually substituted.

         22.  One day Paufler became semi-catatonic while sitting in his 
living room at home.  He was rushed to the hospital emergency room.  He 
nearly died.  Lab reports indicated, among other things, a nearly total 
lack of potassium in his body.  He was given massive injections of 
potassium in the emergency room and placed on an oral supplement.  
Paufler resolved to take no more steroids.

         23.  From time to time, prior to this point, Paufler had smoked 
marijuana socially with visiting friends, seek some relief from his 
misery in a temporary "high".  He now began smoking marijuana more often.  
After some weeks he found that he could stand and then walk a bit.  His 
doctor dismissed the idea that marijuana could be helpful with multiple 
sclerosis, and Paufler, himself, was skeptical at first.  He began 
discontinuing it for a while, then resuming.

         24.  Paufler found that when he did not smoke marijuana his 
condition worsened, he suffered more intense spasms more frequently.  
When he smoked marijuana, his condition would stabilize and then improve;
spasms were more controlled and less severe; he felt better; he regained 
control over his limbs and could walk totally unaided.  His vision, often 
blurred and unfocused, improved.  Eventually he began smoking marijuana 
on a daily basis.  He ventured outdoors.  He was soon walking half a 
block.  His eyesight returned to normal.

                                 - 46 -
<hr>
His central field blindness cleared up.  He could focus well enough to 
read again.  One evening he went out with his children and found he could 
kick a soccer ball again.

         25.  Paufler has smoked marijuana regularly since 1980.  Since 
that time his multiple sclerosis has been well controlled.  His doctor 
has been astonished at Paufler's recovery.  Paufler can now run.  He can 
stand on one foot with his eyes closed.  The contrast with his condition, 
several years ago, seems miraculous.  Smoking marijuana when Paufler 
feels an attack coming on shortens the attack.  Paufler's doctor has 
looked Paufler in the eye and told him to keep doing whatever it is he's 
doing because it works.  Paufler and his doctor are exploring the 
possibility of obtaining a compassionate IND to provide legal access to 
marijuana for Paufler.

         26.  Paufler learned in about 1980 of the success of one Sam 
Diana, a multiple sclerosis patient, in asserting the defense of "medical 
necessity" in court when charged with using or possessing marijuana.  He 
learned that doctors, researchers and other multiple sclerosis patients 
had supported Diana's position in the court proceeding.

         27.  Irwin Rosenfeld has been diagnosed as having Pseudo Pseudo 
Hypoparathyroidism.  This uncommon disease causes bone spurs to appear 
and grow all over the body.  Over the patient's lifetime hundreds of 
these spurs can grow, any one of which can become malignant at any time.  
The resulting cancer would spread quickly and the patient would die.

         28.  Even without development of a malignancy, the disease 
causes enormous pain.  The spurs press upon adjacent body tissue, nerves 
and organs.  In Rosenfeld's case, he could neither sit still nor lie 
down, nor could he walk,

                                 - 47 -
<hr>
without experiencing pain.  Working in his furniture store in Portsmouth, 
Virginia, Mr. Rosenfeld was on his feet moving furniture all day long.  
The lifting and walking caused serious problems as muscles and tissues 
rubbed over the spurs of bone.  He tore muscles and hemorrhaged almost 
daily.

         29.  Rosenfeld's symptoms first appeared about the age of ten.  
Various drugs were prescribed for him for pain relief.  He was taking 
extremely powerful narcotics.  By the age of 19 his therapy included 300 
mg. of Sopor (a powerful sleeping agent) and very high doses of Dilaudid.  
He was found to be allergic to barbiturates.  Taking massive doses of 
pain control drugs, as prescribed, made it very difficult for Rosenfeld 
to function normally.  If he took enough of them to control the pain, he 
could barely concentrate on his schoolwork.  By the time he reached his 
early twenties Rosenfeld's monthly drug intake was between 120 to 140 
Dilaudid tablets, 30 or more Sopor sleeping pills and dozens of muscle 
relaxants.

         30.  At college in Florida Rosenfeld was introduced to marijuana 
by classmates.  He experimented with it recreationally.  He never 
experienced a "high" or "buzz" or "floating sensation" from it.  One day 
he smoked marijuana while playing chess with a friend.  It had been very 
difficult for him to sit for more than five or ten minutes at a time 
because of tumors in the backs of his legs.  Suddenly he realized that, 
absorbed in his chess game, and smoking marijuana, he had remained 
sitting for over an hour - with no pain.  He experimented further and 
found that his pain was reduced whenever he smoked marijuana.

         31.  Rosenfeld told his doctor of his discovery.  The doctor 
opined that it was possible that the marijuana was relieving the pain.  
Something

                                 - 48 -
<hr>
certainly was - there was a drastic decrease in Rosenfeld's need for such 
drugs as Dilaudid and Demerol and for sleeping pills.  The quality of 
pain relief which followed his smoking of marijuana was superior to any 
he had experienced before.  As his dosages of powerful conventional drugs 
decreased, Rosenfeld became less withdrawn from the world, more able to 
interact and function.  So he has continued to the present time.

         32.  After some time Rosenfeld's doctor accepted the fact that 
the marijuana was therapeutically helpful to Rosenfeld and submitted an 
IND application to FDA to obtain supplies of it legally for Rosenfeld.  
The doctor has insisted, however, that he not be publicly identified.  
After some effort the IND application was granted.  Rosenfeld is 
receiving supplies of marijuana from NIDA.  Rosenfeld testified before a 
committee of the Virginia legislature in about 1979 in support of 
legislation to make marijuana available for therapeutic purposes in that 
State.

         33.  In 1969, at age 19, David Branstetter dove into the shallow 
end of a swimming pool and broke his neck.  He became a quadriplegic, 
losing control over the movement of his arms and legs.  After being 
hospitalized for 18 months he returned home.  Valium was prescribed for 
him to reduce the severe spasms associated with his condition.  He became 
mildly addicted to Valium.  Although it helped mask his spasms, it made 
Branstetter more withdrawn and less able to take care of himself.  He 
stopped taking Valium for fear of the consequences of long-term 
addiction.  His spasms then became uncontrollable, often becoming so bad 
they would throw him from his wheelchair.

         34.  In about 1973 Branstetter began smoking marijuana 
recreationally.  He discovered that his severe spasms stopped whenever he 
smoked marijuana.

                                 - 49 -
<hr>
Unlike Valium, which only masked his symptoms and caused him to feel 
drunk and out of control, marijuana brought his spasmodic condition under 
control without impairing his faculties.  When he was smoking marijuana 
regularly he was more active, alert and outgoing.

         35.  Marijuana controlled his spasms so well that Branstetter 
could go out with friends and he began to play billiards again.  The 
longer he smoked marijuana the more he was able to use his arms and 
hands.  Marijuana also improved his bladder control and bowel movements.

         36.  At times the illegal marijuana Branstetter was smoking 
became very expensive and sometimes was unavailable.  During periods when 
he did not have marijuana his spasms would return, preventing Branstetter 
from living a "normal" life.  He would begin to shake uncontrollably, his 
body would feel tense, and his muscles would spasm.

         37.  In 1979 Branstetter was arrested and convicted of 
possession of marijuana.  He was placed on probation for two years.  
During that period he continued smoking marijuana and truthfully reported 
this, and the reason for it, to his probation officer whenever asked 
about it.  No action was taken against Branstetter by the court or 
probation authorities because of his continuing use of marijuana, except 
once in the wake of his publicly testifying about it before the Missouri 
legislature.  Then, although adverse action was threatened by the judge, 
nothing was actually done.

         38.  In 1981 Branstetter and a friend, a paraplegic, 
participated in a research study testing the therapeutic effects of 
synthetic THC on spasticity.  Placed on the THC Branstetter found that it 
did help control his spasms but appeared to became less effective with 
repeated use.  Also, unlike marijuana,

                                 - 50 -
<hr>
synthetic THC had a powerful mind-altering effect he found annoying.  
When the study ended the researcher strongly suggested that Branstetter 
continue smoking marijuana to control his spasms.

         39.  None of Branstetter's doctors have told him to stop smoking 
marijuana while several, directly and indirectly, have encouraged him to 
continue.  Branstetter knows of almost 20 other patients, paraplegics, 
quadriplegics and multiple sclerosis sufferers, who smoke marijuana to 
control their spasticity.

         40.  In 1981 a State of Washington Superior Court judge, sitting 
without a jury, found Samuel D. Diana not guilty of the charge of 
unlawful possession of marijuana.  In so doing the judge upheld Diana's 
defense of medical necessity.  Diana had been a multiple sclerosis 
patient since at least 1973.  He testified that smoking marijuana 
relieved his symptoms of double vision, tremors, unsteady walk, impaired 
hearing, tendency to vomit in the mornings and stiffness in the joints of 
his hands and legs.

         41.  Among the witnesses was a physician who had examined 
defendant Diana before and after he had used marijuana.  This doctor 
testified that marijuana had been effective therapeutically for Diana, 
that other medication had proven ineffective for Diana and that, while 
marijuana may have some detrimental effects, Diana would receive more 
benefit than harm from smoking it.  The doctor was not aware of any other 
drug that would be as effective as marijuana for Mr. Diana.  Other 
witnesses included three persons afflicted with multiple sclerosis who 
testified in detail as to marijuana's beneficial effect on their illness.

         42.  In acquitting defendant Diana of unlawful possession of 
marijuana the trial judge found that the three requirements for the 
defense of medical necessity had been established, namely: defendant's 
reasonable belief that his

                                 - 51 -
<hr>
use of marijuana was necessary to minimize the effects of multiple 
sclerosis; the benefits derived from its use are greater than the harm 
sought to be prevented by the controlled substances law; and no drug is 
as effective as marijuana in minimizing the effects of the disease in the 
defendant.

         43.  Denis Petro, M.D., is a neurologist of broad experience, 
ranging from active practice in neurology to teaching the subject in 
medical school and employment by FDA as a medical officer reviewing IND's 
and NDA's.  He has also been employed by pharmaceutical companies and has 
served as a consultant to the State of New York.  He is well acquainted 
with the case histories of three patients who have successfully utilized 
marijuana to control severe spasticity when other, FDA-approved drugs 
failed to do so.  Dr. Petro knows of other cases of patients who, he 
has determined, have effectively used marijuana to control their 
spasticity.  He has heard reports of additional patients with multiple 
sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia doing the same.  There are reports 
published in the literature known to Dr. Petro, over the period at least 
1970 - 1986, of clinical tests demonstrating that marijuana and THC are 
effective in controlling or reducing spasticity in patients.

         44.  Large numbers of paraplegic and quadriplegic patients, 
particularly in Veterans Hospitals, routinely smoke marijuana to reduce 
spasticity.  While this mode of treatment is illegal, it is generally 
tolerated, if not openly encouraged, by physicians in charge of such 
wards who accept this practice as being of benefit to their patients.  
There are many spinal cord injury patients in Veterans Hospitals.

         45.  Dr. Petro sought FDA approval to conduct research with 
spasticity patients using marijuana.  FDA refused but, for reasons 
unknown to him, allowed

him to make a study using synthetic THC.  He and colleagues made such a 
study.  They concluded that synthetic THC effected a significant 
reduction in spasticity among multiple sclerosis patients, but study 
participants who had also smoked marijuana reported consistently that 
marijuana was more effective.

         46.  Dr. Petro accepts marijuana as having a medical use in the 
treatment of spasticity in the United States.  If it were legally 
available and he was engaged in an active medical practice again, he 
would not hesitate to prescribe marijuana, when appropriate, to patients 
afflicted with uncontrollable spasticity.

         47.  Dr. Petro presented a paper to a meeting of the American 
Academy of Neurology.  The paper was accepted for presentation.  After he 
presented it Dr. Petro found that many of the neurologists present at 
this most prestigious meeting were in agreement with his acceptance of 
marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of spasticity.

         48.  Dr. Andrew Weil, a general medicine practitioner in Tucson, 
Arizona, who also teaches at the University of Arizona College of 
Medicine, accepts marijuana as having a medical use in the treatment of 
spasticity.  In multiple sclerosis patients the muscles become tense and 
rigid because their nerve supply is interrupted.  Marijuana relieves this 
spasticity in many patients, he has found.  He would prescribe it to 
selected patients if it were legally available,

         49.  Dr. Lester B. Collins, III, a neurologist, then treating 
about 20 multiple sclerosis patients a year, seeing two or three new ones 
each year, stated in 1983 that he had no doubt that marijuana worked 
symptomatically for some multiple sclerosis patients.  He said that it 
does not alter the course of

                                 - 53 -
<hr>
the disease but it does relieve the symptoms of spasticity.

         50.  Dr. John P. Morgan, board certified in internal medicine, 
Professor of Medicine and Director of Pharmacology at CCNY Medical School 
in New York and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology at Mt. 
Sinai School of Medicine, accepts marijuana as having medical use in 
treatment in the United States.  If he were practicing medicine and 
marijuana were legally available he would prescribe it when indicated to 
patients with legitimate medical needs.


Discussion

     Based upon the rationale set out in pages 26 to 34, above, the 
administrative law judge concludes that, within the meaning of the Act, 
21 U.S.C. ¤ 812(b)(2)(B), marijuana "has a currently accepted medical use 
in treatment in the United States" for spasticity resulting from multiple 
sclerosis and other causes.  It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and 
capricious to find otherwise.  The facts set out above, uncontroverted by 
the Agency, establish beyond question that some doctors in the United 
States accept marijuana as helpful in such treatment for some patients.  
The record here shows that they constitute a significant minority of 
physicians.  Nothing more can reasonably be required.  That some doctors 
would have more studies and test results in hand before accepting 
marijuana's usefulness here is irrelevant.

     The same is true with respect to the hyperparathyroidism from which 
Irvin Rosenfeld suffers.  His disease is so rare, and so few physicians 
appear to be familiar with it, that acceptance by one doctor of marijuana 
as being useful in treating it ought to satisfy the requirement for a 
significant minority.  The Agency points to no evidence of record tending
to establish that marijuana is

                                - 54 -
<hr>
not accepted by doctors in connection with this most unusual ailment.  
Refusal to acknowledge acceptance by a significant minority, in light of 
the case history detailed in this record, would be unreasonable, 
arbitrary and capricious.

            ACCEPTED SAFETY FOR USE UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION

     With respect to whether or not there is "a lack of accepted safety 
for use of [marijuana] under medical supervision", the record shows the 
following facts to be uncontroverted.


Findings of Fact

          1.  Richard J. Gralla, M.D., an oncologist and Professor of 
Medicine who was an Agency witness, accepts that in treating cancer 
patients oncologists can use the cannabinoids with safety despite their 
side effects.

          2.  Andrew T. Weil, M.D., who now practices medicine in Tucson, 
Arizona and is on the faculty of the College of Medicine, University of 
Arizona, was a member of the first team of researchers to perform a 
Federal Government authorized study into the effects of marijuana on 
human subjects.  This team made its study in 1968.  These researchers 
determined that marijuana could be safely used under medical supervision.  
In the 20 years since then Dr. Weil has seen no information that would 
cause him to reconsider that conclusion.  There is no question in his 
mind but that marijuana is safe for use under appropriate medical 
supervision.

          3.  The most obvious concern when dealing with drug safety is 
the possibility of lethal effects.  Can the drug cause death?

          4.  Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal 
effects.  But marijuana is not such a substance.  There is no record in 
the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented 
cannabis-induced fatality.

                                 - 56 -
<hr>
          5.  This is a remarkable statement. First, the record on 
marijuana encompasses 5,000 years of human experience.  Second, marijuana 
is now used daily by enormous numbers of people throughout the world.  
Estimates suggest that from twenty million to fifty million Americans 
routinely, albeit illegally, smoke marijuana without the benefit of 
direct medical supervision.  Yet, despite this long history of use and 
the extraordinarily high numbers of social smokers, there are simply no 
credible medical reports to suggest that consuming marijuana has caused a 
single death.

          6.  By contrast aspirin, a commonly used, over-the-counter 
medicine, causes hundreds of deaths each year.

          7.  Drugs used in medicine are routinely given what is called 
an LD-50.  The LD-50 rating indicates at what dosage fifty percent of 
test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced 
toxicity.  A number of researchers have attempted to determine 
marijuana's LD-50 rating in test animals, without success.  Simply 
stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to 
induce death.

          8.  At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 is around 
1:20,000 or 1:40,000.  In layman terms this means that in order to induce 
death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as 
much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette.  NIDA-supplied 
marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams.  A smoker would 
theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within 
about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.

          9.  In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal 
response as a result of drug-related toxicity.

                                 - 57 -
<hr>
         10.  Another common medical way to determine drug safety is 
called the therapeutic ratio.  This ratio defines the difference between 
a therapeutically effective dose and a dose which is capable of inducing 
adverse effects.

         11. A commonly used over-the-counter product like aspirin has a 
therapeutic ratio of around 1:20.  Two aspirins are the recommended dose 
for adult patients.  Twenty times this dose, forty aspirins, may cause a 
lethal reaction in some patients, and will almost certainly cause gross 
injury to the digestive system, including extensive internal bleeding.

         12.  The therapeutic ratio for prescribed drugs is commonly 
around 1:10 or lower.  Valium, a commonly used prescriptive drug, may 
cause very serious biological damage if patients use ten times the 
recommended (therapeutic) dose.

         13.  There are, of course, prescriptive drugs which have much 
lower therapeutic ratios.  Many of the drugs used to treat patients with 
cancer, glaucoma and multiple sclerosis are highly toxic.  The 
therapeutic ratio of some of the drugs used in antineoplastic therapies, 
for example, are regarded as extremely toxic poisons with therapeutic 
ratios that may fall below 1:1.5.  These drugs also have very low LD-50 
ratios and can result in toxic, even lethal reactions, while being 
properly employed.

         14.  By contrast, marijuana's therapeutic ratio, like its LD-50, 
is impossible to quantify because it is so high.

         15.  In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many 
foods we commonly consume.  For example, eating ten raw potatoes can 
result in a toxic response.  By comparison, it is physically impossible 
to eat enough marijuana to induce death.

         16.  Marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest 
therapeutically

                                 - 58 -
<hr>
active substances known to man.  By any measure of rational analysis 
marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care.

         17.  Some of the drugs most widely used in chemotherapy 
treatment of cancer have adverse effects as follows:

               Cisplatin, one of the most powerful chemo-
         therapeutic agents used on humans - may cause deafness;
         may lead to life-threatening kidney difficulties and
         kidney failure; adversely affects the body's immune
         system, suppressing the patient's ability to fight a
         host of common infections.

               Nitrogen Mustard, a drug used in therapy for
         Hodgkins disease - nauseates; so toxic to the skin
         that, if dropped on the skin, this chemical literally
         eats it away along with other tissues it contacts; if
         patient's intravenous lead slips during treatment and
         this drug gets on or under the skin the patient may
         suffer serious injury including temporary, and in
         extreme cases, permanent, loss of use of the arm.

               Procarbizine, also used for Hodgkins disease -
         has known psychogenic, i.e., emotional, effects.

               Cyoxin, also known as Cyclophosphanide -
         suppresses patient's immune system response; results
         in serious bone marrow depletion; studies indicate
         this drug may also cause other cancers, including
         cancers of the bladder.

               Adriamycan, has numerous adverse effects; is
         difficult to employ in long term therapies because it
         destroys the heart muscle.

While each of these agents has its particular adverse effects, as 
indicated above, they also cause a number of similar, disturbing adverse 
effects.  Most of these drugs cause hair loss.  Studies increasingly 
indicate all of these drugs may cause other forms of cancer.  Death due 
to kidney, heart or respiratory failure is a very real possibility with 
all of these agents and the margin for error is minimal.  Similarly, 
there is a danger of overdosing a patient weakened by his cancer.  Put 
simply, there is very great risk associated with the medical

                                 - 59 -
<hr>
use of these chemicals agents.  Despite these high risks, all of these 
drugs are considered "safe" for use under medical supervision and are 
regularly administered to patients on doctor's orders in the United 
States today.

         18.  There have been occasional instances of panic reaction in 
patients who have smoked marijuana.  These have occurred in marijuana-
naive persons, usually older persons, who are extremely anxious over the 
forthcoming chemotherapy and troubled over the illegality of their having 
obtained the marijuana.  Such persons have responded to simple person-to-
person communication with a doctor and have sustained no long term mental 
or physical damage.  If marijuana could be legally obtained, and 
administered in an open, medically-supervised session rather than 
surreptitiously, the few instances of such adverse reaction doubtless 
would be reduced in number and severity.

         19.  Other reported side effects of marijuana have been minimal.  
Sedation often results.  Sometimes mild euphoria is experienced.  Short 
periods of increased pulse rate and of dizziness are occasionally 
experienced.  Marijuana should not be used by persons anxious or 
depressed or psychotic or with certain other health problems.  Physicians 
could readily screen out such patients if marijuana were being employed 
as an agent under medical supervision.

         20.  All drugs have "side effects" and all drugs used in 
medicine for their therapeutic benefits have unwanted, unintended, 
sometimes adverse effects.

         21.  In medical treatment "safety" is a relative term.  A drug 
deemed "safe" for use in treating a life-threatening disease might be 
"unsafe" if prescribed for a patient with a minor ailment.  The concept 
of drug "safety" is relative.  Safety is measured against the 
consequences a patient would confront in the absence of therapy.  The 
determination of "safety" is made in terms of 

                                 - 60 -
<hr>
whether a drug's benefits outweigh its potential risks and the risks of 
permitting the disease to progress.

         22.  In the context of glaucoma therapy, it must be kept in mind 
that glaucoma, untreated, progressively destroys the optic nerve and 
results in eventual blindness.  The danger, then, to patients with 
glaucoma is an irretrievable loss of their sight.

         23.  Glaucoma is not a mortal disease, but a highly specific, 
selectively incapacitating condition.  Glaucoma assaults and destroys the 
patient's most evolved and critical sensory ability, his or her vision.  
The vast majority of patients afflicted with glaucoma are adults over the 
age of thirty.  The onset of blindness in middle age or later throws 
patients into a wholly alien world.  They can no longer do the work they 
once did.  They are unable to read a newspaper, drive a car, shop, walk 
freely and do all the myriad things sighted people take for granted.  
Without lengthy periods of retraining, adaptation and great effort these 
individuals often lose their sense of identity and ability to function.  
Those who are young enough or strong-willed enough will regain a sense of 
place, hold meaningful jobs, but many aspects of the life they once took 
for granted cannot be recaptured.  Other patients may never fully adjust 
to their new, uncertain circumstances.

         24.  Blindness is a very grave consequence.  Protecting patients 
from blindness is considered so important that, for ophthalmologists 
generally, it justifies the use of toxic medicines and uncertain surgical 
procedures which in other contexts might be considered "unsafe."  In 
practice, physicians often provide glaucoma patients with drugs which 
have many serious adverse effects.

         25.  There are only a limited number of drugs available for the

                                 - 61 -
<hr>
treatment of glaucoma.  All of these drugs produce adverse effects.  
While several government witnesses lightly touched on the side effects of 
these drugs, none provided a full or detailed description of their known 
adverse consequences.

         26.  The adverse physical consequences resulting from the 
chronic use of commonly employed glaucoma control drugs include a vast 
range of unintended complications from mild problems like drug induced 
fevers, skin rashes, headaches, anorexia, asthma, pulmonary difficulties, 
hypertension, hypotension and muscle cramps to truly serious, even life-
threatening complications including the formation of cataracts, stomach 
and intestinal ulcers, acute respiratory distress, increases and 
decreases in heart rate and pulse, disruption of heart function, chronic 
and acute renal disease, and bone marrow depletion.

         27.  Finally, each FDA-approved drug family used in glaucoma 
therapy is capable of producing a lethal response, even when properly 
prescribed and used.  Epinephrine can lead to elevated blood pressure 
which may result in stroke or heart attack.  Miotic drugs suppress 
respiration and can cause respiratory Paralysis.  Diuretic drugs so alter 
basic body chemistry they cause renal stones and may destroy the 
patient's kidneys or result in death due to heart failure.  Timolol and 
related beta-blocking agents, the most recently approved family of 
glaucoma control drugs, can trigger severe asthma attacks or cause death 
due to sudden cardiac arrhythmias often producing cardiac arrest.

         28.  Both of the FDA-approved drugs used in treating the 
symptoms of multiple sclerosis, Dantrium and Lioresal, while accepted as 
"safe" can, in fact, be very dangerous substances.  Dantrium or 
dantrolene sodium carries a boxed warning in the Physician's Desk 
Reference (PDR) because of its very high toxicity.  Patients using this 
drug run a very real risk of developing sympto-

                                 - 62 -
<hr>
matic hepatitis (fatal and nonfatal).  The list of sublethal toxic 
reactions also underscores just how dangerous Dantrium can be.  The PDR, 
in part, notes Dantrium commonly causes weakness, general malaise and 
fatigue and goes on to note the drug can also cause constipation, GI 
bleeding, anorexia, gastric irritation, abdominal cramps, speech 
disturbances, seizure, visual disturbances, diplopia, tachycardia, 
erratic blood pressure, mental confusion, clinical depression, renal 
disturbances, myalgia, feelings of suffocation and death due to liver 
failure.

         29.  The adverse effects associated with Lioresal baclofen are 
somewhat less severe, but include possibly lethal consequences, even when 
the drug is properly prescribed and taken as directed.  The range on 
sublethal toxic reactions is similar to those found with Dantrium.

         30.  Norman E, Zinberg, M.D., one of Dr. Weil's colleagues in 
the 1968 study mentioned in finding 2, above, accepts marijuana as being 
safe for use under medical supervision.  If it were available by 
prescription he would use it for appropriate patients.

         31.  Lester Grinspoon, M.D., practicing psychiatrist researcher 
and Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, accepts 
marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision.  He believes its 
safety is its greatest advantage as a medicine in appropriate cases.

         32.  Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D., a psychiatrist practicing in 
Berkley, California who treats substance abusers as inpatients and 
outpatients, accepts marijuana as safe for use under medical supervision.

         33.  Richard D. North, M.D., who has treated Robert Randall for 
glaucoma with marijuana for nine years, accepts marijuana as safe for use 
by his patient

                                 - 63 -
<hr>
under medical supervision.  Mr. Randall has smoked ten marijuana 
cigarettes a day during that period without any evidence of adverse 
mental or physical effects from it.

          34.  John C. Merritt, M.D., an expert in ophthalmology, who has 
treated Robert Randall and others with marijuana for glaucoma, accepts 
marijuana as being safe for use in such treatment.

         35.  Deborah B. Goldberg, M.D., formerly a researcher in 
oncology and now a practicing physician, having worked with many cancer 
patients, observed them, and heard many tell of smoking marijuana 
successfully to control emesis, accepts marijuana is proven to be an 
extremely safe anti-emetic agent.  When compared with the other, highly 
toxic chemical substances routinely prescribed to cancer patients, Dr. 
Goldberg accepts marijuana as clearly safe for use under medical 
supervision.  (See finding 17, above.)

         36.  Ivan Silverberg, M.D., board certified in oncology and 
practicing that specialty in the San Francisco area, has accepted 
marijuana as a safe anti-emetic when used under medical supervision.  
Although illegal, it is commonly used by patients in the San Francisco 
area with the knowledge and acquiescence of their doctors who readily 
accept it as being safe for such use.

         37.  It can be inferred that all of the doctors and other health 
care professionals referred to in the findings in Sections V, VI and VII, 
above, who tolerate or permit patients to self-administer illegal 
marijuana for therapeutic benefit, accept the substance as safe for use 
under medical supervision.

                                 - 64 -
<hr>
Discussion

     The Act, at 21 U.S.C. ¤ 812(b)(1)(C), requires that marijuana be 
retained in Schedule I if "[t]here is a lack of accepted safety for use 
of [it] under medical supervision."  If there is no lack of such safety, 
if it is accepted that this substance can be used with safety under 
medical supervision, then it is unreasonable to keep it in Schedule I.

     Again we must ask - "accepted" by whom?  In the MDMA proceeding the 
Agency's first Final Rule decided that "accepted" here meant, as in the 
phrase "accepted medical use in treatment", that the FDA had accepted the 
substance pursuant to the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.  
51 Fed. Reg. 36555 (1986).  The Court of Appeals held that this was 
error.  On remand, in its third Final Rule on MDMA, the Agency made the 
same ruling as before, relying essentially on the same findings, and on 
others of similar nature, just as it did with respect to "accepted 
medical use."  53 Fed. Reg. 5156 (1988).

     The administrative law judge finds himself constrained not to follow 
the rationale in that MDMA third Final Order for the same reasons as set 
out above in Section V with respect to "accepted medical use" in 
oncology.  See pages 30 to 33.  Briefly, the Agency was looking primarily 
at the results of scientific tests and studies rather than at what 
physicians had, in fact, accepted.  The Agency was wrongly basing its 
decision on a judgment as to whether or not doctors ought to have 
accepted the substance in question as safe for use under medical 
supervision.  The criteria the Agency applied in the MDMA third Final 
Rule are inappropriate.  The only proper question for the Agency here is: 
Have a significant minority of physicians accepted marijuana as safe for 
use under medical supervision?

                                 - 65 -
<hr>
     The gist of the Agency's case against recognizing marijuana's 
acceptance as safe is to assert that more studies, more tests are needed.  
The Agency has presented highly qualified and respected experts, 
researchers and others, who hold that view.  But, as demonstrated in the 
discussion in Section V above, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to 
require unanimity of opinion on the question confronting us.  For the 
reasons there indicated, acceptance by a significant minority of doctors 
is all that can reasonably be required.  This record makes it abundantly 
clear that such acceptance exists in the United States.

     Findings are made above with respect to the safety of medically 
supervised use of marijuana by glaucoma patients.  Those findings are 
relevant to the safety issue even though the administrative law judge 
does not find accepted use in treatment of glaucoma to have been shown.

     Based upon the facts established in this record and set out above 
one must reasonably conclude that there is accepted safety for use of 
marijuana under medical supervision.  To conclude otherwise, on this 
record, would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.

                               CONCLUSION
                                  AND
                          RECOMMENDED DECISION

     Based upon the foregoing facts and reasoning, the administrative law 
judge concludes that the provisions of the Act permit and require the 
transfer of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The Judge realizes
that strong emotions are aroused on both sides of any discussion 
concerning the use of marijuana.  Nonetheless it is essential for this 
Agency, and its Administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the 
evidence of record, correctly apply the law, and act accordingly.

     Marijuana can be harmful.  Marijuana is abused.  But the same is 
true of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in Schedule II so 
that they can be employed in treatment by physicians in proper cases, 
despite their abuse potential.

     Transferring marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule II will not, of 
course, make it immediately available in pharmacies throughout the 
country for legitimate use in treatment.  Other government authorities, 
Federal and State, will doubtless have to act before that might occur.  
But this Agency is not charged with responsibility, or given authority, 
over the myriad other regulatory decisions that may be required before 
marijuana can actually be legally available.  This Agency is charged 
merely with determining the placement of marijuana pursuant to the 
provisions of the Act.  Under our system of laws the responsibilities of 
other regulatory bodies are the concerns of those bodies, not of this 
Agency,

     There are those who, in all sincerity, argue that the transfer of 
marijuana

                                 - 67 -
<hr>
to Schedule II will "send a signal" that marijuana is "OK" generally for 
recreational use.  This argument is specious.  It presents no valid 
reason for refraining from taking an action required by law in light of 
the evidence.  If marijuana should be placed in Schedule II, in obedience 
to the law, then that is where marijuana should be placed, regardless of 
misinterpretation of the placement by some.  The reasons for the 
placement can, and should, be clearly explained at the time the action is 
taken.  The fear of sending such a signal cannot be permitted to override 
the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of countless 
suffers for the relief marijuana can provide when prescribed by a 
physician in a legitimate case.

     The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has been 
accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very 
ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision.  It would 
be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand 
between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of 
the evidence in this record.

     The administrative law judge recommends that the Administrator 
conclude that the marijuana plant considered as a whole has a currently 
accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, that there is no 
lack of accepted safety for use of it under medical supervision and that 
it may lawfully be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.  The judge 
recommends that the Administrator transfer marijuana from Schedule I to 
Schedule II.

                                        <b>Senate speech, 1917</b>

                          <b>I. INTRODUCTION</b>

     Plaintiff Ralph Seeley, a lawyer, brought this action pro se, 

seeking a declaration that the placing of marijuana in &quot;Schedule I&quot; 

in RCW 69.50.204 is a violation of the liberties guaranteed by the 

Washington constitution.  The plaintiff has standing to sue because 

he is a cancer patient, facing ongoing treatment for his disease, 

who has a legitimate need for marijuana to relieve suffering, and 

cannot legally obtain it.

     The plaintiff contends that two sections of Article I of the 

Washington constitution should protect him from the withholding of a 

valuable therapeutic herb.  In brief:

Persons who need opium, cocaine, morphine, barbiturates or 

  amphetamines have the privilege of using the drugs and immunity 

  from arrest with a doctor's prescription; the plaintiff needs 

  cannabis in its vegetable state (marijuana), and has neither 

  privilege nor immunity available to him.  Article I ¤ 12, the 

  &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause, specifically prohibits such 

  arbitrary classification.

Article 1 ¤ 32 states in full, &quot;A frequent recurrence to fundamental 

  principles is essential to the security of individual right and 

  the perpetuity of free government.&quot;  Prohibiting physicians from 

  providing needed medicine to sick people has created legal and 

  social consequences which should be changed as a matter of 

  fundamental principle.

     The parties agreed to the procedural course now undertaken -- 

to file for summary judgment with simultaneous briefs, with the 

losing party to seek direct review by the Supreme Court.


                             <b>II. FACTS</b>     

     <b>A. FACTS REGARDING THE PLAINTIFF'S MEDICAL HISTORY AND USE OF</b> 
        <b>MARIJUANA.</b>

     The plaintiff was diagnosed with chordoma, a rare form of bone 

cancer, in 1986.   He has undergone eight surgeries on his spine, 

two lung surgeries (including the removal of one lung), neutron 

radiation, electron radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.  

Declaration of Ernest Conrad, Exhibit A; Declaration of Ralph 

Seeley, Exhibit B.

     In the course of chemotherapy, the plaintiff became so 

violently ill that he considered discontinuing the treatment and 

allowing the disease to run its course.  At the suggestion of one of 

his physicians, and after discussion with other cancer patients, he 

smoked marijuana before the next injection of chemicals.  The result 

was overwhelming.  Without smoking marijuana, the plaintiff's 

suffering from chemotherapy included hours of agony ending with 

minutes of helplessly lying in his own vomit and excrement on the 

floor, unable to summon the energy to pull the &quot;nurse call&quot; cord 

inches away.  After smoking marijuana, the same regimen of 

chemotherapy resulted in a mildly uncomfortable hour followed by a 

restful night's sleep.  Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B.

     With synthetic THC (Marinol or dronabinol) and other 

antiemetics, the relief was not as effective, and the side effects 

were much more troubling.  There are three principal problems with 

legal, synthetic THC as opposed to illegal, vegetable-state 

marijuana:

The synthetic drug takes a long time to take effect -- from two to 

  four hours.  Smoking marijuana brings results in five to ten 

  minutes.

The synthetic drug dose is impossible to &quot;titrate,&quot; or adjust, and 

  the lowest dosage supplied results in a more debilitating &quot;high&quot; 

  than smoking marijuana.

The &quot;high&quot; from the legal synthetic lasts about 14 hours, while it 

  is typically gone in four to five hours with smoked marijuana.

Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B; Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit 

C.

     To stay legal, then, a patient must take the synthetic drug at 

least two hours before the chemotherapy; then plan on at least 14 

hours of being &quot;out of commission.&quot;  If you don't take the drug two 

hours before the chemotherapy, the violent nausea takes over.  Id.

     In the two to four days following weekly chemotherapy, the 

plaintiff would undergo unpredictable onsets of violent nausea and 

diarrhea. Trying to take the prescribed synthetic THC was futile, 

because the tablets were vomited up whole.  Declaration of Seeley, 

Exhibit B.

     It cannot be over-emphasized that chemotherapy-induced nausea 

is not &quot;an upset tummy.&quot;  It is violent, unrelenting retching and 

gagging, often accompanied by an uncontrollable release of bowel 

control.  The plaintiff underwent adriamycin/cysplatin chemotherapy 

at the University of Washington, one of the most sophisticated 

cancer-care facilities in the nation.  Yet with legal THC, he still 

wound up on the treatment room floor, as described above.

     The non-medical realities for the plaintiff during chemotherapy 

were these:

During his first bout of chemotherapy, he used legal antiemetics.  

  He was in the second  semester of the first year of law school, 

  and wrote barely passing grades.

During the second bout of chemotherapy (same chemo regimen), he 

  smoked marijuana instead of or in addition to taking prescribed 

  medications.  The chemotherapy lasted most of the law-school 

  semester, and he smoked marijuana virtually every day.  He made 

  the Dean's List, as well as winning an AmJur award for what his 

  professor stated was &quot;the best evidence exam I have ever seen.&quot;

During the first chemotherapy, the THC tablets cost 84 cents each.  

  Later, the cost went to more than $5 each, from the same 

  pharmacy.  (The plaintiff will produce the pharmacy vials at oral 

  argument.)  This cost increase of ___ percent coincides with the 

  timing of the end of a federal program for supplying sick people 

  with vegetable-state marijuana.  The plaintiff paid nothing for 

  the vegetable-state marijuana, which was donated.  (Vegetable-

  state marijuana is typically free to sick people, since it costs 

  virtually nothing -- other than risk of imprisonment -- to 

  produce, and numerous people grow it for the exclusive use of 

  sick people.)


     <b>B. FACTS REGARDING THE LEGAL HISTORY OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA.</b>

              <b>1. Marijuana as medicine, pre-prohibition.</b>

     As summarized from Grinspoon, Marijuana, the Forbidden 

Medicine, pp 1-23 (attached to Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit C):

     Cannabis has been used as a soporific (sleep-inducement), 

analgesic (pain reduction), for constipation, to relieve headaches 

and nausea and numerous other health problems in various cultures 

throughout the world for more than 5,000 years.  In all those 

centuries, there has never been a death recorded as a result of 

overdose, making it one of the safest, if not the safest chemicals 

ever ingested in human beings for healing purposes.

     The first Western physician to take notice of the plant was an 

English doctor who observed its use in India, and concluded that it 

was safe and helpful.  In a report published in 11839, he wrote that 

it was an effective analgesic, and that its muscle relaxant 

properties made it &quot;an anticonvulsive remedy of the greatest value.&quot;

     Cannabis was considered a routine part of the physician's 

pharmacopea in this country and others in the 18th and 19th 

centuries; it was even prescribed for Queen Victoria by her court 

physician.  It was listed in the United States Dispensatory in 1854.  

Commercial cannabis preparations could be bought in drug stores.

     Numerous favorable reports on the drug were published in the 

second half of the last century, remarking on how the drug differed 

from narcotics such as opium by not causing debilitating side 

effects such as loss of appetite and constipation, not causing 

addiction, and not requiring higher doses to be effective over time.

     Several developments led to the discontinuance of marijuana as 

medicine.

     First, the advent of the hypodermic syringe led to quicker 

results in pain relief by injection of narcotics -- not possible 

with cannabis because it is not soluble in water.  Next, the 

invention of synthetic drugs such as aspirin, chloral hydrate and 

barbiturates in the early part of this century had two results: 

First, as a plant, marijuana/hemp can't be patented, so profits 

drove pharmaceutical companies toward synthetics; and second, the 

dose could not be determined as specifically as with something such 

as an aspirin tablet.  (It should be noted that between 500 and 

1,000 people die of aspirin-induced bleeding every year in America, 

and barbiturates are, of course, even more dangerous.  Thus, in 

hindsight, we may question the wisdom of replacing cannabis with 

synthetics.)

     Thus, when Congress was considering the Marijuana Tax Act of 

1937, few voices in the medical community were raised in protest, 

because it appeared that no problems would be created; the act was 

aimed at recreational users.  The film Reefer Madness may be a joke 

to sophisticated people today, but it was a genuine effort on the 

part of the government to sway the public about &quot;dangerous and 

addictive&quot; marijuana at the time.

     The effect of the Act was to make obtaining marijuana for 

medicinal use so administratively burdensome that its use fell off 

to virtually nonexistent, and the drug was removed from the United 

States Pharmacopoeia and National Formulary in 1941.

              <b>2. Marijuana as medicine, post-prohibition.</b>

     Two social forces converged in the 1960s which have led to 

reconsideration of marijuana as medicine.  One was the &quot;coming out 

of the closet&quot; of recreational marijuana users, which led to the 

discovery by some ill, recreational users that smoking it helped 

more and cost less than prescribed medicines.  This led to a fund of 

&quot;anecdotal evidence&quot; that marijuana was effective in the treatment 

of glaucoma and spasticity from diseases such as multiple sclerosis.  

The other social force was the advent of chemotherapy for the 

attempted cure of cancer.  (Since the plaintiff has standing as a 

cancer patient, this brief will primarily deal with that aspect of 

the issue.)

     Chemotherapy is, in a word, poison.  Nurses who administer the 

chemicals wear protective clothing, face shields, and doubled rubber 

gloves, then inject the chemical directly into the patient's blood.  

Declaration of Seeley, Exhibit B.

     The concept of the treatment (roughly the same as radiation) is 

that the poison kills faster-dividing cells before it kills 

normally-growing cells.  Since tumors are virtually defined by their 

characteristic runaway, uncontrolled growth, theoretically an amount 

of poison can be administered which kills the tumor but not the 

&quot;host organism&quot; (in this case, the plaintiff).  The patient can only 

withstand a given amount of the therapy before dying of the cure, 

and in the process, the patient gets very sick, as described above, 

and tends to lose appetite and the ability to hold down food and 

digest it just when doing so to maintain strength and fight off the 

effects of the poison is most critical.

     A study by the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of 

Sciences released in 1981 noted the potential for therapeutic use 

and recommended further research:

       Until 10 or 15 years ago, there was virtually no 
       systematic, rigorously controlled research on the human 
       health-related effects of marijuana and its major 
       constituents.  Even now, when standardized marijuana and 
       pure synthetic cannabinoids are available for experimental 
       studies, and good qualitative methods exist. . .well-
       designed studies on human beings are relatively few.

                             * * *

       Our major recommendation is that there be a greatly 
       intensified and more comprehensive program of research into 
       the effects of marijuana on the health of the American 
       people.

&quot;Marijuana and Health,&quot; U.S. Institute of Medicine, Washington D.C., 

prepared for National Institutes of Health, Bethesda MD, Dec. 1981, 

pages 4-5.

     Despite such recommendations by such a prestigious body of 

scientists, little research has been done, and the federal 

government has erected one roadblock after another to prevent the 

gathering of legitimate, scientific evidence, discussed further 

below.

     From the scientific studies available despite the efforts of 

the federal government, smoked marijuana has been shown to be an 

extremely effective and inexpensive remedy to counter the truly 

horrific effects of undergoing cancer chemotherapy.  Affidavit of 

Grinspoon, Exhibit C.  It is, however, illegal.


              <b>3. State statutory law.</b>

     Washington adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act in 

1971, under which drugs are listed in &quot;schedules,&quot; allegedly 

depending upon their therapeutic value and the potential safety.  

RCW 69.50.  The &quot;scheduling&quot; of the drugs is allegedly done by the 

Board of Pharmacy.  However, this is largely a fiction, since the 

schedules simply follow the federal model, as provided under RCW 

69.50.201(a)(2); 201(e).  If any drug has been scheduled differently 

in Washington than by the federal government, it remains mysterious 

to this plaintiff as to what that drug might be.

     Marijuana is listed as a &quot;Schedule I&quot; drug, meaning that (1) it 

has no currently accepted therapeutic use, (2) has a high potential 

for abuse, and (3) is not safe to use under medical supervision.  

RCW 69.50.203.  (It is listed for some mysterious reason as a 

&quot;&quot;hallucinogenic substance.&quot; RCW 69.50.204(c)(14)).  Synthetic THC, 

amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine and opium are 

Schedule II drugs, meaning they have &quot;high potential for abuse,&quot; 

&quot;currently accepted medical use,&quot;, and &quot;the abuse of the substance 

may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.&quot;   RCW 

69.50.205, 206.  Barbiturates are Schedule III drugs.  RCW 

69.50.208.  In simple terms, doctors may prescribe synthetic THC, 

cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, barbiturates and 

opium, but may not prescribe marijuana.

     Numerous states, including Washington, enacted legislation to 

provide marijuana to medically certified patients as a combination 

of experimental and compassionate legislation.  The Washington 

Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act became law in 1979 

(RCW 69.51), stating

       The legislature finds that recent research has shown that 
       the use of marijuana may alleviate the nausea and ill 
       effects of cancer chemotherapy and glaucoma.  The 
       legislature further finds that there is a need for further 
       research and experimentation regarding the use of marijuana 
       under strictly controlled circumstances. 

     The statute created a board of physicians to administer the 

program, in conjunction with federal agencies.  It was amended in 

1989 for &quot;housekeeping&quot; reasons (changing &quot;department&quot; to &quot;board&quot; 

and so forth), but long before, in 1981, for reasons that defy 

explanation on the surface, the legislature killed the program by 

not funding it.  Exhibit D, letter to plaintiff from Donald 

Williams, Executive Director, Board of Pharmacy.

     The alleged reason is that the research proved that THC was 

effective, and THC was synthesized and marketed as dronabinol or 

Marinol, therefore no further need for vegetable-state &quot;smokeable&quot; 

marijuana was required.

     For reasons set forth in Section A above, and in the 

Declaration of Grinspoon, Exhibit C, the contention is absurd.


               <b>4. State case law.</b>

     When Samuel Diana was arrested in 1977 for possession of a 

small amount of marijuana, he argued that it helped him cope with 

his multiple sclerosis better than prescribed medications.  The 

Court of Appeals held that necessity is always a potential defense 

to a crime, and remanded the case for determination, by a 

preponderance of the evidence, 

whether (1) the defendant reasonably believed his use of marijuana 

was necessary to minimize the effects of his disease; (2) whether 

the benefits derived from the drug's use are greater than the harm 

sought to be prevented by the controlled substance law; and (3) that 

no other drug is as effective in minimizing the effects of the 

disease. State v. Diana, 24 Wn. App. 908, 604 P.2d 1312 (1979). 

     With the current state of the literature on the subject, 

(especially since the release of the report of the DEA's Chief 

Administrative Law Judge in 1988, discussed further below), any 

person with glaucoma, multiple sclerosis (or other spasticity 

problems), chemotherapy-induced nausea or the AIDS &quot;wasting 

syndrome&quot; has no problem whatsoever meeting the first and third of 

those, leaving judges only to grapple with the issues of relative 

harm.  The result is that described in the Declaration of Andrew 

Subin, Exhibit E: Persons who need cannabis for medicinal purposes 

end up using it quasi-legally, after being arrested, posting bail, 

paying an attorney, and having their supply confiscated and not 

returned.  See also, State v. Cole, 74 Wn. App. 571, ___ P. 2d ___ 

(1994), in which (1) Division II specifically adopted the legal 

reasoning of Division III in State v. Diana, (2) the court held that 

a marijuana user's own testimony is more than a &quot;scintilla&quot; of 

evidence, and requires the issue of his reasonableness in using the 

drug to go to the jury, and (3) in the &quot;facts&quot; section of the 

opinion, it is established that a superior court judge stated, &quot;I 

hope they get you a prescription for marijuana if that's the only 

thing that works. . .[y]ou cannot in the future grow marijuana for 

your own consumption without a prescription.&quot;  Cole at 573.  This 

demonstrates the sort of misunderstanding among judges exemplified 

in the Declaration of Subin, Exhibit E, and which results in 

unintentional but real injustice on sick and helpless people.      

     This bizarre state of affairs is a keystone to the legal 

arguments below concerning both the privileges and immunities clause 

and the &quot;frequent recurrence to fundamental principles.&quot;


              <b>5. The federal farce.</b>

     The history of medical marijuana and federal law over the past 

three decades has resulted in untold unnecessary suffering among 

some of society's most sick and helpless individuals and their 

families; has diminished respect for the rule of law; and has 

resulted in appointed bureaucrats corrupting the system Congress set 

in place.

     The suborning of the rule of law to the hysteria of the &quot;war on 

drugs&quot; reads like Franz Kafka interpreting  &quot;Through the Looking 

Glass.&quot;  It goes approximately like this:

1972: The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws 
  (NORML) petitioned the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs 
  (precursor to the DEA) to reclassify medical marijuana.  The 
  agency refused to act on the petition.  NORML appealed to the 
  U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit.

1974: The court held that the agency's position had no merit, and 
  that the petition should be processed.  NORML v. Ingersoll, 497 
  F.2d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1974).

1975: The DEA (replacing the BNDD) dismissed the petition without 
  hearing testimony.  NORML appealed.

1977: The Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal, criticizing the 
  DEA for not providing scientific and medical evaluations as 
  required by law, which were to be provided by the Department of 
  Health, Education and Welfare (HEW).  NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735 
  (DC Cir. 1977).

1979: Unreasonable delays resulted in NORML filing motions to 
  compel, against both DEA and HEW.  Facing sanctions, HEW produced 
  a response.  DEA then dismissed the petition once again with no 
  hearings.  NORML appealed again.

1980: The Court of Appeals for the third time reprimanded the DEA 
  and affirmed NORML's right to a &quot;full and fair&quot; hearing. 

1981: NORML filed another motion to compel.  Within three days the 
  agencies announced the approval of synthetic THC 
  (Marinol/dronabinol), and promised a &quot;legislative type hearing&quot; 
  would be forthcoming.

       &#149;1982: With no hearing yet held, NORML filed yet another 
       motion to compel.  The Court of Appeals issued a Mandatory 
       Progression Order requiring the DEA and HEW to provide 
       them with 90-day progress notes.

1986: Hearing procedures were finally set.

1987: Written affidavits, evidence and exhibits filed.  Hearings 
  were held in New Orleans and San Francisco.

1988: Further evidentiary hearings were held in Washington, D.C.  
  Oral arguments were held before the DEA's Chief Administrative 
  Law Judge, Francis L. Young.  In September, Judge Young issued 
  the 68-page &quot;Opinion And Recommended Ruling, Findings Of Fact, 
  Conclusion Of Law And Decision Of Administrative Law Judge In The 
  Matter Of Marijuana Rescheduling Petition, Docket No. 86-22, U.S. 
  Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration.&quot;  
  (Hereinafter, &quot;Young Opinion.&quot;) Judge Young concluded:

       The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana 
       has been accepted  as capable of relieving the distress of 
       great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety 
       under medical supervision.  It would be unreasonable, 
       arbitrary and capricious for the DEA to continue to stand 
       between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance 
       in light of the evidence in this record.

  Young Opinion, page 68.  Judge Young recommended unequivocally 
  that marijuana be rescheduled as a Schedule II therapeutic drug.  
  Id.

1989: The head bureaucrat at the DEA rejected Judge Young's 
  recommendation and refused to reclassify marijuana, 
  characterizing its medical use as &quot;a cruel and dangerous hoax.&quot;  
  54 Federal Register 53767-53785, Dec. 29, 1989, p. 53784.  NORML 
  and the Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics immediately appealed.

1991: The Court remanded the case to the DEA, noting the circularity 
  of the alleged logic: The DEA administrator refused to reschedule 
  the drug because, inter alia, it did not meet the requirement for 
  &quot;general availability of the substance&quot; and &quot;recognition of its 
  clinical use in generally accepted pharmacopoeia, medical 
  references, journals and textbooks,&quot; and for &quot;recognition and use 
  of the substance by a substantial segment of the medical 
  practitioners in the United States.&quot;  The court pointed out the 
  impossibility of showing that a drug enjoys &quot;availability&quot; or 
  &quot;use&quot; when it is illegal for doctors to obtain it by virtue of it 
  being a Schedule I drug.  Likewise, the drug is not going to show 
  up in any manual or pharmacopoeia if it is illegal to prescribe 
  and illegal to possess.  Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics v. 
  DEA, 930 F.2d 936 (DC Cir. 1991).

1992: DEA head bureaucrat Robert Bonner issued a new Denial of 
  Petition leaving out the circular logic, but asserting boldly and 
  in direct contradiction of his Chief Administrative Law Judge's 
  opinion, that his response was based on common sense:

       Smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases.  
       Americans take their medicines in pills, solutions, sprays, 
       shots, drops, creams and sometimes suppositories, but never 
       by smoking.

  Final Rule, Denial of Petition for Marijuana Rescheduling, March 
  18, 1992.

     In summary: Congress created an agency with the power to 

&quot;schedule&quot; drugs and to change the scheduling as new information 

became available; the agency refused to follow the mandates of 

Congress by investigating new information until forced by citizens 

to do so through court action over a span of two decades; the 

recommendation to make the change based on research and information 

was ignored by a bureaucrat relying on his own belief, superstition, 

or other imponderable reality.

     During most of the above-described decades, the federal 

government had in place a program by which some qualified sick 

people could obtain marijuana on a compassionate/experimental basis.  

It was discontinued, and no new applicants are permitted to obtain 

the drug.

1995 - The final irony:

     Through the decades, the feds have been citing a &quot;lack of 

scientific evidence,&quot; especially since the approval of synthetic THC 

-- i.e., &quot;there is no scientific evidence that the benefits of 

smoked marijuana are superior to those of synthetic THC.&quot;  (This 

Court may expect virtual litany of such nonsense from opposing 

counsel as these briefs are written and filed.)

     Dr. Donald Abrams of the University of California San Francisco 

spent three years obtaining the approval of the Food and Drug 

Administration for a study on that exact issue, regarding the effect 

of the two regimens (smoked versus oral) on the AIDS &quot;wasting 

syndrome.&quot;  In April of this year, the federal government rejected 

the proposal by refusing to supply the marijuana for the experiment.  

Affidavit of Doblin, Exhibit F.

     Thus, the government contends that the prohibition of marijuana 

as medicine is justified based on lack of scientific evidence, while 

prohibiting the gathering of scientific evidence. This circular and 

cynical manipulation of logic and legal argument at the expense of 

suffering and helpless people is another cornerstone of the 

&quot;fundamental principles&quot; argument set forth below.


                    <b>III. LAW AND LEGAL ARGUMENT</b>

     The plaintiff is petitioning this Court for equitable relief, 

by way of a declaration that his right to be free of suffering is 

being unreasonably withheld in violation of the &quot;privileges and 

immunities&quot; clause of the Washington Constitution, the &quot;frequent 

recurrence to fundamental principles&quot; clause, or both.

     The Court's power to issue such a declaration is set forth in 

Article 4, ¤ 6 of the Constitution of the State of Washington, and 

RCW 7.24, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.


     <b>A. THE WASHINGTON CONSTITUTION CONTAINS SAFEGUARDS TO</b>
        <b>INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY NOT FOUND IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.</b>

     It is well-established law that the U.S. Constitution's Bill of 

Rights, tacked on as an afterthought years after the Constitution 

itself was ratified, protects individual liberty to a lesser extent 

than Washington's constitution, in which the &quot;Declaration of rights&quot; 

is the first section.  Article I ¤ 1 states unequivocally that

       All political power is inherent in the people, and 
       governments. . .are established to protect and maintain 
       individual rights.

     The Supreme Court of Washington has held that even where the 

language of the two constitutions is similar, greater protection may 

be found under the state's constitution.  State v. Gunwall, 106 

Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808 (1986).

     The plaintiff asks no more than to have this Court protect his 

individual right to be free of needless physical suffering, now 

being caused by his own government.


     <b>B. THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT UNDER</b> 
        <b>ARTICLE 1 ¤ 12 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF</b> 
        <b>WASHINGTON, WHICH PROHIBITS SPECIAL PRIVILEGES AND</b> 
        <b>IMMUNITIES.</b>

               <b>1. Washington's &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause is</b> 
          <b>entitled to a more liberal interpretation to protect</b> 
          <b>individual rights than the federal constitution's</b> 
          <b>counterpart.</b>

     The &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause of the state's 

constitution is analyzed in the same manner as the &quot;equal 

protection&quot; clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 

State v. Smith, 117 Wn.2d 263, 814 P.2d 652 (1991).  That three-

prong analysis involves &quot;levels of scrutiny&quot; which are typically 

determinative of outcome, outlined in Smith at pages 277-79:

&quot;Strict scrutiny&quot; is required when a statute affects a &quot;suspect 

  class or a fundamental right.&quot;  A law may be upheld only if it is 

  &quot;necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.&quot;

&quot;Heightened&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; scrutiny typically applies to gender-

  based classifications, but has been held to apply when the 

  challenged law affects both an important right(such as liberty) 

  and a semi-suspect class not accountable for its status (such as 

  the poor).  The test is that the law must be seen as &quot;furthering 

  a substantial interest of the state.&quot;

Minimal scrutiny is applied absent any reason for applying the 

  higher levels.  The test is whether a &quot;rational relationship&quot; 

  exists between the challenged classification and a &quot;legitimate 

  state interest.&quot;  The classification must be &quot;purely arbitrary&quot; 

  to overcome the presumption of constitutionality.

     In State v. Gunwall, supra., the Washington Supreme Court set 

out what have become known as &quot;the Gunwall factors,&quot; six areas of 

analysis required to be raised and briefed before the state's 

Supreme Court will consider invoking higher standards of personal 

liberty protection under the state constitution, compared to that 

provided by the U.S. Constitution. 

     In State v. Smith, supra, Justice Utter's concurring opinion 

provided a complete analysis of the state's privileges and 

immunities clause as contrasted to the 14th Amendment analysis 

above, and concluded that all six Gunwall factors were met, 

requiring an independent analysis to determine whether a challenged 

law violates Article 1, ¤ 12.  While the majority rejected his 

analysis based on Oregon constitutional analysis (our privileges and 

immunities clause was derived from Oregon's), there was no statement 

by the majority that Washington's privileges and immunities clause 

does not provide a higher level of protection for individual rights 

than the 14th Amendment, only that &quot;several recent decisions hold[] 

that the privileges and immunities clause and the equal protection 

clause are substantially identical and considered by this court as 

one issue.  We decline to interpret Const. art 1 ¤ 12 independently 

of the Fourteenth Amendment in this decision as well.&quot;

     The plaintiff adopts Justice Utter's analysis by incorporation, 

and has attached a copy of the opinion for the convenience of the 

Court, as Exhibit G.</pre>

<pre>               <b>2. Under any analysis or &quot;level of scrutiny,&quot; the</b> 
          <b>plaintiff should prevail.</b>

     The &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause couldn't be more 

straightforward:

       No law shall be passed granting to any citizen, class of 
       citizens, or corporation other than municipal, privileges 
       or immunities which upon the same terms shall not equally 
       belong to all citizens, or corporations.

Wash. Const. art. 1 ¤ 12.

     The plaintiff's situation regarding medicinal marijuana may be 

phrased in several ways which invoke the clause:

The plaintiff is denied the privilege of ending his suffering by the 

  use of a therapeutic drug while others are granted the privilege 

  of ending their suffering with access to far more harmful and 

  addictive drugs, such as morphine, cocaine, amphetamines, 

  barbiturates and opium.  Additionally, patients who need THC and 

  may absorb it effectively through their gastro-intestinal tract 

  have the privilege of the relief of their suffering, while the 

  plaintiff, whose GI tract is not functioning when he needs THC, 

  is denied the privilege.

Other citizens are granted immunity from arrest for possession of 

  therapeutic but potentially harmful drugs by virtue of 

  prescriptions, while the plaintiff is denied that immunity.

     Whatever &quot;level of scrutiny&quot; the Court deems appropriate, the 

plaintiff's right to be free of discrimination by his own government 

is being violated, in that the plaintiff is being made to suffer 

physically for reasons which serve no legitimate government purpose.

<b>THE DISCRIMINATION INVOLVES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND IS ENTITLED TO</b> 
  <b>STRICT SCRUTINY.</b>

     As set forth in State v. Smith, supra, if government 

discrimination or classification involves a &quot;fundamental right,&quot; the 

courts must apply &quot;strict scrutiny,&quot; and uphold the classification 

only if it is &quot;necessary to accomplish a compelling state interest.&quot;  

Id.  The Washington Supreme Court has found that a physician has a 

fundamental right to freely practice medicine.  Bering v. Share, 106 

Wn.2d 212, 721 P.2d 918 (1986).  Clearly, it is no stretch to state 

the corollary -- that a patient has a fundamental right to the aid 

of his physician to relieve suffering.  In any event, the court in 

Bering held that the state has a &quot;substantial interest in ensuring 

its citizens unimpeded access to necessary medical care.&quot;  Id. at 

225.  That decision dealt with access to abortions; it is difficult 

for the plaintiff to see how that might be more &quot;necessary&quot; than 

ending the suffering of chemotherapy-induced, uncontrolled nausea 

and diarrhea.

     If the court finds that a fundamental right is involved and 

applies strict scrutiny, the state must justify maintaining 

marijuana in Schedule I as &quot;necessary to accomplish a compelling 

state interest.&quot;  Frankly, the plaintiff is at a loss to anticipate 

what sort of argument the state might put forward, if the attorneys 

involved intend to keep straight faces while addressing the Court.

     What is the &quot;compelling state interest&quot; in having the plaintiff 

lying on the floor retching and defecating on himself when he could 

be sleeping peacefully?  What &quot;compelling state interest&quot; justifies 

forcing the plaintiff to endure 14-hour &quot;highs&quot; in an attempt to 

relieve his suffering with synthetics?  What is the &quot;compelling 

state interest&quot; to force the plaintiff to pay $5 per THC tablet, 

many of which disappear down the toilet undissolved?

     Or is the &quot;compelling state interest&quot; the larger one of 

controlling marijuana as a recreational drug?  If so, why is it not 

&quot;necessary&quot; to place cocaine, opium, morphine, barbiturates, and 

amphetamines also in Schedule I?  Note that the penalty for 

manufacture or possession with intent to deliver a Schedule I or II 

drug is exactly the same. RCW 69.50.401.  Clearly, the legislature 

attaches no symbolic or exemplary difference between the two crimes.  

Thus, any contention by the Attorney General that placing marijuana 

in Schedule II and permitting its prescriptive, medicinal use will 

&quot;send a signal&quot; that recreational use of the drug is condoned should 

be given the merit it deserves -- none.

     In short, the classification of marijuana in Schedule I 

violates a fundamental right of the plaintiff, and the state cannot 

show a necessary reason for the classification that accomplishes a 

compelling state interest.  Therefore, the plaintiff's motion for 

declaratory relief should be granted.

<b>IF THE COURT DOES NOT FIND THAT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HAS BEEN</b> 
  <b>VIOLATED, THE LAW SHOULD STILL BE STRUCK DOWN UNDER &quot;INTERMEDIATE</b> 
  <b>SCRUTINY.&quot;</b>

     &quot;Heightened&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; scrutiny should apply even if 

&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; does not, because the classification involves an 

&quot;important right,&quot; and because the plaintiff is in a class for which 

he cannot be held accountable -- he did not choose to be a cancer 

patient, or to have his physician place him on chemotherapy in an 

attempt to save his life.  State v. Smith, supra.

     The test is that the law must be seen as &quot;furthering a 

substantial interest of the state.&quot;  As analyzed above, no state 

interest, substantial or otherwise, is not equally well served by 

placing marijuana in Schedule II.

<b>EVEN UNDER MINIMAL SCRUTINY, THE PLAINTIFF MUST PREVAIL, BECAUSE THE</b> 
  <b>CLASSIFICATION IS PURELY ARBITRARY.</b>

     Absent strict or heightened scrutiny, the test is whether a 

&quot;rational relationship&quot; exists between the challenged classification 

and a legitimate state interest.  What is the &quot;legitimate&quot; state 

interest in denying an end to the plaintiff's physical suffering?

     The classification must be &quot;purely arbitrary&quot; to overcome the 

presumption of constitutionality.  State v. Smith, supra at 279.  In 

fact, the classification is purely arbitrary.  As stated by Judge 

Young after taking hundreds of hours of testimony, reviewing 

thousands of pages of documents, and issuing a 68-page report:

       It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for the 
       DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the 
       benefits of this substance [marijuana] in light of the 
       evidence in this record.

Judge Young's report, supra at 68 (emphasis added).

     Thus, even under the &quot;minimal scrutiny&quot; test, the state can 

show no rational relationship between the classification and a 

legitimate state interest, and this court should find that the 

classification is purely arbitrary, and grant the declaratory relief 

requested.


     <b>C. THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO THE RELIEF REQUESTED UNDER</b> 
        <b>ARTICLE I ¤ 32, THE &quot;FREQUENT RECURRENCE TO FUNDAMENTAL</b> 
        <b>PRINCIPLES&quot; CLAUSE OF THE WASHINGTON CONSTITUTION.</b>

               <b>1. Gunwall factors analyzed.</b>

     The &quot;Gunwall factors&quot; have come to be, in Gunwall's progeny, 

required analysis and briefing at the superior court level in order 

for the Supreme Court to consider whether personal liberties are 

protected to a greater extent by the state's constitution, compared 

to the U.S. Constitution.  See, e.g., State v. Wethered, 110 Wn.2d 

466, 472, 755 P.2d 787 (1988); In re Mota, 114 Wn.2d 465, 472, 788 

P.2d 538 (1990).  The plaintiff adopted Justice Utter's analysis 

concerning the Privileges and Immunities clause, above, and here 

provides the Gunwall analysis of the &quot;Frequent Recurrence to 

Fundamental Principles&quot; clause:

     1. The textual language of the state constitution.

       The text of the state constitution may provide cogent 
       grounds for a decision different from that which would be 
       arrived at under the federal constitution. It may be more 
       explicit or it may have no precise federal counterpart at 
       all.

Gunwall at 61. Article 1 ¤ 32 of the Constitution of the State of 

Washington reads in total:

       A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is 
       essential to the security of individual right and the 
       perpetuity of free government.

     Since no &quot;precise federal counterpart&quot; exists, the Court may 

find greater protection under this factor, and the plaintiff argues 

strenuously that it should.

     2. Significant differences in the texts of parallel provisions 

of the federal and state constitutions.

          Such differences may also warrant reliance on the state 
       constitution.  Even where parallel provision of the two 
       constitutions do not have meaningful differences, other 
       relevant provisions of the state constitution may require 
       that the state constitution be interpreted differently.

Id.  Since no parallel provision may be found in the federal 

constitution, this factor does not seem to apply to either find or 

not find greater protection under the state constitution.

     3. State constitutional and common law history. 

          This may reflect an intention to confer greater 
       protection from state government than the federal 
       constitution affords from the federal government. The 
       history of the adoption of a particular state 
       constitutional provision may reveal an intention that will 
       support reading the provision independently of federal law.

Id.  The constitutional history of Section 32 remains somewhat of a 

mystery.  The constitutions of Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Illinois 

contained clauses referencing fundamental principles, but the 

connection to individual rights was unique to Washington.  Brian 

Snure, &quot;A Frequent Recurrence to Fundamental Principles: Individual 

Rights, Free Government, and the Washington State Constitution,&quot; 67 

Wash. L. Rev. 669 (1992) at 676.

     The original proposed constitution by W. Liard Hill contained 

only 31 sections to Article 1.  Section 32 was proposed by George 

Turner, whose later speeches as a U.S. Senator lead to the 

conclusion that Turner, like others of his day, believed that 

constitutional interpretation often required a return to natural law 

principles beyond the four corners of the constitution.  Snure, Id. 

at 674, citing 32 Cong. Rec. 783, 785, 789 (1899)(statement of Sen. 

Turner against United States imperialism in the Philippines).

     The signers of Washington's constitution had witnessed a 

hundred years of what happens when power is concentrated in either 

government (federal) or private (corporate) bodies, and they clearly 

didn't like what they saw.  Thus, we have a clause in our &quot;freedom 

to bear arms&quot; clause stating that &quot;nothing in this section shall be 

construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize, 

maintain or employ an armed body of men.&quot;  Wash. Const. art. 1 ¤ 24; 

and the mention of &quot;corporations, except municipal&quot; in the 

Privileges and Immunities clause, discussed above.

     In the decade before the Washington Constitutional Convention, 

the territory had grown from a virtual wilderness of 75,000 settlers 

cut off from the nation's capital by a month's travel time, to a 

state of 350,000 citizens who could reach the east coast by a three-

day train ride.  Snure, supra, citing Dorothy Johnson, &quot;Empire of 

the Columbia,&quot; (2d ed., 1967).  Most of the influx of settlers had 

experienced legislative abuse elsewhere, and in Washington as well.  

Snure, Id. at 671.  For example, during the 1862-63 territorial 

legislative session, the legislature passed no general laws, but 

enacted more than 150 pieces of general legislation for the benefit 

of &quot;private interests against the general welfare.&quot;  Id.

     Nor did the delegates trust the other branches of government.  

Governors abused their patronage powers, and judges were appointed 

from afar and often absent.  Id., citing, inter alia, Charles H. 

Sheldon, &quot;A Century of Judging: A Political History of the 

Washington Supreme Court,&quot; (1988).  Mining companies amassed armed 

guards to thwart unions activities, and railroads charged excessive 

rates to farmers.  Id., citing Gordon B. Ridgeway, &quot;Populism in 

Washington,&quot; 39 Pac. N.W. Hist. Q. 284-91 (1948). 

     All of these infringements on personal liberties came about 

despite the guarantees of liberty and democratic government found in 

the U.S. Constitution.

     It is noteworthy that Washington's Declaration of Rights is not 

couched in terms of the federal Bill of Rights, which contains the 

repeated phrase &quot;Congress shall make no law. . .&quot;  Rather, rights 

are stated affirmatively:  &quot;The right of petition. . .shall never be 

abridged,&quot; Art. 1 ¤ 4; &quot;Every person may freely speak, write and 

publish on all subjects. . .&quot;  Art. 1 ¤ 5.

     It is also noteworthy that Washington's constitution contains 

checks and balances on power missing from the federal constitution.  

The federal government now comprises four branches, the fourth being 

federal agencies created by Congress but accountable to nobody.  

This has been especially true since the U.S. Supreme Court decided 

INS V. Chadha 462 U.S. 919 (1982), which eliminated the &quot;legislative 

veto.&quot;  Prior to that, Congress could set up agencies to administer 

programs, then oversee progress by way of committee or single-house 

vote.  In what constitutional scholar and University of Seattle Law 

School Prof. David Skover calls &quot;the second most inane decision ever 

handed down,&quot; the U.S. Supreme Court virtually guaranteed the sort 

of petty tyranny that has resulted in this lawsuit.  (The Chadha 

decision did away with the &quot;legislative veto,&quot; on the theory that 

not only must the enabling legislation withstand bicameral majority 

vote and presentment for veto, but each subsequent &quot;fine-tuning&quot; of 

the agency must be done the same way -- clearly an administratively 

impossible task.)

     Washington's constitutional delegates may not have had Chadha 

as an example, but they had seen where government power was headed.  

In Washington, the fourth branch of government is the people: agency 

heads such as the Attorney General, Secretary of State, Treasurer, 

Auditor, Superintendent of Public Instruction and Commissioner of 

Public Lands are elected, not appointed.  Judges, likewise, are 

elected.

     The framers had also seen the concept of &quot;natural law&quot; twisted 

until it faced the direction opposite any original concept; 

originally a guarantee of personal liberty (for example, as set 

forth in the Declaration of Independence as &quot;inalienable rights&quot;), 

under the influence of the robber barons of the 19th century 

&quot;natural law&quot; was the justification for imposition of laessez-faire 

economics, i.e., natural law prohibited the courts from interfering 

with the right of a laborer to contract for his labor, and never 

mind that the laborer starves while the company owner thrives.

     Thus, the mention of &quot;a frequent recurrence to fundamental 

principles&quot; being linked (uniquely at the time) to individual 

liberty, and the lack of any reference to &quot;natural law&quot; along with 

the absence of a separation-of-powers clause in Washington's 

constitution has led at least one scholar to argue persuasively that 

the phrase amounts to retaining the notion that natural law should 

be considered when protecting individual rights, but not when 

invoking natural law to prevent adherence with social or safety 

legislation.

       Section 32 designates extra-constitutional fundamental 
       principles as essential to the security of individual 
       right. 

Snure, supra, note 30, page 687.  Again, it is no stretch to extend 

the right to be free from unjust action when it originates from a 

federal agency as opposed to originating from a corporation or other 

state entity.

     4. Preexisting state law.

       Previously established bodies of state law, including 
       statutory law, may also bear on the granting of distinctive 
       state constitutional rights.  State law may be responsive 
       to concerns of its citizens long before they are addressed 
       by analogous constitutional claims.  Preexisting law can 
       thus help to define the scope of a constitutional right 
       later established.

Gunwall, supra, 106 Wn.2d at 61, 62.

     Much of the preexisting law leading to the &quot;fundamental 

principles&quot; clause is discussed above.  As for laws preexisting the 

state constitution regarding the use of marijuana, medically or 

otherwise, there were none.  Inhaling opium and operating a house 

where inhaling opium took place were made illegal by the territorial 

laws of 1881, seven years before the signing of the Washington 

constitution.  The earliest reference the plaintiff could find to 

marijuana (&quot;cannabis&quot;) was in the Laws of 1951.  As discussed in 

Section II B 1 above, marijuana was widely and legally used in the 

last century and the early decades of this century, prohibited by 

neither state nor federal law.

     5. Differences in structure between the federal and state 

constitutions.

       The former is a grant of enumerated powers to the federal 
       government, and the latter serves to limit the sovereign 
       power which inheres directly in the people and indirectly 
       in their elected representatives.  Hence the explicit 
       affirmation of fundamental rights in our state constitution 
       may be seen as a guaranty (sic) of those rights rather than 
       as a restriction on them.

Gunwall, id.

     The plaintiff simply asks the Court to take these words at 

their face value, and look to fundamental principles, as required by 

Article I ¤ 32, to do justice.

     6. Matters of particular state interest or local concern.

       Is the subject matter local in character, or does there 
       appear to be a need for national uniformity?  The former 
       may be more appropriately addressed by resorting to the 
       state constitution.

     The plaintiff's physician is licensed to practice by the state.  

The plaintiff has undergone his cancer treatment in a state-owned 

and -regulated facility.  The state legislature has given the state 

Board of Pharmacy the power to place drugs in Schedules different 

from the federal government's determination, in RCW 69.50.201(e).  

And the state's constitution requires a &quot;frequent recurrence to 

fundamental principles,&quot; which the federal constitution does not.  

All of these and more make clear that the plaintiff's access to 

medicine is an issue of local significance; Washington's citizens 

should not be made to suffer by bureaucratic fiat from 2,000 miles 

away.


               <b>2. Fundamental principles in Washington case law.</b>

     The state constitution requires a &quot;frequent recurrence to 

fundamental principles,&quot; which raises the question, &quot;What principles 

are fundamental?&quot;

     Run the phrase &quot;fundamental principles&quot; through Westlaw or 

Lexis, and a sampling looks like this:

It is a fundamental principle that the imposition of business and 
  occupation tax liability must be as equitable as possible. 
  Fidelity Title Company v. State of Washington, Department of 
  Revenue, 49 Wn. App 662, 745 P.2d 530 (1987).  

<b>Reynolds Metal Company v. State, 65 Wn.2d 882, 400 P.2d 310.  Appeal</b> 
  <b>dismissed 382 US 1.60 (1965).</b>  

A fundamental principle of contract damages:  An insured should be 
  put in only as good  a position as he would have occupied had the 
  contract not been breached.  Greer v. Northwestern National 
  Insurance Company, 109 Wn.2d 191, 743 P.2d 1244 (1987).  

Fundamental principles of community property law dictate that each 
  spouse should upon his or her death have the right to dispose of 
  his or her one-half interest in community property.  Standard 
  Insurance Company v. Schwalbe, 47 Wn.  App 639, 737 P.2d 667 
  (1987).  

It is a fundamental principle that penal statutes will be strictly 
  construed as a means of assuring fairness to persons subjected to 
  the law by giving clear and unequivocal warning in language that 
  people generally would understand concerning actions that would 
  expose them to liability for penalties and what those penalties 
  would be.  State v. Enloe, 47 Wn. APp 165, 172, 734 P.2d 520 
  (1987). 

Law against discrimination (RCW 49.60) is not rooted in tort law, 
  but grows out of the fundamental principle that every citizen 
  deserves equal treatment without regard to race, color, religion, 
  sex or handicap.  Reese v. Sears Roebuck and Company, 107 Wn.2d, 
  563, 572, 731 P.2d 497 (1987).

To admit irrelevant, prejudicial evidence which would invite 
  speculation in a jury is contrary to the fundamental principles 
  of fairness and due process upon which our criminal justice 
  system is based.  State v. Smith, 106 Wn.2d 772, 780, 725 P.2d 
  951 (1986).

Fundamental principles applicable to a request for an injunction are 
  1) the proceeding is equitable and addressed to the sound 
  discretion of the trial court,  2)  The trial court is vested 
  with broad discretionary power to shape and fashion injunctive 
  relief to fit the particular facts, circumstances, and equities 
  of the case before it, and 3)  One of the essential criteria for 
  an injunctive relief is actual and substantial injury sustained 
  by the person seeking the injunction.  Brown v. Voss, 105 Wn.2d 
  366, 372, 715 P.2d 514 (1986).

General warrants and writs of assistance were &quot;The worst instrument 
  of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty and 
  the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an 
  English law book,&quot; and so far as they place &quot;the liberty of every 
  man in the hands of every petty officer.&quot;  State v. Crandall, 39 
  Wn. APp 849, 855, 697 P.2d 250 (1985).  Citing the works of John 
  Adams 523-24(Chaz. F. Adams ed. Boston 1850; see also T. Taylor 
  Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 41 (1969)).

It is a fundamental principle regarding the attorney client 
  relationship that a fiduciary relationship exists as a matter of 
  law between an attorney and a client.  Estate of Larson, 103 
  Wn.2d 517, 520, 694 P.2d 1051 (1985).

There is a fundamental principle that every competent citizen is 
  under an obligation to further the administration of justice as a 
  matter of public policy when summoned by due process of law to 
  give evidence.  State v. Dibley, 38 Wn. APp 824, 828, 691 P.2d 
  201 (1984).

       &#149;The fundamental principle that &quot;the required criminal 
       conduct must have existed when the conduct at issue 
       occurred&quot; must apply to bar retroactive criminal 
       prohibitions emanating from courts as well as legislators.  
       State v. Gore, 101 Wn.2d 481, 489, 681 P.2d 227 (1984).

Fundamental principle of Washington Electoral Law is that in a 
  partisan contest there should be only one nominee from each 
  political party.  Democratic Party of Washington v. Spellman, 101 
  Wn.2d 94, 97, 675 P.2d 1222 (1984).

       &#149;It is a fundamental principle that no state may impose a 
       tax which discriminates against interstate commerce by 
       providing a direct commercial advantage to local business.  
       Department of Fisheries v. DeWatto Fish Company, 34 Wn. 
       APp 135, 146, 660 P.2d 298 (1983).

       &#149;It is a fundamental principle that when the state 
       condemns land for public use, no greater estate or 
       interest should be taken than reasonably necessary for 
       contemplated public necessity or use.  State v. McDonald, 
       98 Wn.2d 521, 530, 656 P.2d 1043 (1983).

     Clearly, case law analysis shows that &quot;fundamental principles&quot; 

may be found outside and in addition to the clear statements 

contained in documents such as the Bill of Rights.


               <b>3. Fundamental principles and the plaintiff's case.</b>
         
     Three cases citing Article I ¤ 32 bear on the case at bar:

The doctrine of stare decisis should not result in outmoded 19th 

  century precedents being forced to resolve 20th century disputes 

  -- automobiles should not be governed by horse and buggy laws.  

  Foote v. Grant, 55 Wn.2d 797, 806-7, 350 P.2d 870 (1960).

Likewise, in a case involving the &quot;taking&quot; of property by creating 

  loud jet noise in the airspace over it, the Supreme Court of 

  Washington held:

       The invention of the airplane and the development of modern 
       air transportation . . . have occurred somewhat 
       subsequently to the development of the legal concepts 
       emphasized in formulating early common law theories of 
       liability.  An awareness of these changes makes it 
       incumbent upon us to heed the advice of the framers of the 
       Washington constitution when they said: &quot;A frequent 
       recurrence to fundamental principles is essential to the 
       security of individual right and the perpetuity of free 
       government.&quot;

Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, 55 Wn.2d 400, 407, 348 P.2d 664 

(1960)(citation omitted).  In both of the above cases, the 

correlation to the case at bar is clear: Times change, new 

information becomes known, and legal theories adequate in times past 

should be changed to do justice.

     As a direct parallel, it is a fundamental principle that a drug 

prohibited when it was believed to have no medicinal use should not 

remain prohibited after it is shown that it is beneficial, and 

indeed unique in its ability to relieve suffering.

In a much more recent case, the Supreme Court held that while 

  massive, intrusive searches of apartment buildings may in fact 

  enhance public safety,

       it is often when government is most eagerly pursuing what 
       it perceives to be the public interest that it is most 
       likely to sidestep constitutional safeguards or to 
       denigrate constitutional liberties.  For precisely such 
       reasons, our constitution wisely counsels us:

          A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is 
       essential to the security of individual right and the 
       perpetuity of free government. . .

          We therefore cannot permit these warrants to be 
       executed, regardless of Seattle's pressing (and undoubtedly 
       laudable) desire to see its housing codes enforced.

City of Seattle v. McCready, 123 Wn.2d 260, 281, 868 P.2d 134 (1994) 

(citation omitted).

     This is precisely the case now before the Court.  The 

government &quot;is most eagerly pursuing what it perceives to be the 

public interest&quot; in retaining a valuable therapeutic drug in a 

prohibited category, and in doing so is violating the fundamental 

right of its citizens to be free of needless physical suffering.

     Other fundamental principles which the plaintiff asks the Court 

to consider, and recur to as the constitution requires, are these:

It is a fundamental principle that irrational laws breed disrespect 

  for the rule of law.  It is irrational to prohibit physicians 

  from prescribing marijuana while permitting them to prescribe 

  opium and cocaine.  It is irrational to force the plaintiff and 

  others in his situation to choose between physical suffering and 

  undertaking a criminal act.

Citizens of Washington who have a medical need for marijuana are 

  immune, under State v. Diana, supra, from prosecution.  It is a 

  fundamental principle that if a citizen foreseeably will not be 

  prosecuted, he should not be arrested, jailed, and put to the 

  expense, humiliation and vexation of dealing with criminal 

  charges.  This is especially true when, as is the case, the very 

  conditions which render them immune from prosecution make them 

  some of society's most helpless citizens, least able to deal with 

  such legal intrusions in their lives with any grace or dignity.

It is a fundamental principle that a physician should have access to 

  proven therapeutic drugs to relieve the suffering of his or her 

  patients.

It is a fundamental principle that the government of Washington 

  should not deny therapeutic drugs to its weakest and most 

  afflicted citizens merely to &quot;match statutes&quot; with federal laws 

  which are driven by political and irrational decisions, made by 

  bureaucrats who corrupt the process set forth in the enabling 

  statutes created by Congress.

It is a fundamental principle that the federal government should not 

  be permitted to withhold valuable medicine from Washington 

  citizens by first claiming that no scientific evidence supports 

  the therapeutic value of the medicine, then denying permission to 

  gather the scientific evidence to prove (or perhaps disprove) the 

  therapeutic value.


                        <b>IV. CONCLUSION</b>

     This Court, sitting in equity, should exercise its statutory 

and constitutional power to declare that the placing of marijuana in 

Schedule I, RCW 69.50.204, is a violation of the plaintiff's rights 

and liberties secured by Article I ¤¤ 12 and 32 of  the Constitution 

of the State of Washington.

CLERK SUPREME COURT

WANDA JOY HILLS,

     Appellee,

vs.

IOWA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
AND MOTOR VEHICLE DIVISION,

     Appellant.

     Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Muscatine County, 
J.L. Burns, Judge.

     Judicial review of agency action revoking driver's operating 
privileges.  AFFIRMED.

     Thomas J. Miller, Attorney General, David A. Ferree, Special 
Assistant Attorney General, and Kerry Anderson, Assistant 
Attorney General, for appellant.

     Wanda Hills, Muscatine, pro se.

     Considered by Harris, P.J., and Larson, Carter, Lavorato, 
and Snell, JJ.

                               2

HARRIS, Justice.

     A statutory change called for revocation of drivers' 
operating privileges upon certain listed criminal convictions.  
The question here is whether the change applies to convictions 
that occurred after the effective date, but for acts committed 
previously.  The district court reversed such a revocation, 
determining that to allow it would amount to an ex post facto 
application of the law.  We affirm.
     Petitioner Wanda Joy Hills was arrested for operating a 
motor vehicle while intoxicated on April 1, 1993.  Following a 
search incident to arrest, she was also charged with possession 
of marijuana in violation of then Iowa Code section 204.401(3) 
(1991) (section 204.401(3) has since been renumbered as section 
<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A> (1995)).
     Hills arranged to plead guilty to the marijuana possession 
charge at a pretrial conference, initially scheduled for June 29, 
1993.  On June 22, however, the district court, on its own 
motion, changed the date of the pretrial hearing to July 2, 1993.  
Hills entered her guilty plea on July 2.  In the meantime, on 
July 1, 1993, Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> became effective.  It 
provides for mandatory revocation by the DOT of the driver's 
license of anyone convicted of a controlled substance offense 
under Code section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A>. [footnote 1]
     The DOT revoked Hills' license over her protest that there 
could be no revocation on the basis of occurrences prior to July 
1, 1993.  On judicial review
____________________

     [footnote 1]  Iowa Code ¤ <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> states:

          Mandatory revocation.  The department shall upon twenty 
     days' notice and without preliminary hearing revoke the 
     license or operating privilege of an operator upon receiving 
     a record of the operator's conviction for any of the 
     following offenses, when such conviction has become final:

          ....

          8.  A controlled substance offense under section 
     <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A> ....

                                3

the district count reversed the agency action, holding that, to 
apply the new statute to offenses committed prior to its 
effective date, violated the ex post facto principles of the 
state and federal constitutions.  The DOT brought this appeal to 
challenge the holding.
     I.  Ex post facto applications of law are prohibited by 
article I section 9 clause 3 of the United States Constitution 
and by article I section 21 of the Iowa Constitution.  The ex 
post facto clauses forbid

     [punishing as a crime] an act previously committed, which 
     was innocent when done, [or making] more burdensome the 
     punishment for a crime, after its commission, or [depriving] 
     one charged with crime of any defense available according to 
     [the] law at the time when the act was committed.

Adair Benevolent Soc'y v. State, 489 N.W.2d 1, 4 (Iowa 1992); see 
also State v. Kaster, 469 N.W.2d 671, 673-74 (Iowa 1991).  The ex 
post facto prohibition applies only to penal and criminal 
actions, not to civil actions.  State v. Taggart, 186 Iowa 247, 
254, 172 N.W. 299, 301 (1919) (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. (3 
Dall.) 386 (1798)).  Our review of this constitutional question 
is de novo.  State v. Niehaus, 452 N.W.2d 184, 187 (Iowa 1990).
     II.  The question is whether the revocation was, in essence, 
a punishment.  If so the ex post facto prohibition would apply.  
On the other hand if the revocation was merely a civil penalty, 
designed to enhance public safety, the ex post facto prohibition 
would not apply.  This is because civil penalties do not violate 
ex post facto clauses, even though their penalties may be 
retroactive and more burdensome.  Thus our controlling question 
is whether license revocation based on possession of a controlled 
substance is a civil penalty or a criminal (or a quasi-criminal) 
punishment.
     The State argues that license revocations are civil in 
nature, and as an abstract proposition cases support this 
contention.  See, e.g., State v. Moret, 486 N.W.2d 589, 591 (Iowa 
1992) (driver's license suspension of a habitual

                                 4

offender of motor vehicle laws is for public safety, not for 
punishment of the offender); State v. Blood, 360 N.W.2d 820, 822 
(Iowa 1985) (driver's license revocation for OWI not intended as 
punishment but designed solely for the protection of the public).  
In State v. Funke, ___ N.W.2d ___, ___ (Iowa 1995), we rejected a 
former jeopardy challenge to a driver's license revocation on the 
basis that a civil proceeding was involved, not a criminal one.  
Because it was a civil proceeding, we found the former jeopardy 
prohibition no impediment to the revocation because the statute 
authorizing revocation did not serve both the twin goals of 
punishment-deterrence and retribution.  We said public safety -- 
not punishment -- was the goal; deterrence and retribution were 
not involved.  Id. at ___.
     Our Funke former jeopardy holding, however, does not 
necessarily control Hills' ex post facto challenge.  Ex post 
facto, in contrast with former jeopardy challenges, cannot be 
posited on civil matters.  Iowa has limited the doctrine to cases 
criminal in nature.  In re Ponx, 276 N.W.2d 425, 428 (Iowa 1979).  
This limitation on the ex post facto doctrine applies even where 
the civil consequences are "serious" in nature.  Id.
     The question then is whether Hills' license revocation, 
based on the controlled substance violation, was civil or 
criminal in nature.  The answer turns on whether the essential 
aim of the controlled substance revocation was to promote highway 
safety.  We think in this respect it differs from the "habitual 
offender" revocation statute we considered in Funke.
     In contending the revocation is civil in nature, the DOT 
argues there is a "direct connection" between the possession of 
controlled substances, driving, and public safety.  The district 
court did not perceive such a connection and neither do we.  
Persons who illegally possess drugs are of course subject to 
appropriate criminal punishment.  But many such persons choose 
not to drive.  When they

                                 5

do not, they do not affect highway safety.  Any connection 
between drugs, driving, and public safety is at most indirect.  
The amended statute authorizing this license revocation was aimed 
essentially at enhancing punishment for controlled substance 
possession.  As such it was quasi-criminal and not civil in 
nature.  Ex post facto principles therefore prohibit application 
of the amended statute.  The district court was correct in so 
holding.

<h2>Co-sponsors Needed for Federal Medical Marijuana Bill</h2><P>

<B>Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) recently introduced H.R. 2618, a federal medical marijuana bill.  H.R. 2618 reschedules marijuana from schedule I to schedule II, thereby making it available by prescription.  This bill was first introduced 1981 and was co-sponsored by four Republicans, including Rep. Newt Gingrich, then an obscure second-term congressman from suburban Atlanta.  The measure was subsequently reintroduced (H.R. 4498) in early 1982 with 71 additional co-sponsors.<P>

If your member of Congress is supportive of medical marijuana, please take a moment to contact him/her to urge they co-sponsor the Frank medical marijuana bill.  Interested members or staff should contact Mr. Robert Raben on Rep. Frank's staff (202-225-6906).<P>

Although more research is needed, it is clear from rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which it may be substituted.<P>

Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, and nausea and appetite loss in the wasting syndrome of AIDS.  It is also useful for various spastic conditions including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, and it lowers intraocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle glaucoma.  For some people with epilepsy it is the only anticonvulsant that works.  It has been used for centuries as an analgesic and is considered by many to be the best approach to migraine.  It is also useful to some patients for the symptomatic treatment of depression, menstrual cramps, asthma and pruritus.<P>

Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they must risk arrest to obtain and use it.  Informal buyers' clubs supplying marijuana to the seriously ill have been formed in many cities.  Some of these clubs are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a regular basis.  Despite these heroic efforts, the underground emergency distribution system reaches only a small proportion of the tens of thousands of patients who could benefit from legal marijuana.<P>

This bill would amend federal law to permit physicians to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma or spastic condition including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia and quadriplegia.  Thirty-six states have adopted legislation designed to facilitate the availability of medical marijuana, but none of these programs can be implemented without a an amendment to federal law.<P>

<h1><i>Bill Would End Ban on Medical Marijuana</i></h1>

<p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 -- The Drug Policy Foundation today
applauded the introduction of a bill in the House of
Representatives that would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana
for the first time in over five decades. The bill, H.R. 2618, was
introduced by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.). It is modeled on
legislation sponsored in the early 1980s by several members of
Congress, including Republicans Newt Gingrich (Ga.), Bill
McCollum (Fla.), John Porter (Ill.) and Frank Wolf (Va.).</p>

<p>David C. Condliffe, DPF's executive director, said, &quot;Most
Americans are shocked when they learn that a doctor cannot
prescribe marijuana to seriously ill patients, including cancer
and AIDS patients. Polls repeatedly show that the public favors
giving doctors the authority to prescribe marijuana to patients
who find no relief from other medicines. But the federal
government has refused to budge. Barney Frank's bill would end
this cruel policy and help thousands of Americans. His leadership
on this vital issue is admirable.&quot;</p>

<p>Currently, 36 states have endorsed the medical use of
marijuana. However, state acts that recognize marijuana's medical
usefulness are mainly symbolic because the federal government has
classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which means that it
has no officially sanctioned medical use. H.R. 2618 would
reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, along with cocaine
and amphetamines, which are tightly regulated. The bill would
establish an office in the Department of Health and Human
Services to administer a domestic medical marijuana supply that
would be distributed to patients through licensed hospitals and
pharmacies.</p>

<p>Harvard Medical School professor and DPF Advisory Board member
Dr. Lester Grinspoon said, &quot;The fact that thousands of
people daily break the law by going to underground Cannabis
Buyers Clubs is powerful testimony to the importance of this
legislation. These people are being open about using cannabis
because it relieves their symptoms better than legally available
medicines, not because they want better access to a recreational
drug.&quot;</p>

The Drug Policy Foundation                                     Nov. 13,1995
News Release                                                         Page 2
</pre>

<p>&quot;Even as an illegal drug, cannabis stands out among the
modern medicines as a safe and effective treatment for a wide
range of symptoms,&quot; Grinspoon added. &quot;For example, it
appears to be the best drug available to treat the nausea and
vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Cannabis can also
be used to control the nausea from AIDS or the drugs used to
treat it, to reduce muscle spasms brought on by multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, to lower intraocular
pressure in people who have open-angle glaucoma, to suppress an
epileptic's convulsions, to treat painful migraines. The list
goes on.&quot;</p>

<p>DPF President Arnold Trebach said, &quot;This bill would
provide not just relief but dignity to patients suffering from
life- and sense-threatening diseases. It makes no sense to force
patients into a black market where neither their safety nor the
purity of their medicine is guaranteed.&quot;</p>

<p>Trebach added, &quot;The Drug Policy Foundation welcomes H.R.
2618 after having worked for years as lead counsel in a lawsuit
to reschedule marijuana. One of the important results of that
suit was that, in 1988, the Drug Enforcement Administration's
chief administrative law judge agreed with us that marijuana was
a remarkably safe and medically useful drug.&quot;</p>

<p>Since 1987, the Drug Policy Foundation has been a lead party
in the suit to get the DEA to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule
II drug. Most recently, in February 1994, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C., upheld the DEA's authority to
maintain the medical ban on marijuana, despite evidence of its
value.</p>

<p>Grinspoon, co-author of Marihuana, The Forbidden Medicine
(Yale University Press, 1993), commented, &quot;My
representative, Barney Frank, is making an invaluable
contribution to medical science with his bill. It will spur more
and better research on a drug that, through popular
misunderstandings, has been wrongfully excluded from modern
medicine. At the same time, we must recognize that cannabis is
not a perfect drug and that it won't work for all patients.
Still, it will be a major step forward when doctors and patients
can exercise the choice to use cannabis - especially when nothing
else in the pharmacopoeia works.&quot;</p>

Rep. Bill McCullum<BR>
Chair, Crime Subcommittee<BR>
2266 Rayburn H.O.B.<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20515<P>

Dear Representative McCullum:<P>

I am writing to request that you cosponsor a bill which will be introduced by my representative, The Honorable Barney Frank of Massachusetts.  This bill would allow physicians to prescribe cannabis to patients with certain medical symptoms and syndromes.  It is modeled after a similar bill which you co-sponsored in 198I and again in 1983.<P>

The urgent need for such iegislation is indicated by the fact that thousands of patients in 26 cities have formed Cannabis Buyers Clubs throuqh which, with a note from their doctors, they can obtain at cost a small amount ot marihuana (cannabis) for medical use.  They are risking arrest because they have found that marihuana relieves their symptoms better than the available legal medicines.  For example, it appears to be the best available treatment for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.  Many people with AIDS also suffer from nausea caused by the disease itself or the drugs needed to treat it.  In most of these people marihuana eliminates the nausea more effectively than conventional antinauseants.  Marihuana is also used in the treatment of glaucoma, migraine, and muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, parapleqia, and quadriplegia.  Again, it is often safer and more effective than any of the legal medicines available for these purposes.<P>

This medical marihuaha bill would allow people who need medical cannabis to obtain it legally with a doctor's prescription, and to use it without having to suffer the anxiety created by its iilegal status.  A growing number of citizens and physicians have come to understand that outlawing the medical use of cannabis is both unscientific and immoral.  A recent national poll indicates that 85% of Americans are in favor of allowing medical marihuana, and 36 states now have passed laws designed to facilitate its availability.  These hopes cannot be realized until the federal qovernment passes similar legislation.<P>

I am enclosinq a copy of a <a href="lester.html">Commentary</a> published in the June, 1995, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association which may help you to understand why your support for Representative Frank's bill is important.  If you would like to learn more about this issue, I would be glad to send you a copy of a book written by James B. Bakalar and me (Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine, Yale University Press, 1993).  If I can help in any other way, please get in touch with me.  My telephone and fax numbers are listed below.<P>

Thank you for considering cosponsorship of this most important and humane legislation.<P>


Sincerely yours,<P>

Lester Grinspoon, M.D.<P>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><BR><DD>There is a God and we believe in Him.&nbsp;  He is not a person nor a physical being.&nbsp;  He is spirit and He is universal intelligence.&nbsp;  Never deny that there is a God.&nbsp;  God being universal intelligence created the universe out of that intelligence.&nbsp;  It is intelligence that creates.&nbsp;  Man is a part of the creation of universal intelligence and man was created in the image and likeness of God only by his intelligence.&nbsp;  It is the intelligence of man that is like God, but man's intelligence is only a unitary particle of God's universal intelligence.
<BR><DD>God out of His universal intelligence made matter and made mind.&nbsp;  That matter is made by God and man is matter as well as mind; then man must be in the image of God, because nothing could exist without God.&nbsp;  As God made the universe out of His universal knowledge or intelligence so man in his unitary knowledge or intelligence can make a typewriter, an automobile or a chair, but cannot make the universe because his unitary intelligence is not as much or as great as universal intelligence.&nbsp;  All the unitary intelligence of the universe goes to make God who is the embodiment of all intelligence, so no man can be as great as God because he is only a unit of God and God is the whole.
<BR><DD>No man therefore can measure God nor ask God questions because he is not as intelligent as God and therefore cannot understand God.&nbsp;  It is presumptuous therefore, when man questions God from his limited unitary intelligence.
<BR><DD>Man never dies.&nbsp;  Nothing dies.&nbsp;  Man is made of body and spirit.&nbsp;  The spirit is God.&nbsp;  It is intelligence.&nbsp;  The body of man is matter.&nbsp;  It changes from living matter in the man to other matter in the soil.&nbsp;  It is always the same matter.&nbsp;  It doesn't die in the sense of how we understand death.&nbsp;  It changes.&nbsp;  When man sleeps and passes away in the flesh he goes to earth that lives on, out of which other men and things are formed.&nbsp;  All matter is related so man is related to earth and earth related to man.&nbsp;  We eat ourselves over and over again.&nbsp;  When we eat the apple, the banana, the fig, the cherry, the grape, when we drink the water, we are eating and drinking ourselves over and over again, so nothing is lost and nothing dies, so do not be afraid of death, because what you call death is only change and you are still in the universe either in the spirit of God to whom your spirit goes after the change or as matter which goes on forever.
<BR><DD>You are related to the flower, to the beautiful rose, to the trees, to the fish and to other animals just as you are related to God.
<BR><DD>All of you sprung from God who is universal intelligence.&nbsp;  Do not be more cowardly than the rose, the apple, the coconut, the sheep, the fish or the cow to do that which all must, and which we call death, to die.&nbsp;  If you are going to weep to die then the rose should weep to die.&nbsp;  If you weep you are a coward.&nbsp;  Die like a man because you are not lost, you are still there.&nbsp;  You only weep because you are a glutton, because you think you will not get any more to eat and drink and any more happy times; just as you have been feeding upon things, and other beings who came here before you, so someone else must feed on you to make creation true, otherwise God would not be fair to everybody and everything, and God is fair and just and no respecter of persons or things.

<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER><B>(By MARCUS GARVEY)</B></CENTER></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=+2><CENTER><B>From THE BLACK MAN [1936 or 1937]</B></CENTER></FONT>
<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>The July/August [1936] and September/October [1936] 
issues of <I>The Black Man</I> carried criticisms "pro" and "con" 
about the Emperor of Abyssinia - Haile Selassie - who is 
now residing in exile in England.

<P><DD>The criticisms on the matter were really prompted for 
the purpose of enlightening the Negro world about the true 
situation of affairs and to awaken him from his usual 
sentimental dreams.</FONT>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>NOT UNDERSTANDING.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>Some people, a limited few, not understanding the 
purpose, entertained narrow views as to whether the Emperor 
should be criticized or not, and actually suggested that he 
was above criticism, no doubt, because of his "divinity."&nbsp;  
Where they got this idea from we are unable to explain, 
other than to charge it to real ignorance about the present 
state of our peculiarly civilized world.&nbsp;  There is one 
satisfaction, and that is, that <I>The Black Man</I> being read in 
all parts of the world, has succeeded in creating an 
enlightenment that is positively necessary if the Negro is 
to seriously and intelligently grapple with the problems 
that confront him, particularly those that are political.</FONT>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>NOT UNFAIRNESS.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>No one desires to be unfair to Haile Selassie.&nbsp;  The only 
sad thing is that he has been unfair to himself, to his 
country and his countrymen, by acting in a manner not 
consistent with ordinary political intelligence necessary 
to our age, in understanding the machinations, cunning and 
vile methods and systems of Governments and peoples.

<P><DD>Those who pay a little attention to European and 
American politics, must wonder, with great astonishment, 
how Haile Selassie could have made such colossal blunders 
in ignoring the sacred trust imposed upon him, of jealously 
safe-guarding the interest of the country and people whom 
he elevated himself to rule so as to prevent them from 
falling into the very covetous hands and under the 
domination of an enemy who made no secret of his threat 
toward the usurpation of the people's political freedom and 
the conquest of the country.</FONT>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>SYMPATHY FOR THE EMPEROR.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>If there is sympathy for Haile Selassie, it must be for 
his unfortunate ignorance of history which should be the 
guide of every modern statesman and ruler to enable him to 
successfully protect the national interests involved.&nbsp;  Any 
tyro who has read European history knows that the 
Machiavellian policy is as evident today as in the day of 
the originator of the policy, and politically the 
diplomatic word must be taken not in the literal sense but 
with a grain of salt.&nbsp;  Undertakings between Governments 
should be considered from the angle of diplomacy which 
generally hides the truth that is intended.

<P><DD>Haile Selassie was not able to understand the hidden 
methods and motives encouched in diplomatic papers and ad-
vices.&nbsp;  The result was, as Machiavelli would suggest, his 
being trapped to the advantage of the astute Mussolini, 
whose diplomacy for the good of Italy could well be 
understood by the keen diplomat.

<P><DD>When it is understood that Haile Selassie ruled over a 
State with more than twelve million people and one of the 
richest in the world in natural resources, his best friends 
surely cannot compliment him for leaving that country in 
the hands of a foreign foe, and by the methods he adopted.</FONT>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>KEPT COUNTRY UNPREPARED.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>He kept his country unprepared in a modern civilization 
whose policy was strictly aggressive.&nbsp;  He resorted senti-
mentally to prayer and to feasting and fasting, not 
consistent with the policy that secures the existence of 
present-day freedom for peoples whilst other nations and 
rulers are building up armaments of the most destructive 
kind as the only means of securing peace and protection.&nbsp;  
He reclined on the peculiar policy of leaving everything to 
the Almighty Wisdom of the Universal Creator Who, in all 
history, has never yet taken political sides between two 
rival human political forces and powers.&nbsp;  For God to 
maintain his equilibrium, He cannot take sides in human 
political differences between peoples and nations, 
otherwise He would cease to be the God of the one, yet 
positively declaring Himself to be the God of the other.&nbsp;  
So as the result shows, God had nothing to do with the 
campaign of Italy in Abyssinia, for on the one side we had 
the Pope of the Catholic Church blessing the Crusade and 
the other the Coptic Church fasting and praying with 
confidence of victory.</FONT>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>THE ITALIAN FORCE.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>The Italians triumphed by the use of mustard gas.  
Surely God was not on the side of the Italians helping them 
to disload the gas of death.&nbsp;  The Abyssinians lost.&nbsp;  God 
could not have been on their side either.&nbsp;  It is logical 
therefore that God didn't take sides, but left the matter 
to be settled by the strongest human battalion.&nbsp;  Haile 
Selassie had no equipment and no food.&nbsp;  He never even had 
gas masks.&nbsp;  The Emperor remained in the Palace long enough 
to give the Italians a good foothold in Abyssinia, and then 
when he left the Palace it was only for seeing his poorly 
equipped soldiers flee before the enemy and to gain time 
for himself to get back to the Palace and flee the country 
with all he could lay his hands on, leaving the unfortunate 
people to the mercy of the heartless invader.

<P><DD>These are the facts.&nbsp;  Those who do not want to know them 
may, like the ostrich, hide their heads in the sand; but 
those of us who know and understand, realize that battles 
are not won this way.

<P><DD>We are sorry for the Emperor, because we realize he 
didn't know better.&nbsp;  As a fact, he didn't know what it was 
all about, but that it was just a matter of attacking his 
Divine right of being Emperor and that the consequence 
could well be left to God Who ordained the Divinity that 
made him Emperor.</FONT>
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P><FONT  SIZE=+2><B>HOLDING CROWNS.</B></FONT>

<FONT  SIZE=+1><P><DD>Kings and Emperors do not hold their crowns today by 
Divine right.&nbsp;  They hold them by superior statesmanship, 
such as is being demonstrated to us by the nations of 
Europe and America.&nbsp;  When the Negroes get this kind of a 
sense in their heads they will be able to fight a 
successful war in Abyssinia and elsewhere.</FONT>

                     MARIJUANA AS A HOLY SACRAMENT:
     IS THE USE OF PEYOTE CONSTITUTIONALLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT
             OF MARIJUANA IN BONA FIDE RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES?


&quot;And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed.&quot; 
Genesis 1:29 (King James). 


     This past April, within one week, the Supreme Court: 1) denied 

certiorari to Carl Eric Olsen, an Ethiopian Zion Coptic priest appealing 

the denial of a DEA exemption for the sacramental use of marijuana; 

[footnote 1] and 2) held that the State of Oregon could deny unemployment 

compensation to two Native Americans who had been fired for the 

sacramental use of peyote. [footnote 2]  Similarities between the two 

cases end there.  The Supreme Court's latter holding does not change the 

fact that Congress and the Drug Enforcement Administration (&quot;DEA&quot;), have 

decided to accommodate the religious practices of the Native American 

Church (&quot;NAC&quot;), and accord it a preferential position by establishing, 

pursuant to regulation, its right to religious drug use over against all 

other churches. {footnote 3]  Part I of this article will set forth the 

favorable treatment which the federal government extends to the NAC 

regarding its unlimited exemption to use peyote in religious ceremonies.

I.   THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH ENJOYS A DEA EXEMPTION FROM THE 
     FEDERAL DRUG LAWS PROHIBITING INGESTION OF PEYOTE 

     A. The Native American Church 

     When one tries to solidify a definition of the NAC, it must be 

remembered that America has 307 Native American tribes living within its 

borders. [footnote 8]  There is no majority control of the NAC and as a 

result, the only statement &quot;that is safe to make is that there is, in 

many places and in many ways, a concept of a Native American Church.&quot; 

[footnote 9]  How the NAC conducts its rituals and celebrates its 

sacrament is subject to myriad differences.&quot; [footnote 10]

     While the NAC has no recorded theology, members combine certain 

Christian teachings with the belief that peyote embodies the Holy Spirit. 

[footnote 11]  It is believed that those who partake of peyote enter into 

direct contact with God and experience a heightened sense of 

comprehension which includes a deep feeling of compassion for others. 

[footnote 12] 

     Worship in the NAC centers around the &quot;peyote meeting&quot; which begins 

at sundown and continues at least until day break. [footnote 13] 

Normally, the ceremony is conducted to give thanks or to receive 

guidance. [footnote 14]  Participants sit in a circle around a fire, 

[footnote 15] consume peyote during the ceremony, and may pray, sing, or 

use a drum. [footnote 16]  Other accouterments can include a fan, eagle 

bone or feather, whistle, rattle, and/or a prayer cigarette. [footnote 

17]  While the membership of the NAC is estimated to consist of between 

250,000 and 400,000 people, [footnote 18] there are no official 

prerequisites to

     Peyote, an hallucinogenic cactus, [footnote 21] has effects similar 

to lysergic acid diethylamide (&quot;LSD&quot;). [footnote 22]  &quot;The major active 

ingredient in peyote is mescaline.&quot; [footnote 23]  The precursor of the 

DEA, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (&quot;BNDD&quot;), [footnote 24]

     [footnote 21]  Peyote, which is native to the region of the Rio 
Grande Valley and southward, is a plant classified botanically as 
Lophorphora Williamsii Lemaire.  It is a small, spineless, low growing 
cactus and is carrot or turnip-like in shape and size.  Only the fleshy, 
rounded top grows above ground.  After the pincushion top is sliced off 
and dried, it becomes a hard and brittle disk-like button, which is used 
ceremoniously to produce &quot;profound sensory and psychic phenomena.&quot;  35 
Fed. Reg. 14789-90 (1970). 

     [footnote 22]  Id.  LSD is a &quot;Psychedelic&quot; which refers to a class 
of drugs including mescaline and marijuana, among others, whose primary 
effect is to expand consciousness, heighten intellectual activity, and 
increase sensory awareness.  Leary v. United States, 383 F.2d 851, 858, 
860 (5th Cir. 1967), rev'd on other grounds, 395 U.S. 6 (1969).  
Researchers have found that religious reactions in those partaking of 
psychedelic drugs are present in varying degrees from about 25% to 90% of 
all users.  United States v. Kuch, 288 F. Supp. 439, 444 (D.D.C. 1968).  
A &quot;religious reaction&quot; is defined as a sharpening of the senses and a 
mixed feeling of awe and fear.  There may be a sense of mystery, peace, 
and a sharpening of impressions as to all natural objects, perhaps 
something like the vision Moses had of the burning bush.  Id.

1) confused mental states and dreamlike revivals of past traumatic 

events; 2) alteration of sensory perception evidenced by visual illusions 

and distortion of space and perspective; 3) alteration of mood with 

anxiety, euphoria, or ecstacy; 4) alteration of ideation with impairment 

of concentration and intelligence; and 5) alteration of personality with 

impairment of conscious functioning and the deterioration of inhibitions. 

[footnote 25]  Indeed, ingestion of peyote may result in such severe 

reactions as psychosis and suicide. [footnote 26]  The federal drug laws 

which prohibit peyote use, however, do not apply to participants who 

ingest peyote as part of the NAC religious ritual. [footnote 27]

     [footnote 26]  See id.  On the other hand, some report that through 
the use of peyote: 1) euphoria and good feelings are heightened; 2) 
colors and music are more vivid and more pleasing; 3) prayers take on an 
intense philosophical and ethical quality; and 4) a state of inner peace 
takes place where the individual may experience visions or sensations of 
the supernatural.  A. Marriott, supra note 9, at 70.  Peyote is not

substances, with Schedule I containing those substances subject to the 

most restrictive control. [footnote 29]  Schedule I substances are 

defined as those which meet the following three criteria: 

     1)  &quot;a high potential for abuse&quot;; 

     2)  &quot;no currently accepted medical use in treatment in 
     the United States&quot;; and 

     3)  &quot;a lack of accepted safety for use ... under 
     medical supervision.&quot; [footnote 30] 

Peyote is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance [footnote 31] 

of the CSA which prohibits its distribution, its possession with intent 

to distribute, and its possession without a prescription. [footnote 32]

petitioner to apply for an exception to &quot;any provision&quot; of the

     [footnote 32]  21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 812(c)(c)(12), 841, 844 (1988).  The 
manufacture and distribution of peyote were first prohibited by federal 
law in the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, which were superseded 
by the CSA.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 812(c), Schedule I(c)(12) cited in Native Am.

          &quot;Peyote was classified as a 'narcotic' in the Narcotic Farm Act 
of 1929, 45 Stat. 1085, to enable peyote 'addicts' to seek treatment at 
federal facilities.  The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 also 
classified peyote as a narcotic or hypnotic substance, 52 Stat. 1050, and 
imposed certain labeling requirements.  Neither statute prohibited the 
manufacture or distribution of peyote.&quot;  Amicus Memorandum before DEA,

the Attorney General by any interested party in order to determine 

whether a particular drug should be reclassified, added, or removed from 

the schedules. [footnote 34]  The CSA also authorizes the Attorney 

General to establish registration procedures to permit persons to 

manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances and confers 

broad authority to grant and waive registration requirements. [footnote

Citing marijuana as an example, Congress noted the need for flexibility

     The extent to which marihuana should be controlled is a 
     subject upon which opinions diverge widely.  There are

     encourage its use; at the other extreme there are some

Abuse Control Amendments with the understanding that bona fide religious 

use of peyote was exempt from regulation. [footnote 36]  The 
____________________

     [footnote 36]  After the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, 79 
Stat. 226 &#167; 3(a) (&quot;H.R. 2&quot;), passed the Senate and were being debated in 
the House, Congressman Harris stated the following: 
          Mr. Harris:  The last amendment of substance made 
     by the Senate deletes the provisions of the House bill 
     which provided that the term &quot;depressant or stimulant 
     drug&quot; does not include peyote used in connection with 
     ceremonies of a bona fide religious organization. 
          Some concern has been expressed by many of the 
     religious groups affected, and by certain civil 
     liberties organizations concerning the possible impact 
     of this amendment on religious practices protected by 
     the first amendment to the Constitution. 
          Two court decisions have been rendered in this 
     area in recent years.  One, a decision by Judge Yale 
     McFate in the case of Arizona v. Attakai, No. 4098, in 
     the superior court of Maricopa County, Phoenix, 
     Arizona, July 26, 1960; and a California decision, 
     People against Woody, decided August 24, 1964, in the 
     Supreme Court of California.  Both these cases held 
     that prosecutions for the use of peyote in connection 
     with religious ceremonies was a violation of the first 
     amendment to the Constitution. 
          In view of all this, I requested the views of the 
     Food and Drug Administration and have been assured that 
     the bill, even with [sic without] the peyote exemption 
     appearing in the House-passed bill, cannot forbid bona 
     fide religious use of peyote. 
          Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to 
     include the letter from the Food and Drug 
     Administration at this point in my remarks. 
          Dear Mr. chairman: In response to your 
          request we are stating the position the Food 
          and Drug Administration expects to take if 
          H.R. 2 becomes law as it passed the Senate 
          with respect to the use of peyote in 
          religious ceremonies. 
          We have been advised by a representative of 
          the North [sic Native] American Church that 
          this church is a bona fide religious 
          organization and that peyote has bona fide 
          use in the sacrament of the church.  The 
          representative has agreed to document both of 
          these statements. 
          If the church is a bona fide religious 
          organization that makes sacramental use of 
          peyote, then it would be our view that H.R.

          2, even without the peyote exemption which 
          appeared in the House-passed version, could

          We believe that the constitutional guarantee 
          of religious freedom fully safeguards the 
          rights of the organization and its 
          communicants.

     the House agree to the Senate amendments to H.R. 2.

     Mr. [Congressman] Satterfield.  I have one other 
     question.  I recall when we were discussing dangerous 
     drugs a few years ago, the question came up about the 
     Native American Church involving Indians in the west 
     who use and have for centuries used peyote in 
     connection with religious services.  It is my 
     understanding that they enjoy an exemption under the 
     current law. 
     My question is whether in any of the bills we have 
     before us, if passed, would in any way affect this 
     present exemption?

the BNDD promulgated the current regulation which provides: 

          SPECIAL EXEMPT PERSONS 
          &#167; 1307.31 Native American Church. 
          The listing of peyote as a controlled 
          substance in Schedule I does not apply to the 
          nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious 
          ceremonies of the Native American Church, and 
          members of the Native American Church so 
          using peyote are exempt from registration. 
          Any person who manufactures peyote for or 
          distributes peyote to the Native American 
          Church, however, is required to obtain 
          registration annually and to comply with all 
          other requirements of law. [footnote 39] 
____________________

     In the first instance, Mr. Satterfield, the Native 
     American Church did ask us by letter as to whether or 
     not the regulation, exempting them by regulation, would 
     be continued and we assured them that it would because 
     of the history of the church.  We presently are 
     involved in another hearing regarding another church 
     that is a non-Indian church that is seeking the 
     exemption and the order is going to be published, I 
     believe, either today or tomorrow denying them the same 
     exemption as the Native American Church. 
     We consider the Native American Church to be sui generis. 
     The history and tradition of the church is such that there 
     is no question but that they regard peyote as a deity as it 
     were, and we'll continue the exemption. 
     Mr. Satterfield.  You do not see anything in the Senate 
     bill that would make this impossible? 
     Mr. Sonnenreich.  No.  Under the existing law 
     originally the Congress was going to write in a 
     specific exemption but it was then decided that it 
     would be handled by regulation and we intend to do it 
     the same way under this law. 
     Mr. Satterfield.  Thank you.  I have no other 
     questions.

II.  THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH IS A BONA FIDE RELIGION 
     AND MARIJUANA IS CENTRAL TO ITS WORSHIP 

     The EZCC, which traces its origins back 6,000 years, is 

headquartered in Jamaica. [footnote 40]  By the end of the Sixties, the 

Church had received a number of visitors from the U.S. and began allowing 

Caucasians to join the Church. [fotnote 41]  As a result, priests and 

members of the Church began to travel back and forth between the U.S. and 

Jamaica, and a number of U.S. citizens became members and priests in the 

Church. [footnote 42]  The Church was incorporated in 1976 and purchased 

a 1,000 acre farm in White Horse, St Thomas parish, Jamaica. [footnote 

43]  In addition, the Church purchased a residence for its members at 

Star Island in Miami, Florida. [footnote 44] 

     Church members consider themselves the historical and spiritual 

descendants of the Israelites of the Old Testament. [footnote 45]

Because of the constraints of slavery, however, the Church's written 

history did not evolve and does not compare with the organizational 

identity enjoyed by some Caucasian religions. [footnote 46]  Nonetheless, 

the Church is understood to be a Christian religion with Jesus as its 

primary prophet. [footnote 47]  The Church reveres the Bible as its holy 

book, and members adhere to traditions set forth in the Old Testament 

regarding diet, dress, grooming, sexual conduct, and so forth. [footnote

     &quot;The Church historically has been extremely restrictive in its 

membership practices, limiting membership to those men and women who 

demonstrate an acceptance and adherence to the Church's tenets over a 

significant period of time.&quot; [footnote 49]  If members fail to follow the 

Church's rules of conduct, they are subject to harsh

sanctions and sometimes expulsion. [footnote 50] 

     The EZCC traces its use of marijuana [footnote 51] to the Bible, 

citing passages regarding herbs, smoke, and clouds, [footnote 52] and 

stating that 

     &quot;marijuana is the [e)ucharistic spiritual body and 
     blood of Christ,&quot; and &quot;[o]nly through the sacramental 
     use of marijuana--combined with prayer and spiritual 
     reasoning among the brethren--can members of the Church 
     come to know God within themselves and within 
     others.&quot; [footnote 53] 

The non-drug use of marijuana is allowed at any point during the day, but 

is most commonly ingested during the three daily prayer

     [footnote 51]  The EZCC's longstanding religious tradition of 
marijuana ingestion may have a history that dates back further than the 
Native American use of peyote.  Some authors postulate that many Indian 
religions did not incorporate the peyote ritual into their religious 
practices until the 1920s and 30s.  See A. Marriott, supra note 9, at 78-
79; see also Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, at 34 (citing W. La 
Barre, The Peyote Cult 110-23 (4th ed. 1975)). 

     [footnote 52]  Id. at 14.  The EZCC has compiled works of 
scholarship and ancient references which substantiate and detail the 
religious use of marijuana from time immemorial.  See Amicus Memorandum 
Before DEA, July 1988, App. 6.  For instance, The Book of Grass 11-12 (G.  
Andrews &amp; S. Vinkenoog ed. 1967), is cited for a passage on ancient 
Scythia and Iran by Mircea Eliade: 
     only one document appears to indicate the existence of 
     a Getic shamanism: It is Strabols account of the 
     Mysian KAPNOBATAI, a name that has been translated, by 
     analogy with Aristophanes' AEROBATES, as 'those who 
     walk in clouds', but which should be translated as 
     'those who walk in smoke'.  Presumably the smoke is 
     hemp smoke, a rudimentary means of ecstasy known to 
     both the Thracians and the Scythians....&quot; 
Amicus Memorandum Before DEA, July 1988, App. 6 at 6-7.  The EZCC

smoke taken in or hold smoke in their lungs for long periods of time. 

[footnote 55]  Church members state that their ingestion of marijuana 

during worship does not result in any side-effects [footnote 56] or 

intoxication, nor is that a desirable goal. 

     The Church not only does not encourage but in fact 
     absolutely forbids the recreational use of marijuana 
     for the purpose of achieving intoxification.  The 
     Church believes that such intentional misuse of 
     marijuana, by members or nonmembers, constitutes 
     sacrilegious behavior.  Church members are strictly 
     prohibited from using any intoxication or addictive 
     substance--legal or illegal-- for recreational

marijuana on church members.  See Research Report by Brian L. Weiss,

marijuana in high doses for sixteen hours a day for up to fifty years,

     There has never been more than between 100 and 200 EZCC members in

III. THE ETHIOPIAN ZION COPTIC CHURCH REPEATEDLY PETITIONS BUT IS 
     DENIED A SACRAMENTAL DRUG EXEMPTION SIMILAR TO THAT 
     ACCORDED TO THE NATIVE AMERICAN CHURCH 

     A.  Olsen Proceeds Pro Se 

     From 1983 to 1985, Carl Eric Olsen, a member and priest of the EZCC, 

had repeated unilateral communications with the DEA attempting to procure 

for his Church a drug law exemption for the sacramental ingestion of 

marijuana. [footnote 61]  It was not until the

     SPECIAL EXEMPT CHURCH.  Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church. 
     The listing of marijuana as a controlled substance in 
     Schedule I does not apply to the non-drug use of 
     marijuana in bona fide religious ceremonies of the 
     Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church and members of the 
     Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church so using marijuana are 
     exempt from registration.  Any person who manufactures 
     marijuana for or distributes marijuana to the Ethiopian 
     Zion Coptic Church, however, is required to obtain

District of Columbia federal district court issued a show cause order to 

the DEA in response to Olsen's writ of mandamus filed in 1986, that the 

DEA finally responded. [footnote 62]  John C. Lawn, the DEA 

Administrator, answered Olsen's requests in the form of a three paragraph 

letter which stated in part: 

          In 1984, an estimated 7,800 to 9,200 metric tons 
     of marijuana were illegally consumed in the United 
     States.  It has been estimated that over 20 million 
     people in the United States use marijuana on a regular 
     basis.  Marijuana abuse is a major public health 
     problem in this country.  Accordingly, the 
     investigation and prosecution of marijuana traffickers, 
     the interdiction of marijuana smuggling and the 
     eradication of the drug at its source continue to be 
     major concerns of drug law enforcement both 
     domestically and internationally. 

          In view of the immensity of the marijuana abuse 
     problem in the United States and the magnitude of the 
     criminal activity surrounding the production and 
     trafficking in this substance, the Administrator of the 
     Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that the 
     interest of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church in the 
     ceremonial use of marijuana is outweighed by the 
     compelling governmental interest in controlling the use 
     and illegal distribution of marijuana in the United 
     States. [footnote 63] 

     The district court dismissed Olsen's mandamus petition as moot; 

appealing the dismissal, Olsen stated, &quot;The DEA gave no reasons at all 

for denying the exemption, the DEA only gave 
_______________ 

     registration annually and to comply with all other 
     requirements of law. 
Id.  App. 13, 16, 18. 

     [footnote 62]  Id. App. 2-4.  Olsen also had filed a mandamus 
petition in the Eleventh Circuit.  Olsen v. DEA, 776 F.2d 267 (llth Cir. 
1985) (affirming district court's denial of olsen's request for a 
mandamus to compel DEA to respond to petitions for marijuana exemption 
because the statute authorizing exemptions does not provide for a 
religious exemption).

reasons for denying marijuana use to the general public. [footnote 64] 

Olsen also appealed the DEA's denial, admitting that the DEA had a 

compelling interest in the overall enforcement of the CSA, but arguing 

that the exemption granted to the NAC had not undermined that interest 

nor would a limited exemption for the EZCC. [footnote 65]  Olsen pointed 

out that the DEA previously denied a peyote exemption to the Church of 

the Awakening (&quot;CotA&quot;), after finding that the CotA was not similar to 

the NAC because &quot;peyote is essential and central to the [NAC] religion in 

that without peyote their religion would not and could not exist.&quot; 

[footnote 66]  The DEA made no such findings regarding the EZCC denial. 

[footnote 67] 

     In its response, the government set forth the three-part test from 

United States v. Lee, [footnote 68] for establishing a free exercise 

claim [footnote 69] and cited various free exercise cases. [footnote 70]

decision to the Ninth Circuit.  Kennedy v. BNDD, 459 F.2d 415 (9th Cir. 
1972) (ruling that statute granting the peyote exemption only to NAC was 
unconstitutional but nonetheless holding that extending the exemption to 
the CotA would not cure the defect, thus, the exemption for the CotA was 
denied), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1115 (1973).

inquires: 1) whether the challenged law interferes with the free exercise 
of religion; 2) whether the challenged law is essential to accomplish an 
overriding governmental objective; and 3) whether accommodating the 
religious practice would unduly interfere with fulfillment of the 
governmental interest. 455

Admittedly, the federal and state peyote exemptions tend to negate the 

existence of a compelling government interest in prohibiting its non-drug 

use in bona fide religious worship. [footnote 71]  Thus, the government 

tried to distinguish the NAC, stating that Congressional testimony 

presented by the director of the BNDD during the CSA hearings indicated 

that the NAC was considered 

     sui generis.  The history and tradition of the church 
     is such that there is no question but that they regard 
     peyote as a deity. [footnote 72] 

By contrast, the EZCC &quot;does not have such a Congressional recognition of 

its status.&quot; [footnote 73] 

     Olsen replied with a discussion of the key case regarding the 

sacramental use of marijuana, Leary v. United States. [footnote 74] 

Timothy Leary and his daughter were found in possession of marijuana upon 

their re-entry into this country by car from Mexico. [footnote 75] 

Raising a free exercise defense, Leary argued that he was part of the 

Hindu sect of Brahmakrishna and that &quot;the experience [I find) through the

stated that he was partially able to achieve and practice his religious 

beliefs in the religious sect without the use of marijuana. [footnote 77] 

Leary admitted that if he could not use marijuana, it would not affect 

his religious beliefs. [footnote 78]  The court held that the laws 

regulating marijuana serve a compelling governmental interest in avoiding 

a &quot;substantial threat to public safety, peace or order.&quot; [footnote 79] 

     Examining the NAC exemption, the court reviewed two California 

cases. [footnote 80]  In People v. Woody, the state court found a free 

exercise right to use peyote for NAC members who had been arrested during 

a ceremony, [footnote 81] and in In re Grady, the state court held that a 

peyote preacher could offer a first amendment defense to prosecution for 

possession of peyote. [footnote 81]  The Leary court found that unlike

Leary court continued: 

     The exemption accorded the use of peyote in the limited 
     bona fide religious ceremonies of the relatively small, 
     unknown Native American Church is clearly 
     distinguishable from the private and personal use of 
     marijuana by any person who claims he is using it as a 
     religious practice. [footnote 84] 

     B.  Amicus is Appointed to Represent Olsen 

     The Court of Appeals appointed amicus curiae for Olsen. [footnote 

85]  Amicus filed a brief discussing other marijuana exemptions extended 

by the federal government. [footnote 86]  Since the late 1960s, the 

government has been involved in growing, processing, and distributing 

marijuana to registered persons and entities. [footnote 87]  That program 

is administered by the National institute on Drug Abuse (&quot;NIDA&quot;), which 

has contracted with the University of Mississippi to grow marijuana; NIDA

A number of marijuana exemptions have been issued to state governments 

which supervise local distribution of NIDA marijuana primarily for use in 

programs to lessen the negative side-effects of chemotherapy and to treat 

glaucoma. [footnote 89]  In the years between 1978 and 1987, NIDA has 

authorized and overseen the distribution of 477,507 cigarettes for human 

consumption. [footnote 90]  &quot;(Clearly,] some limited level of marijuana 

use is not inconsistent with the government's&quot; goals. [footnote 91] 

     C.  Remand to the DEA 

     The government petitioned the court of appeals to remand the case to 

the DEA so that it could &quot;explain more fully the basis for its 

dDecision.&quot; [footnote 92]  The court denied the motion; then, changing 

its mind six days later, the court issued an order remanding the case to 

the DEA. [footnote 93]

the DEA wherein Olsen withdrew the language of his prior exemption 

[footnote 94] and proposed the following exemption: 

     1.  [EZCC] members would be restricted to using 
     marijuana during their Saturday evening prayer 
     ceremony, which lasts from 8:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m.; 

     2.  During that ceremony, and for the eight hours 
     following that ceremony, Church members would not leave 
     the place where the ceremony is conducted; they would 
     not drive automobiles or otherwise go out in public; 

     3.  Ingestion of marijuana would be limited to Church 
     members who had reached the age of majority, according 
     to the laws of the state in which the ceremony takes 
     place; and 

     4.  Ingestion of marijuana would be limited to full 
     Church members who had undergone the confession 
     ritual [footnote 95] for entering the Church's 
     community. [footnote 96] 

     Turning to the substantive arguments, Amicus stated that contrary to 

the position espoused by the government, the legislative history of the 

American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 (&quot;AIRFA&quot;), [footnote 97] 

did not support the argument that Congress

response, the Senate redrafted its resolution to make &quot;absolutely clear 

that AIRFA directed government agencies simply to ensure that Indian 

religions enjoyed the same guarantee of 'freedom of religion for all 

people' that is required by the First Amendment.&quot; [footnote 100]  When 

the Department of Justice informed the administration that it did not 

object to the President's signing of AIRFA, it made specific mention of 

the fact that Congress had incorporated the Department of Justice's 

position that a preference for Native American religions could not be 

extended without violating the establishment clause. [footnote 101] 

Furthermore, DEA attorneys concurred in the remarks made by the Justice 

Department, writing, in a memo commenting on the Justice Department's 

position, that &quot;no line can be drawn between religions claiming a bona 

fide use of drugs.&quot; [footnote 102]  In 1981, the office of Legal Counsel 

(&quot;OLC&quot;), published a memorandum opinion for the Chief Counsel of the DEA, 

stating that &quot;Indian religion cannot be treated differently than other 

religions similarly situated without violation of the Establishment 

Clause.&quot; [footnote 97]

     An exemption for Indian religious use of peyote would

     The government responded to Olsen's proposed EZCC exemption 

by stating that: 

     such restrictions could not be monitored or enforced 
     without significant intrusion by the Government into 
     the religious practices of the Church.  The monitoring 
     of such restrictions would be extremely burdensome on 
     an agency which is charged with enforcement of a very 
     comprehensive drug law. [footnote 107] 

     D.  The DEA Denies the Exemption 

     In a nine page decision, John Lawn denied the EZCC an exemption for 

the religious use of marijuana. [footnote 108]  Citing Leary, [footnote 

109] in addition to other cases, [footnote 110] the Administrator 

asserted that the EZCC had no free exercise right to use marijuana; 

moreover, it did not enjoy an &quot;equal protection&quot; right to an exemption 

because the EZCC &quot;advocates the continuous use of marijuana or 'ganja', 

while the Native American Church's use of

peyote is isolated to specific ceremonial occasions.&quot; [footnote 111]  The 

Administrator further distinguished marijuana from peyote stating that 

&quot;the actual abuse and availability of marijuana in the United States is 

many times more pervasive in American society than that of peyote.&quot; 

[footnote 112]  Substantiating this claim, the Administrator stated that 

between 1980 and 1987, the DEA seized 19.4 pounds of peyote as compared 

to 15,302,468.7 pounds of marijuana. [footnote 113] 

     This overwhelming difference explains why an 
     accommodation can be made for a religious organization 
     which uses peyote in circumscribed ceremonies, and not 
     for a religion which espouses continual use of 
     marijuana.  The Administrator also notes that Mr. 
     Olsen's conviction in United States v. Rush involved 
     the illegal importation of 20 tons of marijuana....  If 
     Mr. Olsen's assertions that the Ethiopian Zion Coptic 
     Church in the United States has never had, &quot;more than 
     between 100 and 200 members in this country,&quot; 20 tons 
     of marijuana would be an outrageous quantity to supply 
     their religious needs. [footnote 114] 

     Specifically addressing olsen's proposed exemption, the 

Administrator determined that the large quantity of marijuana in this 

country would make monitoring compliance very difficult and would make 

accommodation impractical. [footnote 115]  Olsen challenged the

     E.  The Court of Appeals Denies the Exemption 

     1.  The Majority 

     In June of 1989, the court of appeals, over a strongly worded 

dissent by Judge Buckley, denied Olsen both a free exercise right and an 

&quot;equal protection-establishment clause&quot; right to a religious-use 

exemption. [footnote 117]  Regarding Olsen's proposal, the majority found 

that because EZCC members were allowed to use marijuana &quot;every day 

throughout the day,&quot; the proposal would not be &quot;self-enforcing&quot; and would 

require &quot;burdensome and constant official supervision and management.&quot;

the sacramental use of marijuana in the past, the court noted that the

accommodation posed a significant health risk.  In a subsequent letter to

The sharp contrast between the NAC and the EZCC was further evidenced by 

Olsen's statement that marijuana is smoked continually &quot;through

DEA's explanation fell &quot;far short&quot; of meeting the strict scrutiny 

standard. [footnote 128] 

     In fact, Judge Buckley found the DEA's reasoning to be extremely 

superficial in light of the Supreme Court decision of Larson v. Valente. 

[footnote 129]  In Larson, religious denominations in Minnesota receiving 

more than fifty percent of their funds from members and affiliated 

organizations were not required to comply with registration and reporting

Minnesota's well reasoned

in view of the denominational preference, the majority relied on an equal 
protection analysis.  Id. at 1463-64 &amp; n.5.  The majority cited Walz v. 
Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 694, 696 (1970), for this proposition and Judge 
Buckley acknowledged that this analysis had been mentioned in a 
concurring opinion by Justice Frankfurter in Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 
U.S. 67, 70 (1953).  878 F.2d at 1463 n.5, 1468.  However, both of these 
cases involved laws which applied equally to all religions.  The Walz 
Court examined the New York tax exemption law for religious, educational, 
or charitable uses, 397 U.S. at 666-67, while the Court in Fowler 
reviewed the constitutionality of a law that prohibited all religious 
meetings in any public park in Rhode Island.  345 U.S. at 67.  The Larson 
Court found this distinction critical, stating that the Lemon test 
applied to &quot;laws affording a uniform benefit to all religions,&quot; while a 
law that discriminates among religions must &quot;be invalidated unless it is 
justified by a compelling governmental interest and unless it is closely 
fitted to further that interest.&quot;  Larson, 456 U.S. at 246-47, 252

explanations as to how its registration and reporting exemption was 

closely fitted to furthering a compelling state interest. [footnote 131] 

While the Supreme Court agreed that Minnesota had a compelling state 

interest in protecting its citizens from abusive solicitation practices, 

it found that Minnesota had not demonstrated that the exemption was 

necessary to further that interest nor that the exemption was closely 

fitted to furthering the interest. [footnote 132]  Finding that the 

statutory exemption failed to pass a strict scrutiny analysis, the 

Supreme Court extended it to the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, 

holding that any bona fide religion would qualify for the exemption. 

[footnote 133] 

     Addressing the DEA's argument that the two religions warranted 

different treatment because of: 1) their differing sacramental drug use 

rituals; and 2) the different law enforcement problems vis a vis the two 

drugs, Judge Buckley asserted that Olsen's proposed exemption effectively 

eliminated the first distinction. [footnote 134]  Additionally, Judge 

Buckley challenged the DEA's argument that the abuse and availability of 

marijuana justified the disparate treatment:

that even if it were to find an establishment clause violation, it was 
not certain that extension rather than invalidation of the exemption was 
proper.  878 F.2d at 1464.  Judge Buckley retorted that such indecision 
could not excuse the court from properly reviewing an underinclusive 
statute.  Id. at 1471.

     The government's interest in preventing abuse of a 
     given drug is not proportional to the drug's 
     prevalence.  By classifying both marijuana and peyote 
     as Schedule I controlled substances, Congress has 
     determined that the federal government has a compelling 
     interest in preventing the illegal distribution and use 
     of both drugs. [footnote 135] 

     Noting that the DEA had no difficulty monitoring compliance of more 

than 250,000 members of the NAC, Judge Buckley questioned the DEA's lack 

of solid reasoning why monitoring compliance of one-hundred to two-

hundred EZCC members would be so impossible. [footnote 136]  Indeed, the 

exemption would place no restrictions on the DEA's normal enforcement 

operations other than at the church for a limited number of hours once a 

week. [footnote 137]  Judge Buckley stated that he would remand the case 

to the DEA so that it could more adequately review and address Olsen's 

establishment claim. [footnote 138]

IV.  THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION 

     The establishment clause prohibits both the state and federal 

government from passing laws which prefer one religion over another. 

[footnote 141]  Whether one adheres to the &quot;broad&quot; interpretation of the 

establishment clause or the &quot;narrower&quot; interpretation, all scholars agree 

that the establishment clause was meant by the framers to prevent the 

government from bestowing a preference on one religion; [footnote 142] 

and, as such, to protect the &quot;small, new, or unpopular denominations&quot; 

[footnote 143] from &quot;subtle departures from neutrality, 'religious 

gerrymanders,' as well as

&quot;denominational preference&quot; is conferred by governmental action.  Amicus 
Certiorari Petition, Dec. 13, 1989, at 9-14 (citing Larson v. Valente, 
456 U.S. 228 (1982)).  Moreover, Amicus argued that confusion surrounding 
the definition of &quot;denominational preference&quot; was arising, and courts 
needed guidance on when strict scrutiny should be applied.  Id. at 15-22. 
     In response, the government asserted that no free exercise, 
establishment, or equal protection rights had been violated because 
&quot;DEA's exemption for religious peyote use in 21 C.F.R. &#167; 1307.31 applies 
equally to all bona fide religious groups.&quot;  Respondent's Opposition To 
Petition For Writ Of Certiorari, Feb. 1990, at 9.  As a result, no 
denominational preference was created and the Lemon test as opposed to 
strict scrutiny was applicable.  Id. at 10.  Moreover, the government 
argued that the DEA's &quot;considered professional judgment&quot; concerning the 
burden of monitoring the exemption should not be questioned.  Id. at 12. 

     [footnote 141]  Everson v Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15 (1946).  
Before the fourteenth amendment was passed, some states persisted in 
discriminating against particular religions.  Id. at 13-14 &amp; n.17. In 
North Carolina, test provisions required that officeholders believe in 
the Protestant religion, and Maryland permitted taxation for the support 
of Christian religion and limited civil office to Christians.  Id. at 14

obvious abuses. [footnote 144]  The EZCC is small, new to this country, 

and unpopular. [footnote 145]  As a result, the EZCC has been denied even 

the narrowest exemption for its sacrament while the NAC enjoys an 

unlimited exemption for peyote. 

     A.  Comparing The Two Exemptions 

     The majority stated that Olsen had proposed an exemption identical 

to the one accorded to the NAC. [footnote 146]  This is not true. 

Olsen's proposed exemption is very narrow, restricting the sacramental 

use of marijuana to three hours, one day per week. [footnote 147]  The 

exemption states that once the three hour worship service has finished, 

members may not leave the place where the ceremony was conducted for 

eight additional hours.  The exemption specifically prohibits members 

from driving or going out in public during that post-worship period. 

Only EZCC members who are of the age of majority may participate in the 

service and &quot;membership&quot; is

(citations omitted). 

     [footnote 145]  The total denial of an exemption to the EZCC has had 
tragic results for the members.  The EZCC has publicly stated: 
     Through ... the police force, the church has been 
     severely harassed, victimized and discriminated 
     against.  Our members have passed through several acts 
     of police brutality, our legal properties maliciously 
     destroyed, members falsely imprisoned, divine services 
     broken up, and all these atrocities performed upon the 
     Church, under the name of political laws and their 
     justice. 
1 The Coptic World, Dec. 19, 1987, at 8.  As the Court in Larson 
explained, the free exercise clause and the establishment clause work in 
close conjunction, the guarantees of one reinforcing the guarantees of 
the other.  Larson, 456 U.S. at 244-45.

strictly construed. [footnote 148] 

     While the majority described the NAC exemption as &quot;tightly-cabined,&quot; 

[footnote 149] nothing could be further from the truth.  The NAC 

exemption is unlimited; it states that &quot;Schedule I does not apply to the 

nondrug use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native 

American Church.&quot; [footnote 150]  The only benefit strictly limited to 

&quot;members&quot; is a waiver of the registration requirement if the member 

manufactures or distributes peyote to the NAC. [footnote 151]  Other than 

that, the exemption does not limit participation in the peyote ceremony 

to church members or people of majority, nor does it restrict driving or 

even suggest a detoxification period.  Given the lack of any consensus on 

the meaning of &quot;Native American Church,&quot; either among Native Americans or 

by those outside of the Church, and the widely diverging views on how the 

religious ceremony is to be conducted, [footnote 152] the peyote 

exemption is very broad, indeed. 

     The majority was quite concerned with how rigidly membership was 

enforced in the EZCC and whether membership was required before one was 

allowed to participate in the sacrament. [footnote 153]  But the majority 

failed to note that the NAC exemption is not limited

there any consensus within the NAC as to what even constitutes a member. 

[footnote 154] 

     B.  Comparing the Law Enforcement Problems 

     The majority stated that it based its &quot;decision on the immensity of 

the marijuana control problem.&quot; [footnote 155]  But under a strict 

scrutiny analysis, this statement becomes less persuasive. [footnote 156] 

Thirty-three states have enacted some type of legislation which 

recognizes that marijuana has valid medicinal uses. [footnote 157]  These 

states have not found that an immense &quot;marijuana control problem&quot; 

presents any barrier to creating limited marijuana exemptions.  In light 

of the fact that the federal

government dispenses marijuana for medical uses, [footnote 158] and that 

five people in America have federal permission to use marijuana to help 

with chronic ailments, [footnote 159] the arguments that marijuana poses 

serious health risks and has no acceptable safety use are highly suspect. 

[footnote 160]  Moreover, the majority accepted without question the DEA 

data about abuse, availability, and demand instead of examining marijuana 

in terms of current trends. 

     The DEA set forth statistics regarding the amounts of marijuana 

seized between 1980-1987. [footnote 161]  Yet a breakdown of these 

statistics year by year establishes that the use of marijuana has been 

steadily decreasing since 1979.  Many people assert that both production 

and consumption of marijuana in the country is on the decrease, [footnote

monitoring burden the DEA states would accompany the EZCC exemption.  In 

addition, it simply defies logic that a church with a membership of 

250,000 to 300,000 people would be easier to monitor than a church with a 

membership of one-hundred to two-hundred people.  Olsen agreed to provide 

a list of member names and places of worship.  Under the NAC exemption, 

however, the DEA has no idea where or when ceremonies will take place or 

who will be participating.  This would appear to make monitoring 

exponentially more difficult.  Nonetheless, monitoring the NAC exemption, 

apparently, has not imposed a burden on the DEA.  Nor does it seem likely 

that monitoring the limited EZCC exemption would be significant. 

     C.  Comparing the Churches' Rituals 

     The NAC ritual which involves an all night service perhaps once a 

week, [footnote 168] is more acceptable in the court's view than the EZCC 

ritual which traditionally is a daily observance.  The majority's concern 

about the EZCC's regular use of its sacrament seems to state a clear 

preference for religions that engage sparingly in the use of their 

sacrament. [footnote 169]  The Catholic Church offers the holy sacrament 

for ingestion at every worship service (mass), and members are free to 

engage in worship on a daily

basis, if not more. [footnote 170]  On the other hand, many Protestant 

denominations offer the holy sacrament once a month, or less. [footnote 

171]  Speaking in terms of one's religious tradition, how often one 

partakes of holy communion should not be a basis upon which one church 

receives an exemption and another church does not.  The EZCC ritual is 

more akin to the lifestyle of a religious order living in community where 

communion might be celebrated at various times throughout the day.  The 

majority found it significant that EZCC members were allowed to ingest 

their sacrament outside of the confines of the church facility.

[footnote 172]  This concern again seems to be placing an unfair premium 

on certain types of rituals.  The Protestant and Catholic Churches of 

America celebrate and distribute their sacrament in shopping malls, 

[footnote 173] parking lots, [footnote 174] buses, [footnote 175] 

hospitals, [footnote 176] parks, [footnote 177] homes; [footnote 178] in

the sacrament cannot be celebrated.  Furthermore, finding it significant 

that ingestion of the sacrament be limited to the confines of a &quot;church 

facility&quot; appears suspect when it is not at all clear that the NAC even 

has the functional equivalent of a &quot;church facility.&quot; [footnote 179] 

     The majority dispensed with Olsen's proposed exemption by stating 

that &quot;'narrow' use, concededly, is not his religion's tradition.&quot; 

[footnote 180]  The court cannot in good faith use the tradition of the 

EZCC as a basis for suggesting that the exemption will not be adhered to. 

Whether an exemption tracks a religious tradition or not is irrelevant, 

has never been the law, and should not be used to circumvent a religious 

group's proposal to compromise.  Accepting the EZCC's offer to modify its 

traditions rather than resorting to total ban on the religion's sacrament 

would seem to serve the government's best interest.  Given the choice 

between an unlimited drug exemption for a church which is loosely knit 

together with few checks on behavior [footnote 181] and a narrowly drawn 

exemption which incorporates many checks on behavior for a church that 

nonetheless has not traditionally restricted its sacrament, the latter 

seems preferable.

     The majority noted &quot;further distinctions&quot; between the rituals of the 

two religions: 

     1) the peyote exemption was accorded for a traditional, 
     precisely circumscribed ritual; 

     2) peyote is an object of worship; 

     3) for the NAC, use of peyote outside of the ritual is 
     sacrilegious; and 

     4) the NAC, for all practical purposes, &quot;reinforces&quot; 
     the state's prohibition. [footnote 182] 

First, marijuana is a traditional ritual for the EZCC. [footnote 183] 

Moreover, the NAC's &quot;precisely circumscribed ritual&quot; lasts at least 

twelve hours, while the EZCC proposal would limit the service to three 

hours. [footnote 184]  The peyote ceremony has myriad manifestations, and 

there is no prohibition on how often one might participate in a NAC 

ceremony--while Olsen has limited participation in the EZCC sacrament to 

one night per week, and it is always the same night. [footnote 185] 

Second, the DEA has conceded in its briefs that marijuana for the EZCC is 

an object of worship. [footnote 186]  Third, for the EZCC, use of 

marijuana outside of the ritual is sacrilegious: &quot;The

Church believes that [recreational use] of marijuana, by members or 

nonmembers, constitutes sacrilegious behavior.&quot; [footnote 187]  Even 

during the ceremony, those ingesting marijuana do not inhale the smoke 

into their lungs; they avoid its intoxicating effects by taking it into 

their mouths and exhaling it from their noses.&quot; [footnote 188]  Finally, 

the EZCC religion, for all practical purposes, reinforces the state's 

prohibitions.  The members of the EZCC do not approve of drug abuse in 

any form, and alcohol is strictly forbidden.&quot; [footnote 189]  Indeed, all 

aspects of conduct are strictly regulated by a literal interpretation of 

the Old Testament. [footnote 190]  Thus, the differences noted by the 

majority are instead distinct similarities between the two churches. 

     D.  Comparison of the Drugs 

     Both peyote and marijuana are Schedule I drugs which means that they 

both: 1) have a high potential for abuse; 2) have no currently accepted 

medical use in treatment; and 3) lack of accepted safety for use under 

medical supervision. [footnote 191]  The only argument that can be made 

that these drugs are not similarly situated in terms of the government's 

definition regarding dangerous drugs, is that marijuana does not even 

meet the second

Native American culture, including the native religion, is federal

romantic affinity for the Native Americans is clear and is explicitly 

understood to be part of Congress' agenda: 

     [T]he country is now sympathetic to the cultural needs

It is not inappropriate to suggest that a church originating in Africa, 

coming to America via Jamaica would meet with much less sympathy. 

Indeed, the EZCC denial may stem from racial animus where the general 

perception equates blacks with drugs and crime. [footnote 200]  Moreover, 

the specter of xenophobia cannot be dismissed.  If Native Americans have 

a much higher level of political and popular support, this is exactly the

clause. [footnote 201] 

V.   CONCLUSION 

     Congress and the DEA have accorded a sacramental drug exemption to 

Native Americans regarding peyote. [footnote 202]  The EZCC has tried for 

years to obtain a similar exemption regarding marijuana. [footnote 203] 

This past June, the Supreme Court denied certiorari to the District of 

Columbia Court of Appeals decision denying the EZCC a sacramental drug 

exemption similar to that held by the NAC. [footnote 204] 

     The court of appeals decision to deny an exemption to the EZCC 

violates the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. [footnote 

205]  The court's reliance on the DEA's statement that it has greater law 

enforcement control problems with marijuana will not satisfy an 

application of strict scrutiny.  The DEA must explain why a very narrow 

exemption extended to one-hundred to two-hundred people would undermine 

its interest in preventing drug abuse when an unlimited exemption for 

peyote extended to 300,000 to 400,000 people does not. [footnote 206] 

Additionally, there must be a forthright analysis of the current trends 

regarding the public's abuse of marijuana and the growing body of

information concerning marijuana's use for medicinal purposes. [footnote 

207] 

     The court set forth various aspects of the NAC which made it 

particularly well suited for an exemption, and then failed to recognize 

that the EZCC has demonstrated significant similarity to the NAC 

regarding these aspects. [footnote 208]  For example, the EZCC views the 

recreational use of its sacrament as sacrilegious, has much stricter 

controls on its membership, and regards marijuana as a deity as does the 

NAC concerning peyote. [footnote 209]  Additionally, as a result of its 

proposed exemption, the EZCC would exercise much greater control over its 

ceremony than the NAC. [footnote 210] 

     The EZCC is being denied a benefit accorded to another church 

because of its ritual, its traditions, because it is not indigenous, and 

because of the abuse of its sacrament by others.  The EZCC has proposed 

to modify its tradition and ritual, to adhere to practices which are much 

more restrictive than those of the NAC, and to help with monitoring 

problems, to no avail. [footnote 211]  The reasons for the denial appear 

to flow from the fact that the EZCC is a relatively new religion to this 

country, of black origins, small, and unpopular. [footnote 212]  The 

establishment clause was specifically written to protect these very types 

of religions

<BR><DD>On May 25, 1994, an indictment by The Riverside County Grand
Jury was filed charging appellant with transporting, importing, selling,
furnishing, giving away, or offering to transport, import, sell, furnish,
administer, give away or attempting to import or transport more than 28.5
grams of marijuana.&nbsp; (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11360, subd. (a); count one.)&nbsp; Appellant was also charged with possession of marijuana for sale.&nbsp; (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11359; count two.)&nbsp; (CT 1-2.)
<DD>On April 11, 1995, appellant waived jury trial and proceeded by way of a court trial.&nbsp; (CF 219.)&nbsp; On May 19, appellant was found guilty on both counts.&nbsp; (CT 266.)
<DD>On July 10, 1995, appellant was granted five years probation.&nbsp; Among the terms and conditions of probation imposed, appellant was required to serve 240 days in jail, not to possess or use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed, and not to associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances.&nbsp; (CT 271.)&nbsp; That same day, appellant filed his notice of appeal.&nbsp; (CT 273A.)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B><U><A NAME="FACTS">STATEMENT OF FACTS</A></U></B></CENTER><BR>
<DD>On March 27, 1994, appellant was driving his BMW through the Temecula
border patrol checkpoint when he was stopped at the primary inspection
area.&nbsp; (CT 19-26<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#1"><U>1</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>.)&nbsp; Appellant's BMW was directed to the secondary inspection area where a canine sniff was conducted.&nbsp; (CT 19-21.)&nbsp; The dog alerted to the presence of contraband.&nbsp; (CT 22.)
<DD>Appellant initially refused to provide the border patrol agents the keys to his trunk, but then relented.&nbsp; (CT 23.)&nbsp; Inside the trunk, the agents found two duffle bags containing a total of 40 one-pound packages of marijuana.&nbsp; (CT 23-24.)
<DD>Appellant told the agents he was coming front the Alpine area of San Diego County.&nbsp; (CT 26.)&nbsp; Rolling papers were found on appellant's person, and $2,350 was found under the dashcover inside the BMW.&nbsp; (CT 27, 39.)&nbsp; After appellant was given his <I>Miranda</I><SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#2"><U>2</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL> rights, he spontaneously told Joel Ontiveros, a sheriff's investigator, that the passenger in his car, Bret Corey Mixcel, wasn't involved with the &quot;stuff&quot; in his car, that it was all &quot;my stuff [i.e., appellant's].&quot; (CT 30, 35, 37, 41.)
<DD>Sheriff's Investigator Ontiveros provided his expert opinion based on his training and experience that the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was Mexican grown and was possessed for purposes of selling. (CT 41-42.)&nbsp; He estimated the wholesale value of the marijuana to be $40,000 and the retail value at $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars.&nbsp; (CT 43.)&nbsp; It was important to Ontiveros' opinion about appellant possessing the marijuana for sale that the marijuana was broken down into one-pound increments which makes re-sale easier.&nbsp; (CT 43-44.)
<DD>Appellant testified he is a priest of the Israel Zion Coptic Church; there are only 24 members of this church in the entire state of Wisconsin and they are the members of appellant's family and the family of his friend,
Michael Matteson.&nbsp; (RT 319-320, 326-327; CT 71, 114<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#3"><U>3</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>.)&nbsp; His church is incorporated in the state of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (CT 71, 114.)&nbsp; Appellant estimated the total membership of the Israel Zion Coptic Church from Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina and elsewhere (including men, women and children) as between 200-250 members.&nbsp; (CT 74.)&nbsp; The Israel Zion Coptic Church is an offshoot of the Rastafarian
movement and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; (RT 334-342; CT 84.)&nbsp; The Israel Zion Coptic's doctrine incorporates the use of marijuana (referred to as &quot;ganja&quot;) as a sacrament used during religious services and gatherings.&nbsp; (CT 71-73, 114.)
<DD>Appellant was arrested in 1987 in Wisconsin for growing marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 392-393.)&nbsp; One of the conditions of his probation in Wisconsin was not to grow marijuana anymore.&nbsp; (RT 393-393.)&nbsp; Because of this probation condition, appellant decided to travel to San Diego to purchase
marijuana for the church's use.&nbsp; (RT 391-394.)&nbsp; About $30,000 was collected between appellant and two friends from Iowa to make the purchase.&nbsp; (RT 391, 349.)&nbsp; Appellant drove to San Diego and purchased the 40 pounds of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 400-402.)&nbsp; He was stopped at the Temecula checkpoint while driving back to Wisconsin.<SMALL><SUP><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#4"><U>4</U></A>/</SUP></SMALL>

<B>SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS APPELLANT'S CONVICTION ON COUNT TWO, POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA FOR SALE</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant argues there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on count two, possession of marijuana for sale, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11359.&nbsp; (AOB 5.)&nbsp; More specifically, appellant argues the evidence did not show he intended to sell the marijuana, but only to give it away as a sacrament in his church.&nbsp; (AOB 5.)&nbsp; Appellant's argument should be rejected for at least four reasons: (1) "sale" includes "non-cash benefits" and appellant was seeking to obtain the non-cash benefit of new adherents to his church in exchange for giving them marijuana; (2) appellant through his own testimony revealed he was to receive an additional amount of marijuana in-kind for his actions of purchasing and delivering these pounds of marijuana; (3) appellant has failed to rebut the inference, created by virtue of the large amount of marijuana he possessed, that the marijuana was possessed for sale; and (4) circumstantial evidence (regarding packaging, and appellant's possession of $2,350 in cash) led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to state his expert opinion that appellant possessed the marijuana for purposes of sale.
<DD>In considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the
appellate court must review the record in the light most favorable to the
judgment below to determine whether the record discloses substantial
evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Jackson v. Virginia</I> (1979) 443 U.S. 307, 319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781]; <I>People v. Johnson</I> (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578; <I>People v. Olguin</I> (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1382.)
<DD>Although the appellate court must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, it is the exclusive province of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which the determination depends.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Barnes</I> (1986) 42 Cal.3d 284, 303.)&nbsp; The appellate court must also draw all reasonable inferences from the evidence which support the trier of
fact's verdict.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Alcala</I> (1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 623; <I>People v. Hernandez</I> (1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1177, 1181.)&nbsp; The same standard applies where the People rely primarily on circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; (<I>People v. Perez</I> (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1117, 1124.)&nbsp; Although it is the trier of fact's duty to acquit a defendant if it finds the circumstantial evidence is susceptible of two interpretations, one which suggests guilt and the other innocence, it is the trier of fact, not the appellate court which must be convinced of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; "If the circumstances reasonably justify the trier of fact's findings, the opinion of the reviewing court that the circumstances might also be reasonably reconciled with a contrary finding does not warrant a reversal of the judgment."&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Thus, the relevant inquiry on appeal is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.&nbsp; (<I>Jackson v. Virginia</I>, <I>supra</I>, 443 U.S. at p. 319; <I>People v. Lucero</I> (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1020; <I>People v. Hernandez</I>, <I>supra</I>, 219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1182.)

<P>
<DD>At sentencing, the court made the following relevant comments with regards to count two, possession for sale of marijuana:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT]:&nbsp; I cannot stress how significant the Court found your testimony about the whole series of transactions and thought that went into the decision to leave the state of Wisconsin and its neighboring states and journey over a thousand miles to Southern California to acquire the marijuana which you were going to transport back.
<DD>".......................
<DD>"You are going to be punished in this case [not because of] your involvement with this drug as part of your religion ... but because of your involvement with this drug as part of a commerce of marijuana users.&nbsp; <U>The amount of 40 pounds, the sum of money of $28,000 are not insignificant amounts in the Court's eyes</U>, nor do I think in the eyes of the community.&nbsp; This doesn't look like just Gregory Peck trying to practice his religion.&nbsp; <U>This is Gregory Peck supplying others with marijuana at a particular price as part of the kind of money changing</U> that another revolutionary took offense to when he picked up a whip and drove the money changers from the temple.&nbsp; There are things that occur in a religious context that are not religious, and that's how I view the evidence in this case."&nbsp; (RT 533-535; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IB">B</A>.&nbsp; <U>Analysis</U></B>
<P>
<DD>Appellant's argument there is insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of possession for sale of marijuana should be rejected for at least the following four reasons:
<DD>First, the meaning of "sale" within Health and Safety Code section 11359 has been greatly expanded after issuance of the opinion in <I>People v. Lazenby</I> (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1842.&nbsp; CALJIC No. 12.21 (Marijuana -- Illegal Possession For Sale) was revised in 1993 in light of <I>Lazenby</I> to define "sale" as "any exchange of marijuana for cash, favors, services, goods or other non-cash benefits."&nbsp; <I>Lazenby</I> looked back at 
former Health and Safety Code section 11008 which included "barter, exchange, or gift" within the definition of "sale."&nbsp; (<I>People v. Lazenby</I>, <I>supra</I>, 6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1845.)&nbsp; <I>Lazenby</I> noted that when former section 11008 was repealed in 1972 to bring California into substantial conformity with federal law, there was no indication the Legislature sought to prohibit only sales for cash.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; The conclusion that "sale" includes transfers other than for money comports with the evident purposes of the California legislation, the commonly accepted meaning of the term and settled rules of statutory interpretation.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)
<DD>It is clear from his testimony that appellant intended to provide at least some of the 40 pounds of marijuana to others who were not members of his church.&nbsp; (RT 356-357, 387-389, 394-399, 405-408, 412-413.)&nbsp; In return, appellant was seeking to obtain new adherents to his church because in his words there could be no faith without the marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 356-358, 385-388, 405-408.)&nbsp; Such an exchange is certainly a "non-cash benefit" within the meaning of the jury instruction.
<DD>Second, it is plain appellant was receiving physical and tangible
benefit from the exchange of the maftjuana.&nbsp; Specifically, appellant was receiving more marijuana.&nbsp; Appellant testified he took $30,000 to
purchase the marijuana in San Diego.&nbsp; (RT 391, 394.)&nbsp; Of that money, only $4,000 was his own.&nbsp; (RT 394.)&nbsp; Yet, appellant testified he was to receive <U>one-third</U> of the total amount of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 404.)&nbsp; As the lower court noted at sentencing, appellant was "supplying others with marijuana at a particular price <U>as part of the kind of money changing</U> ..."&nbsp; (RT 534; emphasis added.)&nbsp; This exchange of marijuana had no spiritual element to it.&nbsp; A more precise definition of this transaction is probably "barter."&nbsp; It is common for drug dealers to receive payment in kind.&nbsp; Although it is sometimes difficult to tell in such situations who is the buyer and who is the seller, this type of exchange of marijuana for something of value is precisely what the law was intended to prohibit.
<DD>Third, appellant acknowledges that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance itself affords a reasonable inference of possession for sale.&nbsp; (AOB 7; <I>People v.

Grant</I> (1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 563, 570.)&nbsp; Appellant then attempts to rebut this inference by pointing to his own self-serving testimony about how he intended to give the marijuana to the members of his church for their
use of it as a sacrament.&nbsp; (AOB 6-7; RT 405-407.)&nbsp; However, since "sale" is not limited to the exchange of marijuana for cash (see <I>People v. Lazenby</I>, <I>supra</I>, 6 Cal.App.4th 1842, and above discussion), appellant has failed to rebut the inference.
<DD>Fourth, putting appellant's self-serving testimony aside, there
was strong circumstantial evidence that the marijuana was possessed for
sale.&nbsp; The 40 pounds of marijuana was already broken down into one pound increments, each pound individually wrapped.&nbsp; (CT 44.)&nbsp; Moreover, appellant had $2,350 in cash (CT 27, 39) in his BMW (which he claimed was a gift from his mother, RT 392).&nbsp; The retail value of the marijuana, depending on the quality, was worth $360,000 to $3.6 million dollars.&nbsp; (CT 43.)&nbsp; These factors led Sheriff's Investigator Joel Ontiveros to testify that in his expert opinion the 40 pounds of marijuana appellant was transporting was possessed for purposes of sale.&nbsp; (CT 41-42.)<SMALL><SUP><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#5">5</A></U>/</SUP></SMALL>
<DD>All of these reasons demonstrate there was substantial evidence to support appellant's conviction on count two, possession for sale of marijuana.

<B>THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY RULED APPELLANT'S ACT OF TRANSPORTING MARIJUANA ACROSS STATE LINES, SOME OF WHICH WOULD GO TO INDIVIDUALS NOT CONNECTED WITH HIS CHURCH, CONSTITUTED A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>It is not disputed that by finding appellant had engaged in <U>commercial activity</U> the lower court side-stepped the constitutional issue of whether the Health and Safety Code prohibitions against possession for sale and transporting of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion.&nbsp; Appellant attacks his conviction on both counts arguing the lower court erred by virtue of failing to reach the constitutional issue.&nbsp; (AOB 8.)&nbsp; Appellant is wrong.&nbsp; The caselaw is clear that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; Moreover, there is substantial evidence to support the court's conclusion that appellant's transporting
of 40 pounds of marijuana was commercial activity.
<DD>Immediately prior to finding appellant guilty, the lower court made the following pertinent findings:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT]:&nbsp; Because <U>this case deals with marijuana commerce, which is incidental to rather than an inteitral part of the practice of the defendant's religious beliefs</U>, the Court feels it is not necessary for this Court to determine whether the State of California has adopted the lease [sic, "least"] restrictive means in order to further these valid governmental interests that relate to commercing in marijuana."&nbsp; (RT 519; emphasis added.)
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; It's important to note that the Court is not confronted in this particular case with an individual who possessed a small unable quantity of marijuana in the privacy of his own home or house of worship or one who was cultivating a modest number of plants for personal use with the intent to utilize them as part of religious ceremonies or rights, but rather, the amount of contraband involved and the circumstances under which it was possessed clearly indicates that on the defendant's own admission that he was -- <U>he had purchased this marijuana for the purpose of transporting it interstate commerce to the state of Wisconsin</U> to the environs near his home <U>where it would be distributed to other individuals, some of whom were not involved in the practice -- practices of the Israel Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; The defendant candidly acknowledged that he had no control over those drugs which would go to other parties</U>.&nbsp; The amounts of money involved in the purchase and the amount of the drugs themselves are clearly set forth in the record."&nbsp; (RT 519-520; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>It is a well-settled rule of appellate review that constitutional questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; (<I>In re San Diego Commerce</I> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1236; <I>In re Shannon B.</I> (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1235, 1246, fn. 7; <I>Reed v. City &amp; County of San Francisco</I> (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 572, 575; <I>People v.Bowen</I> (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 783, 789; <I>Palermo v. Stockton Theatres, Inc.</I> (1948) 32 Cal.2d 53, 65.)&nbsp; This is such a case.&nbsp; It is unnecessary to the disposition of this issue that the constitutionality of appellant's use of marijuana in his religion be determined.
<DD>There is substantial evidence to support the lower court's finding that appellant was engaging in marijuana commerce which was not called for by his religion, hence not covered by any assertion of First Amendment rights.&nbsp; Appellant testified he had pooled $30,000 together between himself and two other people from Iowa to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 391, 394.)&nbsp; These two people from Iowa had been members of appellant's church in Iowa, but the Iowa church had broken up.&nbsp; (RE 394-395.)&nbsp; Appellant had no way of knowing whether these friends of his from Iowa, who were going in with him on the purchase of the 40 pounds of marijuana, were going to use it as a sacrament," use it recreationally, or sell it commercially.&nbsp; (RT 412-415.)
<DD>Prior to going into this pooled transaction to purchase the 40 pounds of marijuana, appellant and his church members had been practicing their religion by purchasing small amounts of marijuana at the going Wisconsin rate of $40-$60 for quarter-ounce amounts.&nbsp; (RT 393.)&nbsp; Appellant considered this too expensive which is why he decided to buy a bulk amount in San Diego where he knew he could buy it much cheaper.&nbsp; (RT 392-394.)&nbsp; The fact that appellant had another avenue for practicing his religion with marijuana (i.e., purchasing it in smaller retail amounts in Wisconsin) which did not involve violating California's laws against trafficking in marijuana demonstrates the lower court was correct in side-stepping appellant's constitutional challenge.&nbsp; Constitutional
questions are to be avoided when a case may be decided on other grounds.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)<SMALL><SUP><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#6">6</A></U>/</SUP></SMALL>
<DD>Appellant's history also suggests his interest in the commercial aspect of marijuana is a long-standing concern.&nbsp; When appellant was arrested in 1987 for growing marijuana on his farm in Wisconsin, approximately <U>1,600 marijuana plants</U> were seized.&nbsp; (<I>State v. Peck</I> (Wis.App. 1988) 422 N.W2d 160, 162.)&nbsp; Clearly, this was more marijuana than the 24 members of his congregation (RT 326-327) could reasonably use.
<DD>Recently, the Ninth Circuit analyzed a similar constitutional challenge brought by Rastafarians on religious grounds to their prosecution under federal statutes against marijuana trafficking.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I> (9th Cir. 1996) 75 E3d 1366.)&nbsp; Although the Ninth Circuit
ruled that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act the district court erred in excluding evidence in support of a religious defense as to the counts of simple possession, the district court also ruled it was <U>not error to side-step the freedom of religion issue altogether with regards to the counts beyond simple possession of marijuana</U>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"As to the counts relating to conspiracy to distribute, possession with intent to distribute, and money laundering, the religious freedom of the defendants was not invaded.&nbsp; Nothing before us suggests that Rastafarianism would require this conduct.&nbsp; These counts stand."&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at pp. 1375-1376; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Just as Rastafarianism was not a proper defense to commercial trafficking in marijuana in <I>Bauer</I>, appellant's professed religious beliefs (which are an off-shoot of Rastafarianism; RT 334-342; CT 84) was not a proper defense to appellant's commercial trafficking in marijuana in the instant case.&nbsp; The lower cottrt was correct in side-stepping the constitutional issue of whether California's statutes against possession for sale and transportation of marijuana violated appellant's First Amendment right to freely practice his religion.

<B>APPELLANT WAIVED ANY OBJECTIONS TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION BY NOT OBJECTING TO THEM AT THE TIME OF SENTENCING</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant next argues the terms of his probation which prohibit him from possessing or using any controlled substance, and also prohibit him from associating with unrelated persons who possess, use or traffic in controlled substances unconstitutionally burden his free exercise of religion and his freedom of association.&nbsp; (AOB 17.)&nbsp; Appellant waived this issue by failing to object to these terms and conditions of probation at the sentencing hearing.
<DD>In <I>People v. Welch</I> (1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, the California Supreme Court held that the failure to object to probation conditions at the time of sentencing waives the issue on appeal.&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at pp. 234-237; accord <I>People v. Scott</I> (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 356-358; see also <I>People v. Planavsky</I> (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1302.)
<DD>In the instant case, the probation report which was issued on June 29, 1995, recommended probation for appellant on condition appellant comply with specified terms and conditions including:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"(1)&nbsp; Violate no law or ordinance;
<DD>"...........................
<DD>"(6)&nbsp; Not associate with any unrelated person known to be a possessor, user, or trafficker of controlled substances, nor any unrelated person on probation or parole; and
<DD>"(7)&nbsp; Not possess nor use any controlled substances unless medically prescribed; any prescribed usage to be immediately reported to the Probation Officer."&nbsp; (CT 266I-266K.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>At the sentencing hearing held July 10, 1995, defense counsel stated appellant was "willing and able to comply with the terms of probation."&nbsp; (RT 525.)&nbsp; The court specifically addressed appellant and invited him to comment on the recommendations of the probation report:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; Mr. Peck ... I've [sic] assume you've read through the probation officer's report and understand the terms and conditions of probation they are recommending.
<DD>"You have a right at this point in time, as far as I'm concerned, to address the Court as to the decisions I'm about to make ..."&nbsp; (RT 529.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite this invitation, appellant did not object personally or through counsel to the recommended terms and conditions of probation.&nbsp; Then, the court went through each individual term and condition of probation on the record with appellant (RT 535-541) after which the court again invited any comment on the terms of probation from appellant:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; You understand all of these terms and conditions?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; Yes, I do.
<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; You have any question about anything I said to you?

<DD>"THE COURT:&nbsp; Do you accept these terms and conditions?
<DD>"THE DEFENDANT:&nbsp; Yes."&nbsp; (RT 541.)

<DD>Because appellant failed to object to the terms and conditions of probation at the time of sentencing, the issue is waived on appeal.&nbsp; (<I>People v.

<B>IT IS UNNECESSARY TO REACH THE ISSUE OF WHETHER APPELLANT'S USE OF MARIJUANA IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT'S FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION CLAUSE; BUT IF IT IS REACHED, APPELLANT'S ARGUMENT SHOULD STILL BE REJECTED</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>As previously stated, respondent argues it is unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue of whether appellant's use of marijuana is protected by the First Amendment because he was punished for marijuana trafficking which was incidental to, rather than an integral part of, the practice of his religion.&nbsp; (See Argument II, <I>supra</I>, incorporated here by reference.)
<DD>However, assuming arguendo this Court reaches the constitutional issue, respodent submits appellant's convictions here for transporting marijuana and possession for sale of marijuana are not protected by the First Amendment's Free exercise of religion clause for the following reasons.
<DD>Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (hereinafter "RFRA") in 1993 (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb)<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#8">8</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP> in response to the United States Supreme Court opinion in <I>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I> (1990) 494 U.S. 872, 108 L.Ed.2d 876,110 S.Ct. 1595.&nbsp; (Hereinafter <I>Smith</I>.)&nbsp; While implicitly criticizing <I>Smith</I>, the statute does not present itself as an interpretation of the Constitution overruling <I>Smith</I>; rather it consists of a command that must be followed as a matter of federal law.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, F.3d at p. 1374.)&nbsp; The statute restored and codified the "compelling interest test" as set forth in <I>Sherbert v. Verner</I> (1963) 374 U.S. 398 [10 L.Ed.2d 965, 83 S.Ct. 1790]; and <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I> (1972) 406 U.S. 205 [32 L.Ed.2d 15, 92 S.Ct. 1526], for purposes of analyzing whether statutes substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification.&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, subds. (a) and (b); see <I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at pp. 1374-1375.)&nbsp; The compelling interest test is set forth in the statute as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person --
<DD>"(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and
<DD>"(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest."&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb-1, subd. (b).)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Applying this test to the instant case, the lower court correctly found that California's laws prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were in furtherance of compelling governmental interests.&nbsp; (RT 519.)
<DD>Moreover, respondent submits California's statutes (Health & Saf. Code, &sect;&sect; 11360 and 11359) are the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling governmental interests.<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#9">9</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>

<P>
<DD>In the instant case, the lower court held that California's laws
prohibiting the transportation and possession for sale of marijuana were
in furtherance of compelling governmental interests:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"[THE COURT:]&nbsp; From the evidence received in this trial, the Court finds that the enforcement of laws prohibiting commercial transactions in marijuana embodied in Health and Safety Code Section 11359 and 11360 are valid and compelling public health safety, societal and governmental health interest[s] on the part of the People on [sic, "of"] the state of California."&nbsp; (RT 519.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The lower court's ruling was correct and should be upheld by this Court.&nbsp; In examining the reasons supporting this conclusion, it should
first be noted that two other states, Wisconsin and Iowa, have come to the same conclusion with regard to religious constitutional challenges to the marijuana laws by members of the Coptic Church.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IVA1">1</A>.&nbsp; Deference Should Be Given To Decisions By
Other State Courts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Have Ruled On This Issue</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>In <I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W2d 160, appellant was the
defendant and he challenged Wisconsin's marijuana laws on the same grounds he is challenging California's marijuana laws in the instant case.&nbsp; The Wisconsin court stated in relevant part as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"The Wisconsin legislature, in enacting ch. 161, Stats. [Wisconsin's drug laws], expressly found that the abuse of marijuana and other controlled substances 'constitutes a serious problem foe society.'&nbsp; [Citation.] ...&nbsp; In <I>Rush</I> [<I>United States v. Rush</I> (1st Cir. 1984) 738 F.2d 497], a case involving an identical 'free exercise' challenge to federal drug laws by the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, the court, while recognizing conflicting opinions as to whether marijuana is a health hazard and a threat to social welfare or simply a harmless recreational drug, noted that:
<DD>"<U>Every federal court that has considered the matter, so far as we are aware, has accepted the congressional determination that marijuana in fact poses a real threat to individual health and social welfare, and has upheld the criminal sanctions for possession and distribution of marijuana even where such sanctions infringe on the free exercise of religion</U>.&nbsp; <I>Id</I>. at 512.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]
<DD>"A majority of state courts considering the question have reached a similar result.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]
<DD>".....................
<DD>"<U>Preservation of the public health and safety is the obvious purpose underlying Wisconsin's drug laws, and we see a compelling state purpose in the regulation of marijuana and other controlled substances</U>.&nbsp; On this record, and in light of the nearly unanimous rulings of other state and federal courts on the issue, we conclude that the state interest is of sufficient magnitude to override Peck's first amendment interest in using the drug as a daily continual sacrament in his admittedly sincere role as a member of the Israel Zion Coptic Church.&nbsp; [Footnote omitted.]"&nbsp; (<I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W2d at pp. 163-164; emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Similarly, in <I>State v. Olsen</I> (Iowa 1982) 315 N.W.2d 1, the defendant, a priest in the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, challenged the trial court's refusal of his requested instructions on the religious use of marijuana as
a defense.&nbsp; The Supreme Court of Iowa concluded:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"A compelling state interest sufficient to override Olsen's free exercise clause argument is demonstrated in this case."&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at p. 9.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Appellant testified he regularly smoked marijuana and would then drive on the streets and highways of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (RT 363-367, 373-376, 423.)&nbsp; In fact, he had smoked marijuana in his hotel the morning of his arrest.&nbsp; (RT 410.)&nbsp; Had the 40 pounds of marijuana in appellant's car not been seized, they would clearly have had a deleterious effect on the
citizens of Wisconsin, and possibly Iowa.&nbsp; Appellant, with rolling papers in his pocket, was found headed north on Interstate 13, and presumably
would have exited California within a few hours and passed through several other states before arriving home in Wisconsin.&nbsp; Because the effects of appellant driving possibly under the influence of marijuana would have been felt in the states of Wisconsin and Iowa, this Court should give deference to the decisions of those states.&nbsp; <U>Comity</U> should be given to the decisions of the sister states of Wisconsin and Iowa with regard to decisions primarily affecting the health and welfare of citizens of those states.&nbsp; (See <I>People v. Pensinger</I> (1991) 32 Cal.3d 1210, 1261.)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><A NAME="IVA2">2</A>.&nbsp; The Evidence In This Case Demonstrated Compelling State
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interests</B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>The testimony of expert witnesses and appellant's own testimony about the casual and continuous smoking of marijuana by members of his church demonstrated why California has compelling state interests in regulating marijuana to promote public health and safety in California.
<DD>Prosecution expert Dr. Marcelline Burns testified she had "hands-on" experience in administering smoked marijuana to individuals and then observing them as they are asked to perform a variety of tasks.&nbsp; (RT 102-107, 110-129.)&nbsp; Dr. Burns described tests she conducted with regard to attention and motor skills, particularly the driving of automobiles and flying of airplanes.&nbsp; (RT 110-129, 238-239.)&nbsp; She testified individuals smoking marijuana<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#10">10</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP> were unsafe to drive a car.&nbsp; (RT 126-129, 132-135, 236, 301, 305-306.)&nbsp; Dr. Burns testified such individuals displayed tracking, concentration, and reaction time problems.&nbsp; (RT 126-129, 132.)&nbsp; She testified these symptoms would persist for four to eight hours.&nbsp; (RT 134.)
<DD>Dr. Burns noted several studies indicate marijuana use may cause short-term changes in brain structure, temporarily lowered testosterone levels, and possible "a-motivational syndrome."&nbsp; (RT 243-244.)&nbsp; Based upon the effects she has observed in those who use marijuana, and the literature she has read, she had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children.&nbsp; (RT 129, 237-238.)
<DD>Defense expert Dr. John Morgan testified he too had strong concerns about providing marijuana to children.&nbsp; (RT 189, 221-222.)&nbsp; He believed marijuana use impaired driving.&nbsp; (RT 199, 202-203.)&nbsp; Because marijuana causes a quickening of the heart rate, Dr. Morgan recommended that anyone intending to smoke marijuana should first have a physical exam.&nbsp; (RT 220-221.)
<DD>The manner in which appellant and other members of his church use marijuana takes on partictilar significance when considered in light of the above expert testimony.
<DD>Appellant testified members of his church occasionally smoke marijuana all day long.&nbsp; (RT 359; see also RT 205.)&nbsp; Appellant acknowledged marijuana is provided to children; sometimes children earlier than eight years smoke marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 319-321, 382-385.)
<DD>On a typical day, appellant stated he would start the morning by sharing a joint with his wife; sometimes smoking an entire joint by himself.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; He would then leave to work in his fence installing business.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; He has a mechanical hold digging machine he operates.&nbsp; (RT 367.)&nbsp; In order to get to job sites, appellant
drives on the roads and highways of Wisconsin.&nbsp; (RT 363-367.)&nbsp; If time permits, appellant smokes a joint during lunch and then drives back to
work in his vehicle.&nbsp; (RT 364.)&nbsp; In the evening, appellant smokes
marijuana again, often times sharing it with his wife and at least some
of his children.&nbsp; (RT 319-321, 363-367, 382-385.)&nbsp; The older children sometimes smoked marijuana in the evening even though they would be
going to school the next day with their homework assignments.&nbsp; (RT 384-387.)&nbsp; Appellant testified that thouagh he and his wife smoked marijuana, they were typically the only persons watching their children as they played.&nbsp; (RT 390.)
<DD>Appellant's friend, Michael Matteson, who is also a member of appellant's church does things much the same as appellant expect that he is a carpenter.&nbsp; (RT 324-328, 358-361.)&nbsp; Mr. Matteson spends a lot of time in his carpentry workshop operating electric tools including a band saw.&nbsp; (RT 369-371.)&nbsp; Nevertheless, marijuana is smoked there by
Mr. Matteson and his children.&nbsp; (RT 371-373.)
<DD>Appellant makes no effort to limit his marijuana use to certain days of the week or to specific religious ceremonies (RT 360-362, 354-355), such as Native American Church members do with peyote and marijuana.&nbsp; (RT 36, 40-41, 45-46, 51-55, 67-69.)&nbsp; Rather, he provides it to his young children and he smokes marijuana frequently before getting behind the wheel to drive on public streets and before operating heavy machinery.&nbsp; Such disregard for the health and safety of himself, his family and the public at large vividly demonstrates why California has a compelling interest to intervene and regulate such conduct.&nbsp; The lower court did not abuse its discretion in so finding.
<P>
<B><A NAME="IVB">B</A>.&nbsp; <U>California's Marijuana Laws Are The Least Restrictive Means Of</U>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Furthering The Compelling State Interests In Public Health And Safety</U></B>
<P>
<DD>The least restrictive means prong of the compelling state interest test is less developed than the first prong of identifying a compelling state interest.&nbsp; The reason this is so appears to be because once a court has found a compelling state interest, it is difficult for a court to dictate how this interest might be "fine-tuned" in its application.&nbsp; Administration of a law is an executive function which must take into account such problems as day-to-day administrative mechanics, distribution of limited resources, long-term effects, and other such considerations.&nbsp; As stated by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in <I>State v. Peck</I>, <I>supra</I>, 422 N.W.2d at page 164, footnote 3:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>"Peck suggests without elaboration, that the state could accomplish its goals by developing 'reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the use of marijuana.'&nbsp; Any such action, however, would be for the legislature, not the courts, to undertake."&nbsp; (Emphasis added.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DD>Nevertheless, assuming this Court has reached this stage of the constitutional analysis<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#11">11</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>, a key distinction should be kept in mind: because appellant was convicted of marijuana trafficking offenses (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11360, subd. (a), transporting marijuana; and Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11359, possession of marijuana for sale) rather than simple possession of marijuana, the real issue presented here is  whether Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the <U>least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking</U>.&nbsp; The issue is <U>not</U>, as appellant attempts to frame it, whether California's laws with regard to simple possession of an unspecified amount of marijuana for personal religious use are the least restrictive means available so as not to infringe on the First Amendment religious freedom rights of citizens.<SUP><SMALL><U><A HREF="peck-rb4.html#12">12</A></U>/</SMALL></SUP>
<DD>With this distinction in mind, let us turn to Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <I>Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith</I>, <I>supra</I>, 494 U.S. 872.&nbsp; In <I>Smith</I>, Justice O'Connor concurred in the judgment of the majority but did so by
applying the <I>Sherbert</I> test, which is exactly what Congress mandated in subsequently passing the RFRA in 1993.&nbsp; (42 U.S.C. &sect; 2000bb, subd.
(b).)&nbsp; With regard to peyote use within the context of a religious ceremony of the Native American Church, she found there was a compelling state interest in the regulation of peyote by the government and it was advanced by the least restrictive means.&nbsp; She wrote, "I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon's criminal prohibition is 'essential to accomplish' [citationj its overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance."&nbsp; (Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. at p. 905.)&nbsp; Justice O'Connor gave two reasons.&nbsp; First, "[b]ecause the health effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them.&nbsp; [Citation.]"&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Second, "in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon's stated interest in preventing any possession of peyote.&nbsp; [Citation.]"&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>.)&nbsp; Though Justice O'Connor was discussing peyote, the same rationales apply equally with regard to marijuana.&nbsp; The health effects and dangers exist both with regard to adults and children notwithstanding the religious purpose for which appellant claims it is used.&nbsp; To permit appellant to use and distribute marijuana among friends and family even for religious purposes does not resolve state health concerns.&nbsp; Likewise, with regard to preventing trafficking in marijuana -- to accept appellant's religious defense to his trafficking convictions would put an unworkable burden on law enforcement and the courts to divine who fall into the category of a religious exemption at any given moment in time.  It was also encourage completely non-religious marijuana traffickers to raise bogus religious defenses in efforts to cloak their true nefarious purposes.&nbsp; (See <I>United States v. Meyers</I> (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 [district court rejected claim that self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana" had legitimate religious beliefs protectable under RFRA].)
<DD>Similarly, this Court in <I>Music Plus Four, Inc v. Barnet</I> (1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 113, upheld a city ordinance which prohibited the display and sale of drug and marijuana paraphernalia (pipes, "alligator" clips, etc.) to minors.&nbsp; This Court found it was a compelling state interest "of the highest priority" to "protect children from exploitation by those trafficking in drugs and drug-related products."&nbsp; (<I>Id</I>., at p. 130.)&nbsp; Likewise, this Court found that the city ordinance which required minors to be accompanied by a parent or guardian before such drug and marijuana paraphernalia could be displayed or sold to them was "<U>the least restrictive means</U> to achieve that goal."&nbsp; (<I>Music Plus Four, Inc. v. Barnet</I>, <I>supra</I>, 114 Cal.App.3d at p. 130; emphasis added.)&nbsp; If it is a compelling state interest of the highest priority to protect children from exposure to marijuana-related products, certainly it is an even higher priority to protect them from the actual trafficking of marijuana.&nbsp; Likewise, Health and Safety Code sections 11360, subdivision (a), and 11359 are the least restrictive means with regard to controlling marijuana trafficking because the threat of substantial prison incarceration is necessary as a deterrent to those who would traffic marijuana to our children and citizens in general.&nbsp; The fact that these laws also provide flexibility with the possibility of probation (such as in appellant's case) for those motivated by more benign purposes also reflects how these statutes are the least restrictive means for achieving the state's compelling interests in ensuring public health and safety.
<DD>Ultimately, in this specific case, the least restrictive means prong is not of great importance.&nbsp; Even if California had in place a system by which appellant was able to lawfully obtain marijuana for religious purposes, such a system would still not address most of the state's primary concerns.&nbsp; Appellant gets into motor vehicles and drives shortly after smoking marijuana.&nbsp; It seems relatively clear appellant does not believe marijuana smoking substantially impairs a driver or heavy machine operator.&nbsp; He gives marijuana to children.&nbsp; If the state permitted appellant's use of marijuana but forbade it to his children, appellant apparently would not follow such a law as he believes it is necessary for children to smoke marijuana once they have reached the "age of reason" in order to follow his beliefs.&nbsp; (KT 382-384.)
<DD>For all these reasons, appellant's use of marijuana is not protected by the First Amendment.

<DD><A NAME="1">1</A>.&nbsp; Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings be admitted into evidence at trial.&nbsp; (RT 14.)
<DD><A NAME="2">2</A>.&nbsp; <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966) 384 U.S. 436, 444 [86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694].
<DD><A NAME="3">3</A>.&nbsp; Counsel stipulated that the transcript of the August 29, 1994, Evidence Code section 402 hearing being admitted into evidence at trial.&nbsp; (RT 9-10.)
<DD><A NAME="4">4</A>.&nbsp; Expert witnesses also testified regarding the effects and harmfulness of marijuana.&nbsp; The testimony of these witnesses is discussed in Argument IV.
<DD><A NAME="5">5</A>.&nbsp; It should also be noted that it was unlikely appellant could have used the entire 13 pounds of marijuana which was to be his portion of the 40 pounds entirely by his church.&nbsp; Appellant testified that there were only 24 members of his church, including his children.&nbsp; (RT 326-327.)&nbsp; Appellant also testified he and his wife smoked an average of about three joints of marijuana per day between them.&nbsp; (RT 363-364.)&nbsp; However, Sheriffs Investigator Ontiveros testified that according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Campaign Against Marijuana Planting (CAMP), ten pounds of marijuana would yield enough hours of intoxication for one person to stay intoxicated for 2.1 years contintiously.&nbsp; That's smoking one-half gram marijuana joint or marijuana cigarette every two hours, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year."&nbsp; (CT 42.)
<DD><A NAME="6">6</A>.&nbsp; Assuming arguendo the lower court should not have side-stepped appellant's First Amendment challenge, it should still be rejected for the reasons set forth in Argument IV, <I>infra</I>.
<DD><A NAME="7">7</A>.&nbsp; Even assuming arguendo the issue were not waived on appeal, the terms and conditions of probation were proper in any event (See Argument IV, <I>infra</I>.)
<DD><A NAME="8">8</A>.&nbsp; The lower court noted that the RFRA controlled in this case:&nbsp; The defense contends and the People concede in this case that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 governs the application of California state laws relating fo the use, possession, and distribution of marijuana by the defendant in this case."&nbsp; (RT 519.)&nbsp; Appellant's reliance on the old California case <I>People v. Woody</I> (1964) 61 Cal.2d 716 to support his constitutional challenge is misplaced.&nbsp; <I>Woody</I> based its analysis strictly on federal grounds and did not analyze the issue based on independent state grounds.
<DD><A NAME="9">9</A>.&nbsp; The threshold consideration for even applying the compelling interest test is to determine the sincerity of the defendant's belief in the tenants and practices of the religion of which he asserts he is a part.&nbsp; (<I>United States v. Bauer</I>, <I>supra</I>, 75 F.3d at p.
1376.)&nbsp; Here, the prosecution contested the sincerity of appellant's beliefs but the court implicitly found them to be sincere.&nbsp; (RT 518-519, 533-534.)&nbsp; Insofar as the lower court's determination is a factual finding, it is entitled to deference on appeal.&nbsp; (See <I>People v. Marquez</I> (1992) 1 Cal.4th 553, 570; <I>People v. Meredith</I> (1992) 11 Ca1.App.4th 1548, 1561; <I>People v. Gallant</I> (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 200, 206.)&nbsp; However, if the court's finding is a mixed question of fact and law, this Court is entitled to review the issue independently.&nbsp; (<I>Ibid</I>; see also <I>People v. Boissard</I> (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 972, 977.)&nbsp; Respondent submits appellant's religious beliefs are not sincerely held.&nbsp; (See Argument I, <I>supra</I>; see CT 238-239; see also tbe factors used in <I>U.S. v. Myers</I> (D.Wyo. 1995) 906 F.Supp. 1494 to determine the sincerity of the religious beliefs of a self-declared "Reverend" in the "Church of Marijuana.")
<DD><A NAME="10">10</A>.&nbsp; Dr. Burns noted her laboratory marijuana was about six to seven times weaker than marijuana found on the street.&nbsp; (RT 235.)
<DD><A NAME="11">11</A>.&nbsp; See <I>Transport Workers' Local 234 v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority</I> (3rd Cir. 1988) 863 F.2d 1110, 1120 [the least restrictive means analysis applied in cases implicating the First Amendment is not applicable to cases arising under the Fourth Amendment].
<DD><A NAME="12">12</A>.&nbsp; Indeed, had appellant been arrested for mere possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for use in his religion, he would only have suffered a citation (the equivalent of a speeding ticket and not even been booked.  (Health &amp; Saf. Code, &sect; 11357, subd. (b).)  Clearly, such a legislative scheme for simple possession of small amounts of marijuana is <U>the least restrictive means</U> of achieving the compelling state interest in public health and safety.

P.O. Box 1000<br>
Lewisburg, PA 17837</font></p>

<p><font size="4">December 16, 1996</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hello Carl,<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I thank you for forwarding a copy of Brian's letter to me along
with your newsletter.&nbsp; As you suspected, I was and am amused
with Brian's observations of life and his veiled hopes for something
better to come.&nbsp; His voice arising to me from the type
renews and invigorates my personal pride in my own son whom I
consider to be an unselfish and uncomplaining sufferer in this spiritual battle
which has immersed us completely.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I am encouraged ever so subtly when I hear from you that you
preceive some of the concepts that are always in the forefront of
my consciousness in a similar manner as I, myself, see
them.&nbsp; When you describe the folks who first told you about
Ivy and his cosmic as being super-charged, I know that you fully
understand the differentiation that I am making between that
purity of purpose and thought and the ensuing smuggling debacle
which evolved under the Coptic guise.&nbsp; I know that you must
have experienced some degree of this super-charged spirit
yourself or you could never have recognized it as something
unique and special.&nbsp; I am also certain that others
throughout history have manifest this storied Christ-like
persona, but Ivy it the only one that I personally experienced.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I know that it is very difficult to balance the seeming dichotomy
between that purity of unfeigned selfless service and the
unbridled vanity of the smuggling apparatus that chewed us up and
spit us out along with our spiritual siblings, leaving the
residue we now know.&nbsp; I also know and feel the same conflict
that you experience as my human nature wars against my quest for
divinity, each staging victories, each suffering defeats.&nbsp; I
do not torment myself over these inevitable clashes.&nbsp; I am
confident that the spirit must and will prevail and that the
final result can only be in our sincere glorification of that
holy spirit.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I do not know and I cannot say of a certainty that there will
ever be any reunion or gathering of these scattered individuals
we often refer to as the brothers and sisters.&nbsp; I do,
however, hold onto a sincere hope that such a cataclysmic revival
of love could actually transpire and, because I know the joy and
ecstasy that I have experienced, I maintain that glimmer of hope
that this spirit can again resurrect itself among us despite the
overwhelming odds that appear to prohibit such an event.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">We all have our experiences with the herb in every imaginable
scenario.&nbsp; The herb is our sacrament and we are the
ministers and the mistresses of the herb and the civilization
which is inherent to the spiritual use and understanding of the
herb.&nbsp; I know that you are one of the, if not the, foremost
spokespersons and representatives of the &quot;plant of
renown.&quot;&nbsp; Through your diligent and determined efforts
you have achieved the respect of countless people who otherwise
would not have heard of the compelling argument that cannot be logically
resisted.&nbsp; I understand the forum that you have created
through your persistence.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Many of our former colleagues have withdrawn or retracted from
the forefront for various reasons.&nbsp; Some because of the
persecution, but mostly because of the penalty from the law enforcement
tenacle of the political beast.&nbsp; Many are not willing to
stop partaking.&nbsp; Some, as you suggest, refuse to stop the
cultivation, or buying and selling, possibly importing the sweet
smelling incense.&nbsp; I cannot say anything about someone's
choice in how they decide to either use or not use the
ganja.&nbsp; I loved every aspect of the herb culture.&nbsp; The only
element of everything that I have experienced with the herb that
I now consider to be regrettable is the crass commercialization
of a natural substance that should be free politically and free
or of minimal monetary value commercially.&nbsp; Ideally free,
but I will not attempt to determine economics because of the
elusive nature of people's private business.&nbsp; I know you understand
that I am merely saying that our motivation and our
administration is not commercial.&nbsp; Although this is far from
the reality of today's social conditions.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I do not feel as though I have transgressed in any of my
endeavors in the herb culture.&nbsp; I am being persecuted by the
unjust political policies of a very corrupt and self-serving
government.&nbsp; I would gladly give up even my life and everything
related to that life before I would ever allow the evil to speak
their sinister lies about the herb without challenge.&nbsp; As
long as my alleged crime against society is related to the ganja,
I am prepared to proudly bear whatevery the demons deem as my
punishment.&nbsp; I realize that wasting away in a federal dungeon
can appear to be a frivolous and somewhat stupid way to end up,
but since this is the consequence of my sincere pursuit of my belief
that ganja is good, then I am determined to bear the consequence
with as much dignity as I can muster.&nbsp; I am honestly not
remorseful because of this.&nbsp; The only thing that grieves my
soul in any continual manner is the suffering of my family being separated
and, in the same vein, the estrangement of the sisters and
brothers when I know the potential of the &quot;perfect
love&quot; that we once shared for those fleeting moments of
perfection.&nbsp; As you have stated, I also feel that I have a unique
and enlightening understanding of the herb and, although my forum
is not nearly as vast or as productive as that which you have
achieved through your inspired efforts, I am committed completely
to defending the use of herb for spiritual communion.&nbsp; I
know that collectively we can move mountains.&nbsp; I also
realize that this eventually does not seem likely.&nbsp; Yet I
cannot release that hope which, for whatever reason, remains real
to me.&nbsp; I am not hoping to claim a reward before a work is
completed.&nbsp; I am simply relating to you that the reuniting
of these old farts, no matter how cantankerous and contrary many
of us have become, is also a great work, in my own mind at least, and
I somehow can't shake the perception that this is an essential
ingredient in the big picture that, perhaps, you foresee.&nbsp; I
also know that this almost seem vain.&nbsp; But I do see that big
set of nerds, regardless of how remotely they were touched by Ivy's
&quot;super-charged&quot; aura of consciousness, as a spiritual
body that must be revived.&nbsp; This may be an illusion, but it
is the illusion I cling to and will undoubtedly cling to until my
final breath.&nbsp; This in no way diminishes the monumental work
that you are doing.&nbsp; In fact, I see it as a natural
progression of things.&nbsp; However it works out, my love for you
and all of the characters in my imaginary drama only increases.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I liked the three basic issue that interest Neil
Montgomery.&nbsp; His inquiries seem to be sincere and, really,
they do provoke wonderful thoughts.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(1) How best does the EZCC fit into the definitions of religion?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">As you know, the term religion invokes a somewhat negative
reaction because of the malicious and murderous behaviors that
have been and are being performed under the guise of religion and
in the name of God.&nbsp; Almost every religion in this world
today seems to condemn me, imprison me, and even (in their
thoughts) to kill me because I proclaim that the cannabis
(marijuana, ganja, herb, hemp, etc.,...) is the only substance
provided by nature (God) that heightens the perceptions of human
beings, thus enabling the lowly creatures to more readily exhibit
divine qualities such as love, equality, unity, and charity and
to actually commune more consciously with the purity of that holy spirit which
dwells within our consciousness.&nbsp; Because humanity is so
inextricably committed to fulfilling their own wicked lusts and
vanities it has become increasingly more difficult for this potentially
divine species to cease from their sinful ways because, honestly,
the vast majority prefer sin and corruption above anything that
even suggests godliness.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I am a bit reluctant to tout the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church
banner as the harbinger of the sacramental civilization that is
inherent within these people that I will introduce as the
possessors of this civilization because that Coptic Era represented
a commercial diversion for us as a spiritual body and must be
cast aside as simply a stage in the inevitable metamorphosis of
these divine people who are uniquely aware of the ganja
mystery.&nbsp; Call us what you will.&nbsp; A true religion deals with
the worship of God as a result of the faith and belief of its adherents
in the infallibility and goodness of God's relationship to
mankind and to all creation, thus manifesting in perfect love,
one toward another; not just in words alone -- in the
indisputability or our deeds and our actions.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">By this definition, or by any definition, we qualify!<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(2) What is a sacrament?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">My only personal understanding of these religious rites or
functions of faith has to do with Christian doctrines whose
origins stem from the Bible and the life of the man-Christ who is
the focus of our meditations.&nbsp; The understanding that we, as
humans, have been able to grasp has come to fruition primarily as
a result of the mediations and interpretations of this man's
teachings through what has been purportedly recorded of his
various messages.&nbsp; I am not concerned with the controversy
about the divine authority of this messianic messenger.&nbsp; I will
only deal at this juncture with the sacrament that was
established by this Christ and commonly known as the
Eucharist.&nbsp; I know the tired and stale rituals of various
Christian dogmas that show the people a piece of bread or a flour wafer
and a cup of wine as the representation spoken of in the
eucharistic parables about the &quot;body and blood&quot; of
Christ.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Now, obviously we are not eating a man's flesh nor are we
drinking a man's blood.&nbsp; This is a symbolism for partaking
of a spirit or a spiritual food that would instill in those who
share this Eucharist a more Christlike perception and, therefore,
a more Christlike behavior.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Let us examine for a moment these substances, bread and
wine.&nbsp; Whether blessed or not, the reaction to them does not
change.&nbsp; Bread does absolutely nothing to the spiritual
consciousness of a man or a woman.&nbsp; Wine, on the other hand,
will cause any human to become drunken and manifest various spiritually
unconscious behaviors when imbibed in excessive quantities.&nbsp;
If memory serves me, and I'm sure that it does, the scripture
says something like &quot;As often as you partake of this, do it
in remembrance of me (Christ).&quot;&nbsp; Even if someone should
begin partaking of the fermented fruit juice with the intention
of a spiritual meditation to coincide with the drinking, they would
invariably lose sight of the &quot;blood of Christ&quot; concept
as the alcohol level increases in their own bloodstream.&nbsp;
And then what?&nbsp; They cannot locate the moral integrity that is
required to enter into the heavenly places.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">I am more than just aware of the propaganda and the outright lies
that have been formulated and spread in the minds of people
everywhere concerning the herb.&nbsp; I will not at this moment
argue inane malarkey that has been used to malign the most
wonderful organic substance that mankind has available in abundance
at their fingertips.&nbsp; I will simply declare that the herb
known as cannabis is the only substance in all of creation that
even remotely resembles the properties of this &quot;holy Eucharist.&quot;&nbsp;
No other substance, either natural or synthetic, can break down
the barriers of selfish pride, of racial hatred and strife, of
greed and malice like a few tokes of <u>good</u> (not the
commercial crap) ganja weed.&nbsp; There is no other substance on
earth that enhances the equality concept like a few more pulls on
the pipe that is packed with the aromatic blend of ganja
buds.&nbsp; There is no quicker way to journey to the prophetic
Mt. Zion, a choice and happy place that is adorned with wonderous
grace, than by inhaling deeply of the &quot;holy smoke&quot;
emanating from the ember of the &quot;burning bush&quot; that our
forefather Moses was wont to burn.&nbsp; The greatest comforter
to the human soul on all the face of all the earth is the sweet,
sweet essence of <u>good</u>, ripe ganja.&nbsp; It cannot be made
by men in their laboratories and it cannot be dethroned as the
king and the queen, the alpha and the omega, in the beginning and
in the end, the delightfully delicious Eucharist provided absolutely
free by our great and merciful God.&nbsp; We thank you!&nbsp; And
the smoke arises in every corner of this earth in spite of the
most fearsome and barbaric persecution by the wicked and barbaric
religious-political-commercial governments.&nbsp; I do not wish
to argue the validity of whether or not smoking the ganja is this
spirit of consciousness which I have briefly described as a sacrament.&nbsp;
I am formally and explicitly announcing that it is a sacrament,
has been a sacrament for at least two millenia and is my
eucharistic vehicle which allows me to journey in the spirit to
the realms of Christlike understanding.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">(3) What is the proof of claim to the sacrament?<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">In answer to this question, volumes could easily be written
stating the historical use of ganja in every era and spiritual
advent throughout man's and woman's development from the time
when recorded documents first appeared.&nbsp; A very convincing
argument can be made by us concerning the use of this herb by all
of the prophets, priests, and apostles of scriptural lore and
innumerable references through mystical symbols and parables to
the use of this sweet smelling incense by all of these holy men
and women of old as told in the Bible.&nbsp; This only engenders
controversy and accusations and, quite probably, not a little
vexation from the bible-thumpers everywhere.&nbsp; The surest
proof and absolutely indisputable evidence can only be obtained
by allowing the sisters and the brothers whom I have previously
made reference about to gather in one location without the ominous
threat of reprisal from these legions of governmental
functionaries and permit us to conduct our religious services and partake
of our sacramental herb.&nbsp; Keep these devious lawmakers and
their henchmen from interfering with our practice of our faith in
the manner that we know has been passed to us from Abraham and
Isaac, Felix and Elijah, Moses, Joshua, and Daniel from his
lion's den.&nbsp; Peter, Paul, and Barnabas all going to this
great spiritual feast.&nbsp; And so many more that we cannot
say.&nbsp; Stop persecuting us for this moment and cease from
terrorizing our religious activities.&nbsp; Allow us to smoke our
ganja and we will surely manifest proof to the whole world that
we are a spiritual people, that ganja is our vehicle to the spiritual
realms of Zion, and that we, collectively, hold the keys to the
mysteries which have eluded humanity until this blessed dispensation.&nbsp;
What possible threat do we pose to these powers that be in this
wicked and degenerate kingdom that has led mankind to the very
brink of destruction?&nbsp; What possible threat can be posed by
a totally non-violent group of ganja smokers except that we can
expose the demons who lead the people into their corrupt devices
and hold them in a diabolical economic servitude.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">They fight the ganja and the ganja people because we are the only
ones who can truly liberate the human soul from the bondage of
sin and lead the march away from oppression, lust, and crime unto
the promised paradise that the sould longs for.&nbsp; This is why
they wage a war that they cannot win, not against cocaine and
heroin and the illicit prescription drugs which they manufacture
and control, but against nature and against God in the form of
the ganja.&nbsp; This is why they refuse to allow us the basic
liberty of practicing our religion with our sacrament.&nbsp; They
actually do not want proof because it is proof they would get.<br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="40">Okay, Carl.&nbsp; I've babbled on enough for now, but I know that
you can grasp what it is that I am babbling about.&nbsp; We do
hold this mystery among us.&nbsp; And this is undoubtedly why I
continue to babble.&nbsp; This is only the tip of the iceberg.<br>

<p><font size="4">Hello, dear Jeffery, and hearty greetings to
all you meet; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Thank you for the invigorating note that you most recently sent
to me and especially appreciate your saintly remembrance of Brian
and your thoughtful communication to him.&nbsp; I hope you are
aware that he is no longer in McKean FCI.&nbsp; He was accused of
inciting a riot there last October when the Federal prisons
across Amerika spontaneously erupted after congress refused to address
the harsh penalties meted out to crack (read black) users and distributors
as opposed to the powder cocaine sentences.&nbsp; Anyway, he's
been on lockdown ever since and is presently being housed in
Beckley, W. Va.&nbsp; He is a warrior. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I have no excuses, real or imagined, why I have not been more
prompt in returning a letter to you.&nbsp; I do thank you for
reminding me that I am full of shit, lest at any time I should
happen to overlook such an obvious bit of information.&nbsp;
Besides, I like it when you talk dirty to me :-).&nbsp; I will
say that I have thought of you on numerous occasions and even
reminded myself that I should respond to your letters and
acknowledge receipt of your gift to me of the book &quot;Green
Gold,&quot; but, alas, I had no movement of my spirit to exercise my
pencil hand until just now and I am grateful for the stimulation
that you provided.&nbsp; By the way, in answer to your question,
there is nothing that you either said or did that pissed me off
in any way.&nbsp; It has been a long time since anyone has pissed
me off by anything that they have said to me or about me.&nbsp; This
does not mean, however, that I am incapable of reacting to verbal stimulus,
for this is one of my favorite pursuits of interest -- to react
verbally to something someone has said or done.&nbsp; Hammering
what I consider to be hypocrisy or ignorance or any number of
other moral infirmaties always gives me great pleasure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I am always interested in updates about any and all or our former
assocates in the Coptic experience and also all of those who were
considered to be merely fringe performers, imposter performers,
or bad performers who were excommunicated from the fellowship of
kindred minds (?) pecking order because of some perceived
blasphemy in the mind of the spiritually tyrannical Nyah Bingi
Man.&nbsp; I find all of these characters, or whichever category
they may be classified, to be of great interest to me.&nbsp; As I
review each individual that I came in contact with as a result of
this spiritual movement, which somehow evolved into the
ganja-smuggling juggernaut known as Coptic, I find that almost unanimously
these people were motivated to do what they did by a sincere belief
that they were drawing themselves closer to the will of the true
and living God.&nbsp; When many were the recipients of critical
&quot;fire,&quot; and some even permanently ostracized from the
right hand of God or banished to a limbo or non-descript
banality, it was more devastating than anything they could have previously
imagined.&nbsp; They examined themselves, thought that their
intentions were simply to know God and to attempt to purify
themselves, and suddenly they found themselves alienated from
their adopted spiritual family and stamped with the accursed
designation of &quot;fuckery.&quot;&nbsp; All because they did
not fit into the extremely limited parameters of Keith's cadre of
sycophants and mindless robots.&nbsp; No one could stand up to
that spiritually powerful asshole who rode roughshod over <u>his</u>
kingdom of ass-kickers who readily and willingly stepped on each
other in order to draw closer to his and Wally's fiegned
holiness.&nbsp; Meanwhile, these two guys were fucking dozens of
women, each under the guise of sanctifying them.&nbsp; I won't go
into all the horrifying hypocrisy that occurred under the Coptic
banner.&nbsp; And even though all were guilty of plenty of sins
during the 4, 3, and 8 era, only Keith and Wally were in a
position to lead and, thus, they are ultimately responsible for
the catastrophe whose fruit is the rottenness we now behold among
all those of use who vowed to &quot;Let perfect love and
friendship reign, through all eternity.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I am not condemning anyone.&nbsp; I am merely stating what
happened even though I am not going into an in depth analysis of
the overwhelming corruption that resulted.&nbsp; If, perhaps, you
will allow me to make a little analogy.&nbsp; Think of a minefield
that lies in the path of a group objective which promises
unimagined euphoria for all those involved.&nbsp; There is no way
of circumventing the hazards posed by the lethal mines.&nbsp;
Someone, or maybe even a few, must encounter the minefield
head-on, exploding the deadly obstacles, and, by this foray into uncharted
territory of vanity, clear a path that can safely be trod by all
those who come after.&nbsp; Once this path has been cleared, can
we pretend that nothing has happened?&nbsp; Do we pretend that
those who were blown apart by the mines are still among us in one
piece because we do not want to accept that they are mutilated
beyong recognition?&nbsp; Do we then refuse to proceed to the
safety and joy of the promised euphoria?&nbsp; This may not be
the most enlightened symbolism that could be posed, but I'm sure
you can comprehend what it is that I'm inferring. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When first we became aware of the existence of the spiritual
light, a group of us gathered in a place near Papine, in St.
Andrew Parish near Kingston, Jamaica.&nbsp; There was a
manifestation in the embodiment of a guy we knew as Brother Ivy,
one George Baker Ivy.&nbsp; Only a small number of the sisters
and brothers who would at some later times and dates become
associated with this movement actually say and experienced the
vibration of that man during those few short months.&nbsp; This
in no way indicates any special hierarchy because of this
experience or as a result of a lack of this experience.&nbsp; It
is simply, throught the best effort of my memory and my honest
portrayal of the understanding of those events, what
happened.&nbsp; I have a detailed story of how it was that I arrived
at Papine on March 8, 1971, but suffice to say that I was
directed there by Nathan and Cynthia, generally, and, more
specifically, by Howard after I arrived in Miami. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I travelled alone and, when I reached the humble &quot;camp&quot;
in the wilderness I was initially greeted by Ivy, himself, and a
small group of men constructing a foul coup.&nbsp; When I
proceeded to the actual building that was the church, I encountered
Tommy, Gary, Alan, and a fellow named Herbie inside.&nbsp; Herbie was
run off by Keith after Ivy's death for the inforgivable
transgression of trimming his hair.&nbsp; Tommy, Gary, and Alan
became Keith's chosen heirs after his death to the accumulation
of the physical attainments of the ganja enterprise.&nbsp;
Ironic, to say the least.&nbsp; Anyway, Marvin and Andy, Nathan
and Cynthia, Brad, Jake, Sarah, Bobby, Tommy, Howard, Gary, Alan,
Bighead Stevie, Judy, Cliff, myself, and some others who may not
have remained among us for too long attended the spiritual feast
hosted by Ivy.&nbsp; A bevy of African-descendant Jamaicans were
also in attendance, some sporadic and some daily.&nbsp; Keith,
Wally, Dougie (Samson), Kootman, Shine, Blossom, and Flowers were
but a few of these Jamaicans. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Without question; not even the slightest, unmurmured question;
the show, the stage, the script, the spirit, and all of the bit
actors and actresses belonged to Ivy.&nbsp; There was one
pervading and prevalent premise that permeated every singly being
that I personally encountered during this time.&nbsp; This was
not something that was told to you or to anyone upon their
arrival, but once someone had discerned for themselves what was
spiritually taking place, then the accepted premise was openly
discussed by all of those who had what was considered to be <u>that</u>
discernment.&nbsp; What was <u>that</u> discernment?&nbsp; Quite
simply and unequivocally that Ivy was the resurrected spirit of
the Christ spoken of in the scriptures.&nbsp; Quite simply and
irrevocably that Ivy was the embodiment of that divine and holy
spirit which has become known to mankind as the savior of humanity,
the annointed one.&nbsp; Of this one fact there was no
dispute.&nbsp; Of this one fact there was no doubt.&nbsp; Of this
one fact all of those people whom I have previously mentioned
were in agreement.&nbsp; Whatever any of them may say now, or
whatever any of them may have said or done subsequent to the
man's departure from that body, I assure you with every morsel of
consciousness that may exist within me and I vow a solemn oath to
you on the blood coursing through my veins that all of these
people, along with myself, confessed with our mouths that this
man, Ivy, was the Christ.&nbsp; <u>No one</u> challenged his
authority as the only begotten son of that omnipotent God.&nbsp;
I, personally, spoke to Keith of this spiritual phenomenon and
he, as my spiritual equal and brother at that time, wholeheartedly
applauded my awakening and nurtured me personally in the self evident
truth that we were both privy to.&nbsp; It was only after the
death of Ivy and a period of youthful uncertainty and stumbling
that Keith asserted his sagacious knowledge of our blind trust
and became our master rather than our brother. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I will not delve into this transition at length because it is a
matter that each person must acknowledge for themselves.&nbsp; If
each person, both man and woman, examines their personal story of
how they first because aware of this spirit that continues to
bind us in the most unusual manner, then I am certain that they
will be able to link their spiritual awakening, and whatever
awareness they may possess, directly to Ivy.&nbsp; It is a fact
which must be.&nbsp; Whomever you first heard about this thing
called &quot;Doctrine&quot; from can be traced to Ivy.&nbsp; It matters
not whom this person was or these persons were.&nbsp; None of us
can claim ownership of this message of salvation, of these words
or consolation.&nbsp; If, perchance, we were fortunate enough to
be a momentary vessel of the precious promise, this divine
covenant, then let us give thanks.&nbsp; And since we have all
been the recipients of this holy hope of perfect love, then let
us give thanks.&nbsp; We have quibbled for too long.&nbsp; Time
is really gliding on.&nbsp; I can think of no reason to hold on
to animosity for anyone, least of all any of the sisters and the
brothers who share the common hope of the redemption from sin and corruption
that we share.&nbsp; At the same time, I cannot with a clear
conscience whitewash the past into something that is not
true.&nbsp; Once we acknowledge what has happened, either
specific deeds which we have done or the cosmics that we have
collectively experienced, we will be free to laugh and to sing
and to praise.&nbsp; Otherwise, we are bound spiritually from
beholding the glory which we do possess individually and, to a
much greater extent, collectively. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When you, Jeff, expressed bewilderment in one of your previous
letters so long ago concerning the declaration which I made about
Ivy's divinity; that all things have authority only as they are
viewed in the light of his divine sonship, that Ivy is the sone
of God and that this and only this lends credence to any claims
that we may make; I was absolutely flabbergasted by your
incredulity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It really shows how far we all strayed from when first we saw the
light.&nbsp; That someone like yourself, and many others of the
brothers and sisters who came among this congregation after Keith
had usurped control of all of our destinies, could be around
Brad, Jake, Cliff, Tommy, Big Al, etc., etc., etc., and me and not
be acutely aware of Ivy and the indisputable aura of his divinity
which made all of this spirituality that we know and love
possible is a testament to our shamefulness.&nbsp; We should all
hide our nakedness by diving into the valley of disbelieving
unfaithfulness.&nbsp; It is a good thing that God is merciful and
laughs at our frailties. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keith turned us against each other for the love of filthy
lucre.&nbsp; Wally pretended to be a high priest with the
regimented and mandatory hours of prayer.&nbsp; I know that their
attempts to place themselves on a plateau above their brethren
and sisters was an act of treachery and spiritual
wickedness.&nbsp; All that multiple wife shit was a cloak for
satisfying their lusts.&nbsp; They both, Keith and Wally,
willingly sacrificed their brethren and sisters lives so that
they could fulfill their own vain interpretations of the
scripture with them as Moses, Aaron, Peter, James, and John all
of the other starring roles.&nbsp; What assholes!&nbsp; Keith befriended
the nasty gunmen and actually catered to those murdering scoundrels.&nbsp;
The litany of these types of events goes on and on.&nbsp; My hand
is tired.&nbsp; Did you ever notice how few new people came
amongst us as anything other than casual observeres or money
grubbers during their tenure? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the few short months of Ivy's resurrection, a reverberation
transmitted itself to and through literally hundreds of souls and
links them together even today after more than twenty-five years
of various turmoils. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">All of those who would profess to be loyal adherents to the
vanity of the Coptic trip of Keith and company should remember
that the man died alone, most probably of A.I.D.S., shitting up
himself and without the service of even a hot cup of tea.&nbsp;
This seems a cold tribute, but true nevertheless.&nbsp; The poor
guy had to suffer unimaginable loneliness in his last days on
earth and because I knew him well and loved him, I feel the
horrifying emotions that abide outside of the realms of sincere
thanksgiving that have at times overtaken all of us. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Someone had to walk through the minefield to clear away all of
the fatal flaws of a spiritual mortal.&nbsp; These vanities have
been exposed and they can never again withstand the light of
awareness.&nbsp; Some may desire to retain a hierarchy of
hypocrisy but it has become no longer acceptable to a consciousness
that is determined to give glory where glory is due, to give
honor where honor is due.&nbsp; These accolades belong to God
who, though in us all, is far above us all.&nbsp; Man, primarily
man and not so much woman, in his vanity to proclaim himself to
be God has erred continually and abundantly by forgetting and
neglecting the true attributes of the divine nature -- humility,
long-suffering, the joy of service, and a few more that I'm sure
you can recall.&nbsp; Humble yourself and the spirit will cheer
you, humble yourself and you will walk with God.&nbsp; By the
way, despite all the spiritual vibrancy that Ivy exuded, he was a determined
servant to us all and, although regal in every aspect of his
being, he managed to instill spiritual awareness and infailing
charismatic magnetism in all of us that experienced his
resurrection.&nbsp; It was so powerful that we were able to transmit
this purity to others in spite of our own delicate
condition.&nbsp; Again, I remind you, the consciousness that you
possess concerning your own spiritual being can be traced
directly to Ivy through one of his emissaries that I have previously
written about.&nbsp; The seed of the precious fruit was Ivy and
that whole Coptic experience was a diversion from the purity of
that holiness.&nbsp; All of our enthusiasm, all of our exuberance
from the discovery of the font of life, all of our dedication to
do the will of God, all of our desire to serve was recognized by
Keith and selfishly channelled into a smuggling operation which
ultimately brought great riches to Keith and a few others but
finally caused the alienation of the sistes and the brothers
toward each other, Carl &quot;Z-man&quot; Swanson's death, and
prison sentences for a large number of the brothers.&nbsp; So
many things come to my mind about that absolute travesty
masquerading as godliness that it is impossible to even begin to
relate the depths of deceitfulness which occurred among us in
such a limited purview as a short letter.&nbsp; Tomes, with input
from all of the participants, would be required to get the proper
perspective or, perhaps, endless hours of truthful reasoning
would help expose everyone's persistent desire to mask our
participation in a fraudulent counterfeit after we had experienced
and handled the genuine article. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Where does all of this leave us now?&nbsp; Just exactly where we
are.&nbsp; Each of us has a few brothers and sisters from that
spiritual age with whom we communicate and/or associate.&nbsp;
Then, generally speaking, there is a larger number of brothers
and sisters from the said era with whom no contact or association
is desired.&nbsp; This category is loathed, coveted, or presumed
to be cursed for some self-serving reason which only the
individual, themself, knows.&nbsp; This completely illogical,
nasty, and unchristianlike reasons to harbor ill-will may have
even stemmed from a time when Keith or Wally, sitting on their spurious
throne of judgment, pronounced that the poor brother or sister in question
was, indeed, &quot;fuckery.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, this lent
justification to depise the dear soul into eternity.&nbsp; How
ludicrous and downright mean-spirited are these nerds?&nbsp; And
they want someone to take them seriously.&nbsp; Even their prayer
is sin.&nbsp; And the longer and the more persistently stubborn
someone opts to be in holding onto these unclean spirits, the
more insistent that someone determines to be in defending the
wickedness of that exclusionary little club of scurrilous nincompoops,
then the longer it will be before we can &quot;Behold how good
and how pleasant it is for sisters and brothers to dwell together
in unity.&quot;&nbsp; And that does not mean everyone living in
one house while other houses stand empty awaiting a cache of
smuggled ganja. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I cannot predict how it should be or how it will be or how it
won't be.&nbsp; I am, however, absolutely confident that when
people genuinely love one another, then they can solve any
problems which may arise with ease and minimal effort.&nbsp; You
cannot condemn someone that you love!&nbsp; Leave those weighty matters
to God.&nbsp; We can resist any evil behavior so that it does not
enter into our <u>own</u> realm or action, but we must always be
ready to forgive, especially those we <u>know</u> to be
sojourners with us on this path whose destination leads us to a
perfect praise of that perfect spirit that we have tasted of and
known.&nbsp; Outside of this simple, realistic desire to achieve
this acceptable demeanor, all else results in vanity and vexation
of the spirit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">That was a pretty long-winded dissertation about a subject that
is so long in the past.&nbsp; See what your short note to me
inspired.&nbsp; And believe me, I really had to restrain myself
lest a more scathing analysis of our collective present condition
had poured forth. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This past summer was noteworthy to me because of some very nice encounters
that Judy was fortunate enough to experience.&nbsp; She
thoroughly enjoyed each one and realizes how uplifting the
special bond is between all of these old characters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Over the 4th of July she went up to Billie's and Pop's house with
Jane Swanson and Irene (Chuck's wife).&nbsp; Gary and Eileen were
there and Bobby.&nbsp; Sweet reminiscing and a touch of
spontaneous praise. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nate and Cynthia and Marvin and Andy visited here in Iowa City
and, of course, the subject was our mutual experience and the
blessedness of this holy spirit that we know and love. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jane and Joel came though Iowa with Blossom and Big Bob in tow
and spent a short time together on some land that Jane has in
southern Iowa.&nbsp; Plenty of kids, Rich Cone, and a few other
folks who had experienced this spirit but were never considered a
part of the fellowship because they didn't have Keith's sanction.&nbsp;
They didn't even know him, but are a part of that spirit family nonetheless.&nbsp;
Plenty of stories and updates always accompany each of these folks
about other of the brothers and sisters whom we may not have been fortunate
enough to see just yet.&nbsp; All are languishing, whether they
realize it or not, for the company of their spiritual
sibblings.&nbsp; All are languishing to see the saints and to
harmonize with others of this limitless family of Ivy's
offspring.&nbsp; All await, whether consciously or
subconsciously, for the fullfillment of that promise that we
heard when first we saw the light. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Samson claims, via Nate and Cindy, that he should be the elder
who is heir to whatever remains of the skeletal bones of the
Coptic and that he wants the St. Thomas property only to have a
place for the brothers and sisters to congregate when and if they
are ever moved to do such a thing. :-)&nbsp; I can only speak for
myself.&nbsp; I have everything that I had hoped for when I first
heard this blessed promise.&nbsp; I can actually sing psalms and
I love to do it even though at present it is an exercise I
perform alone.&nbsp; If this is my sole inheritance, I know that
I am blessed.&nbsp; I have the armaments to carry me through any
battle from both enemies within and enemies without.&nbsp; I
remember Samson as a real jovial and uplifting character at
certain times.&nbsp; When he started his routine about Mr. Mach-a-vah
come from afar riding on his pimbacarry he could certainly entertain
anyone.&nbsp; His rendition of &quot;From Greenland's Icy
Mountains&quot; is truly divine.&nbsp; His long-suffering is not
forgotten.&nbsp; But then, as with all of us, there are certain
aspects of his personality that must be left behind because we
all know that &quot;You cannot get to Zion with a carnal
mind.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In any event, we march on to tomorrow.&nbsp; Who can say what it
will bring?&nbsp; We maintain our individual hopes.&nbsp; We
know, and God certainly knows, what it is that we truly hope for. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If I have provided you with a little food for your spirit to
process, then I am glad.&nbsp; If not, then I am almost as
glad.&nbsp; I know that your hope is a blessed hope simply from
the things which you say and my limited knowledge of your activities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I can see good in each of the oldtime sisters and brothers.&nbsp;
I sincerely long to see each one of them and to probe the regions
of Zion that we have journeyed to in times post.&nbsp; I suspect
that we are all a bit more familiar with the surroundings this
time around and will not get lost so easily. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When Judy was with Gary and the rest that I previously mentioned
at Billie's place near Chicago last summer, Gary reminisced about
a recent moment that he had spent with Tommy and some others in
Miami.&nbsp; He said something like, &quot;If Tommy is ever
released from the feds ominous threat of another trial that 'all hell
will break loose',&quot; meaning that &quot;Bro. Louv&quot; will
somehow resurrect into the awesome reviver of the Coptic
legacy.&nbsp; I say Tommy is not going to bust even a single
grape until he acknowledges the Vanity Fair of the whole Coptic episode
and refreshes his memory concerning the enormous vitality that he
was infused with by Ivy in the very beginning.&nbsp; He must stop
pretending to be the Apostle Paul or Brother Louv and just be
content with being Brother Tommy who, in reality, is one of the
most lovely and lovable creatures of all time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cliff sent a message via E-mail to Carl asking the rhetorical
question, &quot;What happened to the brethren?&quot;&nbsp; If
anyone has even the slightest comprehension concerning what
really happened to the sisters and the brothers, I suspect it would
be old Cliff.&nbsp; How ironic that Tommy and Cliff have been
within a few miles of each other for over 10 years and each has
their own reasons for remaining aloof.&nbsp; I know them both
quite well and love each for his stubborn faithlessness.&nbsp;
Come on down, boys and girls, there is no difference here.&nbsp;
I love the memory of each, for that is all that I have.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">I remain, then, the old goat who has lost his bleat, -- Jim </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Louv brother Carl,</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I know that it's been a little while since I
returned something for the last letter you sent me but sometimes
I'm just not in the letter writing mood plus there's not much new
to tell you anyway.&nbsp; It's still the same old fuckery going
on here, it seems like everytime the guards change shifts (the
police change every quarter so we get a few new assholes every
three months) we have to go through a bunch of extra shit until
we break them in or else we just get used to them and learn how
to work around the assholes.&nbsp; It's funny how people learn to
adapt to most any situation and one thing that's good about
suffering is that it forces people to stand together that would
be hating each other under normal circumstances.&nbsp; I also
like to believe the old cliche that &quot;Suffering builds character.&quot;&nbsp;
Sometimes I do wonder though if people that suffer get any reward in
the long run because you see people all over the earth suffering
and they never get any relief.&nbsp; Who knows maybe they get
some kind of blessing that we can't see but like you said
&quot;God is with those with the biggest armies or the most
money.&quot;&nbsp; Of course there has to be suffering to change
wrongs that are being done and when you're suffering for a cause
or something you believe in it can give you a certain pride and
dignity that is a blessing in itself.&nbsp; The difference
between people who know what they're suffering for and people who don't
are like night and day, people that go into suffering sacrificing
and giving up small pleasures to make things better (or a hope of
making things better) in the long run get a self worth and self
respect that is like no other.&nbsp; It's a feeling that a person
gets when they know that they might have some effect on the future
of or on the betterment of the human race.&nbsp; It's this spirit
or desire to change things that has made man progress this far
and have made man willing to give up their lives if necessary for
something they believe in.&nbsp; So my point is that maybe the
blessing that one gets for suffering is the feeling of
satisfaction or self worth that a person feels or maybe suffering
is something that is necessary to make man learn how to live
together in peace and how to better themselves in the long
run.&nbsp; Maybe that's why the Bible says that we should &quot;Bear
our suffering with joy,&quot; maybe our little minds can't
comprehend the blessing that we get because we can't see the big
picture of how mankind benefits through our suffering. <br>
<spacer type="horizontal" size="50">Brother Jeffery wrote me a letter and sent me a few old pictures
the other day which was very nice of him to take the time to
do.&nbsp; However, some of the thanks goes to you because he said
that it was through your letters (or maybe it was through the
&quot;Internet computer system&quot; because he also said
something about that) that he learned that I wanted some old
pictures.&nbsp; I wrote him back and thanked him and I also told
him what I thought led to the brothers' down fall and why I feel
that they haven't been able to resurrect anything.&nbsp; Even though
I was young I saw how things progressed, as I'm sure you know my father
was one of the first white brothers in Jamaica.&nbsp; I knew
brother Ivy, I lived at every house (except the one right before
his death) that &quot;Niah Keith&quot; (with brother Keith and
his family) ever lived at in Jamaica, his children were like brothers
and sisters to me.&nbsp; I lived with brother Wally, Brother
Cootman (that was sister Phyllis's father) and shit I even lived
at brother Dohgie's (Laurenton Dickens's) house (me being the <u>only</u>
white person there) in Bull Bay for about four months (I was
about 9 years old at the time) one time while my parents were in
America.&nbsp; I lived with my family in America at all the
places (I'm sure that you remember that my family lived up in
Maine) where they made the moves and <u>I was at all three</u> of
(the ranch, the Canal and Maine) the big busts and I went to a
juvenile (the Canal and Maine) home on two of them.&nbsp; I'm
just stating all of this to say that I was there from the
beginning (the beginning meaning when the white brothers first
went to Jamaica) so I saw how things manifested through
time.&nbsp; As I told brother Jeffery in my letter to him, the
thing that the brothers had in the beginning that drew them
together, the thing that made them able to work together and
accomplish so much in such a short time was the louv and unity
they had for each other in the beginning.&nbsp; After a while through
the hunger for power and greed certain ones set themselves up on
a pedestal (as big Bob would say &quot;The Elderberries&quot;)
and started to think that they were some how more holy than their
brother.&nbsp; It shifted from equality to some kind of a pecking
order where instead of looking out for their brothers &amp; sisters best
interest all they could do is play politics and think they were
better than other people.&nbsp; Really I think it's a disgrace
how the brothers ended up hating each other, no wonder not even
their own children wanted to live that kind of life style.&nbsp;
What ever you do you can't leave out the youth because young people
are the future so you have to teach them what you know.&nbsp;
That's another thing that the brothers did wrong, with all those
big smart Coptic Priests around it's funny how they didn't teach
the children shit, they should have at least taught us how to
drive those boats, if they would have maybe I wouldn't be here
right now. :-)&nbsp; As I said the only thing that the brothers
had at one time that made them different from the rest of the
world was the louv (that's the spirit that, if used in the right
frame of mind, ganja enhances) so when they lost that for each
other they couldn't set an example for or draw anyone.&nbsp; For the brothers
to ever come together in a spirit again they have to put aside
all the bad thought and hatred that they carry for each
other.&nbsp; How did the old saying go?&nbsp; &quot;Think right
love and pray and you'll live in rejoicing every day.&quot;&nbsp;
Louv is what the world is lacking and that's the key.&nbsp;
Fighting for the freedom of ganja is good but if you can't
display and give people the understanding of the frame of mind
that you're supposed to be in when you smoke it then people might
get the wrong concept (especially young people) of the spirit
that it induces and go on to abuse it just like most everyone
else does.&nbsp; Ganja is a medicine it can be easily
abused.&nbsp; I believe that in the beginning the brothers had
the spirit that the herb enhances but as time went on they lost
that spirit and ganja became the focal point (I know that I
abused it) and that's when they started to abuse it.&nbsp; It doesn't
do any good to point the finger at anybody because we all make mistakes
in life, (what was the old saying, &quot;We all sin and fall
short of the glory of God&quot;) so the idea is to lift each
other and try not to make those same mistakes again.&nbsp; Maybe
one day after the brothers get beat hard enough they'll forget
about the bad feelings that they carry for each other and come
together and have some fun.&nbsp; I'm not going to hold my breath
though. :-(<br>

<p>September 6, 1996 </p>

<p>Carl, </p>

<p>I found a few minutes to write <a href="jim-02.html"> a few
lines</a> to <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/harkin01.html"> Tom
Harkin</a>.&nbsp; I don't have much confidence, as you probably
know, in either the judicial or the legislative branches of the
U.S. Government.&nbsp; I tried to be brief and to the point and,
as you will see in reading the enclosed copy, I did not attempt
to employ diplomacy.&nbsp; It is difficult for me to see any of
these politicians, lawyers, judges, etc. as being the least bit
compassionate or even attempting to understand people who use
herb or advocate the use of herb. If these elected officials
sincerely believed that the herb is evil, I could more readily
accept their mealy-mouthed stance against its use in any
capacity.&nbsp; But I am thoroughly convinced of their conscious
participation in a heartless, esoteric ploy, the goal of which is
known by these fraudulent marionettes who masquerade as my
representative and who pretend to have my well-being as the
motive of their profession.&nbsp; I know that this is a lie and
that they represent the interests of those who have enabled them
to achieve the lofty position that is indicated by their
particular title.&nbsp; Pain and suffering are not their concern
unless it happens to befall them or their families. I'm sure my
letter will do neither good nor harm for <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers2.html"> Allen Helmers</a>'
tribulation because the political machine is determined to keep
marijuana from the people at all cost and these demons will treat <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Mr. Helmers</a> with
the same bloodstained hands with which the have slain so many
before him. I invoked the names of Jake and <a
href="../tropic.html"> Tommy</a> because the incident actually
took place and because there are warriors in this great conflict
who know something about this subject and they are both armed
with the spiritual weapons that can make these imposters
regurgitate.&nbsp; When and if they resurrect these dreadful
swords of the spirit is a question I am incapable or
addressing.&nbsp; We both know that some elementary exercises in
humility and some very real and elementary exorcisms of vanity,
pride, and ill-will are required on an individual basis before we
can once again proclaim with conviction, &quot;One God for us
all.&quot; Judy has spent some time this summmer with many
seemingly incompatible spirits from days gone by.&nbsp; Sisters
Billie, Eileen, Jane S., Jane Z., Blossom, Irene L., Cynthia,
Andy, Chris N., and probably a few more I cannot recall.&nbsp;
Brothers Booblius, Rich Cone, Nate, Marv, Chuck L., Joel Z., and
I know some others who slip my mind - Pops and Gary to name
two.&nbsp; Bobby Kleine, too.&nbsp; Plus having talked to Lancer
on the phone and having heard about dozens more via the old
grapevine.&nbsp; Several Jamaicans having joined Stevie
Kleinschmidt on the journey over yonder.&nbsp; Judy loved the
company of each one and longs to talk and sing with as many more
as would be physically possible because she feels a &quot;special
bond&quot; with all of these fine folks.&nbsp; No shit!!&nbsp; I
wonder why?&nbsp; Could it be that we hold something in common
that is magical in its mystery and yet so real to all of
us?&nbsp; We are only depriving ourselves of something holy and
divine if we attempt to exclude anyone.&nbsp; No one need
worry.&nbsp; I can't come just yet, but sometime in May of 2024
I'll be there.&nbsp; Save me a seat, Carl.&nbsp; Better get right
with God, come and do it now, and at the cross of King Alpha and
Queen Omega we lay our burden down!&nbsp; No one is better than
anyone else and, thank God, no one is any worse.&nbsp; What a
glory when we'll all be there.&nbsp; Have I lost my mind?&nbsp; I
actually do love all these characters, and more.&nbsp; Keep up
the good work. <a href="../ganjaman.html"> Jim</a> </font></tt> </p>

<P>Hello Carl,
<DD>Please ignore the surplus Hallmark.&nbsp;  It was free from the chapel so I picked up a few.&nbsp;  I am, however, happy for you because it seems a worthwhile expenditure of the happy emotion.
<DD>I thank you for your continued consideration of an old goat like unto <A HREF="../ganjaman.html"> myself</A>.&nbsp;  I appreciate your thoughtful assistance toward my postal expenditures and I am well supplied with stamps even though I have been a bit negligent in communicating with those that I should be communicating with and also with several folks who, more than likely, have no desire whatsoever in hearing from me.&nbsp;  Believe me.&nbsp;  My musings and my meditations are not of a type which would be extremely popular with the masses.&nbsp;  And they are not of a carnal nature, as I have by some act of divine grace been able to subdue those pesky, guilt-ridden little morsels of banality.&nbsp;  HOORAY!
<DD>I always enjoy receiving your newsletters and I laud your efforts to somehow make a reasonable argument of common sense to a set of religiously and politically indoctrinated, self-serving coterie of prejudiced money-grubbers whose motives are not righteous and who have redefined justice and liberty to suit themselves and their puppeteers.
<DD>But over all, what I have enjoyed the most from what you have sent to me were the letters from <A HREF="brian-02.html"> Brian</A> and your <A HREF="olsen-02.html"> replies</A>.&nbsp;  Whichever came first I do not know, and which was a reply I cannot say, but I will say that I am very proud to be Brian's father and his perception of humanity is very moving to me.&nbsp;  It was very kind of you to show an interest in the young man and to encourage him in the manner that you have.&nbsp;  I know he has to be uplifted whenever he receives any correspondence from anyone.&nbsp;  He has been persecuted to a draconian degree because of the herb and he has withstood all of these diabolical forces.&nbsp;  Regardless of what anyone may think about ganja and society's resistance to people like Brian and myself who refuse to acquiesce to the mischief that they say is law, we will most likely remain the stubborn, stupid, quixotic dolts that we are until they succeed in squeezing the life out of us.
<DD>Judy has been seeing a lot of the old <A HREF="../sixtymin.html"> brothers and sisters</A> over the past several months and she has been completely delighted in the company of each and every one of them even though some animosities and a variety of misunderstanding seems to linger between various cliques so to speak.&nbsp;  Is it possible that these old characters could ever be of one heart, one aim, one destiny as well all professed when first we saw the light?&nbsp;  Of course it is possible.&nbsp;  Is it probable?&nbsp;  Only the bookmakers know the odds on that one.&nbsp;  When Cliff sends you the cryptic little question, "What happened to the brethren?" I suspect that this is simply a rhetorical question disguised as some great mystery.&nbsp;  I suspect we all have some clue as to what happened to us as individuals and also what happened to us as a collective group.&nbsp;  There were also many sisters.&nbsp;  So the question is not simply, "What happened to the brethren?"&nbsp;  More aptly, "What happened to the sisters and the brethren?"&nbsp;  Note: I now put the ladies before the hairy reasoners.
<DD>I received the Garvey book.&nbsp;  Thanks!&nbsp;  I will write something to the Senator and I'll send you a copy.&nbsp;  I love you all very much and almost all of my thoughts are of the HOOD.&nbsp;  Female & male.&nbsp;  Jane Zimmerwoman is a great gal.&nbsp;
<DD>Jim

<P>Dear Carl
<DD>Hope all is well.&nbsp;  I haven't heard from you for a long time.
<DD>I recently heard about a recent 8th Circuit decision pertaining to a group of Rastas having the right to a freedom of religion defense in regards to possession of some marijuana they were growing.
<DD>I assume that you published part of the decision in the Iowa NORML newsletter.&nbsp;  The last newsletter I have from you is the fall of 1995.&nbsp;  Please send me your latest newsletter containing the said decision if possible.
<DD>I recently returned from a trip to Florida.&nbsp;  While there I read some articles in Hemp Magazine out of Texas.&nbsp;  The articles were implying that the DEA was overstepping its authority when they opposed farmers in Colorado trying to get the right to grow hemp for commercial purposes.&nbsp;  The DEA also goes public declaring that marijuana is not a medicine & even had an agent at a protest against a radio station in Massachusetts that was playing marijuana songs.&nbsp;  The article was saying that the DEA is paid to enforce the law not make it.
<DD>Do you think that a class action lawsuit against the DEA on behalf of the sick & dying, the farmers who want to grow hemp commercially, the environmentalists who know hemp is good for the environment, those who would use marijuana as a spiritual sacrament, etc., is feasible?
<DD>Looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.
<DD>Jeff

<P>Louv Brother Brian,

<P><DD>Thanks for <A HREF="brian-01.html"> the letter</A>.&nbsp;  Thanks also for the comments on Judas, and for saying that I don't fit the role.&nbsp;  I wasn't suggesting that I play that role, I was merely addressing the fact that Christ loved Judas.&nbsp;  This goes to the part where Christ talked about loving your enemies and doing good to them that hate you and despitefully use you.&nbsp;  That was all I was getting at.&nbsp;  As for telling my story, I'm sure a lot of the old church members would consider my version a complete betrayal of everything they believe in.&nbsp;  I don't smoke the herb, for one thing.&nbsp;  I consider the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church to have fallen because of selling the herb.&nbsp;  I doubt very much if my views would be received with much sympathy from them.&nbsp;  What I was getting at was that I don't give Judas the opportunity to kill me.&nbsp;  I don't have any secrets which cannot be revealed.&nbsp;  I've certainly done some embarrassing things that would make me feel ashamed to speak of them in public, but nothing that would put me (or anyone else) in a prison cell.&nbsp;  I agree that Judas ended up destroying himself because of his actions, but it wasn't because Christ held any bad feelings toward him.&nbsp;  You can rejoice in the knowledge that anyone who treats you treacherously will live in torment, although I'm not exactly sure that's something to rejoice over.&nbsp;  I'd prefer it if people didn't act treacherously at all.&nbsp;  I try not to give them the opportunity.&nbsp;  At any rate, I was simply looking at things from my own perspective.&nbsp;  I stopped smoking the herb so that no one would have control over me, particularly the informer.&nbsp;  I suppose an informer could make something up from imagination, but at least it would be a lie.&nbsp;  The way I was living before, the informer could have told the truth, like Judas, and put me away for a long time.&nbsp;  I'll admit that it takes more than an informer's word sometimes (although not all the time, since your dad is living proof of that), but usually it takes some actual evidence to back it up.&nbsp;  In my case, an informer could say I was breaking the law, but it would be difficult to prove it, since I don't.&nbsp;  I'm looking to partake of my sacrament openly, or at least legally.&nbsp;  I could do that in Holland, and I may move there some day.&nbsp;  I think we should all be thinking about the very real world we live in, instead of isolating ourselves in some camp somewhere and selling herb to everyone to pay for it (a recipe for disaster, in my opinion).&nbsp;  Prison taught me one thing, and that was that God was not on my side.&nbsp;  As Marcus Garvey so wisely said, God doesn't take sides.&nbsp;  Garvey liked what Napoleon had to say about it, "God is on the side with the biggest battalion."&nbsp;  So far, we don't even have a security guard any more.&nbsp;  I'd say we have some organizing to do.
<BR><DD>Thanks for the news about Stevie.&nbsp;  I think I heard about it from someone else - maybe it was you.&nbsp;  I agree that he was a good brother.&nbsp;  Keep in touch.
<P><DD>Sincerely,
<P><DD>Carl E. Olsen

<P>Louv Brother Carl,

<P><DD>As you know sometimes it takes me a while to find the inspiration to respond to letters, but I do make a mental note of it and always do try to get around to it eventually.&nbsp;  My conscience starts to bother me (which I believe is Goud's spirit working inside of a person) when I don't take the time to reciprocate or show some kind of appreciation for a letter or something someone has done for me.&nbsp;  Anyway, I received <A HREF="olsen-01.html"> your letter</A> and as always I do enjoy hearing from you.&nbsp;  Now to comment on some of the things in <A HREF="olsen-01.html"> your letter</A>.&nbsp;  First let me say that I don't mind at all you sending some copies of <A HREF="brian-01.html"> my last letter</A> to some of the brothers or even if you put it on "Internet," really I'm flattered that you think it's good enough and that other people would actually be interested in reading it.&nbsp;  I didn't think that my letter writing skills were that good especially since I just learned (one good thing I got out of coming to prison) how to half-way write a letter in the last couple of years.&nbsp;  Plus I never did call anyone's name (in the personal things I wrote) so I don't see where it could possibly do any harm.&nbsp;  Shit, in fact it might even do some good.&nbsp;  Maybe one of those "Assholes" that I was talking about will see it and their conscience (Goud) will start bothering them.&nbsp;  This brings us back to the topic of "Judas" which at one point in your letter (surprisingly) you compared yourself to.&nbsp;  Of course there is many ways that a "Judas" can manifest himself but I don't see where you would fit in any of those categories.&nbsp;  I don't know of any time where you sold out your brothers' or friends' trust, that you betrayed for personal gain, or to save you from some pain.&nbsp;  I don't know of any time when you and someone were in on something together and then you sold them out when the going got rough, or a time when you ever turned your back on a brother in need.&nbsp;  You've never pinned any person (by name) to any particular event.&nbsp;  Because you want to tell of your old experiences and adventures that doesn't make you a "Judas," plus you tell everyone straight up (since you've come to this frame of mind) not to tell you their secrets.&nbsp;  You try to stay away from people (all the old brothers that might have something to hide) that have secrets to prevent anything from ever being told.&nbsp;  Mind you, I don't necessarily agree with all of your views but I don't hold them against you and I damn sure don't look at you as a "Judas."&nbsp;  Now I'm going to comment on some of the other aspects of "Judas" and his judgment.&nbsp;  Let me ask you a question, Who do you think put it in "Judas'" heart to kill himself?&nbsp;  Wasn't it the love that Christ had and the goodness that he showed "Judas" that made his conscience (which I believe is the spirit of Goud that makes it hard for a man to live with his wickedness) bother him so much that he had to go kill himself?&nbsp;  If you believe that Goud works through man and knows the heart of every man then it was Goud who put it in his heart to kill himself.&nbsp;  I don't know if it's true or not but from what I understand suicide is the only sin that can't be forgiven.&nbsp;  So if you look at it from that perspective Goud did turn "Judas into dog meat."&nbsp;  I believe that the Bible is a parable book and the story of "Judas" just shows that a disloyal person has not been respected since the beginning of time.
<BR><DD>I don't know if you heard this or not but just in case you didn't "Brother Stevie" (A.K.A. "Broke Back") got killed, by a drunken driver, in St. Louis not too long ago.&nbsp;  I was sorry to hear it he was a good brother.&nbsp;  <BR><DD>From the dungeons of "Babylon" your brother always.
<BR><DD>Louv, Brian
<P>P.S. If you can send me another one of those "<A HREF="../tropic.html">Louv Story</A>" pamphlets.

<P>Dear Brian,

<P><DD>Thanks for the letter.&nbsp;  I hope you don't mind if I send copies to some of the brothers and post it on my <A HREF="../coptic.html"> COPTIC page</A> on the World Wide Web (Internet).&nbsp;  I almost hesitate to publish it because of some of the very personal things you said, but I think you can explain them or retract them, as the case may be, so that it is only a manifestation of your thoughts at the time you wrote them.&nbsp;  The first issue you brought up that concerns me is your statement about hating "Judas."&nbsp;  I wonder if you think that Christ hated Judas.&nbsp;  My understanding has always been that Christ loved Judas just as much as the other disciples.&nbsp;  As a matter of fact, shortly after I stopped smoking ganja, I started calling myself "the informer," because I wanted people to know that I was no longer keeping any secrets.&nbsp;  If you have a secret, don't tell it to me.&nbsp;  Somewhere in the Bible it talks about there being no secret that will not be revealed.&nbsp;  I think there's another line about that which was spoken in secret will be shouted from the rooftops, or something like that.&nbsp;  When I stopped smoking ganja, I also keyed on the scripture where Christ tells his disciples that he will no longer partake of the sacrament until he partakes of it new with them in the kingdom of God.&nbsp;  We were always taught that you make heaven or hell out of your life here on earth, not somewhere up in the sky.&nbsp;  So that means that we have to make marijuana legal, or at least have the power to tell the world that we use it without being persecuted for it (that would be my idea of heaven on earth).&nbsp;  I think we can assume that Christ had the power to turn Judas into dog meat.&nbsp;  It was only Christ's obedience to his father that caused him to allow Judas to play the role that he did, to serve as a warning to the rest of us not to play Judas' role.
<P><DD>Thanks for letting me know what you've heard about Tom Reilly.&nbsp;  It's unreal how many years that man has been out on appeal bail.&nbsp;  I always figured that it was a government plot to keep him quiet (looks like it worked).&nbsp;  After all, he was the spokesman and he made them very uncomfortable by going on <A HREF="../sixtymin.html"> 60 Minutes</A> and giving all those <A HREF="../tropic.html"> media interviews</A>.&nbsp;  Anyway, it just goes to show you that the high will be brought low and the low will be brought high, and everything will even out in the end.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was also interested in hearing about Brother Dogie, although the last time I talked to him (a year or two ago) he said he didn't want to be involved with the property at St. Thomas.&nbsp;  This is an unusual turn of events, although I guess I'm not surprised.&nbsp;  My reason for not wanting to have any connection to the property in St. Thomas is because I quit selling and smoking ganja.&nbsp;  As far as I'm concerned, that property in St. Thomas is just a dead weight.&nbsp;  It's the last remnant of a life that I left behind - a life that I've been trying to kill.&nbsp;  I have pity for poor Brother Dogie wanting to tie that dead weight around his own neck, but I guess that's just the way it all has to work out.&nbsp;  As for Jane, I'm sure she's just as happy as I am that she has nothing to do with it.
<P><DD>Thanks for Mike Hatfield's number.&nbsp;  I haven't gotten hold of him yet, but I'll keep trying.&nbsp;  Keep in touch and let me know what you think about my comments.
<P><DD>Sincerely,
<P><DD>Carl E. Olsen

<p><font size="4"><tt>June 22, 1996 </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Louv Brother Carl, </tt></font></p>

<p><DD><font size="4"><tt>First let me tell you that I did receive
both of your last packages and I did find the contents very
interesting, in fact that's just the kind of stuff that I've
wanted (I'm referring to the </tt></font><a href="../coptic.html"><font
size="4"><tt>literature</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt> on the
brothers) because every time I try to explain to people how I
grew up it's hard for them to comprehend or relate to the full
picture of the spirit and mind set of the thing.&nbsp; Of course
they can all grasp and usually like the concept of smoking ganja
in Church but it's hard for them to understand (which was far more
important) the powerful spirit of louv and brotherhood that drew
the true brothers together.&nbsp; Even though everyone loved to
burn ganja that was not the main essence of the spirit, that just
intensified the spirit that was already there.&nbsp; I love to
burn herb and I know that you do too (we used to smoke it
together all the time) but that is not what makes us
brothers.&nbsp; What makes us brothers is that we care about and
try to uplift a fellow brother or sister in whatever little way
we can.&nbsp; Everyone might disagree on certain things but when
you can come together in unity and put aside your differences or compromise
on them I don't think that there is any greater feeling than that
and I believe that that was the essence of the brothers.&nbsp;
That spirit was even why the brothers were so successful in the
ganja movements, it's just sad that most of them carry bad
thought against or even hate each other now.&nbsp; Anyway, back
to the subject of trying to get people to try to understand the
kind of life that I grew up in, that's the reason why one time I
had asked you to send me some of the old pictures (since I know
that you were the main picture man) so that I could show them to people,
but I remember that you told me that you had left all of your old
pictures out at Jim's farm in Miami. :-(&nbsp; Now second, I want to
thank you for the money that you sent me, that was very kind and
thoughtful of you, I do appreciate it and I won't ever forget
it.&nbsp; Shit, that's two weeks at the commissary for me. :-)&nbsp;
Loyalty and devotion is also something that I learned to value
and respect from both growing up in the Church and, of course,
from my </tt></font><a href="../ganjaman.html"><font size="4"><tt>father</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> which has always been a very loyal person.&nbsp;
Shit, I could have been out of prison a long time ago if I would have
wanted to sell out my so-called friends and brothers (I say
&quot;so-called&quot; because most of them wouldn't even take the
time to write me a letter now) but growing up the way I did
tought and instilled in me to hate &quot;Judas&quot; (informer)
which is a principle (even though most of the people that I was
loyal to didn't really appreciate it) that I'm happy I have
because I know that it's a principle that no amount of money in
the world can buy, either you have it or you don't.&nbsp; Still
even in the belly of the beast I have to count my
blessings.&nbsp; Speaking of bing in the &quot;Belly of the
beast&quot; I don't know if you know it of not but I'm still in
the &quot;Hole&quot; where I've been now for nine months now
(since October 24) and they say that I have nine more to
go.&nbsp; Yes, they've put me on &quot;Terrorist status&quot; and
they're trying to punish me hard for the riot that happened last
year.&nbsp; Of course, this is against their own law (in the BOP
rule book it says that it's a violation of our human rights to
keep us in segregation for any longer than 180 days) but they're
getting around their own laws by saying that we are a &quot;long
term hold over.&quot;&nbsp; As I'm sure you know the law was made
only for us, they can break them whenever they get ready, it's a
prime example of &quot;Just-us.&quot;&nbsp; Supposedly we are
waiting on bed space in a penitentiary but the truth is that we
are down here being punished over and over again.&nbsp;
&quot;This is definitely the bloodclot beast.
<DD>Now to bring you up to date on a little of the recent gossip on
some of your old brethren.&nbsp; I heard that the government was
revoking </tt></font><a href="../tropic.html"><font size="4"><tt>Brother
Louv</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt>'s (new name &quot;Brother Nate&quot;)
appeal bond or whatever the fuck he was out of prison on, I had
thought that he was all finished with (especially since he's been
out so long) that bullshit but I guess that there is still
something hanging over his head.&nbsp; Anyway I heard that they
want him to go back to prison for a few months and then start on
his five years of parole.&nbsp; If that was his reason for not
wanting to talk to any of the old brothers they ended up fucking
him anyway and now he'll really have a good reason.&nbsp; Another thing
I heard is that brother (elderberry) Dogie was suing the brothers
for the farm up in St. Thomas because he says that &quot;He's the
last surviving elderberry so the farm is rightfully
his.&quot;&nbsp; It's really something how some brothers gave
their life to build the thing and then other ones reaped all the
rewards.&nbsp; I mean why wasn't sister Jane given a piece of the
land after brother Carl died?&nbsp; I don't know but I would say
that the elderberries were some real shit when it came to looking
out for their brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Oh yes, by the way, I
talked to Michael Hatfield (the lawyer) the other day and he
asked me if you were hooked up to the &quot;Internet computer
system&quot; which at the time I hadn't gotten your package yet
so I told him that I didn't know.&nbsp; Needless to say that it
was quite a coincidence when a couple of days after he asked me
that I received your package telling me about your </tt></font><a
href="../../"><font size="4"><tt>Internet</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt> work.&nbsp; Anyway he was curious to know what you
were doing lately so if you want to give him a call sometime
here's his phone number 352-669-2131.&nbsp; I would give you a
call but I only get one phone call every two weeks so I usually call
my Mother.&nbsp; Can you believe that the Warden here has the
same name as you?&nbsp; Maybe he's some family to you and you
could call him up and tell him to take it easy on me.
<DD>Well my brother I'm going to end this letter here but let me say
that I think the &quot;Internet&quot; thing is a good idea.&nbsp; Obviously
it's a good way to spread the word, you've already found a good
brother (</tt></font><a href="harrison.html"><font size="4"><tt>Christopher
Harrison</tt></font></a><font size="4"><tt>) that's hungry for
some true brothers and some doctrine, it sounds like he already
has the spirit.&nbsp; I'm not much of a letter writer but I'll
write him a letter as soon as I get caught up.
<DD>I thank you again for being a good brother to both me and my </tt></font><a
href="../ganjaman.html"><font size="4"><tt>father</tt></font></a><font
size="4"><tt>. <br>
<DD>Much louv and respect, <br>
<DD>your brother <br>
<DD>always, <br>

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=+1>May 24, 1996 <BR>
Dear Brother Olsen, <BR>
<DD>I am writing this letter to you to ask that more information
about my Father's first Family, The Coptic Church, be sent to me by mail
at 600 Lindsay Ave., Sacramento, CA 95838, under the name of Christopher
Harrison.&nbsp; I would also like to thank you for your work, which without I may never have been brought back to knowing my Father.&nbsp; For as long as I can remember, I have been studying the Bible (King James and various translations of it), trying to understand Him.&nbsp; Growing up in the Baptist Church (offspring of the orignial falsity, The Catholic Church), I had been taught, along with the rest of the lost spirits, that my Father is a mystery; and that He always will be a mystery to me.&nbsp; This ignorance has led me to believe in the status quo (evil), leading me into the life- (actually death-) time pursuit of being a lawyer.&nbsp; I had applied to law schools, thinking that, upon acceptance, I would be completed &amp; happy.&nbsp; (This went along with the belief that this was the sky God's will.)&nbsp; It was not until some days ago that I realized that this sky god is actually Satan, trying to lead me astray.&nbsp; <BR><DD>It was at this point that I realized the Light, and knew that I could not remain sinless in this world.&nbsp; I knew that Goud was real, and that my spirit needs to return to be among the Brethren, the Coptics.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>I came to the Truth after months of prayer and sacrifice,
leading me to search for <A HREF="../../"> your page</A> on the Internet.&nbsp; When I first read it, I was convinced that there was truth in it; but it was not until I continued the search that I was able to confirm that it was all Truth through reading the passages of our forefathers (the Essenes and the Gnostics).&nbsp; It was during this time that I knew it was time for me to return to the ways of my Father.<BR>
<DD>As you may well understand, I am full yet not satisfied, in
want yet I have everything.&nbsp; I write to you because I now know what work my Father has for me: not to study the laws and precepts of those spirits who are bound by Satan, but to study the laws and ways of my ancestors.&nbsp; In this, I may continue towards knowledge and carry on His works.&nbsp; <BR><DD>So that I may begin my tutorship as soon as possible, I ask that your Honor would contact me immediately at (510) 631-3267.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>Giving Honor and Praises to our <BR>
<DD>Most High, the Inner Spirit, our <BR>
<DD>Eternal Source of Life.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>Your Servant and Brother <BR>
<DD>Forever, <BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="11"><STRONG>453B.11 Examination of records by director---subpoenas.</STRONG></A>
<P>
For the purpose of determining whether or not the dealer should have paid taxes, determining the amount of tax that should have been paid, or collecting any taxes under this chapter, the director may examine, or cause to be examined, any books, papers, records, or memoranda that may be relevant to making such determinations, whether the books, papers, records, or memoranda are the property of or in the possession of the dealer or another person. The director may require the attendance of any person having knowledge or information that may be relevant, compel the production
<P>
of books, papers, records, or memoranda by persons required to attend, take testimony on matters material to the determination, and administer oaths or affirmations. Upon demand of the director or an examiner or investigator, the court shall issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness or the production of books, papers, records, or memoranda. The director may also issue subpoenas. Disobedience of subpoenas issued under this chapter is punishable by the district court of the county in which the subpoena is issued, or if the subpoena is issued by the director, by the district court of the county in which the party served with the subpoena is located, in
the same manner as a contempt of court.

administrative search warrant as authorized by section 808.14 to execute a distress warrant authorized by section 422.26.

In addition to the civil tax penalty and interest imposed by this section, a dealer distributing, offering to sell, or possessing taxable substances without affixing the appropriate stamps, labels, or other official indicia is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who possesses, prints, engraves, makes, issues, sells, or
circulates a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or places or causes to be placed a counterfeit taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia on a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
A person who uses, sells, offers for sale, or possesses for use or sale a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia, or attaches or causes to be attached a previously used or expired taxable substance tax stamp, label, or other official indicia to a taxable substance, is guilty of a class "D" felony.
<P>
Notwithstanding section 802.3, an indictment may be found or information filed upon any criminal offense specified in this chapter, in the proper court, within six years after the commission of the offense.
<HR>
<A NAME="13"><STRONG>453B.13 Credit for previously paid taxes.</STRONG></A>
<P>
If another state or local unit of government has previously assessed an excise tax on a taxable substance, the taxpayer shall pay the difference between the tax imposed under this chapter and the tax previously paid. If the tax previously paid to the other state or local unit of government was equal to or greater than the tax imposed under this chapter, no tax is due. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that an excise tax on the taxable substances has been paid to another state or local unit of government.

<HR>
<A NAME="15"><STRONG>453B.15 Availability of records and information.</STRONG></A>
<P>
The director may request from state, county, and local agencies,
information and assistance deemed necessary to administer this chapter.

<HR>
<A NAME="16"><STRONG>453B.16 Notice of conviction.</STRONG></A>
<P>
If a person enters a plea of guilty, or forfeits bail or collateral
deposited to secure the person's appearance in court, and the forfeiture is not vacated, or if a person is found guilty upon an indictment or information alleging a violation of this chapter, a copy of the minutes attached to the indictment returned by the grand jury, or to the county attorney's information, a copy of the judgment and sentence, and a copy of the opinion of the judge if one is filed, shall be sent by the clerk of the district court or the judge to the state department of transportation.

     Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Robert A. 

Hutchison, Judge.


     Appeal from district count denial of petition for a writ of 

certiorari challenging constitutionality of agency action under 

Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.2O9(8)</A> (1995).  <STRONG>REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH 

DIRECTIONS.</STRONG>


     William Jeffrey Crispin of Wilson & Adams, P.C., Des Moines, for 

appellant.

<STRONG>LAVORATO, Justice.</STRONG>

     Richard A. Dressler appeals from the district count's denial of 

his Petition for a writ of certiorari against the Iowa Department of 

Transportation (IDOT).  In his petition, Dressler challenges as 

unconstitutional 1993 Iowa Acts chapter 16, section 4, codified at 

Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> (1995).  Section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> authorizes 

the IDOT to revoke the driver's license of a person convicted of 

certain drug, drug tax, or drug-related offenses.

     We reach only DressIer's contention that section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> 

violates double jeopardy guarantees.  We conclude section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> 

is constitutionally infirm under the federal Double Jeopardy Clause.  

We reverse the district court's order denying Dressler's petition for 

a writ of certiorari.  We remand to allow the district court to enter 

an order granting the writ.

     <STRONG>I.</STRONG>  <EM>Background Facts and Proceedings.</EM>

     In March 1994 Dressler pleaded guilty to the possession of a 

controlled substance.  <EM>See</EM> Iowa Code ¤ <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  About six weeks 

later, the IDOT notified Dressler in writing that his driving 

privileges were revoked for 180 days pursuant to Iowa Code section 

<A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.  The notice also informed Dressler that he was not 

entitled to a preliminary hearing on the matter.

     Dressler then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the 

district court.  In the petition he asked the court to find section 

321.209(8) unconstitutional on the three grounds he urges here.  

Dressler appeals from the court's order dismissing the writ.

     <STRONG>II.</STRONG>  <EM>Scope of Review.</EM>

     A writ of certiorari is proper under Iowa Rule of Civil 

Procedure 306 when one "exercising judicial functions . . . is 

alleged to have . . . acted illegally."  Our review of certiorari 

actions is generally at law.  <EM>Grant v. Iowa Dist. Ct.</EM>, 492 N.W.2d 

683, 685 (Iowa 1992).  Because Dressler alleges a constitutional
<HR><CENTER>3</CENTER>
violation, our review is de novo.  State v. Clarke, 475 N.W.2d 193, 
194 (Iowa 1991).

     <STRONG>III.</STRONG>  <EM>Applicable Law.</EM>

     Iowa Code section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> pertinently provides that 

          [t]he department shall upon twenty days' notice and 
     without preliminary hearing revoke the license or operating 
     privilege of an operator upon receiving a record of the 
     operator's conviction for any of the following offenses, 
     when such conviction has become final:
          [Sections 1-7 deal with vehicle-related offenses.]

          8.  A controlled substance offense under section 
     <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401</A>, 124.401A, 124.402 or 124.403; a controlled 
     substance tax offense under chapter <A HREF="453b.html">453B</A>; a drug or 
     drug-related offense under section 126.3; or an offense 
     under <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/21/ch13.html">21 U.S.C. ch. 13</A>.

     <STRONG>IV.</STRONG>  <EM>Double Jeopardy.</EM>

     The Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution provides that no 

person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 

jeopardy of life or limb."  U.S. Const. amend. V.  The protections 

against double jeopardy are enforceable against the states through 

the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution.  <EM>Benton v. 

Maryland</EM>, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 23 L.Ed.2d 707, 716 

(1969).

     The Double Jeopardy Clause is violated when (1) a second 

prosecution for the same offense occurs after acquittal, (2) a second 

prosecution for the same offense occurs after conviction, and (3) 

multiple punishments occur for the same offense.  <EM>North Carolina v. 

Pearce</EM>, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656, 664-

65 (1969); <EM>State v. Taft</EM>, 506 N.W.2d 757, 760 (Iowa 1993).

     Dressler's double jeopardy claim falls within the third 

situation: multiple punishments occurring for the same offense.  He 

contends the State impermissibly inflicted two punishments upon him 

for the same offense-possession of a controlled substance.  Dressler 

claims he was punished the first time when he was incarcerated and 

paid a $250 fine and count costs for possession under section
<HR><CENTER>4</CENTER>
<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  He claims he was punished a second time when the IDOT 

notified him that, without the benefit of a hearing, his license was 

revoked for 180 days.

     Dressler says that to escape double jeopardy concerns, a state 

wishing to inflict postconviction punishment upon a defendant must do 

so in a single proceeding.  He contends that was not the case here, 

because the license revocation followed Dressler's initial conviction 

and sentence under section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  This, he argues, constituted 

multiple prosecution and punishment for the same offense in separate 

proceedings,  constitutionally prohibited by federal double jeopardy 

guarantees.

     To support his argument, Dressler relies heavily on two recent 

United States Supreme Court decisions: <EM>United States v. Halper</EM>, 490 

U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.24 487 (1989), and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Montana 

Department of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, 511 U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 

128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994).  In <EM>Halper</EM>, the Court held that a civil 

penalty, imposed after a criminal penalty, may constitute a second 

punishment for double jeopardy purposes

     when the sanction as applied in the individual case serves 
     the goals of punishment.
          These goals are familiar.  We have recognized in 
     other contexts that punishment serves the twin aims of 
     retribution and deterrence.  Furthermore, "[r]etribution 
     and deterrence are not legitimate nonpunitive governmental 
     objectives."  From these premises, it follows that a civil 
     sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a 
     remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also 
     serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is 
     punishment, as we have come to understand the term.  We 
     therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a 
     defendant who alreadv has been punished in a criminal 
     prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil 
     sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not 
     fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent 
     or retribution.

<EM>Halper</EM>, 490 U.S. at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02, 104 L.Ed.2d at 501-

02 (citations omitted).

     In <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, the Court had before it a postconviction drug 

tax assessment.  Employing a different analysis from that articulated 

in Halper, the
<HR><CENTER>5</CENTER>
Court held that the tax constituted a second punishment.  For that 

reason, the tax had to be imposed during the first prosecution or not 

at all.  The Court characterized the postconviction proceeding to 

collect a tax as "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal 

prosecution that placed the Kurths in jeopardy a second time 'for the 

same offence.'"  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/hermes/ascii/93-144.ZO.filt"><EM>Kurth Ranch</EM></A>, 511 U.S. at ___, 114 S.Ct. at 1948, 128 

L.Ed.2d at 782.  Simply put, as Dressler says, "a state wishing to 

inflict postconviction punishment on a defendant must do so in a 

single proceeding.  Otherwise, punishment following an initial 

conviction and sentencing is barred as double jeopardy."

     The question boils down to whether the license revocation is 

punitive or remedial.

     The State concedes Dressler was sanctioned in the criminal case 

<EM>before</EM> his license was revoked in a civil proceeding under section 

<A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.  But the State argues the subsequent revocation of 

Dressler's license is not subsequent punishment for possession of a 

controlled substance under section <A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  The State strongly 

asserts that the underlying purpose of section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> is remedial 

rather than punitive, designed solely for the safety of the public.  

For that reason, the State concludes, no double jeopardy violation 

occurred.

     We think the question whether the revocation was punitive rather 

than remedial is controlled by our recent decision in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills v. Iowa 

Department of Transportation</EM></A>, 534 N.W.2d 640 (Iowa 1993).  In <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, 

the defendant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while 

intoxicated.  After a search incident to arrest, the defendant was 

also charged with possession of marijuana.  See Iowa Code ¤ 

<A HREF="124-401.html">124.401(3)</A>.  Before the defendant's pretrial conference -- at which 

the defendant intended to plead guilty to the possession charge -- 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> became effective.  As a consequence, the IDOT 

revoked the defendant's license
<HR><CENTER>6</CENTER>
over her objection that to do so was an ex post facto application of 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A>.

     On judicial revIew of the IDOT's decision, the district court  

reversed.  On appeal the IDOT argued that ex post facto protections 

did not apply to a revocation based on a controlled substance 

violation, because the revocation was a civil, rather than criminal, 

penalty.  <EM>See State v. Taggart</EM>, 186 Iowa 247, 254, 172 N.W. 299, 301 

(1919) (ex post facto protections apply only to penal and criminal 

actions, not civil actions).  This is the same argument the State 

posits against Dressler's double jeopardy claim here.

     In rejecting this argument in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, we said the answer turned 

on whether the legislative purpose underpinning the controlled 

substance revocation is promotion of highway safety.  In concluding 

there was no direct connection between possession of controlled 

substances, driving, and public safety, we said that

     [p]ersons who illegally possess drugs are of course subject 
     to appropriate criminal punishment.  But many such persons 
     choose not to drive.  When they do not, they do not affect 
     highway safety.  Any connection between drugs, driving, and 
     public safety is at most indirect.  <EM>The amended statute 
     authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at 
     enhancing punishmen for controllcd substance possession.</EM>

<A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A>, 534 N.W.2d at 642 (emphasis added).

     Our conclusion in <A HREF="hills.html"><EM>Hills</EM></A> that section 321.209(8) enhances 

punishment of a controlled substance possession dispenses with the 

State's assertion that this section is not a penal statute.  Because 

section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> twice punishes Dressler for the same offense -- 

possession of a controlled substance -- in a separate proceeding, we 

conclude it unconstitutionally contravenes Dressler's double jeopardy 

guarantees.

     <STRONG>V.</STRONG>  <EM>Disposition.</EM>

     We conclude that section <A HREF="321-209.html">321.209(8)</A> violates double jeopardy 

principles by twice punishing Dressler for possession of a controlled 

substance in separate
<HR><CENTER>7</CENTER>
proceedings.  We therefore reverse the district court's order denying 

Dressler's petition for a writ of certiorari.  We remand to allow the 

district court to enter an order granting the writ.

<TITLE>New Iowa Double Jeopardy Ruling</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0000FF" vlink="#FF0000" alink="#FF00FF">

The Des Moines Register, Wednesday, February 7, 1996, page 1M 
 
Court restores driving privileges 
 
The ruling says the state may not automatically suspend licenses of 
convicted drug dealers. 
 
By THOMAS A. FOGARTY 
Register Staff Writer 
 
     Hundreds of convicted drug dealers will have their driving 
privileges restored and the state of Iowa could lose more than $16 
million annually in federal highway aid as a result of a little-
noticed decision issued last month by the Iowa Supreme Court. 
     The court struck down a 1993 state law that calls for the 
automatic six-month suspension of the driver's license of anyone 
convicted of a drug-related criminal charge.  According to the court, 
the license suspension was an unconstitutional second punishment for 
a single criminal action. 
 
Subject to Suspension 
     Shirley Andre, chief of the Department of Transportation motor 
vehicle division, said 8,483 people with drug convictions were 
subject to the suspension law before the court nullified it with its 
decision Jan. 17. 
     With the decision, Andre said, the department stopped imposing 
new suspensions and lifted those that were in effect.  Although the 
department has yet to systematically contact those serving their 
suspension that driving privileges have been restored, officials have 
informed drug offenders who have inquired about their driving statis. 
     Transportation officials have decided against expunging drug-
related suspensions from the driving records of those who have 
already completed them, Andre said. 
     The Supreme Court ruled in a case brought by Richard Dressler of 
Des Moines, who in March 1994 was stopped by authorities near Huxley 
for a broken taillight.  Officers discovered a small quantity of 
marijuana in his possession.  Dressler pleaded guilty and paid the 
fine on the criminal charge. 
     He challenged the license suspension in court.  Ironically, 
disposition of the case took so long that Dressler served the full 
suspension, so the ruling has no practical effect on him. 
     "It's the first step in the right direction of common sense," 
said Jeff Crispin, the Des Moines lawyer who represented Dressler.  
"There's no logical connection between these drug offenses and 
driving privileges." 
 
Unrelated Charges 
     The court decision addresses only license suspension for drug 
offenses that are unrelated to driving, such as possession or sale of 
drugs.  It has no bearing on license suspensions for those convicted 
of driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.  In fact, 
the Iowa Supreme Court issued an opinion on the same day last month 
upholding precedures for suspending the licenses of drivers charged 
with driving under the influence. 
     Three years ago, Gov. Terry Branstad recommended to the 
Legislature passage of license suspensions in drug cases.  Branstad's 
support of such a policy as a get-tough measure only partially 
explains how the law came to be. 
     In addition, the federal government said failure by Iowa or any 
other state to pass such a measure would cost state governments 5 
percent of their federal highway aid in 1994, and 10 percent in 
subsequent years.  At the time, transportion department lobbyists 
told lawmakers that the higher percentage represented about $16 
million a year for Iowa.  The sum presumably would be higher now, 
Andre said. 
     The federal deadline for state action on the legislation has 
passed, so the Supreme Court's decision to nullify the Iowa law 
leaves the status of future federal highway aid questionable.  Andre 
said officials are preparing a letter to U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena explaining the situation and seeking his 
guidance. 
     "To my knowledge, no other state has been fraced with this 
particular challenge," said Andre. 
     In addition to sorting things out with federal highway 
officials, Andre said her agency has been discussing with Branstad 
staff possible legislative responses to the court's decision. 
     Andre and David Hudson, Branstad's legislative lobbyist, say 
it's too early to know what course of action will be recommended this 
session to the Legislature.  The options include repealing the 
unconstitutional provision outright, or developing a substitute 
provision that would achieve the same goals in a constitutional way. 
     In 1993, the federal government permitted states that opposed 
the license suspension policy for drug offenders to preserve their 
full highway allotment by passing a legislative resolution stating 
their intention not to pass such a law.  Even if that option remains 
for Iowa officials - and it's not clear that it does - Andre said 
it's an unlikely course of action, given Branstad's support for the 
suspension policy.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/401.html#3">124.401</A>, subsection 3, Code 1995, is
  1  2 amended to read as follows:
  1  3    3.  <STRONG>a.</STRONG>  It is unlawful for any person knowingly or
  1  4 intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless such
  1  5 substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid
  1  6 prescription or order of a practitioner while acting in the
  1  7 course of the practitioner's professional practice, or except
  1  8 as otherwise authorized by this chapter.  Any person who
  1  9 violates this subsection is guilty of <EM>a serious</EM> <STRONG>an aggravated</STRONG>
  1 10 misdemeanor <STRONG>for the first offense, and a class "D" felony for</STRONG>
  1 11 <STRONG>the second and each subsequent offense if the second or</STRONG>
  1 12 <STRONG>subsequent offense occurs within six years of the previous</STRONG>
  1 13 <STRONG>offense</STRONG>.  <EM>If the controlled substance is marijuana, the</EM>
  1 14 <EM>punishment shall be by imprisonment in the county jail for not</EM>
  1 15 <EM>more than six months or by a fine of not more than one</EM>
  1 16 <EM>thousand dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.  All</EM>
  1 17 <EM>or any part of a sentence imposed pursuant to this section may</EM>
  1 18 <EM>be suspended and the person placed upon probation upon such</EM>
  1 19 <EM>terms and conditions as the court may impose including the</EM>
  1 20 <EM>active participation by such person in a drug treatment,</EM>
  1 21 <EM>rehabilitation or education program approved by the court.</EM>
  1 22    <STRONG>b.  Any person who possesses marijuana is guilty of a</STRONG>
  1 23 <STRONG>serious misdemeanor for the first offense, and is guilty of an</STRONG>
  1 24 <STRONG>aggravated misdemeanor for the second and each subsequent</STRONG>
  1 25 <STRONG>offense if the second or subsequent offense occurs within six</STRONG>
  1 26 <STRONG>years of the previous offense.</STRONG>
  1 27    <STRONG>c.  A person eighteen or older is guilty of an aggravated</STRONG>
  1 28 <STRONG>misdemeanor if the person knowingly or intentionally possesses</STRONG>
  1 29 <STRONG>any controlled substance in violation of this section in the</STRONG>
  1 30 <STRONG>presence of a minor.</STRONG>
  1 31    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act shall not take effect
  1 32 unless an appropriation is enacted or the state's share of the
  1 33 cost is specified in accordance with section 25B.2, subsection
  1 34 3.  
  1 35                           EXPLANATION
  2  1    This bill provides that a person who unlawfully possesses a
  2  2 controlled substance other than marijuana commits an
  2  3 aggravated misdemeanor for the first offense and a class "D"
  2  4 felony for each subsequent offense if the subsequent offense
  2  5 is committed within six years of the previous offense.  The
  2  6 bill eliminates the six-month jail term and $1,000 fine for
  2  7 possession of marijuana and makes possession of marijuana a
  2  8 serious misdemeanor for the first offense and an aggravated
  2  9 misdemeanor for each subsequent offense if the subsequent
  2 10 offense is committed within six years of the previous offense.
  2 11 The bill also makes it an aggravated misdemeanor for an adult
  2 12 to unlawfully possess a controlled substance in the presence
  2 13 of a minor.
  2 14    The bill may contain a state mandate under chapter 25B and
  2 15 will not take effect unless an appropriation fully funding the
  2 16 cost to political subdivisions of complying with the bill or
  2 17 specifying the state's share of the cost of complying with the
  2 18 bill is enacted.

  1 11 <STRONG>stated specifically in the record.  However, the state may</STRONG>
  1 12 <STRONG>appeal the discretionary decision on the grounds that the</STRONG>
  1 13 <STRONG>stated mitigating circumstances do not warrant a reduction of</STRONG>
  1 14 <STRONG>the sentence.</STRONG>
  1 15    <STRONG>2.</STRONG>  A court sentencing a person for the person's first
  1 16 conviction under section <EM>124.406, 124.413, or</EM> 902.7 may, at

  1 19 provided by the statute if mitigating circumstances exist and

  1 21 However, the state may appeal the discretionary decision on

  1 23 warrant a reduction of the sentence.
  1 24    Sec. 2.  Section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/902/11.html">902.11</A>, unnumbered paragraph 1, Code 1995,

  2  2 <EM>forcible felony and the</EM> sentences for the prior forcible
  2  3 felonies expired at least five years before the date of

  2 12 percent of the maximum term of the person's sentence.
  2 13    2.  A person serving a sentence for a conviction of a

  2 20 is amended to read as follows:
  2 21    <EM>Each</EM> <STRONG>Unless an inmate is sentenced pursuant to section</STRONG>
  2 22 <STRONG>902.12, subsection 2, an</STRONG> inmate of an institution under the

  3  3 <STRONG>institutions.</STRONG>  Reduction of sentence pursuant to this section
  3  4 may be subject to forfeiture pursuant to section 903A.3.
  3  5 Computation of good conduct time is subject to the following
  3  6 conditions:
  3  7    Sec. 6.  APPLICABILITY OF WAIVER TO CURRENT INMATES.  The
  3  8 board of parole shall identify inmates currently serving
  3  9 mandatory minimum sentences for an offense under section 1 of
  3 10 this Act that would have been eligible for waiver of the
  3 11 mandatory minimum term if the inmates had been sentenced on or
  3 12 after the effective date of this Act.  For each inmate
  3 13 identified, the board of parole shall review the inmate's
  3 14 record and the circumstances surrounding the inmate's
  3 15 conviction and make a determination as to whether the inmate's
  3 16 mandatory minimum term should be waived.  If the parole board
  3 17 determines that the inmate's mandatory minimum term of
  3 18 confinement should be waived, the inmate shall be immediately
  3 19 eligible for parole.
  3 20    Sec. 7.  INTERIM STUDY COMMITTEE.  The legislative council
  3 21 is requested to establish an interim committee to study
  3 22 currently available sentencing and incarceration options.  The
  3 23 study may include but shall not be limited to a review of
  3 24 available jail, community corrections, and prison beds; the
  3 25 potential impact of the use of split sentencing on jail,
  3 26 community corrections, and prison bed space; security needs
  3 27 and costs associated with the implementation of hard labor
  3 28 requirements for persons incarcerated in corrections
  3 29 institutions; and the nature and costs associated with other
  3 30 sentencing options.  In addition to legislative members, the
  3 31 membership of the interim committee shall include the
  3 32 following public members:
  3 33    1.  A representative from the board of parole.
  3 34    2.  A representative from the division of criminal and
  3 35 juvenile justice planning of the department of human rights.
  4  1    3.  A representative from an association of sheriffs and
  4  2 deputy sheriffs.
  4  3    4.  A representative from the department of corrections.
  4  4    5.  A representative from a county board of supervisors.
  4  5    The committee shall submit findings and any recommendations
  4  6 in a report to the general assembly by January 1, 1997.
  4  7    Sec. 8.  RISK ASSESSMENT STUDY.  The department of
  4  8 corrections, in consultation with the board of parole and the
  4  9 division of criminal and juvenile justice planning of the
  4 10 department of human rights, shall conduct a study of the
  4 11 various risk assessment tools currently used in the Iowa
  4 12 corrections system to determine the relative risk posed by a
  4 13 criminal offender and the prospects for the offender's
  4 14 rehabilitation, and make findings and recommendations
  4 15 regarding the implementation and use of a risk assessment tool
  4 16 during or as part of the presentence investigation process.
  4 17 In conducting the study, the department shall also consult
  4 18 with faculty members with expertise in risk assessment who are
  4 19 from Iowa institutions of higher education which offer degree
  4 20 programs in criminology.  The recommendations and any
  4 21 corresponding findings shall be submitted in a report to the
  4 22 general assembly by January 1, 1997.
  4 23    Sec. 9.  SPLIT-SENTENCING PILOT PROJECT.
  4 24    1.  The general assembly finds that the implementation of a
  4 25 split-sentencing pilot project within this state could serve
  4 26 as a test for a fair and flexible method of dispensing
  4 27 criminal justice which provides for an incremental approach to
  4 28 the imposition of aggravated misdemeanor and felony criminal
  4 29 sentences and may help to reduce the current prison
  4 30 overcrowding problems while protecting the public safety.  A
  4 31 split-sentencing pilot project is therefore established in a
  4 32 judicial district to be determined by the supreme court.  The
  4 33 judicial district shall be selected based on the availability
  4 34 of jail space within the judicial district, and whether the
  4 35 judicial district in consultation with the county board or
  5  1 boards of supervisors and the sheriff or sheriffs desires to
  5  2 participate in the project.  Notwithstanding any other
  5  3 contrary provision of law, subsection 2 of this section shall
  5  4 apply within and only within the judicial district which is
  5  5 selected to participate in this pilot project from the date of
  5  6 the enactment of this Act through June 30, 1997.
  5  7    2.  By record entry at the time of or after sentencing for
  5  8 an aggravated misdemeanor or a felony, other than a class "A"
  5  9 felony, the court may sentence the defendant to serve up to
  5 10 ninety days of the sentence in the county jail and suspend the
  5 11 balance of the term imposed.  If the person is ordered to
  5 12 serve up to ninety days in jail, the costs of the person's
  5 13 confinement shall be paid by the state at the rate negotiated
  5 14 by the department of corrections with the judicial district
  5 15 under section 904.908.  Payment shall be made by the
  5 16 department of revenue and finance upon submission of a voucher
  5 17 executed by the sheriff.  Persons serving time in a county
  5 18 jail under this subsection shall be committed to the custody
  5 19 of the director of the department of corrections and the
  5 20 department shall be responsible for all prisoner medical
  5 21 costs.  
  5 22                           EXPLANATION
  5 23    This bill provides that the court, when sentencing a person
  5 24 for certain drug offenses not involving a firearm or an
  5 25 assault, may waive an applicable mandatory minimum sentence if
  5 26 mitigating circumstances exist and are on record.  The waiver
  5 27 is appealable by the state.  The waiver may also be made
  5 28 retroactively applicable at the discretion of the parole
  5 29 board.
  5 30    The bill also provides that persons sentenced for a second
  5 31 forcible felony are to serve 85 percent of their sentence
  5 32 before they are eligible for parole or work release.  Persons
  5 33 sentenced for a third or subsequent forcible felony, under the
  5 34 bill, are to serve their entire sentence but are eligible for
  5 35 sentence reductions of up to 12 days per year for good
  6  1 behavior.  Persons confined in an institution under the
  6  2 control of the department of corrections are currently
  6  3 eligible for reductions of one day for each day of good
  6  4 behavior and an additional five days a month for participation
  6  5 in institutional employment, an employment program, or an
  6  6 educational or treatment program.
  6  7    The bill establishes a split-sentencing pilot project under
  6  8 which a court in the judicial district selected for the pilot
  6  9 project would be permitted to sentence a person convicted of a
  6 10 crime which is classified as an aggravated misdemeanor through
  6 11 a class "B" felony to up to 90 days in a county jail as part
  6 12 of the person's sentence and suspend the remaining term of
  6 13 confinement.  If a person is serving a sentence of confinement
  6 14 in a county jail, the person is committed to the custody of
  6 15 the director of the department of corrections and the costs of
  6 16 confinement in the jail and medical care will be paid by the
  6 17 state.
  6 18    The bill requests that the legislative council establish an
  6 19 interim committee to study currently available sentencing and
  6 20 incarceration options.  The committee is to include
  6 21 representatives of the board of parole, the division of
  6 22 criminal and juvenile justice planning, the sheriffs
  6 23 association, county boards of supervisors, and the department
  6 24 of corrections.
  6 25    The bill also directs the department of corrections to
  6 26 study the risk assessment tools currently used by the Iowa
  6 27 corrections system.  The department is to consult with persons
  6 28 with expertise in criminology, the division of criminal and
  6 29 juvenile justice planning, and the board of parole.

  1  1 A Joint Resolution supporting the use of marijuana for medical 
  1  2    purposes in the state of Iowa. 
  1  3    WHEREAS, significant scientific and medical studies have 
  1  4 demonstrated that marijuana is safe for use under medical 
  1  5 supervision and that the cannabis plant, in its natural form, has 
  1  6 important therapeutic benefits that are often of critical medical 
  1  7 importance to persons afflicted with a variety of life- 
  1  8 threatening and sense-threatening illnesses; and 
  1  9    WHEREAS, courts have recognized marijuana's medical value in 
  1 10 treatment and have ruled that marijuana can be a drug of 
  1 11 "necessity" in the treatment of glaucoma, cancer, AIDS, and 
  1 12 multiple sclerosis; and 
  1 13    WHEREAS, the people of the state of Iowa believe that well- 
  1 l4 trained medical professionals rather than remote federal 
  1 15 bureaucrats should be responsible for determining a patient's 
  1 16 medical care routine; and 
  1 17    WHEREAS, seriously ill Iowans and other Americans are 
  1 18 unnecessarily suffering because of federal policies which legally 
  1 19 prohibit marijuana's legitimate medical use; and 
  1 20    WHEREAS, Iowa Code section <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>, subsection 7, paragraph 
  1 21 "a", enacted in 1979, allows the use of marijuana for medical 
  1 22 purposes in the state of Iowa, expressing the intent of the Iowa 
  1 23 General Assembly that marijuana should be available for 
  1 24 legitimate medical purposes; and 
  2  1    WHEREAS, these problems are not particular to the state of 
  2  2 Iowa, but generally affect the citizens of all states adversely; 
  2  3 NOW THEREFORE, 
  2  4 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA: 
  3  1    That the Iowa General Assembly memorializes the President
  3  2 and the United States Congress to end federal prohibitions
  3  3 against marijuana's legitimate medical use by creating a
  3  4 rational system of prescriptive medical access to marijuana;
  3  5 and
  3  6    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That copies of this Resolution be
  3  7 transmitted to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of the
  3  8 United States; the Honorable Albert Gore, Vice President of
  3  9 the United States and President of the United States Senate;
  3 10 the Honorable Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the United States
  3 11 House of Representatives; the Honorable Robert Dole, Majority
  3 12 Leader of the United States Senate; Donna Shalala, Secretary
  3 13 of the United States Department of Health and Human Services;
  3 14 Janet Reno, United States Attorney General; and the members of
  3 15 Iowa's congressional delegation.  
  3 16                           EXPLANATION
  3 17    This resolution recites the Iowa general assembly's support
  3 18 for the removal of federal prohibitions relating to the
  3 19 legalization of marijuana for certain medical purposes in the
  3 20 state of Iowa.

Cannabis Research and International Law, A Thesis.

by Jon Gettman

(This article was written to clarify some ideas expressed in earlier
correspondence with Mario Lap.)

Summary:  International treaties requiring cannabis prohibition are based
on outdated scientific findings which lack modern day validity.  An effort
is underway in the U.S. to utilize legal and administrative procedures to
bring about an official review of this issue.  Advocates of ending cannabis
prohibition world-wide are invited to consider ways in which the research
behind this effort may aid efforts by other countries to call for a review
of the relevant international treaties.

        This article contains speculation about the impact of recent
cannabis-related research on international treaties.  This article presents
a thesis, and in no way attempts to present these assertions as
research-based analysis.  In fact I am presenting this speculation to
interested parties in hope that other people may be able to compile the
relevant research to transform this speculation into a well-founded
argument grounded in specific attributes of international law and treaty.

        The truth is, I don't know much about the international treaties
that concern cannabis control and prohibition.  I know a lot about United
States law, policy, and regulation, and what I know about the treaties
derives from that specific context.

        The way U.S. law is constructed, specific scientific findings are
required to classify a drug as prohibited.

        Until 1989 - 1994 no one knew what the mechanism of action was that
produced the characteristic effects of cannabis.  It has been assumed
throughout the 20th Century that cannabis affected the human brain in a
manner somehow similar to opium and opiate derivatives, and in both
domestic U.S. law and in International treaties this assumption has been
the basis for similar controls on both cannabinoids and opiates.  In the
U.S. this is manifest in the schedule I status of both cannabis and heroin.

        Until this period, henceforth described as circa 1991, all law and
policy about cannabis was based on a bet, on a wager that whenever science
figured out how it worked, it would prove cannabis worked like heroin.
Circa 1991 the discoveries, in fact, occurred, and it is now clear that
they bet on the wrong theory.  They bet on the wrong horse, and now they
don't want to talk about it and hope that nobody finds out.  They?
Politicians, government officials, and legislators in democratic societies
around the world who claim that prohibition is based on scientific
findings, not some form of repressive malice.

        Obligations affecting the prohibition and regulation of
cannabinoids related to two international treaties are codified in the U.S.
Controlled Substances Act, 21 USC Chapter 13.  These treaties are:  the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 and Convention on Psychotropic
Substances, 1971.

        The mechanism of action by which cannabinoids affect the human
brain were discovered circa 1991.  This mechanism of action categorically
and definitively distinguishes cannabis from opiates, cocaine, and
amphetamines.  The latter list of drugs affects the neurotransmitter
dopamine, and cannabinoids to not.  See the following:

        1)  Cannabis produces effects by way of a receptor system .
Howlett, A.  "Pharmacology of Cannabinoid Receptors"  The Annual Review of
Pharmacology and Toxicology, 1995. (In press when copy received from
author.)

        2)  The receptor system allows a characterization of the dependence
liability of cannabis, and explains the fallacies of prior research
hypotheses.  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in
Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and
H.H.Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals
of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.

        (Incidentally, this characterization proves that patients who use
marijuana therapeutically are not engaging in denial when they attest to
medical benefits, and therefore patient anecdotes have increased scientific
validity.)

        3)  The receptor system also allows for explanation of tolerance to
cannabis, and provides evidence that tolerance and dependence to cannabis
are mediated differently in the brain. Oviedo, A., Glowa, J, and Herkenham,
M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters cannabinoid receptor
binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic study." Brain
Research, 616:293-302. 1993.

        My thesis, then, is fairly straightforward.  How can treaties
regulating cannabis that were signed in 1961 and 1971 be based on any valid
scientific findings when the mechanism of action for cannabinoids wasn't
discovered until circa 1991?

        U.S. law contains the following provision:

        "Nothing in the amendments made by the Psychotropic Substances Act
of 1978 or the regulations or orders promulgated thereunder shall be
construed to preclude requests by the Secretary of Health and Human
Services or the Attorney General through the Secretary of State, pursuant
to article 2 or other applicable provisions of the Convention, for review
of scheduling decisions under such Convention, based on new or additional
information."  21 USC 811 (d)(5)

        This provision refers to the U.S. legislation that was passed to
bring the U.S. into compliance with the 1971 treaty.  However this
underscores a fundamental aspect of the relationship between U.S. law and
our international treaty obligations.  If there is a conflict between the
two, U.S. law takes precedence and our government must take steps to change
the treaty, whether it is the Single Convention or the Psychotropic treaty.

        There have been two significant legal actions to reschedule
cannabis in the United States, by NORML, and by Carl Olsen.  I have
initiated a third.  The process itself is relatively straightforward.  A
petition citing evidence is filed.  If the evidence provides sufficient
legal and/or scientific grounds for consideration, then the Drug
Enforcement Administration must defer the petition to the Department of
Health and Human Services for a scientific and medical evaluation.  The
findings of this evaluation are binding on DEA, which is not allowed to
make such scientific and medical judgments in the absence of HHS findings.
The scientific findings provided by HHS are then used to apply statute to
obtain the appropriate level of regulation and control.  (The failure of
HHS to provide any findings on marijuana's accepted medical use in the
United States was in part DEA's justification for refusing action on
NORML's petition.)

        In legal papers filed in 1982 the DEA acknowledged that this review
process by HHS could produce evidence which would require the U.S.
government to seek a change in the international scheduling of cannabis.

        A 1977 ruling in NORML v. DEA by the U.S. Court of Appeals
determined that because of international treaty obligations, cannabis must
be placed in either schedule I or II of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
However U.S., courts have not ruled on the validity of the treaties in a
case where new evidence is submitted demonstrating the treaties are based
on invalid scientific assertions.

        The petition I filed in July, 1995 seeks the removal of all
cannabinoids from schedules I and II of the CSA because they do not possess
the high potential for abuse required for placement in those schedules
under U.S. law (see 21 USC 811(c) and 21 USC 812(b)(1)).  The petition
seeks only seeks the removal of cannabinoids from those two schedules, and
requests that the government appropriately schedule cannabinoids based on
the medical and scientific findings of the Department of Health and Human
Services.  In the U.S., this entire process is subject to review by both an
independent administrative law judge and the appeals branch of the
judiciary.

        The petition was accepted for filing by the Drug Enforcement
Administration on July 27, 1995.  Because the petition raises an issue
already decided by a U.S. court, it could (as Carl Olsen earlier and
shrewdly observed) easily have been dismissed under the doctrine of res
judicata, meaning (but not correctly translated) this was already decided.
However the petition raises a new issue, which is what happens if the
treaties are not based on valid science?

        Ending prohibition, in a technical sense, has always been
complicated by the treaties.  The U.S. government argues that the treaties
prevent them from ending prohibition.  And with apologies for the blatant
arrogance of this next remark, the whole world knows that the treaties will
not be changed unless the U.S. government agrees.

        In this specific case, it will be difficult for the U.S. Government
to ignore the scientific validity of the cannabinoid receptor research. The
petition for repeal is based on evidence from over 150 scientific journal
articles and government reports.  However the three articles cited above
are not only representative, but are in fact written by scientists with
reputations of the absolute highest caliber.  Dr. Miles Herkenham, key
author of two of the three studies cited above, is the chief of the
neuroanatomy section of the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH).

        It is my argument within the United States that in light of these
revolutionary research findings we have obligations under both U.S. and
international law to reassess the domestic and international legal status
of cannabis.

        My thesis is based on components of U.S. law, and this is all I
require for legal action within the United States.  It is my intention to
get the US to address the issue of international scheduling in light of the
recent scientific advances.  Perhaps the scientific findings supporting the
petition for repeal can support efforts by citizens of other countries to
have their governments seek the appropriate changes to international
treaties on cannabis.

        International treaties regarding cannabis prohibition are based on
invalid scientific findings that have been completely rejected by modern
day science.  How can any sovereign, democratic country justify adherence
to treaty provisions based on science which is so out of date?  Certainly,
these treaties provisions must be changed.

        How individuals around the world can bring this issue to the
attention of their governments is a question that deserves, I suggest, wide
consideration.


Author's note:  The complete text of the petition for repeal referred to
above will soon be available at the web site of the National Organization
for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, <A HREF="http://www.norml.org/">http://www.norml.org/</A>.

The Scientific And Legal Basis
for the End of Marijuana Prohibition

by Jon Gettman

        The Controlled Substances Act mandates that schedule I drugs have a
"high potential for abuse."  A judicious reading of both the statute and
the legislative history finds that this abuse potential is the key
criterion for its scheduling under the CSA.(NORML v. DEA, 559 F.2d 735
(1977))(21 USC ¤ 812 (b)(1))  However, it has long been recognized that
marijuana does not satisfy this essential criterion.  Therefore the
justification for marijuana's continued placement in schedule I is a
presumption rather than a finding.(See U.S. Cong. and Admin. News 1970 p.
4578, p. 4579, p. 4629. See also 51 FR 22947 (1986))

        As of April, 1995, the Drug Enforcement Administration was "unaware
of any new scientific studies of marijuana that would lead [them] to
re-evaluate its classification at this time."  According to a letter from
Thomas Constantine, Administrator of DEA, if this author "has access to
scientific data concerning marijuana which he wishes to bring to our
attention, we will be pleased to consider it, should he care to share the
documentation with us."  Extensive documentation was provided to
Constantine on July 10, 1995 as part of an administrative petition
subjecting DEA's consideration of these issues to judicial review.

        The CSA establishes an eight item list of scientific and medical
factors that are to be considered in scheduling decisions. (21 USC 822 (c))
These factors are defined further in the legislative history.(see U.S.
Cong. and Admin. News 1970 p 4601 - 4603)

        The first factor is the drug's relative or actual potential for
abuse.  The contemporary paradigm for evaluating the abuse potential of a
drug has been developed by the Committee on the Problems of Drug
Dependence.[<a href="#7">7</a>]  They have concluded that self-administration in animal
studies is the necessary characteristic of a drug with a significant,
severe potential for abuse.[<a href="#3">3</a>, <a href="#7">7</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#32">32</a>]  However, animals will not self
administer marijuana.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#32">32</a>]

        The second factor is evidence of the drug's pharmacological
effects.  In 1989 Leo Hollister remarked that: "Our studies of cannabinoids
over the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions.  They constitute the largest series of studies of the human
pharmacology of marijuana on record."[<a href="#15">15</a>]  Since then further research by
the likes of Donald Tashkin, Mario Perez-Reyes, Julian Azorlosa, for
example, have supplemented the classic work on the chemistry and
pharmacology of marijuana by Agurell, Dewey, Hollister, Martin, Mechoulam,
and Razdan.

        The third factor considered in scheduling decisions is scientific
knowledge about the substance.  In 1988, it became obvious that scientists
had been wrong in their theories about how marijuana acted on the
brain.[<a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#18">18</a>, <a href="#27">27</a>]  Recent Evidence affirms that marijuana activates a
unique receptor system in the brain.[<a href="#16">16</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#18">18</a>, <a href="#31">31</a>]  In another
current finding, it has been discovered that tolerance to marijuana is the
result of receptor down-regulation, rather than receptor desensitization as
was previously believed.[<a href="#25">25</a>, <a href="#29">29</a>]  In addition, the theory that marijuana's
lipophilic qualities produce a harmful effect has also been
contradicted.[<a href="#22">22</a>, <a href="#30">30</a>]  The receptor has been cloned[<a href="#23">23</a>], an endogenous
ligand for the cannabinoid receptor has been discovered[<a href="#9">9</a>], and an orally
effective cannabinoid antagonist has been created.[<a href="#28">28</a>]

        The fourth factor is the history and current pattern of abuse,
including "social, economic, and ecological characteristics of the segments
of the population involved in such abuse."  Critical evaluations of the
National Household Survey, the Monitoring the Future Project, the Drug
Abuse Warning Network and other federally sponsored reports provide more
than adequate data to evaluate this factor.  Key observations are that
marijuana use and adolescent access persist despite increased enforcement.
Moreover, the National Household Survey indicates that risk perception
associated with marijuana use decreases as education and age increase.[<a href="#34">34</a>]

        The most interesting factor for advocates of harm reduction
policies, though, is the fifth factor: scope duration and significance of
abuse.  According to the legislative history, "in reaching [her] decision,
the Attorney General should consider the economics of regulation and
enforcement attendant to [a scheduling decision].  In addition, [she]
should be aware of the social significance and impact of such a decision
upon those people, especially the young, that would be affected by it."

        This fifth factor allows the introduction of several critical
issues, such as the impact of schedule I status and enforcement policies
have on the private therapeutic use of marijuana[<a href="#12">12</a>] as well as their
effects on the cultivation of marijuana for medicinal or personal use[<a href="#11">11</a>].
This factor also allows the introduction of cost/benefit analyses of
decriminalization laws in various states[<a href="#2">2</a>], as well as the evaluations of
various state legislatures on the significance of marijuana abuse as it is
reflected in the scheduling of the substance under state law.[<a href="#24">24</a>]

        The sixth factor concerns the risk, if any, to public health.  "If
a drug creates no danger to the public health, it would be inappropriate to
control the drug under this bill." A recent editorial in favor of harm
reduction policies in the American Journal of Public Health calls for
development of "a new system that is consistent with present scientific
knowledge and able to incorporate new scientific findings."[<a href="#8">8</a>]  The
Controlled Substances Act provides such a system, and reformers should try
and make the CSA work the way it was intended to before contemplating a new
system.  This factor alone allows for the introduction of harm reduction
policies into scheduling and national drug policy.

        The reputed threat to public health presented by marijuana is a
result of the drug's perceive relation to the use of other dangerous drugs.
The contemporary gateway theory, though, acknowledges that alcohol and
cigarette use precede marijuana use, and that marijuana use does not
predict in any way use of more serious drugs.[<a href="#6">6</a>, <a href="#20">20</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>, <a href="#35">35</a>, <a href="#36">36</a>]
Consequently, the policy ramification of the gateway theory is that the
public health would benefit from successful policies that delay the age of
first use of any drugs.[<a href="#20">20</a>]  Why is marijuana singled out?

        Norman Zinberg clarified the relationship of drug, set, and setting
to the understanding and treatment of drug use and abuse in 1984.[<a href="#37">37</a>]  An
emerging public health model that advocates harm reduction, the study of
use and abuse, and performance evaluation is evidence of gaining
recognition for the utility of Zinberg's ideas.[<a href="#13">13</a>, <a href="#34">34</a>]  A meta-analysis of
correlations between school-aged use of alcohol, marijuana and tobacco
conducted by the Bowman Gray School of Medicine concluded that the primary
correlates of school aged drug use were prior use and access.[<a href="#13">13</a>]

        There is considerable social science data and theory to support the
rescheduling of marijuana under these last two factors representing the
epidemiology and the significance of a drug's actual use in the population.

        The animal models used to determine the abuse potential of a drug
represent synergy between pharmacology and root behavioralism.[<a href="#4">4</a>]  Despite
their excellent predictive validity, they do not present a biological
marker.  This lack of a biological clarification of marijuana's abuse
potential has been the excuse to keep marijuana in schedule I.  The
discovery of the cannabinoid receptor system annihilates that excuse.

        The seventh factor is the substances physic or physical dependence
liability.  It has been long recognized that marijuana is not physically
addictive.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#14">14</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>]

        Advances in neurobiology have provided a biological model for
explaining substance abuse.[<a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>]  Drugs of abuse affect the
production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with response and
reward and now held to explain the compulsive self-administration of
drugs.[<a href="#10">10</a>, <a href="#19">19</a>, <a href="#21">21</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>]

        However, cannabinoid receptors are not located on dopamine
producing neurons.[<a href="#17">17</a>]  In vivo microdialysis has shown that unlike other
drugs[<a href="#10">10</a>] THC, the active chemical in marijuana, does not affect striatal
dopamine levels.[<a href="#5">5</a>5]  (Earlier research that had indicated a cannabinoid
effect on dopamine was found to be strain-specific, and has not been
replicated in other animal studies.[<a href="#1">1</a>, <a href="#17">17</a>, <a href="#33">33</a>])

        Heroin (schedule I), cocaine (schedule II) and amphetamines
(schedule III) all affect dopamine production.  Marijuana, cannabinoids,
and THC do not.  Where shall we schedule marijuana under existing
provisions of controlled substances act?

        The eighth factor concerns the relation of the substance to other
scheduled chemicals.  The discovery of the receptor system provides the
scientific basis for considering cannabinoids as a family with a similar
mechanism of action.  This is especially accurate with regards to the
drug's dependence potential.  Scientists have long accepted the validity of
assertions about marijuana based on research on its constituent parts, such
as THC, cannabinol, marijuana smoke, and experimental cannabinoids.

        There is no basis for distinguishing between the marijuana and THC
in a consideration of dependence potential.

        As a result of this and other information, I believe that
marijuana, cannabinoids, and THC should be removed from schedules I and II,
and I have begun the administrative proceedings to consider this issue.

        By law, petitions for rulemaking changes are sent to the DEA.(21
CFR 1308.44)  The DEA then forwards the petition to the Department of 
Health and Human Services for a scientific and medical evaluation that is 
binding on DEA in regards to scheduling decisions.(21 USC ¤ 811 (b))  The 
Court of Appeals has ruled that petitions must be judged on merit.(NORML v. 
DEA, 559 F.2d 735 (1977))

        The United States has an international obligation under various
treaties to verify this information and take steps to change the
international scheduling of marijuana.  Meanwhile, the subject of where
marijuana should be scheduled pending treaty amendment is open for debate.

        Twenty five years ago the government acknowledged marijuana did not
deserve schedule I status. Unfortunately, however, it decided to wait for
more evidence before ending marijuana prohibition.  The scientific evidence
has been mounting ever since, and none of it legitimately supports
marijuana's schedule I status.

        Justice delayed is justice denied.  The time has come for an end to
marijuana prohibition, and to acknowledge that for the last 25 years
marijuana users have been denied equal protection under the laws of the
United States and its Constitution.

by Jon Gettman</CENTER>

<P>Cannabinoids are the active ingredients in marijuana, and
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the only psychoactive cannabinoid.
Excerpts from frequently cited journal articles follow the brief statements
below.  Because these excerpts are taken out of context, the reader is
encouraged to read the original journal articles.

<P>The primary marker of a drug with a severe dependence liability is
compulsive self-administration by animals in a clinical setting.  Animals
will not self-administer marijuana.

<P>Cannabinoids are non-toxic; lethal effects are non existent.

<P>The pharmacology of cannabinoids was well-characterized by the mid 1980's,
and indicates that marijuana does not pose greater health risks than
alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.

<P>The discovery of the neural mechanism, the cannabinoid receptor system,
which accounts for the characteristic effects of marijuana began in 1989.

<P>Drugs with the highest potential for abuse have a direct effect on the
neurotransmitter dopamine; marijuana does not.

<P>Tolerance to marijuana has also been explained. It results from a natural
process and not cell toxification.  Research has proven that tolerance to
marijuana is not a characteristic of a dependence liability.

<P>Marijuana does not harm the immune system.

<P>The discovery of the neural cannabinoid receptor system provides evidence
of the physiological basis for the medical use of marijuana and
cannabinoids.

<P>Before 1989, because no one knew how marijuana's effects were produced,
scientists were allowed great breadth to speculate about the substance.

<P>Much of the harmful speculation about marijuana prior to the receptor
discovery has based in studies with severe methodological problems.

<P>Prior to 1989, many of these speculative hypotheses were presented to the
public as likely facts which supported various public policies; but no one
really knew what they were talking about.

<P>Primary Marker of Drug Dependence:  "[S]elf-administration of a drug to the
point where the behavior becomes obsessive and detrimental to the
individual is the primary criterion which must be met to classify a drug as
one with significant potential for dependence."  Cicero, T. (1992)
Assessment of Dependence Liability of Psychotropic Substances:  Nature of
the Problem and the Role of the College on Problems on Drug Dependence.
Contractor Document for the Office of Technology Assessment. (Springfield,
VA: National Technical Information Service.  1992.) (NTIS Doc.
#PB94-175643) pg. 6.

<P>Primary Clinical Test of Dependence Liability:  "If the abuse liability of
a substance as defined by the likelihood of it supporting drug-seeking and
drug-taking, is to be evaluated, an assessment of its reinforcing functions
by self-administration is clearly the method of choice."  Brady, J.V. "The
Reinforcing Functions of Drugs and Assessment of Abuse Liability."  In:
Problems of Drug Dependence, 1987.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual
Scientific Meeting, The Committee on Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.
Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on Drug Abuse Research Monograph 81.
Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1988.  pp. 440 - 456. pg. 452.

<P>Marijuana Does Not Meet the Primary Test for Dependence:  "While
self-administration of drugs has been taken as an indication of
psychological dependence and/or abuse potential, few reports claim to have
established experimental models for self administration of Delta-9-THC . .
. This observation suggests limited potential for development of . . .
limited psychological dependence due to the weak reinforcing properties of
Delta-9-THC."  Abood, M.E., and Martin, B.R. (1992), "Neurobiology of
Marijuana Abuse," Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 13:201-206. pg. 203.

<P>The Toxicity of Marijuana:  "lethal effects of overdose by humans are
nonexistent or rare"  Dewey, W.  Cannabinoid Pharmacology. Pharmacological
Reviews. 1986 Vol. 38, No. 2.  pp. 151 - 178. pg. 172.

<P>The Extent of Parmacological Research:  "Our studies of cannabinoids over
the past 22 years have touched upon virtually every aspect of their
actions."  Hollister, L.  "Peregrinations Among Drugs of Dependence:
Nathan B. Eddy Memorial Award Lecture."  In: Problems of Drug Dependence,
1989.  Proceedings of the 49th Annual Scientific Meeting, The Committee on
Problems of Drug Dependence, Inc.  Harris, L. (ed.), National Institute on
Drug Abuse Research Monograph 95.  Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Print.
Off., 1990.  pg. 36-43. pg. 42.

<P>The Relative Abuse Potential of Marijuana:  "Compared with other licit
social drugs, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, marijuana does not
pose greater risks." Hollister, L.E.(1986), "Health Aspects of Cannabis",
Pharmacological Reviews, 38:1, 1-20. pg. 17.

<P>The Mechanism of Action for Cannabinoid Effects:  " [Quantatative
radiography has established that a cannabinoid receptor system in the
brain] "is the same receptor [system] that mediates all of the behavioral
and pharmacological effects of cannabinoids . . ."  Herkenham, M., Lynn,
A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain,"
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg.
1935.

<P>Marijuana And  Known Drugs of Abuse:  "The effects of cannabinoids on
dopamine circuits thought to be common mediators of reward are indirect and
different from those drugs such as cocaine and morphine which directly
affect extracellular dopamine levels and produce craving and powerful
drug-seeking behavior." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor
Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W.
Kalivas and H.H.Samson (eds), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 29

<P>Note:  Dopamine-based craving is believed to be neural mechanism
responsible for the phenomenon of denial, in which someone with a drug
dependency has strong urges to deny their dependency, and engage in all
sorts of fictions and escapades to maintain their supply and intake of a
drug. The accounts of patients who have used marijuana medically are often
dismissed on suspicion that these anecdotal accounts are motivated more by
drug dependency than therapeutic benefits.  The distinction noted above is
evidence that this sort of denial is not an element in patient accounts of
the therapeutic benefits of marijuana.

<P>Tolerance to Marijuana : "The magnitude of the present effect, like the
striking behavioral tolerance, may stem in part that, unlike other
psychoactive agonist drugs, cannabinoids can be administered in very high
doses.  It is ironic that the magnitude of both tolerance (complete
disappearance of the inhibitory motor effect) and receptor down-regulation
(78% loss . . .) is so large, whereas cannabinoid dependence and withdrawal
phenomena are minimal.  This supports the claim that tolerance and
dependence are independently mediated in the brain."  Oviedo, A., Glowa, J,
and Herkenham, M. (1993), "Chronic cannabinoid administration alters
cannabinoid receptor binding in rat brain: a quantitative autoradiographic
study." Brain Research, 616:293-302. pg. 300.

<P>Marijuana and Immunosuppression:  "In humans, immune suppression is subtle
and in many cases insignificant.  There is little evidence for cannabinoid
immunosuppression as a causative agent in disease."  Lynn, A.B., and
Herkenham, M. (1993) "Localization of Cannabinoid Receptors and
Nonsaturable High-Density Cannabinoid Binding Sites in Peripheral Tissues
of the Rat:  Implications for Receptor-Mediated Immune Modulation by
Cannabinoids"  Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 268:3
1612-1623. pg. 1620.

<P>The Cannabinoid Receptor System Discovery Explains Why Cannabinoids Have
Medical Value:  "Dense binding in the basal ganglia and cerebellum suggests
cannabinoid involvement in movement control . . . Anticonvulsant and
antiemetic effects of cannabinoids have therapeutic value.  The
localization of cannabinoid receptors in motor areas suggests additional
therapeutic applications.  Cannabinoids exacerbate hypokinesia in Parkinson
disease but are beneficial for some forms of dystonia, tremor, and
spasticity."  Herkenham, M., Lynn, A.B., et al., (1990) "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain,"  Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, 87:1932-1936, 1990. pg. 1936.

<P>Before 1989, Theories Substituted for Facts About Marijuana's Mechanism of
Action :  "Because the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action of
psychoactive cannabinoids were not understood, neuroscientists were allowed
great breadth to speculate upon the influence that these compounds might
have on the neurons of the brain." Howlett, A.C., Bidaut-Russell, M,
Devane, W., Melvin, L., Johnsons, M., & Herkenham, M.,  "The Cannabinoid
Receptor:  Biochemical, anatomical, and behavioral characterization."
Trends in Neuroscience  13:10, 420-423. 1990. pg. 420.

<P>Before 1989, Studies which Caused Some Scientists Alarm Were Based on
Faulty Research: "Most of the biochemical studies employed concentrations
of Delta-9-THC that were in excess of physiologically meaningful
concentrations that might be found in brain.  In addition, the criterion of
structure-activity relationship was not met -- that is, the potencies of
the various cannabinoids in the in vitro  assays did not correlate with
their relative potencies in eliciting characteristic behavioral effects.
Particularly damaging to the relevance of these in vitro studies was the
absence of enantioselectivity."  Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid
Receptor Localization in Brain:  Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"
P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson (eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol
Addiction, Annals of the American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992.
pg. 19.

<P>Before 1989, All Sorts of Research on Cannabinoids Was Conducted Because No
One Knew How they Worked on the Brain:   "Until recently, very little was
known about the cellular mechanisms through which cannabinoids act . .
.Without evidence that cannabinoids act through a specific receptor coupled
to a functional effector system, researchers were prone to study the
effects of cannabinoids on membrane properties, membrane-bound enzymes,
eicosanoid production, metabolism, and other neurotransmitter systems in
vitro." Herkenham, M. (1992), "Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain:
Relationship to Motor and Reward Systems,"  P.W. Kalivas and H.H. Samson
(eds.), The Neurobiology of Drug and Alcohol Addiction, Annals of the
American Academy of Sciences.  654:19-32, 1992. pg. 19.

Substance Abuse: The New Paradigm
by Jon Gettman

Part 1 of 2.

Author:  U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment

Title: Biological Components of Substance Abuse and Addiction - 
Background Paper

Date:  September, 1993

Source:  Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office(OTA-BP-BBS-
117), 68 pgs.  $4.25 + postage from GPO (202) 512-1800.

        This OTA paper reviews medical research through 1992 
regarding the effects of various drugs of abuse on the brain, and by 
way of excellent references, provides a guide to the scientific 
literature for the interested public.  The paper provides:

        A discussion of the basic concepts of neuropharmacology, 
including the brain reward system, adaptive responses such as 
tolerance, dependence, and sensitization, and how the abuse liability 
of various drugs is evaluated and compared.

        A discussion of the specific effects on the brain of cocaine, 
amphetamines, caffeine, nicotine, phencyclidine, alcohol, 
barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates, cannabis and Lysergic Acid 
Diethylamide.

        A discussion of research on inherited traits that may 
increase the risk of drug abuse, primarily reviewing studies on 
alcoholism, with some mention of opiate-related research.

Significance:

        Research on several drugs of abuse has converged on a single 
point -- their impact on the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine 
and their subsequent influence on human behavior through the brain 
reward system dominated by that neurotransmitter.

        The paper reports on the current attributes used for 
evaluating the abuse potential of drugs. OTA reports that no research 
indicates that cannabis (marijuana) shares these attributes. OTA 
fails to discuss the ramifications of such a finding.

Excerpts:

        "The capacity to produce reinforcing effects is essential to 
any drug with significant abuse potential, whereas tolerance and 
physical dependence most commonly occur but are not absolutely 
required to make such a determination . . . The predominant feature 
of all drugs with significant abuse potential properties is that they 
are self-administered . . . Animal models of self-administration 
provide a powerful tool that can give a good indication of the abuse 
liability of new or unknown drugs."  OTA 1993 pg. 5.

        "While marijuana produces a feeling of euphoria in humans, in 
general, animals will not self-administer THC in controlled studies.  
Also, cannabinoids generally do not lower the threshold needed to get 
animals to self-stimulate the brain reward system, as do other drugs 
of abuse."  OTA 1993 pg. 34.

Discussion:

        The executive summary explains that susceptibility to drug 
abuse is influenced by such factors as the biological response to a 
drug, a person's psychological makeup, and the drug's availability.

Title:  Technologies for Understanding and Preventing Substance Abuse

Date:  September, 1994

Source Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, (OTA-EHR-
597) 260 pgs.  $15.00 + postage from GPO (202) 512-1800.

        Several committees of Congress asked the Office of Technology 
Assessment (OTA) to study the socioeconomic, psychological, 
physiological and genetic foundations for substance abuse and 
addiction.  OTA's report on the Biological Components of Substance 
Abuse and Addiction was published in 1993 (see above); this is the 
companion report that reviews social science research that has 
implications for prevention efforts.

        This report provides an extensive discussion of available 
data and the limitations of the studies that produce it.  Like its 
predecessor, it is a comprehensive guide to current research and its 
varying interpretations.

        This report does not address treatment or law enforcement 
issues

        There are not root causes for drug abuse, but risk and 
protective factors that influence the possibility of abuse within 
different sub populations in different settings.  Research into 
Necessary Preconditions, Individual Factors, and Activity Settings is 
reviewed, and policy options for prevention funding are discussed in 
conclusion.

        Appendices review the history of drug control policy in the 
U.S., existing federal prevention programs, and provide a list of 
original research papers contracted for this study and extensive

Significance:

        This paper re-presents the material from the 1993 OTA report.  
With regard to marijuana, while more research strides were made 
between the publication of the two papers, even less is reported 
about the biological basis for cannabis use than in the 1993 paper.

        Four models for considering prevention issues are reviewed, a 
Public Health Model, a Medical Model, a Criminal Justice Model, and 
the over-generalized approach of mass communications.

        Leading indicators of drug use are criticized  for several 
limitations, including the government's credibility, over-looked 
populations, measuring use but not abuse, and little opportunity to 
conduct multi-variate analysis.

        Teenage use of "legal" drugs precedes use of marijuana.

        The statistical results of 242 studies have been analyzed to 
sort risk factors into 11 major categories (50 sub categories), and 
to establish strong, moderate, and weak relationships between risk 
factors and school age drug use.

        Analysts are beginning to find the differences between drug 
use and abuse more interesting than the differences between legal and 
illegal drugs.

        Commercially marketed prevention programs, such as DARE, 
require extensive evaluation studies.  To date, the few evaluation 
studies that have been done do not indicate success at prevention of 
drug abuse.

Excerpts:

On the Brain Reward System:

        "Most drugs of abuse, either directly or indirectly, are 
presumed to affect the brain reward system.  Inducing activity in the 
brain reward system gives drugs of abuse positive reinforcing actions 
that support their continued use and abuse."  OTA 1994 pg. 45.

        "The rewarding properties of stimulant drugs such as cocaine 
and amphetamines are due directly to the effects of the chemical 
dopamine. Opiates, on the other hand, indirectly stimulate dopamine 
by activating other chemical pathways, which in turn increases 
dopamine activity.  All of these drugs have reinforcing properties.  
Phencyclidine (PCP) is also a strong reinforcer but its relationship, 
in any, to activity in the dopamine pathway has yet to be 
established.  Other drugs are either weak reinforcers or have not 
been shown to support self-administration in animal experiments.  
Nicotine stimulates dopamine neurons; however, its effect is modest 
when compared with cocaine or amphetamine.  Likewise, caffeine is a 
weak reinforcer, but the precise mechanisms of its reinforcment are 
unclear.  Finally, cannabis and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) also 
produce positive effects that clearly support their use."  OTA 1994 
pg. 47.

On the Stepping Stone and Gateway Drug Theories:

        "While study results vary somewhat, the sequence most often 
reported is that alcohol and cigarette use come first, followed by 
marijuana use and then by the use of other illicit substances."  OTA 
1994 pg. 74.

        "(T)he criminalization of marijuana may have caused some 
marijuana users to move on to other illicit substances through 
contact with the subculture of illicit users."  OTA 1994 pg. 74.

        In one study, "delinquency and youthful sexual activity 
tended to precede the use of marijuana and hard liquor. . . The early 
use of so-called gateway drugs, such as beer and cigarettes, may 
contribute to later problem behaviors, while the later use of 
marijuana, hard liquor, and other illicit substances may be more the 
result of extended participation in problem behaviors"  OTA 1994 pg. 
78.

        "Because many individuals who use substances do not go on to 
substance abuse, and because one level does not guarantee use at a 
higher level, these stages are descriptive but not predictive."  OTA 
1994 pg. 80.

On National Surveys:

        "Drug measures focus on use, rather than abuse or addiction.  
The common measures of drug use employed by the Household and Seniors 
Surveys - lifetime, past year, and past month use-are insufficiently 
refined to distinguish between casual and dependent use."  OTA 1994 
pg. 38.

On learning from those who use drugs without abuse:

        "What prevents some individuals from progressing from initial 
use to abuse to addiction? . . . Studying those individuals who do 
not progress from use to addiction may provide insights and lessons 
about how to prevent progression among those who do progress."  OTA 
1994 pg. 75

        "But what about those individuals who live in stressful and 
chaotic conditions - who are constantly exposed to many of these risk 
factors - yet who do not develop substance abuse problems?"  OTA 1994 
pg. 115.

On the Public Health Model for understanding abuse and addiction:

        "The legality or illegality of a drug is an artificial 
barrier that is not as relevant as the health-related considerations 
stemming from all types of drug use.  Rather than using 
legal/illegal, the public health approach categorizes drugs by such 
characteristics as addictive potential and long-term health risks. . 
.Dealing with the drug problem primarily as a moral problem is 
considered inappropriate and counterproductive (as part of the public 
health model)." OTA, 1994 pg. 29.

On Ethnographic studies of Marijuana Use:

        "Differences in marijuana smoking may also be partially 
attributable to gender.  In a recent review, it was shown that men's 
marijuana smoking was tied more to the  availability of the drug, 
while women's smoking was affected to a greater degree by social 
influences, such as weekday versus weekend smoking, and the smoking 
of their male partners. Women have also been shown to increase their 
marijuana smoking during periods of anger and other unpleasant 
dispositions."  OTA 1994 pg. 90.

        "Most of the ethnographic research on marijuana use has been 
conducted outside the United States.  Much of it was initiated in the 
1960's and 1970's . . .In Jamaica, for example, anthropologists Vera 
Rubin and Lambros Comitas directed a research team of 45 . . .Their 
controversial findings were that none of the deleterious social or 
medical consequences believed by many to be associated with the drug 
in the United States could be found among Jamaican users."  OTA 1994 
pg. 124.

Discussion:

        The findings OTA reports on marijuana are very exciting 
because of their possible impact on marijuana's legal status under 
federal law, however that is just one application of the technologies 
of this report, and but one measure of this report's significance.

        This is the most valuable report on substance abuse in the 
United States since the second report of the National Commission on 
Marihuana and Drug Abuse in 1973.

        The title is very important, and very revealing:  
"Technologies for Understanding and Preventing Substance Abuse and 
Addiction."  Ideas, theories, programs, policies, and though 
unmentioned, laws as well, are all technologies.  They are all 
subject to evaluation, or assessment, by conventional standards.  The 
drug war has reached a critical, and perhaps terminal stage where it 
has been going on long enough for empiricism to take over from 
theory.         This report represents the end of the "Just Say No!" 
monopoly on prevention efforts, one of the driving forces behind 
marijuana prohibition. Effectiveness is replacing strength as the 
standard of evaluation.

        OTA recognizes a prevention program market that receives one 
fourth of the funds given to local jurisdictions under the Drug Free 
Schools and Communities Act.  Three programs "have captured a sizable 
share" of the market, DARE, Quest: Skills for Living; and Here's 
Looking at You 2000. Only DARE has been evaluated sufficiently for 
conclusions to be drawn about the program.

        DARE is one of the better funded prevention programs and is 
delivered to 5 million students at a cost of $10 each.  Of the 
studies reviewed by OTA on DARE's effectiveness, "the average 
reductions in substance use were very small.  Use among control 
schools and DARE schools was roughly equal." (OTA, 1994 pg. 150-151)  
While the program has important strengths, school-based prevention 
technologies "have not been refined and tested enough to demonstrate 
their effectiveness."

        OTA commissioned a study involving 9930 statistical analyses 
from 242 separate studies reporting relationships between substance 
use by school age youths and its postulated causes, and OTA only 
summarizes the findings of this study in this report.  Tobacco, 
alcohol, and marijuana accounted for 82% of the completed analyses.

        Only four variables were held to have strong relationships to 
school-age drug use.  "1)  prior and concurrent use of substances, 2) 
substance use by peers and friends, 3) perceived peer attitudes about 
substance use, and 4) offers to use substances."  (OTA 194 pg. 147)  
Of the 15 variables with moderate relationships to substance use, 7 
were social variables involving resistance skills, peer pressure, and 
beliefs about consequences.

        These findings need to be examined in more detail, but they 
should be of immense help in evaluating the theoretical basis for 
many prevention programs which lack performance data for evaluation.

        The significance for policy discussions is that these 
findings suggest that availability itself is probably the greatest 
contributing factor to school-age drug use.

        The role of tobacco and alcohol marketing, and the role of 
head shops is discussed in the context of the availability of drugs 
as a necessary precondition for abuse.

        Distinctions are made between use, abuse, and addiction.  OTA 
is straightforward that substances differ in their abuse liability, 
and the line between use and abuse varies.  The goals of prevention 
programs vary between attempting to prevent initial use, delay 
initial use, or reduce or control continued use.  While there is a 
progression to the use of various drugs, OTA reports that these 
stages are descriptive, not predictive. There is considerable 
evidence that expectations play an influential role in drug use and 
abuse.

        Ethnographic studies and anthropology have begun to make 
important contributions to understanding substance abuse.  Four 
social contexts are recognized: a drug focused subculture, drug use 
as part of a larger lifestyle or identity, normal, recreational use 
among specific partners or peers, and use in social isolation.  
(Interestingly, medical marijuana use is provided as an example of 
drug use in social isolation.  Sad, true in too many cases, and 
unnecessary.)

        However, "most of the ethnographic research has concentrated 
on drug-focuses subcultures or on crime-related subcultures.  There 
are too few studies on other populations . . . (for example) no 
significant ethnographic studies of student drug use in almost two 
decades.  The drug problem has been defined in the public mind and 
among some funding sources as a problem of poor minority communities. 
. . Drug use and drug users are defined as the "other," different 
from the rest of society.  Ethnographers have paid relatively little 
attention to the relationship between culturally approved drug use 
(e.g., caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, psychoactive prescription drugs) 
and illicit drug use."  (OTA 1994 pg. 128-129)

        The elements of notable prevention programs include:  
promoting social and life skills, strengthening families, promoting 
healthy peer interaction, indirect and participatory approaches to 
substance use, and alternative activities.

        A considerable amount of material covered by OTA is not 
reviewed here.  This includes a review of all major drug use 
indicators and considerable discussion of the demographic differences 
in drug use by people of different genders and races.  Relationships 
between individual risk factors and aggressiveness, delinquency, 
physical and sexual abuse, and mental disorders are also discussed.

        Technologies are problem solving tools that have benefits and 
limitations.  This article has touched on a few of the technologies 
that are most relevant to marijuana law reform:  the brain reward 
system, the gateway drug sequence, the public health model, the 
isolation of primary causes of school-age drug use, the use of 
ethnographic studies, the elements of successful prevention programs 
and learning about drug abuse from drug use.  These are all tools 
that provide new ways to address, solve, and explain old problems.

        Advocates of marijuana law reform must become familiar with 
the latest findings in these and other areas, otherwise arguments for 
reform will become increasingly irrelevant as the context of public 
policy discussions evolves.

 Interview with Professor Raphael Mechoulam, Codiscoverer of THC

The International Journal of the Addictions, 21(4&5), 579-587, 1986.

        The interview was conducted by Stanley Einstein in Jerusalem 
on January 14, 1985.

        Mechoulam provides a brief history of research preceding his 
isolation of THC with Yehiel Gaoni in 1964, and discusses some of the 
possible therapeutic applications that can be derived from 
cannabinoids.

        "Probably the major barrier has been the unwillingness, or 
fear, by companies to develop drugs that are based on cannabis.  They 
are afraid, as I said before, of notoriety.  They were afraid that 
they would get into a jam of sorts.  So for the first ten years after 
our discoveries, essentially no work has been done whatsoever on the 
pharmaceutical properties of cannabis.  Even afterwards the work that 
was done, was done very, very timidly and very slowly.  Even when 
work done at a scientific level it was stopped at the corporate- 
administrative level . . . Most industries and governments do not 
know how to make use of scientists and scientific ideas."  pg. 587.

The Chronic Cerebral Effects of Cannabis Use

I  Methodological Issues and Neurological Findings

II Psychological Findings and Conclusions

The International Journal of the Addictions, 21(6), 605-642, 1986.

        (I) "On the basis of available research, it was concluded 
that there is no evidence that marijuana produces gross structural 
cerebral changes and little evidence that it leads to functional 
impairment, although subtle impairment cannot be ruled out." pg. 605.

        (II) "Evidence from both American and cross-cultural studies 
suggests that marijuana probably does not produce chronic cerebral 
impairment, although subtle impairment cannot be ruled out." pg. 629.

        This paper summarizes what research had determined about 
marijuana's effects on the brain by the early 1980's.

        This paper also marks a transition in the focus of research 
from brain damage to brain function.

Health Aspects of Cannabis

Pharmacological Reports, 38(1), 1-20. 1986.

        This article reviews a) the acute and chronic effects of 
cannabis in humans b) the possible adverse effects of cannabis on 
health and c) the therapeutic uses of cannabis.  This article is 
cited frequently and is considered one of the most authoritative 
analyses of cannabis-oriented research to date.  Subsequent research 
has tended to support Hollister's conclusions, particularly in regard 
to tolerance and dependence.

        "Tolerance is not a problem when doses are small, or 
infrequent, or where the pattern of use of the drug is not prolonged.  
Tolerance only becomes a major factor with high, sustained, and 
prolonged use of the drug . . . Large doses of THC are required over 
long time periods for tolerance to develop.  As most social use of 
the drug does not meet these requirements, neither tolerance nor 
dependence has been a major issue in its social use."  pg. 9.

Determination and Characterization of a Cannabinoid Receptor in Rat 
Brain

Molecular Pharmacology, 34:605-613.  1988.

        Prior to this study, "one reason for our lack of insight 
concerning the actions of cannabinoid drugs in the (Central Nervous 
System) is that a clearly defined cellular mechanism(s) for this 
class of drugs has remained elusive."  pg. 605.

        It had long been suspected that the effects of cannabis were 
mediated by receptors in the brain, but until this study the 
technology to determine and characterize these receptors did not 
exist.  Prior research had established criteria for a 
pharmacologically distinct cannabinoid receptor; this study met those 
criteria by using autoradiographic binding of a potent isomer of THC 
to tissues from a rat brain.

Cannabinoid Receptor Localization in Brain

Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, 87:1932-1936. 
1990.

        Herkenham's research team applied the technology developed by 
Howlett's team to locating cannabinoid receptors in guinea pig, rat, 
dog, monkey and human brains.

        Receptors are most dense in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, 
and cerebellum, and are sparse in the lower brainstem areas 
controlling heart and lung functions.  "High densities of receptors 
in the forebrain and cerebellum implicate roles for cannabinoids in 
cognition and movement." (pg. 1932.)

        Addressing recent interest in dopamine release in the brain, 
Herkenham notes that:  "The presence of cannabinoid receptors in the 
ventromedial striatum suggests an association with dopamine circuits 
thought to mediate reward.  However, reinforcing properties of 
cannabinoids have been difficult to demonstrate in animals.  
Moreover, cannabinoid receptors in the basal ganglia are not 
localized on dopamine neurons."  pg. 1936.

QUAD-CITY TIMES <tt></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police sealed off Davenport's
Credit Island Park and made more than 30 arrests Saturday after a
melee broke out between officers and participants at a
marijuana-themed festival there. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Davenport police officer, Chad
Langager, 36, was hositalized and expected to undergo surgery for
a serious knee injury. One festival-goer who allegedly had been
smoking marijuana came away with a broken nose. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hempfest - which is intended,
organizers have said, to promote the benefits of the hemp plant
from which marijuana is made - was only 90 minutes old when the
disturbance began. The crowd intervened after police moved in
about 1:30 p.m. to arrest four people sharing a marijuana
cigarette, authorities said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There's no free day I'm
aware of where we're not supposed to enforce laws,&quot;
Davenport Police Chief Steve Lynn said. &quot;We tried to deal
with it as effectively as we could.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police set up a command center at
Credit Island Park before the festival began. More than 50
officers, including Metropolitan Enforcement Group officers and
sheriff's deputies, were on the scene. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said several people incited
the assemblage and called it &quot;a crowd of near-riot
proportion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fracas, police reports
state that: officers were pushed, punched and spat upon; one
participant allegedly tried to wrench an officer's nightstick
from his grasp while others grabbed microphones in the park
pavilion and urged the crowd to resist police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police used a substance called
Capstun similar to Pepper Defense Spray to disperse the 300 to
400 Hempfest participants who had come from around the Midwest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses said several children
were affected by the burning, choking mixture. Tamara Kirkland,
17, of Moline, said her 4-year-old niece had to be carried off
after she was sprayed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lynn said the accidental spraying
of some children was unavoidable because of the circumstances. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve participants, including the
Hempfest organizer, Bob Moldenhauer, 43, of Rock Island, were
arrested. Moldenhauer was being held in the Scott County Jail on
$1,040 bond late Saturday, facing charges of possession of a
controlled substance, trespassing, interference and possession of
drug paraphernalia. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reports state that
Moldenhauer was told to leave the scene. He initially complied,
but then returned and tried to hand officers leaflets. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he refused subsequent orders
to leave he was taken into custody and had to be taken to the
ground before he could be restrained, according to the reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people arrested were being
held on various charges, including possession of marijuana,
inciting a riot and assaulting a police officer. More than 20
people, many of them in their teens, were issued citations, but
were not held in custody. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the Capstun spray
outraged some crowd members such as Josh Abney, 19, of East
Moline. &quot;They sprayed me, and I threw my Mountain Dew bottle
at them,&quot; he said. &quot;They made it a riot.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya Wheeler, 19, of Moline, said
she felt the police provoked the fracas. &quot;The mace wasn't
aimed at people smoking,&quot; she said. &quot;They were walking
around spraying everybody. I had it in my mouth, and it burns
your throat.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other witnesses also said the
arrests were made with excessive force. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said the event never should
have been held in the park in the first place. Instead of
acquiring a permit, Hempfest organizers applied for the use of a
park shelter which only requires notifying the city's parks and
recreation department. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They trashed LeClaire Park
three years ago, and the city said they were not supposed to come
back,&quot; he said. &quot;But they circumvented the license this
time.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Hempfest was held in
September 1993 at Prospect Park in Moline, neighbors complained
to city officials, saying it was nothing more than a &quot;drug
party.&quot;</tt> </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- What started out
to be a day of peace and love quickly descended into violence and
arrests, as this year's spring Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park
was closed early Saturday afternoon by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-three people were arrested
on charges ranging from possession of controlled substances to
assault, and one Davenport police officer was seriously injured. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police and festival participants
alike described the incident as a &quot;riot&quot; situation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old police officer, a
16-year veteran of the department, suffered a leg injury that
requleed surgery at a local hospital. Because he is an undercover
officer, his name was not released by police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reported no other injuries. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's festival began at noon.
Shortly before 1 p.m., police began making arrests.</tt></font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <font size="+2"><b><p>'Our intent was <br>
    not to close the <br>
    park down, but just <br>
    to monitor the <br>
    situation ....'</b></font> <font size="+1"><br>

    Davenport Police</font><br>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<tt>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's when some of the
festival-goers violently resisted arrest and started
&quot;throwing bottles and rocks,&quot; said Officer Dave
Kanaack, one of about 20 officers at the scene. &quot;Our intent
was not to close the park down, but juat to monitor the situation
with regard to Iowa laws.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since possession and recreational
use of hemp, from which marijuana is derived, is illegal, Officer
Kanaack said, &quot;We're not just going to look the other
way.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, some of the
festival-goers held a different viewpoint. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It's not right. We should be
able to do what we want,&quot; said Joe Smith of Rock Island, who
came to the festival just before the violence broke out.
&quot;Everybody was just having a good time until this started. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It just broke out out of the
blue,&quot; he said after police closed the island at 1:33 p.m. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said many in the crowd
defended those who were being arrested. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Everybody stood up for
everybody else,&quot; he said, estimating the crowd to be about
1,000. Other crowd estimates were much lower. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Smith said police officers
used Mace to control and subdue the festival-goers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officer Kanaack said &quot;there
was an accident with a police officer&quot; who was trying to
control one individual and &quot;some residual spray got in the
direction of the crowd. Unfortunately, a lot of people were
involved in this.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hubert Evans of Davenport, who
left the park just before the riot broke out, called the police
department later Saturday to complain about their treattuent of
the public. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I don't appreciate them
being so reckless with people's lives, walking around
intimidating people,&quot; he said of police behavior before
arrests were made. &quot;They were creating a military threat in
a peaceful situation. It was deliberately provocative.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It used to be so different
at the different locations. They were so much more lenient,&quot;
said Sharon Valle of Bettendoff. &quot;Occasionally, cops would
stop by and look intimidating. But it would be very
peaceful.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least three men still were
being held in the Scott County Jail Saturday night. According to
a jail spokesman, the men, whose ages and addresses were not
available, were: Joseph Loughead, charged with rioting and
interference with official acts; Christopher Rice, charged with
assault with injury to a Police officer, rioting and Interference
with official acts; and Michael Winterlin, charged with assault
with injury to a police officer, interference with official acts
and disorderly conduct. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hemp Pest organizer Robert
Moldenhauer of Rock Island was arrested and charged with unlawful
assembly, failure to disperse and possession. He could not be
reached Saturday for comment. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Davenport officer Saturday night
said the department may be perceived to be harsher than others
because &quot;we've always pretty much had zero tolercance on any
kind of drug activity.&quot; He said that reflects Chief Steve
Lynn's position. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's melee wes not the first
time tensions have risen between police and attendants of Hemp
Fest in the Quad-Cities. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police made &quot;several&quot;
arrests in May 1995 during a festival at Loud Thunder Forest
Preserve near Andalusia. Charges ranged from possession of
cannabis, minors in possession of alcohol and contributing to the
delinquency of minors all misdemeanors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rock Island County Sheriff
Department Capt. Richard Fisher said at the time that the Loud
Thunder event &quot;was a complete disaster.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September 1993, Moline police
received complaints of illegal drug use, fighting, open profanity
and yards being used as bathrooms during a hemp fest in Prospect
Park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that event, Moline Police
Chief Steve Etheridge said officers declined to make arrests in
Prospect Park, fearing the actions &quot;would start a
riot.&quot;</tt> </p>

Staff writer </p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVENPORT -- Hemp Fest
organizer Bob Moldenhauer said Monday he may move next year's
event to private property after the mass arrests at Saturday's
festival -- arrests he says were intended solely to silence him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a vendetta against me --
it's not about the Hemp Fest anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;What
happened Saturday afternoon was a well-orchestrated effort,
pre-planned by the Davenport Police Department.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not true, police Lt. Dave
Struckman said Monday. Officers made arrests and closed Credit
Island Park only because some participants blatantly were
breaking laws and inciting riot, he said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A melee began after police tried
to arrest four people allegedly smoking a marijuana cigarette,
according to reports. Others in the crowd began throwing bottles
and rocks at police and using loudspeakers to encourage people to
resist arrest, police said. Mr. Moldenhauer said police arrested
him and the others to keep him and others from talking to the
crowd about Libertarian philosophies and decriminalization of
marijuana. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They wanted to silence me,
to keep me from telling people that government does not really
exist,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a private corporation that
takes our money, and that's it.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody silenced Mr. Moldenhauer,
Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We gave him a forum,&quot;
he said. &quot;He had an hour and a half to exercise his right to
free speech. He could talk about anti-government, pro-marijuana
or whatever. But we had told these folks that we would not sit
back and let them violate the law.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers openly were
smoking marijuana, even though police were nearby and had
supplied an &quot;amnesty barrel&quot; in which the public could
dump their marijuana as they entered, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our officers would have
loved to have been there and not had to do a damned thing,&quot;
he said, &quot;but it was too blatant to overlook.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police estimate 300 to 400 people
attended the event. Thirty-three were arrested on charges ranging
from possession of controlled substances to assault. During the
melee, a 36-year-old Davenport police officer had his leg broken
when Christopher Rice, 28, of Rock Island allegedly fought being
arrested, according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Winterlin, 21, of
Bettendorf was charged with assault on a police officer,
disorderly conduct and interference with official acts after he
allegedly taunted police, chanted obscenities against the police,
spit in the face of one officer and punched another in the chest,
according to police reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That's inciting a
riot,&quot; Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Officers employed a chemical spray
to subdue the crowd, but Mr. Moldenhauer said reports of its use
were exaggerated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I only saw one (officer)P
using it, and I was standing right downwind from him,&quot; he
said. &quot;If he'd bee using a lot of it, I'd have known. It was
just an intimidation tactic.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer Cooper of Moline said
police handled festival-goers too roughly. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;People who weren't moving
fast enough got kicked around and roughed up,&quot; she said.
&quot;One guy was still getting kicked after he was cuffed and on
the ground.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lt. Struckman said the police
department has received no complaints about officer's deportment
during Saturday's arrests. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fest organizers rented a city park
shelter under an individual's name instead of trying to get a
permit for the fest from the city, according to Scott County
Sheriff Mike Bladel, whose deputies assisted city police at the
park. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We weren't told we needed a
permit,&quot; Mr. Moldenhauer said. &quot;The city wanted things
to occur just as they did. I think next year we might move the
fest to private property. Then the police won't have any excuses
for this kind of thing.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn't stop police from
making drug arrests, Lt. Struckman said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Even on private property,
there are things called 'laws,'&quot; he said. &quot;It may be
private property, but if you open the event to the general
public, it becomes sort of public domain. Police could still be
there under-cover.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Mr. Moldenhauer's view,
marijuana use is not prohibited by law in Iowa. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Under Iowa law, a person is
defined as a legal entity,&quot; he said. &quot;But according to
Black's legal dictionary, a legal entity is not a natural person.
So you can have all the pot you want because you're not a
person.&quot;</tt> </p>

<BR>QUAD-CITY TIMES

<TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the disturbance that landed him in jail and led to 30 other arrests, the Rock Island man who organized last weekend's Hemp Fest at Credit Island Park says he has no plans to 
discontinue the semiannual event and will move it to private property next time.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I ain't gonna let 'em stop Hemp Past,&quot; Robert Moldenhauer said Monday.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer, 41, faces numerous charges, including criminal trespassing and marijuana possession, in the wake of the melee that broke out when police and fest-goers clashed Saturday afternoon.  The event, promoted last week with fliers that included a hand-drawn map directing participants to Davenport's Credit Island, attracted as many as 400 people from across the Midwest.  Davenport police said.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer does not dispute police reports that list him as the event's organizer.  He said he reserved a park shelter by paying $20, and then paid a $150 damage deposit at the request of 
the city of Davenport's legal department.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the past six years, he has arranged numerous other Hemp Fests in the Quad-Cities, he said.  Some of the twice-a-year events have resulted in disturbances not unlike the one Saturday.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But instead of bouncing around from one city park to another and being &quot;hassled&quot; by police, Moldenhauer says he intends to move future Hemp Fests to private property.  If police try to intervene, they will be trespassing, he warned.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And we'll deal with trespassers the way trespassers should be dealt with,&quot; he said, declining to elaborate.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He denied that the purpose of Saturday's event was to promote illegal drug use, even though the fliers intercepted last week by police suggested otherwise.  The leaflets advised participants to &quot;remember to bring a bud,&quot; a reference to marijuana cigarettes.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moldenhauer argues the fests are designed only to promote the benefits of hemp -- the plant from which marijuana is derived and to educate people about the government.  He said police quashed Saturday's fest, not because of its hemp theme, but because they wanted to censor his views.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They intended to shut it down primarily to silence me,&quot; he said.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The government doesn't like to hear what I have to say because it exposes them as extortionists.&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police, who had a command center set up across the street from the park, said they were there only to monitor the situation and enforce the law.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They moved in after observing four people share a marijuana cigarette.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems began when the crowd lashed out against the arresting officers.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some fest-goers formed a circle around officers, yelled obscenities and threw bottles at them.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One officer suffered a broken leg while trying to restrain one of the participants.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 36-year-old officer was recovering Monday at a Davenport hospital after he underwent surgery Saturday afternoon.</TT>

<TT>Rally Report
<BR>by Chris Rice

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday, May 16th, 1996 couldn't have been a more beautiful day for the Quad Cities Hemp Coalition's twelth semiannual Hempfest being held on Credit Island on the Mississippi River in Davenpot, Iowa.  It soon became apparent that this fest wasn't going to be as groovy as the others.  A heavy police presence greeted Hempsters, and police "Amnesty Barrels" decorated the entrance to the island.  Only an hour into the event, which started at High Noon, the police moved into the center of the crowd and attempted to search a woman's purse who had been seen smoking some kind of "hand rolled cigarette."  Members of the crowd informed the woman, who was not under arrest at the time, that she did not have to consent to a search.  The officer tugged on the purse while pursuading the woman to give it up.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, police decended on the crowd from their temporary island command post, slamming fest participants to the ground and spraying capstun on the crowd indiscriminately.  Thirty-three were arrested and hundreds were cleared from the island.  A police officer's leg was broken when another officer fell on him.  Chris Rice, a fest organizer, was charged with breaking the officer's leg even though he was faced down on the ground and handcuffed at the time.  Local news broadcasts showed a woman looking for her baby being sprayed in the face repeatedly with capstun.  Davenport police chief Steve Lynn (business phone # 319-326-7778) was present for the entire event.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A demonstration in response to this event is planned for Saturday, July 27th, 1996 at the Scott County Courthouse, 416 West 4th Street, Davenport, Iowa.  The police are saying that Hempfest is closed down for good and we need to show them otherwise.  Call Chris Rice (309) 794-9107 for info.

<FONT SIZE=+1><TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, May 18th, 1996 there was a Hempfest held on Credit Island in Davenport, Iowa.  The police decided they were going to shut down Hempfest and showed up in full force.  They stepped up to the front of the crowd and attempted to grab a woman's purse.  When members of the crowd told the woman that she doesn't have to consent to a search, the police officers responded by slamming festival participants to the ground and spraying the crowd with capstun indiscriminately.  The police are saying they have shut down Hempfest for good.  They think that we will stop fighting for our rights!  Well that's not going to happen.  Now is when we pull together and make an axample of Davenport, Iowa.  We are going to come back stronger than ever!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way that the police and Davenport are going to stop us from having this type of gathering is to stop arresting people for Cannabis; free our friends and family doing years in prison for Cannabis; and allow us to grow a personal amount to consume in our own homes and on other private property with the consent of the owner.  Stop sending armed masked men in black to break down our doors, invade our homes, throw us to the floor, and drag us away in the middle of the night to live for years in chains.  Then, and only then, will we stop demanding an end to this atrocity!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are tired of being used as an excuse for politicians to tamper with the rights guaranteed to us in the Constitution.  We love America and we want her to live up to her promise.  It's a free country:  Like it; Leave it; or change it.  We intend to change it back to the free land our founding fathers intended.  If you can't stand freedom, maybe you should leave!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said, "They will change the law someday."  Ask yourself, "Who are they?"  It's obvious that the powers that be don't have concern for us.  "They" is us, "We the People".  It is up to us to force a change as peaceably as possible.  NOW!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a surprise to almost everyone when alcohol prohibition ended in 1933, and everyone was surprised when the Berlin Wall fell overnight.  Now we are up against the wall and it's time we start pushing.  We have the strength of numbers and the conviction of prior convictions.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sorry if the police and courts set robbers, rapists, and murderers loose in order to prosecute us, but they have been doing just that for years!  The purpose of this action is to end this miscarriage of justice.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently people doing life in prison without parole on cannabis charges.  We are their only hope for freedom and they are counting on us.  Will you let them down, or will you wish you had done something when your turn comes?  If you don't do anything about this then you are also responsible because you allow it to happen.  Join with us and victory is ours!  Live in fear and you might be next!

<FONT SIZE=+1><TT><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 in 4 black males between the age of 18 and 30 are in prison.  The leading cause of this imprisonment is the WAR ON DRUGS!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence has gripped many poor black communities.  This violence is a direct result of the WAR ON DRUGS!  When so many pecple are pushed out of the legal system and courts cannot be depended on for justice, violence seems to be the only alternative.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police have used the WAR ON DRUGS as an excuse to stop and search black males anytime they wish.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WAR ON DRUGS has done more harm to the black community than any other.  There are many divisions separating the black and white community but this is an issue which we can unite on.  Black, white, and hispanic united to stop this war ravaging our communities.  Join us!  We all want our brothers and sisters, friends and family back!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We advocate the legalization of Marijuana for it's peace inducing qualities and other industrial uses.  We do not advocate the use of addictive or hard drugs, but we feel that arrest and imprisonment are not proper solutions.

<P>We are coming together for a demonstration against the WAR ON DRUGS:</TT></FONT>

<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><TT>WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP BRING AN END TO THE DRUG WAR?</TT></FONT></CENTER></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><TT>Spend a little money copying flyers for demonstrations and events.  Distribute them to friends, at the bar, at public events, concerts, 4th of July celebrations, and to the passer by on the street.

<P>Do not support businesses or buy products from companies that support the WAR ON DRUGS.  Call then and tell them why you will no longer buy their products even though you like them.

<P>Go to the County Clerk's office tomorrow end register to vote.  Vote pro hemp and against the DRUG WAR.  Write your elected officials and tell them what issues and positions will effect your vote in the next election.

<P>Tune your radio to AM 1420 between 2:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M., Monday through Friday.  Tell talk radio host Jim Fisher how you feel about the WAR ON DRUGS.  If you are told that they don't want to talk about the WAR ON DRUGS today, it is easy to turn any other subject into a DRUG WAR subject.  To get on the air call (319) 344-7040.

<P>Pay for a billboard or a newspaper ad with a picture of friends and family imprisoned by the WAR OH DRUGS.  Include their name, age. charge. term, address, and a short biography describing how imprisonment has harmed them and their dependents.  People need to know that there are real people doing real time.  We need to put a face to a number.

<P>Attend demonstrations against the WAR ON DRUGS.  Attendance at demonstrations does not mean you are a drug user.  What it does is show the media that there are thousands of people that believe that there has to be a better alternative than a DRUG WAR that focuses on arrest and imprisonment.

<P>If you are in a band, write a song or two about this situation.  Pass out flyers at shows and use your pulpit to announce upcoming events.  Call (309) 794-9107 for information about a local compilation we would like to record to benefit this cause.  We will remember your efforts when we purchase recordings.

<P>If a police officer wants to search your vehicle or person, just say "NO!"  When they say "If you have nothing to hide, why can't I search?", tell them "It is my 4th Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search".  Stick to it.  You don't know if someone dropped a seed in your back seat.  Tell them to "go ahead and get the dogs" if threatened with them.  Let them waste their time.  You don't get any extra credit for helping them send you up.

<P>Think about whether you really want to smoke with someone who doesn't care if you could go to jail for doing it.  Expect people to back up their beliefs with actions.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Hempsters demonstrate against the war on drugs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Davenport, IA July 27, 1996.&nbsp;  The streets of downtown Davenport were infiltrated by a platoon of freedom fighters wearing tee-shirts that read "Bix smokes," armed with 10,000 flyers that describe the world renown jazz musician Bix Beiderbecke as a marijuana user.&nbsp;  Thousands of survivors from the Bix 7 Mile foot race and attendants of the Bix jazz music fest were eagerly snapping up the hand bills.&nbsp;  Meanwhile a few blocks away, a hundred hempsters demonstrated on the lawn of the Scott County Court House.
<BR>
<BR>A press conference hosted by Chris Rice, Quad City Hemp Coalition organizer, explains the demonstration's purpose is: to denounce the police macing and beating of hempsters at the May 18th QCHC rally at Davenport's Credit Island; as part of the Uniting Spirits march to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to protest the war on drugs; and to educate the public of the role marijuana played in the jazz music community.&nbsp;  Speakers included QCHC Chris Rice, libertarian candidate Robin Miller, and Zenger Editor Jackson Clubb.
<BR>
<BR>Chris Rice told the crowd how police at Credit Island started the riot when they wrenched a purse from a woman's hands dispite her protest against search without consent.&nbsp;  Rice continued with how he was beat while being arrested for interferance with the search and how police claim that he broke a police officer's leg during his arrest.&nbsp;  Chris further told of his up coming trial and said, "The cops don't have a leg to stand on."&nbsp;  Read about Credit Island rally on the net at <A HREF="http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/NORML/QCHC/qchc.html"> http://www.commonlink.com/~olsen/NORML/QCHC/qchc.html</A>.
<BR>
<BR>Libertarian candidate from illinios for US Senate, Robin Miller talked about the Libertarian Party platform entitled First Step Towards Freedom; included within he said, "Pardon everyone convicted of nonviolent drug offences ... to empty federal prisons of the marijuana smokers and others who are of no threat to society."&nbsp;  Miller pledged, "The Constitution is our contract with America."
<BR>
<BR>Jackson Clubb encouraged people to go to Chicago and participate in the Uniting Spirits march to the Democratic National Convention.&nbsp;  Clubb said that he was run out of town in the 1970's for organizing rallies and selling tee-shirts that read "Quad Shitties" depicting a cop beating a hippy.
<BR>
<BR>Others told how Henry County Illinios is one big drug war atrocity, where victims are intimidated by police into consent to search and are railroaded through court to jail.&nbsp;  A woman discribed how she served 12 terrible weeks in the Henry Co. jail for one joint.&nbsp;  Mr. Rice told of the excitement of cross country travelers when they see fields of wild marijuana; only to end up in jail for picking ditchweed that gives you a headache.
<BR>
<BR>No law enforcement was visible at the rally, except for two friendly Sheriff Dept. deputies who passed through on bicycles.&nbsp;  The demonstration concluded with 100 protesters carrying signs chantting, "Hay Hay HO HO, we don't want your drug war, Bix smoked reefer," and "We smoke pot and we like it alot."&nbsp;  Local press report "Hemp Fest Peaceful."

<BR>
Dear Dr. Gieringer:<P>

Thank you for taking the time to contact me with your opinions.&nbsp;  As
your Senator, it's important for me to hear from you.<P>

I appreciate your comments regarding proposals to legalize certain illicit drugs as an attempt to address the problems of drug abuse and drug-related crime in America.&nbsp;  However, I firmly believe drug use is wrong and harmful and that it must stop.&nbsp;  This includes marijuana, a drug proven to be both harmful to the user and a major gateway drug for other, more dangerous substances.&nbsp;  Eighty-five percent of people who use harder drugs such as cocaine or crack admit to first having used marijuana.<P>

The effects of marijuana use are well documented.&nbsp;  Using marijuana
produces a dreamy state of consciousness in which ideas seem disconnected, uncontrollable, and free-flowing.&nbsp;  Time, color, and spatial perceptions may be distorted and enhanced.&nbsp;  Communicative and motor abilities are decreased during the use of these drugs.&nbsp;  Difficulty in depth perception and altered sense of timing, both of which are particularly hazardous, are also known effects of using marijuana.&nbsp;  Marijuana is addictive, causes difficulty with persistent memory and cognitive functions, causes personality changes, creates abnormalities in the lungs, creates abnormalities in the unborn, has residual effects on fetuses exposed in utero, and suppresses the immune system.<P>

The argument that the dangers of marijuana are overstated were more plausible in the 1960s and 1970s, when less was known about the full effects of this and many other drugs.&nbsp;  Today, supporting the idea of smoking marijuana for medicinal purposes is similar to supporting tobacco for weight or anxiety control.&nbsp;  There are better, safer, and more effective alternatives that are readily available whose side effects and interactive dangers are known.<P>

Claims that drug users only effect themselves and pose no threat to society are also misguided.&nbsp;  People who use drugs do so to alter their perceptions of reality.&nbsp;  When someone is high, they cannot be as alert to dangers that are always around us, dangers such as a boiling pot on the stove, a burning candle, or even something as simple as an open window.&nbsp;  Drug using workers are 3 to 4 times as likely to have on-the-job accidents, 4 to 6 times more likely to have off-the-job accidents, 2 to 3 times more likely to file medical claims, 5 times more likely to file workman's compensation, and 25 percent to 35 percent less productive on the job.&nbsp;  To claim that drug use affects only the user is to deny the reality that whatever we do effects those around us.<P>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) survey numbers on hospital admissions for drug related emergencies further confirms the alarming problems created by drug use.&nbsp;  At least 500,000 Americans ended up in hospital emergency rooms in 1994 because of drug-related episodes, 40,100 of these episodes were directly related to marijuana.&nbsp;  Marijuana is likely to be mentioned in combination with other substances, particularly alcohol and cocaine.&nbsp;  In 1994, alcohol and cocaine were mentioned during 48 percent of marijuana-related episodes.<P>

Please look at the statement that I made on the floor of the Senate that further addresses the idea of drug legalization.&nbsp;  Drugs are illegal because they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.&nbsp;  We need to work to keep our drug laws strong and effective.<P>

Once again, thank you for communicating your views to me.&nbsp;  Although we may disagree at times, I nonetheless appreciate and encourage your communication with me.&nbsp;  Knowing your concerns helps me to do the best job I can as your U.S. Senator.<P>

Sincerely,<BR>

RE: Public &amp; Scientific Support For Medicinal Marijuana<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;**<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agricultural Support For Industrial
Hemp/Marijuana<br>
&nbsp;***<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutional Violation By Present
Federal Anti-Marijuana Laws</tt></p>

<p><tt>Dear Senator Grassley:</tt></p>

<p><tt>* In the past months &amp; years you have continually
cited, mistakenly, that there is &quot;no public support for [decriminalization]
of marijuana&quot; and that there is &quot;no scientific basis
marijuana is harmless&quot; and that it has &quot;no medicinal or
public health benefit&quot; to be gained from marijuana. It is
believed your anti-marijuana position is but a reflection of the self-serving
status quo of the professional bureaucrats whose 'reports' you
steadfastly quote, ie, your exercise in sophist rhetoric as
contained in the Congressional Record for Monday, January 22,
1996. You were no doubt responding to the professional opinions voiced
in the 'National Review' opposing the Republican's Drug War as a
failed domestic policy. Your logic &amp; argument was skewered by
the fact you labeled a peace-making effort toward
decriminalization as &quot;Drug Legalization&quot;. By-and-large
the public rejected your thesis by voting in support of
decriminalization of marijuana this past November 5th in
Calfornia &amp; Arizona.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Of more recent note in yours of October 30, 1996, to marijuana
activist Carl E. Olsen of Iowans For Medicinal Marijuana, you
continue to parrot self-serving federal bureaucratic reports
&amp; statistics. You must at some point begin to realize the
questionable validity of such self-serving reports as the means
of those agencies' perpetuation. It would appear the public is
able to make this distinction while you are not.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It is time to take an honest look at the sick politics that
foster a war by [north] Americans against Arnericans. The
parallels of the Nazis against the Jews &amp; the Republicans
against the drug culture is all too familiar. The public
recognizes a negative &amp; failed policy as contrary to the
social conscience, and has made that consensus known by thier
recent vote for decriminalization of marijuana.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Regarding scientific findings, your stated opposition to medicinal marijuana
is not license for falsehoods, ie, &quot;There have been over
12,000 published scientific studies of marijuana, none of which
have shown smoking marijuana to be a safe or effective medicine
for the treatment of any condition&quot; as stated in your letter
to Mr. Olsen, then you go on to cite yet another self-serving
federal bureaucratic study(s). There are in fact several
published scietific articles supporting marijuana as a safe &amp; effective
medicine for treatment of a wide range of human maladys. You are
refered to the world's largest drug library @ DRCNet on Internet
and the Library at Iowa State U.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As a 30 year marijuana researcher, and as addressed in a previous
letter to you earlier this year (your silence giving consent), to
deny the phenomena of the many ancient &amp; current medicinal
uses of marijuana is to defy the logic of experience over the
years. To make the argument, as you have, I here quote your very
words as contained at the second to last paragraph of your
statement in the Congressional Record as aforementiomed: &quot;To
make the argument [against medicinal marijuana] requires ... suspension
of judgement, a willingness to accept assertations over facts,
and a professional absence of mind that ignores experience&quot;.</tt></p>

<p><tt>As an Iowan, I have to ask what would make such an astute Senatorial
poli tician 'ignore experience'? You say you have strong feelings
about representative government, but representative of who? Your
references are, without exception, the parrotings of the federal
bureacracy. The natural inference from that is you represent the bureaucracy,
or the bureaucracy wags the politician, as in the tail wags the
dog. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As an ordinary member of the public, I find it suspect, if not outrightly
corrupt, that major pharmeaceutical special interests succeed in
gaining the approval of FDA for dangerous drugs far and away more dangerous
than marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a citizen, I detect the rotten stink of bureaucratic blocking
the availability of marijuana for legitimate research. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As the son of an Iowa farmer, I question the authority of the
Federal Govermment to determine what crops a soverneign State may
produce within it's boundaries. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a taxpayer, I denounce any expenditure on a war against fellow Americans
for exercising thier right to pursue happiness by using marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a victim of glaucoma I've lost the sight of one eye as the
result of the bureaucratic repression you sponsor. On this point,
when government acts to deliberately damage a citizen, it's only
gain is a loss of respect and faith and trust replaced by an
intracable contempt. What you offer at the third paragraph of
page three in your letter to Mr. Olsen is yet further redundancy
of yet another government-funded institute which faithfully
parrots the bureaucratic line opposing marijuana. My personal therapeutic
experience with a multitude of FDA approved medications did not
lower my intraocular pressure sufficient to prevent optic nerve damage
&amp; loss of eyesight only occurred after the Feds acted to
curtail my use of marijuana. That is to say, most emphatically,
until government interference occurred, treatment by marijuana was
effective. Thanks to the Feds, I am today blind in one eye. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">As a matter of common sense, how 'euphoria' is undesirable or
harmful can only be the result of considerable governmental
sophistry.</tt></p>

<p><tt>You say &quot;science does not support these claims&quot;
that marijuana makes some illnesses easier. I believe, based upon
my own experience &amp; research, that you are stating an intentional
falsehood in furtherance of your political opposition to
marijuana and desire to carry-on your party's war against
marijuana. There is no sensible or humane reason to continue an active
war against a benign plant, a plant that has served man's needs for
centuries.</tt></p>

<p><tt>In light of the public support for and historical benefit of
marijuana, it would behoove a truly representative government to
move accordingly and at the very least free the plant for private
use &amp; study. This act may serve to restore some credibility
to politicians and government alike.</tt></p>

<p><tt>It must be recognized that the public is both better informed
&amp; educated than it was when the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act was
passed (by quorum) as a result of industrial fibre interests and
the need for the bureaucrat to justify employment [the BNDD
absorbing Treasury agents put out of work by repeal of alcohol
prohibition]. The public is aware of the federal-level skulduggery
employed to protect &amp; perpetuate federal employment. The public
has grown sick of federal political sophistry &amp; slease, and
have shown that contempt by not voting. The public now represents
a silent majority only occassionally stirred to vote when an obvious
change is needed and thier representatives fail to make that
change; thus California's Proposition 215.</tt></p>

<p><tt>&quot;The best available science, however, clearly and overwhelmingly
demon- strates the contrary&quot; you wrote in denial of
marijuana's beneficial effects. Although obviously oxymoronic, I
will again address the obvious: <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">The science authors you referenced {Leo E. Hollister, Dr. H.S. Greenberg)
conducted thier work under gov't grant, and that they conclude alongside
the gov't's position is no surprise. Those articles in various independent
medical journals all end noting 'inconclusiveness' and the need
for further study which is prohibited by the Federal Government's stramglehold
on the very substance under study. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">At the last few symposiums on marijuana, all government agencies invited,
stayed away, apparently prefering ignorance. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">Your continued oppositional stance, is, in the opinion of this
writer, untenable &amp; counterproductive.</tt></p>

<p><tt>** Marijuana as an agricultural commodity cannot continue to
be ignored. That we as a (so-called) 'free' nation must IMPORT
marijuana clothing, birdseed, paper, etc. is absurd in the
extreme. That a ranking member of the Senate Committee on
Agricultural opposes marijuana is positively ludicrous.</tt></p>

<p><tt>*** As a high school student, a course in U.S. Government was
required. The representatives upon being elected are required to
give an oath to &quot;defend the Constitution&quot;. We were
taught the Constitution was designed as a protection against
government's tendency to tyrannize it's subjects. We were taught
we had certain 'inalienable rights' in the Bill of Rights. We
were taught that ours is a 'dual system of government' under the
Dual Sovereignty Doctrine as expressed by the 10th Amendment to
the Constitution. The Founding Fathers' rationale behind the
mandate of separation of powers was to protect us all against encroachment
of a centralized government. The 10th Amendment clearly states
that the federal government is a government of very limited
powers, that for federal action to be legitimate, it must be
authorized by the Constitution. Congress clearly has no general
police power to legislate for the health, welfare, morals, etc.
of state citizens, and for that reason the Drug Abuse Prevention
Act could not have been enacted to prevent immoral behavior in a
State. What has actually occurred is the passage of a criminal
statute under guise of a commercial regulation.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The only authority that Congress could have used in enacting
the Substance Abuse Control Act was the Commerce Clause, however
is voided by the Supremacy Clause as it can only be invoked when
a State law conflicts or impairs a federal statute, negated by
the fact the State of Iowa adopted the Uniform Substance Control
Act. Extraterritorial application of a federal statute can only apply
when a statute is solely and exclusively the subject matter of
the federal government within a sovereign State of the union. The
federal government is otherwise not constitutionally allowed any
police power within the sovereign states. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="40">When the federal government claims jurisdiction over a subject
matter, it must do so exclusively over the whole of the entirety
of the subject matter, (ie, marijuana) to retain jurisdiction
over said subject matter. Thus, the federal statutes
criminalizing or scheduling marijuana is a prima facie
unconstitutional statute, and those federal representatives enacting
it violated the very oath they were sworn to, ie, defending ine Constitution.</tt></p>

<p><tt>The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Wm. Rehnquist,
recently addressed federal Congressional over-reaching thus:
&quot;[t]he Constitution creates a Federal Government of
enumerated powers. See U.S. Const., Art. I, Section 8 ... the
powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal
government are few and defined. (emphasis added) Those which are to
remain in the State governments are numerous and
indefinite.&quot; Lopez 115 S.Ct. 1624 at 1626 &amp; The
Federalist No. 45, pp. 292-293. The fear of federal tyranny is
great when Congress legislates beyond it's express authority.
Never has the Supreme Court declared that Congress may use a trivial commerce
impact as an excuse for broad regulation, let alone criminalization,
of state or private activities. Lopez at 1629.</tt></p>

<p align="center"><tt>* * * * * * * * * * </tt></p>

<p><tt>Given the wide social acceptance of marijuana citing 20+ million
users (U.S.) according to the U.S. Dept. of Justice (1993) the
time has come to recognize marijuana as a medicine, as a benign
&amp; mildly euphoric plant substance, as not dangerous (no known
overdose nor death resulted), all combine to obviate the social
need to reform marijuana laws. Given the public support for
marijuana decriminalization, politicians have lost their best
excuse for failing to act responsibly. Agricultural interests are expanding
to include marijuana as a viable &amp; highly versatile crop commodity.
The U.S. Constitution plainly does not allow the federal government
or it's representatives to declare a plant a crime (as in employment
justification for a distinct minority of federal agents &amp; bureaucrats)
in a State where they have no jurisdiction to begin with over the
subject matter, ie, marijuana.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Decriminalization of marijuana is proposed and advanced as a
means to begin to heal the wounds of the drug war &amp; restore
public trust in politicians and government. Laws decriminalizing
marijuana are needed to free the user of fear of his government's
oppressive tendencies. Remove an anti-government segment and gain
their involvement in the democratic process. There is tax
revenues to be appreciated from the legitimate marijuana
commodity federally and in each State &amp; locality (prohibitionary taxes
will have to end).</tt></p>

<p><tt>My support for decriminalization is limited to marijuana only.
I remain opposed to all dangerous drugs illicitly produced. My
position is the only danger posed by marijuana is the goverwent's
unsupported prohibition of it.</tt></p>

<p><tt>You are urged to recognize the public's broad support for medicinal marijuana
and the obvious need for decriminalization &amp; reform of
existing marijuana laws and it's absurd scheduling as a Class I
narcotic. The public knows better.</tt></p>

<p><tt>Please act responsibly. You represent the public, not the self-serving bur-
eaucracy.</tt></p>

<BR>
<BR>Carl,
<BR>
<DD>I just wanted to write you a letter and let you know how it's going with me.&nbsp;  As I'm sure you've heard, I was busted on February 13 by U.S. Customs & DEA SWAT teams at my house in Minneapolis.&nbsp;  I was originally charged with conspiracy for over 1,000 kilos of pot, money laundering and 5 counts of possession with intent to distribute.&nbsp;  Everyone on my indictment became informers except me.&nbsp;  Even when told I faced 20 years of federal time, I refused to even meet with narcs, or say anything at all about my activities.&nbsp;  In June I pled guilty to one count of possession of 500 pounds in February 1992.&nbsp;  In August I was sentenced to 63 months in the Bureau of Prisons.
<DD>The state of Texas is currently revoking my probation on an 80 pound possession charge, also from 1992, that may or may not result in more time.&nbsp;  I am presently on my way (hopefully) to a federal corrections institute in Minnesota.&nbsp;  Some people have insinuated that my arrest, like similar arrests of people like Arlin Troutt and Dennis Peron, have discredited the Grassroots Party and the Hemp Movement.&nbsp;  This is absurd.
<DD>The only "crime" I have ever been convicted of is possession of marijuana - the breaking of an unjust and unreasonable law.&nbsp;  The same goes for Arlin and Dennis.&nbsp;  Any you.&nbsp;  I am angry and disgusted by certain elements who are trying to defame people like us who have put their lives on the line to further a righteous cause.&nbsp;  I am not saying that everyone should break the marijuana laws, but I am sickened by self-righteous hypocrites who condemn those of us who have been arrested and given up years of our lives for nothing more than possession of a plant that is a gift from God.&nbsp;  There are three equally important aspects of the cannabis legalization issue: industrial, medical and HUMAN RIGHTS.&nbsp;  Human rights encompasses personal and religious use.&nbsp;  I have always said that the Hemp Movement will only be successful when all three aspects are accorded equal importance.
<DD>There are between 100,000 and a quarter million Americans in prison today for marijuana alone.&nbsp;  Their cause is EVERY BIT as legitimate and vital as that of medical users or "industrial use" advocates.
<DD>For one group of Hemp Activists to look down their noses at another is ridiculous and counter-productive.&nbsp;  It should be remembered that the purpose and intent of the laws against marijuana is the total eradication and extinction of the cannabis plant.&nbsp;  Were it not for "outlaws" who have kept the cannabis species alive over the last 60 years, the industrial and medical use advocates may well not have had a plant to be talking about.
<DD>Ghandi said, "We have a moral obligation to disobey unrighteous laws."&nbsp;  Thoreau said, "In a land where any are imprisoned unjustly, the only place for a truly just man is in prison."&nbsp;  I agree with them both.&nbsp;  I did not become an activist after my arrest - I've been at it for over seven years, and I've worked as hard and given as much as anyone in this movement has.&nbsp;  Now I am giving 5 years of my life in federal prison.
<DD>Marijuana prisoners ask for no special accolades or recognition - we know ourselves the worth of our sacrifice and dedication, for we are the ones who must pay its price.&nbsp;  But we do not deserve the condemnation and recrimination of anyone who claims to fight for Truth and Justice.&nbsp;  The Hemp Movement is stuggling to change a law that will change the world.&nbsp;  We need all the help we can get, and we must work together.&nbsp;  You keep doing your job, and we'll keep doin' ours.
<DD>Until We Win,
<DD>Russell "Bongo" Bentley
<BR>
<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I don't know how much time you have for reading, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LIVING IN TRUTH by VACLAC HAVEL.&nbsp;  Read it, you'll be glad you did.

<p><font size="4"><tt>Dear Mark: </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>A few weeks ago you requested permission to
provide a letter I'd written to Iowa Senator Grassley to various newspapers
&amp; other federal legislators.&nbsp; I'd provided it to Carl

Internet, dispersing it at my request. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>You are encouraged to make that letter
available to anyone who needs to be educated about Cannabis in an
honest manner as opposed to the pervasive govt misinformation. </tt></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><tt>* * * * * * * * </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>I've noted a recent federal push to control &quot;pseudoephedrine&quot;
anti-histamines &amp; cold pills in an effort to further enforce
prohibition of &quot;meth&quot;amphetamine clandestine
production. It should be pointed out to these &quot;pop-law&quot;
lawmakers that use of these remedies are a simple expedient to
the outlaw lab production techniques, and that &quot;meth&quot;
will still be made using bituminous (soft) coal, bleach, battery
(sulfuric) acid, and salt, the latter two combining to make
hydrochloric gas.&nbsp; In the early 1900s this was a widely
known process to make &quot;chicken crank&quot; so the hen would
lay more eggs, grow faster, etc., along with helping the farmers
of the era do more work!&nbsp; &quot;Chicken crank&quot; was used
in a variety of snake-oil concoctions &quot;energizers&quot; and
was an ingredient in some soft drinks, namely 7-Up &amp; Coca
Cola.&nbsp; It can also be produced from coal oil. If Congress
moves to control cold remedies, underground labs in this country
will use commonly available materials to continue
operation.&nbsp; It seems the politicians are unaware that the
'Invisible Hand' of market demand is what fuels the market and no hysterical
&quot;pop-law&quot; will slow it down, much less stop production. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>It should be understood I do not advocate
&quot;meth.&quot;&nbsp; Nor do I advocate any war on Americans by
Americans.&nbsp; It is my belief that the (Lifestyle Police's)
&quot;DRUG WAR&quot; is no more than VERY SICK POLITICS.&nbsp;
It's only product is misery imposed on the underprivileged and
contempt for govt &amp; authority as opposed to respect.&nbsp; No
govt has ever gained it's citizens' respect by means of
prohibition and oppression. </tt></font></p>

<P>July 30, 1996

<P>Dear Carl,

<DD>Thanks for the Summer 1996 NORML newsletter.&nbsp;  As your article on page 11 points out, the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue, which I was counting on, is now dead.&nbsp;  Never, in one term, has any U.S. Supreme Court so damaged the Constitution.
<DD>Besides the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue, they ruled that forfeitures from innocent owners is okay; that police can use pretext stops to search for drugs; limited federal judges' ability to make sure prisons provide legal access to inmates; and approved limiting habeas corpus in death penalty cases.&nbsp;  Now President Clinton is using the Olympic bombing to slip in roaming phone taps!&nbsp;  Who says 1984 isn't around?
<DD>On my appeal, we now expect the Iowa Supreme Court to rule on the legality of mushrooms.&nbsp;  On one level, there is no mention in the statute of any mushroom.&nbsp;  A look at the whole of Iowa's Controlled Substances Act would lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that mushrooms are legal.&nbsp;  They define "drug," in part, as "substances, other than food, intended to affect the structure or any function of the human body..."&nbsp;  Most people would consider a mushroom "food."&nbsp;  The definition of "manufacture" says, in part, "by extraction from substances of natural origin" and all I had was the "substance of natural origin" - mushrooms.&nbsp;  I was in no way "extracting" the psilocybin.
<DD>What the Iowa Supreme Court has to look at, though, is not whether it is fair to put me in prison for 20 years for having mushrooms not even listed as illegal.&nbsp;  What they really better consider is the precedent they will set in my case.&nbsp;  If they say a plant that naturally contains a listed substance is to be treated exactly like the extracted, or chemically synthesized, form, where does that leave the state of law?&nbsp;  Nicotine is illegal (Iowa Code ¤ 205.5) to possess or sell.&nbsp;  Every person with a pack of cigarettes would be in danger of prosecution.&nbsp;  Coffee, beans or brew, that contain caffeine would be subject to "drug" controls.&nbsp;  Home owners would be "manufacturing lysergic acid" if they grow morning glories.&nbsp;  Garden shops that sell San Pedro cactus, a common item, would be open to "sale of mescaline" charges.&nbsp;  The list goes on and on.
<DD>While the Iowa Supreme Court may not care to be fair in my case because it's legally correct to rule I broke no laws, they may think twice if they realize how they rule will affect tobacco and coffee.&nbsp;  NORML should take heed that an adverse ruling in my case opens the door for prosecutorial slight-of-hand and using my case to change a misdemeanor marijuana charge into a felony THC charge.
<DD>If the Iowa Supreme Court holds that mushrooms that naturally contain psilocybin are illegal, even if not specifically prohibited, because they happen to contain, naturally, psilocybin - where does that leave the Declaration of Independence and Constitution?&nbsp;  After all, they are documents that happen to "contain" an illegal substance since they are printed on paper containing hemp.&nbsp;  But then with the way the U.S. Supreme Court and our government is using the trumped up excuse of the "War on Drugs" to undermine these documents, they have already done much towards declaring them as "prohibited substances"!
<DD>We expect a ruling in my case in December or January.&nbsp;  As I said, now that the forfeiture - double jeopardy issue is dead, they will, now, have to rule on the mushroom legality issue.&nbsp;  Will the Iowa Supreme Court declare that much of life on this planet is illegal - which ruling against me will, in essence, do - because 1000s of living organisms naturally contain a controlled substance?&nbsp;  Or will they leave us safe to enjoy our poppy seed rolls, morning glory flowers and other items not specifically outlawed?&nbsp;  Tune in this winter...

<P><DD>Namaste,
<DD>Skip

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Dear Carl:
<BR>
<BR>Well, I went ahead and wrote my Religious Freedom/Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993/1st, 5th, 8th, 9th and 14th Amendments brief.&nbsp; (Whew!!)&nbsp;  Anyway, I doubt if I'd go through it again if I had all the stuff from your marijuana attack ...  and, I'm sure it was more than you would want to send anyway.&nbsp;  So, unless it was real easy for you, you can forget that request.
<BR>
<BR>But I have another one.&nbsp;  Since I am planning for the new trial,
which I hope will not be necessary, but "just in case" I want to be ready ... and have a couple of requests.
<BR>
<BR>One, the FIJA people wrote me and said you were the one to contact in Iowa.&nbsp;  They mention in the newletter on information they have in their "Activists' Supply Shop" that tells how to inform the jury at the trial.&nbsp;  Do you have that literature?&nbsp;  I couldn't tell from the list which it was, and couldn't afford it if I could have.&nbsp;  If you have this could you send me a copy?&nbsp;  (THE INFO FOR ATTORNEYS ON HOW TO SLIP IT IN IN OPENING/CLOSING ARGUMENT)
<BR>
<BR>Two, If my case does go to trial next year (Feb, March or April) would you be able, perhaps, to get a couple of persons to hand out the "True or False" FIJA leaflets?&nbsp;  I think that would help a lot as I will be making a good case to the jury on mushrooms safety, religious use, and the silliness of the law that prosecutes someone for something not even listed as illegal and sends them to prison for 20 years.&nbsp;  (THE TRIAL WOULD PROBABLY BE IN SCOTT COUNTY - FOR LEAFLETING)
<BR>
<BR>Three, Do you know any doctors, professors, biologists or psychiatric doctors that would write an Affidavit, and possibly testify at trial, on the safety and ????? of psilocybin and of mushrooms?&nbsp;  If so, could you send me their addresses so I could contact them and get affidavits for my motion and inquire if they would also be willing to testify if a new trial becomes necessary?
<BR>
<BR>Thank you for your support so far.&nbsp;  I hope you can help me out on the above three requests.
<BR>
<BR>Best regards,
<BR>Skip
<BR>
<BR>P.S.&nbsp;  I will be representing myself at any new trial.&nbsp;  No sell-out court-appointed lawyers <U>again</U>!&nbsp;  I <U>am</U> a paralegal and am studying on how to prepare & present my case at trial.

<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I've changed my mind, again.&nbsp;  Sorry.&nbsp;  I <U>would</U> like a copy of your original <U>DEA Petition</U> for an exemption and the appeal stuff.&nbsp;  The reason is that, regardless of the outcome of my case, I think my Sacred Mushroom Church has a real chance for an exemption - since Psilocybe mushrooms are situated much more similarly to peyote than marijuana.&nbsp;  Besides, I <U>have</U> used them as a religious sacrament for 22 years and it's about time I was able to do so legally.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>We plan to incorporate our church also.&nbsp;  Having your original Petition, etc., would guide me in the process I need to follow.&nbsp;  I think my argument has a much better chance than marijuana, as, from the Spanish Inquisition on, peyote <U>and</U> mushrooms have been used and persecuted/prosecuted together.&nbsp;  I think the religious use history, medical safety (Psilocybin is <U>THE</U> SAFEST HALLUCINOGEN, 10 TIMES SAFER THAN MESCALINE; AND MUCH LESS TOXIC, EVEN, THAN THC), and "pervasiveness" of <U>actual</U> use in the U.S. is so close to that of peyote that we'd really be in good shape under the RFRA of 1993.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>so, if it isn't too much of a problem, I would like the copies you said you'd make.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>This doesn't cancel the other items my last letter raised on the FIJA stuff.&nbsp;  If a new trial is necessary, I will want to raise, not only the religious freedom issue, but want the jury to be "fully informed."
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I have Jonathan Ott (<U>PHARMACOTHEON</U>, <U>AGE OF ENTHEOGENS</U>, <U>HALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICA</U>, and other books) lined up to come from Mexico as on Expert Witness.&nbsp;  Also, Dr. John Beresford, retired Psychiatrist who did psilocybin experiments in the '60s, and now heads The Committee on Unjust Sentencing and The Albert Hoffmann Museum will be an Expert Witness.&nbsp;  I'm hoping for others, perhaps even Dr. Hoffmann, although his age, 93, might preclude his being able to come.&nbsp;  (He's close to both Dr. Beresford & Jonathan Ott)
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>I'm proceeding as if the new trial will be necessary.&nbsp;  Better to be prepared.&nbsp;  And I am getting ready to do a first class trial - and represent myself.&nbsp;  The motions are done, with supporting briefs, and I'm studying on trial presentation, objections, cross examinations, etc.&nbsp;  I'm preparing a trial notebook a'la F. Lee Bailey.&nbsp;  And with the cops & prosecutors destroying all 4,860 Mason jars of cultures, (knowing & <U>ADMITTING</U> I said I was growing many types of mushrooms), 2 weeks after I got in their jail, but before I could ask for preservation and independent testing - then lying on the stand about a "court order" to destroy the jars when it was the prosecutor who told the cops to destroy them - well, Mark Furman will look like a saint when I get through with the Quad City MEG officers who lied and the prosecutor who let them!
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>No Iowa choo-choo train trial this time, my friend.&nbsp;  Oh, I'd take a stand-by counsel to help - but I am going pro se.&nbsp;  Jury voir dire will be extensive this time.&nbsp;  Discovery motions, jury questionnaire motion & 75 sample questionnaire, etc., etc., are all typed and ready to go.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>They probably will decide not to even retry me at first glance of all the motions.&nbsp;  And each one is proper - not "frivolous" or like most "jail-house" lawyers do.&nbsp;  But then I am a trained paralegal.&nbsp;  I should have represented myself the first time - but, in county jail, there was no way to prepare.&nbsp;  Here in Anamosa ... I've got afternoons and all day Thursdays and Fridays and have been using the time in the law library and on the typewriters.&nbsp;  It has been my only activity.&nbsp;  Then, in my cell, I study for trial presentation - the one area of law I wasn't trained in at paralegal school.&nbsp;  Lists of questions for "cross," for me "Experts," exhibits, order of proof, etc., will all be in the trial notebook - ready to go.&nbsp;  And, I've got the luxury of the first trial's transcripts to prepare with.&nbsp;  All they have to present I've got time to prepare to counter.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=50>Well, I rattled on for more than you probably wanted to read.&nbsp;  Thanks for all the help.&nbsp;  Let me know about the FIJA stuff when you send the "EXEMPTION" stuff.&nbsp;  I can't tell you how big a help you've been.&nbsp;  Hope we get to meet someday - I'm sure we will ....

<CENTER>DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
* Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times ran a piece noting that the lead story in the next issue of the National Review is going to call for the legalization of drugs. The rationale for this argument is that the war on drugs has failed and that the only solution is to declare defeat and turn the asylum over to the inmates.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I am not sure just what information the folks at the National Review are using, but the facts are flawed and the argument is dumb and irresponsible.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Mr. Buckley, the author of the piece, is safe in making such arguments because he personally does not plan to use drugs. No one of his immediate acquintance is likely to start using dangerous drugs. So the consequences of his advocacy will not be felt personally. Instead, the burden of his ideas will be borne by countless families whose kids -- the most at-risk population -- will fall victim to the consequences of drug abuse. The costs will also be borne by the public purse, as we have to treat the walking wounded.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Although there is no public support for the idea of legalization, and none in the Congress, some of our culture elite -- left and right -- keep raising the idea as if it had some intellectual merit. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I am therefore submitting for the R<SMALL>ECORD</SMALL> a longer statement on the common mistakes made in the legalization argument that I hope will help in closing this latest chapter in foolishness.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>The statement follows:</B></FONT>
<FONT SIZE="1"><B>
<CENTER>STATEMENT BY CHARLES E. GRASSLEY: DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I have been increasingly concerned about the tendency in some quarters to
promote the legalization of drugs in this country. If there is any idea that
is essentially without merit and without public support, it is that this
country should entertain seriously the notion that dangerous drugs should be
legalized and made widely available. Drug legalization is truly an
invitation to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, many in the media and in our cultural elite, who have a
disproportionate access to public communication and opinion outlets, have
once again started to advocate some form of legalization. While this
advocacy is not likely to lead to a major change in public policy, it can
and does have an adverse influence on thinking about the dangers of drug. It
sends a mixed message about the dangers of use that is particularly harmful
when it touches our young people.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
As Bill Bennett and Joe Califano noted recently, drugs are illegal because
they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.
Legalization advocates, however, deploy a variety of arguments on behalf of
their position that ignore this essential fact. They all too often resort to
scare tactics, misrepresent reality, or skip over inconvenient facts. I
think that it is important to set the record straight.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
There are a number of misconceptions about our efforts to deal with the drug
problem. It is important to understand these and the common arguments used
to promote them in order to arrive at a reasoned and reasonable
understanding of what the drug problem is about. One of the first points to
note is that our last drug epidemic--during the 1960s, 1970s, and early
1980s--was the result of arguments made by some that drugs were really not a
problem and that everyone would feel better, live better, and prosper from
the self-administration of dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The claim, made with considerable fervor, was that drugs were liberating and
that only a repressive society would prevent people from achieving their
true potential. By the late 1980s, we finally came to realize just what a
cruel hoax, a big lie, these claims were. We are still trying to cope with
an addict population from that ear, a period that has left us with a legacy
of lives blasted by drug use, a cost that is borne by families and the
public purse. We cannot afford to ignore this lesson, to repeat a disaster
based on the enthusiasms of a few.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10><I>Mistake #1: Prohibition doesn't, can't work. Efforts to keep people from using drugs, like alcohol prohibition, only encourages the idea of forbidden fruit, increases crime, and will always fail.</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The argument that prohibition doesn't work relies on a collective amnesia
about this country's experience with alcohol prohibition between 1920 and
1934. In the first place, Prohibition did not make the use of alcohol
illegal, only its manufacture and sale over a certain strength. It was, in
effect, a control regime legalizing personal use. This effort came at the
end of a very long history
in this country of trying to reduce the consumption of alcohol from
dangerous heights. The modern parallel is with the efforts to reduce tobacco
use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, Prohibition did not lead to a major increase in violent crime, as is
often claimed. The major increase, particularly in violent crime in this
country, came between 1900 and 1910, well before the prohibition movement.
Violent crime remained fairly stable or declined during Prohibition. While
it is true that crime rates decreased after Prohibition this was not the
result of ending Prohibition. Nor did Prohibition create organized crime.
Major organized crime groups existed well before alcohol prohibition and
they prospered after it ended.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, major health problems, such as cirrhosis of the liver and
alcohol-related psychoses, declined sharply during Prohibition. Alcohol
consumption, even though it was not illegal, also declined sharply. It
increased in the years following the repeal of Prohibition, as did the
associated health problems.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Fourth, it is important to remember also that alcohol, unlike dangerous
drugs, had wide social acceptance and a long history of use. Alcohol can
also be used by most people without creating impairment, either temporary or
long term. Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin have no such long history of
popular public use or acceptance, and their use is solely for the purpose of
intoxication. In fact, the public has opposed these substances once they
learned how dangerous and destructive they were. This is also true
historically in this country and internationally. No society today has a
legalization regime for dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In addition, it is clear that control efforts, when reinforced by serious
law enforcement, prevention, and education programs do deter use, especially
among young people. Our own recent experience illustrates how effective we
can be. After decades of increasing use in this country, we reversed the
trend of drug use when, beginning in the mid-1980s, we decided to just say
no and to get serious about doing something. Overall drug use, apart from
addicts, declined by more than 50 percent; cocaine use by 70 percent.
Unfortunately, more recently, as we have moved away from these serious
programs we have seen a return to use in the most at-risk
population--teenagers.<BR>
<BR><CENTER>[Page: S328]</CENTER>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #2: Legalization will mean less crime because the profit motive is removed and we will lock fewer people up when we make our drug laws more
humane</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
First, most prisoners in state and Federal prisons are not there for drug
offenses as their first or major offense. Most offenders are in jail for
violent or repeat offenses. Of these, despite the wildy exaggerated numbers
often cited, only 10 percent of Federal prisoners and 17 percent of state
inmates committed their crimes to obtain drugs. Indeed, research shows that
most career criminals came to drug use after starting their criminal
activities, not before. Legalization will not greatly reduce the crime rate,
especially for violent crimes. Indeed, in so far as the pharmacological
effects of drugs, particularly cocaine and other stimulants, exacerbate
violent tendencies, legalization will produce far greater violent crime
rates as the number of 'legal' addicts soars.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, the vast majority of prisoners serving time from drug offenses are
not there for use but for
trafficking--individuals whose actions destroy lives and menace
neighborhoods.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, legalization will not end black markets for drugs, unless we are
prepared to legalize drug use for all ages down to the age of 6 or 7. Only
the most radical legalization advocates want to see kids using drugs. But to
leave any population out of a legalization regime means leaving a black
market. Crime will not simply disappear nor will the organizations that are
currently trafficking in illegal drugs.
</B></FONT></MULTICOL></DIV>
<DIV><MULTICOL COLS=3 WIDTH=100%><FONT SIZE="1"><B>
<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #3: Legalization will mean a healthier climate in which controlled
drug use will provide quality control and monitored use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
This argument misses or misrepresents the issue. The issue is not whether we
make drugs, which are inherently dangerous to use, more pure, but whether we
permit their use at all. Britain led the way in trying to treat dangerous
drug use as a therapeutic problem, regulating addicts through doctors' care.
This was not an open drug policy for anyone to use drugs but a policy just
for addicts. The result was a disaster. It did not prevent the spread of
drug abuse. It only made doctors complicit in the act of promoting an
addiction for which they had no cure. In effect, it reversed the normal
doctor-patient relationship, putting doctors in the position of making their
patients worse off. As a result, in Britain, addiction soared, addicts got
worse not better, and the black market flourished. Similar experiences have
visited similar efforts in other countries. Now, it seems that Switzerland
is experimenting with a variation of this approach. The results are likely
to be a similar disaster, making the government and the medical community
complicit in spreading addiction.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
It is also important to keep in mind, that dangerous drugs are not
synonymous with other controlled pharmaceuticals. The latter are controlled
but they also have a therapeutic purpose. Dangerous drugs have no medical
purpose. They are addictive and destructive. To argue that these drugs
should be self-administered with the only control being over their quality
is to argue for a massive increase in the addict population, adding an even
greater burden to an over-taxed health-care system. In effect, the
legalization argument requires society to endorse a self-destructive
behavior and then requires society to provide perpetual care to the victims
at public expense.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #4: Deterrence does not work</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
When you talk to former addicts or those who have given up use, one of the
most important reasons they give for their decision to quit or seek
treatment was the threat of criminal prosecution, the difficulty of
acquiring drugs, and the cost. When drugs are perceived as expensive,
dangerous and wrongful to use, difficult to get, and involve a risk of
criminal prosecution, potential users forego use, and many current users
quit. This remains true even though most enforcement efforts focus not on
users but on violent offenders and drug traffickers.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
No program to prohibit drug use can be universally effective. Although we
have long-standing laws against child abuse or murder or theft, these have
not prevented any of these acts completely. No one doubts their importance,
however, or the role they play in discouraging yet more of these actions
than if they were not prohibited.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #5: Legalizing drugs will remove the `Forbidden Fruit' appeal of
drugs, which leads most new users, especially the young, into use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
If this is a valid argument, then anything that society prohibits for the
general good would succumb to the same argument. Forbidding child abuse
encourages child abuse. Prohibiting murder encourages it. This is the logic
of the argument. In fact, the reverse in the case. We educate people's
understanding of what is rightful or wrongful to do by the laws that we
declare and enforce. Even during Prohibition, when use was legal, the simple
message sent by society that use was bad caused significant drops in use.
Whenever we have enforced our drug laws and backed these up with education
and prevention programs endorsed by our civic and cultural leaders, we have
seen use decline and young people forego use. When we ignore this simple
reality we see kids returning to drug use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unless one contemplates making cocaine and heroin routinely available to
12-18 year olds, something even few legalizers argue, then legalization will
not remove the so-called `Forbidden Fruit' appeal. It will only add the idea
that society condones use while continuing to prohibit access to the most
at-risk population. Just the absence of a clear message on drug use in the
last few years has seen teens returning to use in disturbing numbers. A
legalization message would have devastating results.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #6: Drug use is a purely personal choice. It is a victimless crime. The state has no right to keep people from using drugs</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The idea that an individual who uses drugs does so in some vacuum that
affects no one else is another one of those fictions that obscures the
facts. In the first place, drug users don't stay home. They go to work and
play with the rest of us. They use the highways, they drive the school buses
and trains, they fly the planes. They also encourage others to use, thus
spreading the problem.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
People under the influence of dangerous drugs are more prone to workplace
accidents, are more likely to have highway accidents, are more prone to use
violence in public and family disputes, and are at greater risk for health
care than are non-users. Addicts are far more likely to lose control over
their own lives, and are more in need of public intervention. A considerable
percentage, perhaps as many as 60 percent, of the homeless are drug and
alcohol addicts.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Some 2 percent of live births in this country--over 100,000 babies--are born
addicted with life-long disabilities because their mothers used.
Conservative estimates of the yearly social costs of drug addiction at
current levels run around $70 billion. These costs are borne by families and
the public purse. The number of users and consequently the number of addicts
would soar under a legalization regime, compounding all the problems we
currently have. There is no such thing as a purely private use of drugs
without consequences. There is no known cure for addiction. A choice for
legalization would be a self-inflicted disaster.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #7: Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, and cause far more harm
than dangerous drugs, we should make heroin, cocaine, etc., legal to be
consistent. Doing so would not increase the number of users significantly</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Here is the legalization argument at its most outrageous. What people are
asked to accept is the idea that because we have substances generally
available that already cause major harm--tobacco and alcohol--we should add
dangerous drugs to the occasions for woe for the sake of consistency. What
the argument says is that since we have one major problem we should make it
worse by adding another. Who are we kidding?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In order to rescue this logic from being completely ludicrous, people are
asked to believe a further assertion: that under a legal regime there won't
be an increase in users. Really? Let's look at what we are being asked to
believe. We are going to make drugs cheaper and freely available. We are
going to see them aggressively marketed by the producers. We are going to
have society condone the use of addictive substances. But, we are not going
to see a significant increase in use. Such is our understanding of human
nature?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
We saw what happened with drug use in this country in the 1960s and 1970s
when we allowed the de facto legalization of drugs, condoning personal use
and not enforcing our laws. That partial legal environment caused a dramatic
increase in use. Can anyone doubt the effects if we condoned use outright?
We cannot afford this kind of logic.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
These are by no means the only myths. Others hold that drug laws are
racist--which is another big lie, but even if true it is hardly an argument
for making drugs legal; that the health consequences of personal use are
exaggerated; or that drug laws lead to locking up lot of innocent people. 
None of these arguments can sustain serious attention or thought. Nor is
there any major public support for drug legalization. The argument is
pressed by only a few, some liberal, some conservative. To make the argument
requires, however, suspension of judgment, a willingness to accept
assertions over facts, and a professional absence of mind that ignores
experience.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, while the argument for legalization has little public
support, it is a major agenda item of many of our cultural elites. They have
a disproportionate influence on our public discourse, on our radios and
television, in the movies, in music and the arts. This means they have a
disproportionate influence on the most at-risk population for drug
users--our young people. By helping to obscure the message of the dangers of
drug use, by encouraging it as part of a `liberated' life style, they
contribute directly to use. When our political leaders remain silent they
aid and abet this. The result in the 1960s made the point. Our recent
experience confirms it: When you replace `Just Say No' with `Just Say
Nothing' or `I didn't inhale,' you are opening the door to trouble.

<HEAD><TITLE>Medical Necessity - Historical Background</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#0000FF" VLINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#FF00FF">
<H2>April 1996
<P>
Dear candidate:</H2>
<P>
<CENTER><H1>Historical Background<BR>
Medical Necessity</H1></CENTER>

<H2>	Over the past 20 years, thirty-seven states have passed legislation
recognizing marijuana's therapeutic value.  Iowa enacted a law allowing
doctors to prescribe marijuana in 1979.  See Iowa Code ¤¤ <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(4)(m),
<A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/204.html">124.204</A>(7) and <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>(7)(a).  To understand the history of this legislation
and the need to amend current state law, a brief review of some national
court decisions is enlightening.
<P>	In 1976, a glaucoma patient by the name of Bob Randall was brought to trial
for growing marijuana plants on the balcony of his apartment in Washington,
D.C.  The court dismissed the charges, ruling that Randall's use of
marijuana was a "medical necessity."  Federal agencies began providing him
with marijuana, and Randall became the first American to receive marijuana
for the treatment of a medical disorder.
<P>	In 1981, a multiple sclerosis patient by the name of Sam Diana was
convicted for possessing marijuana in the state of Washington.  The
Washington Court of Appeals overturned the verdict and returned the case to
the lower court for retrial.  The Appeals Court ruled that "medical
necessity" was a valid defense.  On retrial, the Washington court concluded
that Diana was "not guilty by reason of medical necessity."
<P>	In 1989, a glaucoma patient by the name of Elvy Musikka was brought to
trial for cultivation of marijuana plants.  The court found Musikka not
guilty, ruling that her use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."
<P>	In 1991, a hemophilic patient by the name of Kenneth Jenks was brought to
trial for growing marijuana plants.  Kenneth received AIDS at a hospital
through a blood transfusion and transmitted the disease to his wife before
he knew that he had the disease.  Both Kenneth and Barbara were found guilty
at trial, but the Florida Court of Appeals reversed their convictions,
ruling that their use of marijuana was a "medical necessity."  The Florida
Supreme Court affirmed the reversal of their criminal convictions.
<P>	The federal government is the only legal supplier of medical marijuana in
the United States, and currently supplies marijuana to only 8 medical
patients, two of whom, George McMahon and Barbara Douglass, are Iowans.  In
1991, the federal government decided to stop accepting any new applications,
effectively nullifying all state laws allowing medical use of marijuana.
Without a federal license, no one can use medical marijuana by prescription
in the United States.
<P>	In 1994, Judge Irwin, an Iowa district court judge for Pottawattamie
County,  ruled that "medical necessity" is a recognized defense to
prosecution for possession of marijuana in the state of Iowa.  A copy of
that order is enclosed with this letter.
<P>	Iowa law says that possession of marijuana is legal when used for medicinal
purposes pursuant to rules of the board of pharmacy examiners.  We have
contacted the board of pharmacy examiners and discovered that the only rules
are those contained in the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration
and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
<P>	In 1991, an Iowan with multiple sclerosis by the name of Ladd Huffman was
approval by both the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement
Administration to receive medical marijuana.  However, his prescription was
never filled, because the federal government decided to stop accepting new
applications.  Ladd's application was one of 28 which was approved but was
never honored.
<P>	It is our position that seriously ill people who use marijuana for medicine
should not be arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial.  Seriously ill patients using marijuana as medicine should
be able to have a hearing with the board of pharmacy examiners, or other
qualified board.  If they have a legitimate medical necessity, they should
be certified and exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa.
The Iowa Legislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified
medical marijuana users from prosecution by the state.</H2>

<HR>April 1996
<BR>Dear Sirs,
<DD>As a person running for an office that is responsible for creating legislation that sets the standards and laws for the State of Iowa, I would not feel comfortable trying to second guess any legal decisions handed down by a Supreme Court, be it State or Federal.
<DD>As for my either supporting the enacting of medical necessity legislation pertaining to the medicinal use of marijuana to protect from criminal prosecution, I would have to see the proposed House File before taking a stand one way or another on the matter.
<DD>I, too, like two of the people you cite in your historical background, have Multiple Sclerosis.&nbsp;  To date, I've no need of THC to stem any medical problems that are related to the M.S.&nbsp;  With the advent of genetic engineering, new drugs to fight M.S. are being brought out 
for testing and approval by the FDA on, seemingly, a regular basis.
<DD>I do feel that THC in it's natural form is not needed as a therapeutic substance at this time.&nbsp;  Unless I am proven wrong about my thoughts on this and concerns for the potential for abuse of the substance, I would tend to be disinclined to support any legislation in this regard.
<DD>Thank you.

<BR>Dear Mr. McMahon & Mr. Olsen
<DD>Cancer has not been very kind to my family.&nbsp;  In 1978, my brother died from Hodgkins Disease.&nbsp;  1988 my sister was treated and cured of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and in 1992, my nephew was cured of advanced Hodgkins.&nbsp;  I need to look into the issue of marijuana for medical use because I have seen personally how it could possibly have made chemotherapy
more tolerable to my family.
<DD>I will look at this issue with an open mind and at this time am supportive of your position.
<DD>Thank you and best wishes!

<BR>Dear Carl:
<DD>Thank you for sending me the letter regarding the medical marijuana bill (Senate File 361), as well as a copy the resolution adopted in California last month.
<DD>Whether the current problem is at the federal level (and it appears to be federal), I do have a few concerns about any statutes or resolutions dealing with the medical or therapeutic uses of marijuana.&nbsp;  The chief one is that there continue to be adequate safeguards to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to the drug.
<DD>However, in the event that Rep. Miller introduces the resolution, I will discuss the matter with the appropriate committee chair and House leadership.

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Well, good Monday morning to you.&nbsp;
Three minutes after 8 o'clock.&nbsp; Welcome to the show.&nbsp;
Local talk radio on the air here in Waterloo and Cedar Falls and
around eastern Iowa.&nbsp; I hope you had a great weekend and
enjoyed the big win by the UNI men's football team Saturday night.&nbsp;
That was a squeaker.&nbsp; And another squeaker Sunday.&nbsp; The
UNI women's basketball team won by just one point over Iowa
State.&nbsp; So a big upset there for the women.&nbsp;
Congratulations to both teams.&nbsp; Well, this morning on our
local talk show, remember you can always get in on the show by
calling 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479, the topic this morning - the
legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; All
right, we heard about it, it's been in the news because of a recent
decision in California that has allowed that, or paved the way to allow
it.&nbsp; And we're going to talk about that, and also talk about
any movement here in the State of Iowa to do the same type of
thing - legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; And
joining me now on the program first is Ron Corbett.&nbsp; Mr.
Corbett is a Republican from Cedar Rapids, House Speaker.&nbsp;
And Mr. Corbett, welcome to the program this morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Thank you, and good morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Now, you have come out,
even before the session, nothing's really been said.&nbsp; The
session starts what in January?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; January 13, yes. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; So you're about ready to go back to work
then? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, we are. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; That job, anyway. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yep. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Ron, now you've come out before this
session and talked against the legalization of marijuana for
medicinal purposes.&nbsp; Tell me why you've come out and made
that public announcement. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Well there's several
reasons.&nbsp; First of all, not just voters in California, but the
voters in Arizona, have passed a referendum on the ballot this
last November, and so we've had this renewed debate as far as marijuana
goes.&nbsp; Now in both those states they were referendums.&nbsp;
There's going to be an attempt in other states that allow
referendums in future elections.&nbsp; Iowa is not a state that
allows for referendums, so the decisions would have to be made by
the state legislature, the Iowa House and the Iowa Senate.&nbsp;
A week ago, Republicans got together and put together their list
of items that we wanted to accomplish next year and we also made
a list of things that we weren't going to take up and this was an
issue that we decided that we did not want to take up.&nbsp;
There is a small lobbying group, an organization for this in the
state of Iowa, but at least from what I understand with the
Arizona and the California that it's such a broad definition
&quot;medical use&quot; that we'd have a real hard time.&nbsp;
Where do you draw the line?&nbsp; I mean, today stress is a medical
term, and so someone feels they're a little stressed out at
work.&nbsp; You know, do they go home?&nbsp; Do they pick up a
bag of marijuana and tell their doctor or primary care giver that
they're stressed out and they need to have this?&nbsp; So, it
isn't something that...&nbsp; You know, people say, well that
would never happen.&nbsp; I mean, it's a pretty broad term and
definition, and so we decided we do not want to tackle this next
year. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Um hum.&nbsp; In your mind, in your
feelings, if the definition could be narrowed down to not
included all people or all medical reasons, is it something at
that point you'd be in favor of? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I still don't think so.&nbsp; I
know, the fact that this notion that marijuana has demonstrated
medical utility has been rejected by the American Medical
Association, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the American
Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and the
American Cancer Society.&nbsp; So, they've debated this in their
organizations and they felt that there isn't a reason.&nbsp;
There, as far as some of these things with chemotherapy, the nausea,
etc., there are other drugs that have been shown to be more
successful first line therapy drugs for nausea and vomiting
versus marijuana or synthetic THC, which is actually the
ingredient within marijuana that the advocates say is helpful. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Um hum.&nbsp; Apparently, several groups
have okayed the use, or said that it does provide for some
medical usage.&nbsp; There have been the American Bar
Association, and even the Iowa Democratic Party, has come out and
said that it does show that there are some uses for it, even
though some of the groups that you mention don't approve it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; As you know, that's going to be the
case.&nbsp; I mean, people are going to line up on both sides of
the issue.&nbsp; Each side is going to throw out a study.&nbsp;
We can, I can quote different studies from different doctors and colleges
around the country that say there's no evidence for marijuana
usage in areas and I suppose the other side can show us some
studies, too, but it, when you have President Clinton's national
drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, coming out, this is his quote, just when
the nation is trying it's hardest to educate teenagers not to use
drugs, now they're being told that marijuana and other drugs are good.&nbsp;
You know, that they're medicine.&nbsp; That it's okay, and so the
national drug czar, Iowa's drug czar, is against it, and this
whole coalition of, drug-free coalition, D.A.R.E. programs, all
the different programs that we have out there that have recognized
that drugs are bad, and the war on drugs that we've been having,
certainly marijuana's considered a gateway drug to other drugs. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Now, when you mention that the topic won't
come up this year, and that the Republican leaders have met on
this, now, let's explain, that's because the Republican Party
does control the House and Senate in Iowa, and you guys pretty
much set the agenda.&nbsp; Is that not right? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; The Republicans control the
House, we've done that now for three elections cycles, but this
year the Republicans were successful, Republican candidates in
the Senate were successful in getting the majority, so now we
have a Republican majority in both the House and the
Senate.&nbsp; And, of course, Governor Branstad is a Republican,
so this is the first time in fourteen years where the Republicans
have had control of the Legislature.&nbsp; But, even as far as this,
that the medical use, I mean, we still have, in the California
initiative, it allowed for cultivation for growers, it allowed
for possession, even if you're not sick.&nbsp; I mean, you're
going to develop a whole, if you're going to try and create an
additional supply, or additional demand for marijuana, you're
going to have suppliers that are out there.&nbsp; So you're going
to have people now growing and possessing.&nbsp; And just imagine
the field day attorneys can have in court when it comes to our
laws.&nbsp; You know, you can say, well I was just delivering this
bag to a friend of mine who has AIDS and they need to use, they
need to use this to help them out, and so I think, in the court
of law, having these broad definitions, as it relates to the
referendums in Arizona and California, it's going to be a nightmare
in the court system. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Well, how about the people that would use
the drug for medicinal purposes and actually would have a need
for it and who believe that it does help them?&nbsp; What would
you say to them? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; I have to give some type of
credibility to some studies that have shown, you know, like, I
don't have AIDS and haven't had cancer, so I haven't had the,
that option before me, but apparently with some of the people
they do feel that it's been helpful to them.&nbsp; But, it isn't
a treatment for the disease.&nbsp; I mean, that's one thing that
has to be clear.&nbsp; It isn't a treatment for the disease, it's
supposedly to relieve some of the pain and suffering, but there
are other drugs.&nbsp; I think you've got two different, you've
got people that actually can benefit from it that are kind of
used, being used as props.&nbsp; I'm not so sure that the people
that have been backing these referendums, this movement around
the country, have a larger goal in mind, the outright
legalization of all drugs.&nbsp; And if you follow the money
trail, in politics there's money, the pro-legalization folks
spent over two million dollars on this referendum, and the anti
folks barely had forty, fifty thousand bucks.&nbsp; And so,
there's a lot of money behind this, the marketing, and so I
certainly feel sorry for any of those people who find themselves
in that position, but I'm not so sure they're not being used as props
for a larger cause. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Well, Mr. Corbett, we're going to hear from
one of those people here in just a bit.&nbsp; And, we're going to
have you stay on the phone.&nbsp; Okay? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Sure. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; All right.&nbsp; Rob Corbett of Cedar
Rapids, a Republican and House Speaker of the Iowa House, on his
feelings as to why marijuana shouldn't be legalized in the state
of Iowa for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; And up next, we'll talk to one
of those patients who says it does him good.&nbsp; Stay
tuned.&nbsp; Local talk radio on KCNZ. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HOST:</b>&nbsp; Welcome back to the program.&nbsp; Jim
Coloff this morning, filling in for Greg Allen.&nbsp; He is ill
today.&nbsp; He'll be back tomorrow morning, but we've got a
great topic this morning, and some good discussion that will be
going on here I imagine.&nbsp; The topic today, the legalization
of marijuana for medical usage.&nbsp; We heard from Mr. Ron
Corbett of Cedar Rapids who is against the issue and he's House
Speaker.&nbsp; They'll probably not be talking about it in the
state Legislature, it sounds like.&nbsp; But, an individual here
in the studio from Waterloo who would probably like to see it
talked about and actually see it passed, Allen Helmers of
Waterloo.&nbsp; Good morning Allen. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Good morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Thanks for coming in this morning.&nbsp;
Now, you are an advocate of medical use of marijuana because you
are a participant in that. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I've been arrested and am
awaiting further court action.&nbsp; I suffer from chronic pain
syndrome and fibromyalgia.&nbsp; The two diseases are not going
to go away.&nbsp; They can only be treated, there's no
cure.&nbsp; Nothing is going to make it go away.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So your doctors have told you that
they've done everything they can and to diminish this pain that
they say they're helpless?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; They keep continuing to use me and other
patients in my position as a chemical experiment, in my view of
it.&nbsp; I just came off of another one last week.&nbsp; I had
to spend a week at home from Thanksgiving 'till last Wednesday,
before I could even leave the house from being so sick from
chemical medication that I was given.&nbsp; That certainly is not
being able to function in this world. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; Now how long have you
suffered from this disease? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I've known and been diagnosed with
fibromyalgia since the 1976. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; And at what point...? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Excuse me.&nbsp; 1986. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, 1986.&nbsp; So about ten
years.&nbsp; And at what point did you really start having the greatest
symptoms and the most pain? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; It came on quite a few years before
that, but I had a multiple broken back in 1981 in a semi roll
over accident and it never went away.&nbsp; They couldn't ever
take the pain and I believe that was the onset of it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, the doctors think that's what kind of
brought it on? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; The trauma of that accident. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, it's nothing that you've done
yourself in your life to spur this disease?&nbsp; Some people
would say, well maybe AIDS, people live that lifestyle, but with
you it was an accident, a semi accident. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Right, it was a semi accident.&nbsp; And
then, two and a half years ago, I was ran over by a drunk driver
and broke my leg in twelve or thirteen places, and my bottom
three vertebrae in my back. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, that didn't help at all either? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; And now I've got a leg an inch shorter
than the other and it just turned into a nightmare.&nbsp; I mean
a physical nightmare.&nbsp; I thought was bad before, and it
continues to worsen.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Now, explain to me the pain that you
suffer.&nbsp; You know, I've never had a debilitating disease, so
it might be hard for me to understand the pain, but tell me about
this pain. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Fibromyalgia is a rheumatoid disease of
the muscles and soft tissues, ligaments, tendons.&nbsp; It
travels around the body.&nbsp; It has very many other effects
that, symptoms and things that are with it.&nbsp; A loss of,
dropping things, a loss of concentration, word mix ups, there's a
lot of psychological things.&nbsp; A lot of other physical
problems.&nbsp; You can't stand to be touched.&nbsp; Different clothing
you can't wear.&nbsp; The symptoms go on and on of what is caused
from fibromyalgia.&nbsp; They haven't found a cure, they haven't
found a cause.&nbsp; All they can do is try and make you as comfortable
and lead the most productive life you can, and the only way to do
that is some sort of drugs to ease the pain.&nbsp; There's a
great deal of sleep disturbance with it, which increases the
pain.&nbsp; Any time you overdo physically, you pay for it really
bad the next morning. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, tell me how marijuana has helped
you, or that it could help you, in being treated or for this
pain, at least to cope with the pain. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; It does help me, it very much takes the
muscle spasms away, which is probably the most debilitating part
of the disease.&nbsp; And then the anxiety, because you're never
sure if your body is going to be there for you or not.&nbsp; So,
people are very anxious that have this disease.&nbsp; They're not
sure if they're going to get through the day, or what.&nbsp; Now,
marijuana, and any other drug, can and are abused.&nbsp; I'm not
talking about drug abuse here, I'm talking about drug use, the use,
what it takes, and you're able to function.&nbsp; Going out and
doing what little I can is certainly better than sitting home and
wasting away.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Allen Helmers, our guest from
Waterloo.&nbsp; An advocate of the medicinal use of
marijuana.&nbsp; And, Rob Corbett also on the line.&nbsp; We're
going to bring him back in this next segment and talk to both
gentlemen, and find out more from Allen Helmers about the,
marijuana actually does work according to some studies.&nbsp; So
stay tuned for that.&nbsp; Local talk radio on KCNZ.&nbsp; We'll
take a break for a CNBC business report. </p>

<h4 align="center">PART 3</h4>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Good morning.&nbsp; Local talk radio on
the air on KCNZ, your information station.&nbsp; You're going to
have a chance to get in on the discussion, if you'd like
to.&nbsp; We're going to open up the phone lines here in just a
bit.&nbsp; 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479.&nbsp; We're talking about
the medicinal use of marijuana, not for a drug, but maybe for
medicinal usage.&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; We're talking with
Allen Helmers.&nbsp; He suffers from a disease that causes great
pain, and he says marijuana will help him.&nbsp; Is it possible
to have marijuana available to only patients like yourself?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There are currently still eight patients
alive in America on the, there's a compassionate users program,
and that was begun in the '70s.&nbsp; I think there was 15 when
George Bush stopped it in 1992, right before he was voted out of
office, two of which live in Iowa, George McMahon which has, he
has nail patella syndrome, and Barbara Douglass who suffers from multiple
sclerosis.&nbsp; So, we do have two of those patients left in
Iowa.&nbsp; That program is no longer in effect, but the people
still do get marijuana from the federal government and claim to
get excellent results from it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; Now, you mentioned that
there are, for your disease and your condition, you said there
are 300 other people in northeast Iowa? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There is approximately 300 that come to
the support group at Covenant Medical Center from time to time
who are members of it.&nbsp; I'm not saying they all come every month.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, if marijuana was legalized, would all
300 of these people, would it be available to them? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I very much doubt that it would work for
all of them.&nbsp; The problem is, what works for Jane doesn't
work for Allen.&nbsp; What works for Allen doesn't work for
Jane.&nbsp; We found that out through our group discussion that,
there's no way I could say that it would work for everyone.&nbsp;
It does work for me, and I do know several other people who have
claimed results that they have not gotten from chemical drugs or
any other therapy that they hadn't felt in over ten years.&nbsp;
I guess I'm responsible, because they read my article in the
paper and tried it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; Now, how would we know that
someone was being honest?&nbsp; If they said, well the drug is
working, rather than just saying that so they could have more
marijuana legally to smoke? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; That's a problem.&nbsp; Drugs are
abused.&nbsp; Morphine is probably snitched from a grandpa who
has cancer, by the kid, or teenager, or whatever.&nbsp; Any drug
can be abused.&nbsp; The point I'd like to make came out of an
editorial shortly after the election on the 11th of November in the
Des Moines Register.&nbsp; Just one line out of that, outlawing
use of certain drugs for any purpose simply because they are
favorites on the illegal market means we are letting street
criminals dictate our drug policy, while forcing some who suffer
from desperate illnesses to pay the price.&nbsp; I believe that
says most of it right there. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; Mr. Corbett has been
gracious enough to stay on the line with us and allow Mr. Helmers
to have his say.&nbsp; Ron, we're going to bring you back up
now.&nbsp; Mr. Corbett is a Republican from Cedar Rapids.&nbsp;
He's the House Speaker.&nbsp; And a group of Republicans who say they
don't want to see this come up or be enacted in Iowa.&nbsp; Ron,
is it true that we're allowing drug dealers to dictate our
legislation? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, if you want to take that one step
further, if you want to take that editorial one step further,
then just advocate legalizing all drugs then, if that's the case,
because that's what's being done right now on the street.&nbsp;
The problem here is that both sides can argue that there are studies
proving one way or the other.&nbsp; So, rather than saying who's
right and who's wrong on this, let's look at how broad this thing
is.&nbsp; And, it may work for Mr. Helmers.&nbsp; I mean, he just
admitted that it doesn't work for everyone.&nbsp; Well, that's
what the law says.&nbsp; The law says we can't specifically say
only Mr. Helmers can use it, but Mr. Doe can't, because it
doesn't work for him.&nbsp; The laws have to be crafted in a way
they apply to everyone and anyone.&nbsp; So, I mean, these things are
so broad... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; But, there is not a chemical drug that
works for everyone. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I'm just saying that when you
legalize marijuana this first step, you're heading down the
slippery slope.&nbsp; And you're so broad.&nbsp; Where do you
draw the line?&nbsp; Where do you say, well, only for these
people that are... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; We have to draw the line with the
truth.&nbsp; It's time for the truth to be out. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; So, you would want it, you have... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I don't want marijuana on the
street.&nbsp; I want it legalized under medical supervision.&nbsp;
And, I'm not saying that somebody coming in with a sneeze and get
marijuana.&nbsp; That's not right.&nbsp; I'm saying that under a
qualified medical doctor. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, that's how broad these referendums
in California... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, those laws need some tuning.&nbsp;
And the people that wrote them have even admitted that.&nbsp; I
read that in the paper last week also. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And, today, if you look at what
caregiver means, what, you know, people think doctor, they think
of M.D., but that isn't the case.&nbsp; I mean we have a lot of
health care providers and professionals that are recognized as
being that.&nbsp; Whether it's a nurses aid, a chiropractor, a massage
therapist, an M.D.&nbsp; The list is broad, so anyone can be
really classified as a primary caregiver without having the M.D.
behind their name, so that aspect of it, as far as being prescribed.&nbsp;
I just think that between, whether it be prescribed by some
health care professional, or who uses it, it's so broad, the
definition is so, I think you have too much case for abuse.&nbsp;
And, hey, one of the great things about having fifty states is
that some states can try some stuff to see how it works.&nbsp; In
two or three years from now we'll see.&nbsp; We'll have an
ongoing study from Arizona and from California.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There's been many studies already that
for some reason the politicians would wish to discredit or ignore
completely, and Holland has been legal for quite a while and I
guess it's the most pleasant place to be.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; I've never been there.&nbsp; Have you? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; No, but I know many people who go there,
to enjoy absolute freedom.&nbsp; They do treat people with
marijuana over there.&nbsp; The information is there.&nbsp; When
the DEA can block the AMA from scientific studies, because they
will not allow the different grades of marijuana to be imported
into this country, we're letting our police practice the medicine
in this country, and that's not right. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Now, Allen, Mr. Corbett makes the point
that if we legalize it for a few, how can we not allow it to go
to all people, or have people just come in, like you said, with a
little pain and they say they need this marijuana?&nbsp; Now to
be, honestly, have you had anyone come up to you, who they know
that you're in this and that you're fighting for this, have you
had anyone come up to you and say, hey, this is great because if
this is passed maybe I can get some marijuana, too?&nbsp; I don't
need it but, boy, this would kind of open the door.&nbsp; Have
you had anyone pressure you at all? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I've had lost of people say, oh yeah, it
great man, everyone's going to have it then, and that's not what
we're after.&nbsp; We're after doctor's supervision.&nbsp; I wish
that I would have brought my bucket of empty pill bottles.&nbsp;
It's not that they have not tried everything on the shelf pretty
near.&nbsp; That's not the problem.&nbsp; The problem is the
marijuana works where the chemicals are not, and I can't deny
that fact.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, what you're after, Mr. Helmers, is
fine, but the unintended consequences of people coming up and
using it for whatever reason, being picked up for carrying a
commercial quantity of marijuana going into court saying, well,
this is just for medicinal purposes, I'm a supplier, whatever.&nbsp;
I mean, you might as well throw all of our drug enforcement laws
out the window if you're going to start, if you're going to go
down this road.&nbsp; I just don't see how you can do it with the
safeguards.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; How do we continue to use cocaine and
morphine then, through our medical community?&nbsp; I don't
really see the difference, myself. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Tell me how you... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; They're both very abused on the street. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Tell me how you keep this from being
abused by your local reefer head. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Helmers? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; It always has been.&nbsp; Now, how are
you going to stop it? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well,... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I'm telling you that you shouldn't be
locking people up simply because they are chronically and
critically ill. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And those that aren't? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; The reefer head, has he tried all the
different pills, has he went through all these different doctors
and medical treatment?&nbsp; We're talking about oranges and
apples.&nbsp; We're not talking about street people.&nbsp; We're
talking about sick people.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Oh, I know. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Is it legal for street people to carry
morphine around in their pocket right now? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Listen, I know that I will lose the
debate if the people who are in favor of medical use parade
around the chronically ill, the cancer victims, the terminally
ill, the AIDS victims.&nbsp; Everyone has compassion.&nbsp; I
don't want to see anyone suffer, any more than anyone else does.&nbsp;
And so, then if that's the case, and if that's all the debate is
about, is providing some compassion for these people, and the way
to do that is for allowing marijuana, I lose the debate.&nbsp; I'm
fully aware of that.&nbsp; But there are some other extremely
important consequences that come from this.&nbsp; And so, people
are thinking that we're just going to help out these folks that
are chronically ill, and that to help them relieve some of the
pain, I'll lose.&nbsp; But there's more to that.&nbsp; There is
more to it than just that.&nbsp; And, when you start sending
messages that marijuana is a legal drug, is for medicine, then
the next step is what?&nbsp; And the step after that?&nbsp; And,
I just see the slippery slope on this issue.</p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Corbett, I'm going to let Allen
answer that, and we've got a caller on the line on hold, so after
this comment from Mr. Helmers we'll take that call. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; The point is, I first tried marijuana in
the Vietnam era and realized what it could do.&nbsp; So when I
was hurt, I understood.&nbsp; And number one, at my age, when I
was first exposed to it, Art Linkletter was on TV telling us how
bad it was and we we're going to jump out windows and this and
that.&nbsp; Number one, we have to stop lying to our
children.&nbsp; Marijuana is not totally bad.&nbsp; It should
not, children should not be using any substances, tobacco,
alcohol or any drugs.&nbsp; And, until we're honest about what
the drugs are, they're going to get into, well, gee, marijuana
isn't anything, maybe crack ain't anything, or maybe this heroin
isn't anything.&nbsp; We've got to be honest right on down the
line. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, if you have a comment, 277-1918 or
1-800-913-9479.&nbsp; M.B is on line one, and M.B. you're on the
air.&nbsp; Welcome to the program. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; Ah yes.&nbsp; I have a question for both
gentlemen, I believe.&nbsp; Both of you seem to be assuming, and
saying even, that this drug, this marijuana, will be given by,
quote, a bunch of different caregivers.&nbsp; Why not handle it
as other dangerous drugs are, by strictly a physician's prescription,
with that physician's number?&nbsp; And, not all physicians can
even write prescriptions for certain scheduled drugs.&nbsp;
Wouldn't that take care of a lot of the problems you two are
talking about? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; That's what we are advocating. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett?&nbsp; Did you hear the
comment? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, and that's what people in
California and Arizona thought they were voting for, and that
wasn't the case.&nbsp; I mean... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; Well, why not, you're a better legislator
than that bunch in California.&nbsp; Surely, you folks in Des
Moines can come up with a straight forward.&nbsp; Why not handle
it like codeine?&nbsp; You can't go down and buy codeine.&nbsp;
You need a prescription.&nbsp; Even for Tylenol and codeine
combined.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; And, they do plan on changing that law
in California.&nbsp; Even the people who wrote that referendum
understand that that was written too broadly. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; You people wouldn't make that mistake in
Des Moines. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, I'd hope not, because Jim... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>M.B.:</b>&nbsp; Why not give it a shot, and simple say, a
physician, on his medical judgment, signed, sealed and delivered
in a prescription?&nbsp; That takes care of codeine.&nbsp; There
aren't too many cases of opium or codeine running around, for the
reason that you can only get it by prescription from a physician
who can write prescriptions for scheduled drugs.&nbsp; I'll hang
up and listen to you guys. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I'd ask, why has the American
Medical Association, the American Glaucoma Society, the American
Academy of Ophthalmology, and the American Cancer Society passed
resolutions saying that they don't, there's no demonstrated
medical use for marijuana?&nbsp; I mean, here we're arguing
whether we should have it for medicinal purposes or not, but
there are people prior to that debate that say there are no
medicinal purposes. <b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Corbett.&nbsp;
We're going to take a break here, we've got to break.&nbsp; And,
we'll be back.&nbsp; And, when we come back, another caller
called in didn't want to go on the air.&nbsp; But, wanted to ask
Mr. Helmers, and I'll let him think about this during our break,
that if he would support, or, would you support legislation for
crack cocaine, or for heroin?&nbsp; And, he wanted to know where
the line would be drawn.&nbsp; So I'll let you think about that
during the break.&nbsp; And, we'll be back with more on local talk
radio after this.&nbsp; If you'd like to get in on the show,
277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479. </p>

<h4 align="center">PART 4</h4>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Welcome back to the program.&nbsp; Local
talk radio on KCNZ.&nbsp; Talking about the medicinal uses of
marijuana.&nbsp; Should it be legalized in Iowa?&nbsp; It has
been in Arizona and California.&nbsp; Is this sweeping the
nation?&nbsp; Is it going to be everywhere soon?&nbsp; Well, not
in Iowa probably.&nbsp; It sounds like it won't come up this
year.&nbsp; We've got a caller on the phone.&nbsp; Allen in on
line two, but first off we want to give the other Allen, Allen
Helmers, our guest here in the studio, a chance to answer the
question.&nbsp; A caller called in and wanted to know if he would
support legalization of crack cocaine if it helped make someone
feel better.&nbsp; Or, how about heroin?&nbsp; What if that
helped someone feel better? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Cocaine is already available through
your doctor.&nbsp; Crack cocaine, there's really no medical use
for it, according to any literature that I've ever read.&nbsp;
Yes, I would support heroin, which I do believe is available
through doctors in some states, it was on the Arizona referendum, for
chronically ill people, under a doctor's supervision.&nbsp; I
don't think heroin belongs on the street, as well as any other
drug.&nbsp; It's too easily abused.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum.&nbsp; And, Ron, any comment on
that?&nbsp; What if we passed this, and then we have the next
group that want to legalize something else?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, that's the point I've been trying
to make, that all the safeguards that the legislature, whoever,
other legislators around the country can put in, this issue it
just seems to me, at least the way I understand it, and what I've
been able to read about it, that it's way open to abuse and
misuse through the process, with today anything being classified
as a medical use.&nbsp; I mean, so for you to start saying that,
well, only people that have chemotherapy are allowed to use it.&nbsp;
Well, what happens if someone develops carpal tunnel and they
have some extreme pain in their wrist?&nbsp; And then some person
that has it says, well, these drugs aren't working for me, so I
want to use marijuana.&nbsp; And so, I mean, where do you draw
the line on an issue like this?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And, I don't know where you draw the
line.&nbsp; So, rather than trying to guess where to draw the
line, we've elected not to authorize this in Iowa.&nbsp; Let some
of the other states, through their referendum process, it seems to
be the only way they can get it passed, let them try it.&nbsp;
And, in three years from now, we'll have an understanding.&nbsp;
And, in three years from now we'll have some results.&nbsp; Was
it abused, wasn't it abused?&nbsp; All these questions that I've
been asking and we've been bouncing back and forth, maybe we'll
have some more information.&nbsp; So let's hold off for three or
four years and see how it works in some other states. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Do you think that doctors are
over-prescribing morphine and other pain killers for people with
carpal tunnel now? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; I don't know. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, there's the point.&nbsp; I mean,
if the doctor is prescribing the marijuana, that's the whole
point.&nbsp; You must have missed 60 Minutes last night.&nbsp; It
started out with a great article about how America is killing its
sick people because they're afraid to prescribe pain
medication.&nbsp; It was a terrific piece there.&nbsp; I wish you
would have seen it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Yeah, I did miss it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, we've got another call on the line
here, and if you want to get in on the discussion, 277-1918 or
1-800-913-9479. And, Allen from Waterloo, thank you for holding Allen.&nbsp;
What's your comment here on the air? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Well, I just wanted to comment on the idea
of when will our legislators understand that prohibition does not
work, it never has worked, and never will work?&nbsp; These
people are going against historical and natural law, and until
they come around to this understanding, that it is honest education
that works to help people out, prohibition will not work.&nbsp;
Since they put a profit into it, drugs will always be out
there.&nbsp; The only way to really get a handle on it is to go
ahead and let the people do what they want to do, but honestly
education them about it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett, do you think this is
prohibition, or just... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, what you're advocating is, what
the caller is advocating is legalization of all drugs then.&nbsp;
Correct? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Caller, are you there? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; I think they should legalize
marijuana.&nbsp; I do believe that they should go ahead and decriminalize
everything else.&nbsp; Yes, honest education is the only way to
do it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Because it doesn't make sense locking a
person with three ounces of marijuana up for five years, and
locking a person who raped a five year old kid up for two.&nbsp;
I don't see what's going on.&nbsp; You guys got to start thinking
about the laws you're writing. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, we do.&nbsp; And... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, that's what's going on. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; And you know there's a lot of problems
out there with substance abuse.&nbsp; Allen, you've already
pointed that out.&nbsp; You got hit by a drunk driver. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; And you gave her seven days in jail. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; People will abuse alcohol.&nbsp; They
will abuse other substances.&nbsp; And, they will abuse the right
to use marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; So, I think we've
proven it.&nbsp; They'll be abuses in it.&nbsp; Now, how do you
handle the abuses? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, people abuse food.&nbsp; People
abuse anything there is that can be abused.&nbsp; How do we stop
all the abuse? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Allen, are you still on the phone Allen? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Yes. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, do you think that, you mentioned
legalizing marijuana for all purposes, is that correct?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Yes. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Do you think that if it was legalized for
medicinal purposes you'd have a greater case to make to have it
legalized for all? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; I think it would probably help out,
yes.&nbsp; I mean, obviously, this drug war that we've got now
doesn't work, hasn't, and it won't.&nbsp; So, let's start thinking
of some more positive approaches, instead of this negative idea
of prohibition. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; So, this could be the first step in your
goal to have it legalized for everyone? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; I mean, well, you also have to look at the
history of things.&nbsp; Like, marijuana basically didn't exist
until in the 1930s.&nbsp; The historical name is hemp.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Uh hum. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; And, there's two forms of hemp.&nbsp;
There's an industrial hemp, and there's a medicinal hemp. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Cannabis. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; And when they changed the name in the
Congress, they changed the name to marijuana and made it all
illegal. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Sure. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; What they've done is held back the farmers
from growing the industrial form of hemp also.&nbsp; The Iowa
Farm Bureau has just passed a resolution calling for studies and
research into it for growing it here in Iowa.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Allen, thanks for the call.&nbsp;
Appreciate it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ALLEN:</b>&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Helmers.&nbsp; We heard from
the caller that this could be the first step to legalizing
marijuana for everyone, and it sounds like he was talking about
letting farmers grow hemp for whatever purpose.&nbsp; Now one of Mr.
Corbett's concerns was that this was kind of the first step to an
explosion here, and drug paraphernalia, drug use.&nbsp; Do you
agree with that? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Ah, no I don't.&nbsp; I think that the
drug use will end up going down over it.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; It will go down? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; I really believe so.&nbsp;
And, that's been the way it has gone in the Netherlands and other
European countries who are legalizing.&nbsp; There's a couple
more, Belgium legalized just a while back.&nbsp; It doesn't pay
to put non-violent, peaceful people in prison.&nbsp; Most enlightened
societies are aware of that.&nbsp; And I'd like to get back on
one point that Mr. Corbett made earlier.&nbsp; The people who
backed these resolutions in California and Arizona, the political people,
a few of them were Reagan's ex-secretary of state George Schultz,
former U.S. Senators Barry Goldwater, Allen Cranston, and Dennis DeConcini,
and Nobel economist Milton Friedman, and conservative William Buckley.&nbsp;
The people who bank rolled it, like George Soros, one of America's richest
men, contributed $550,000.&nbsp; Peter Lewis, Cleveland Insurance
tycoon, gave a half a million.&nbsp; John Sperling, president of
Phoenix, chipped in, as did Lawrence Rockefeller, Nelson's
brother.&nbsp; Don't tell me that's a line up of busy minded
pot-head hippies.&nbsp; I mean, the problem is you're trying to
turn it into a Cheech and Chong show. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; No, that's not... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; There's a medical need, and people are
being punished in this country.&nbsp; Is the next step for me to
call Dr. Kevorkian?&nbsp; Or, are we going to do like the Nazis
did and load sick people in the back of trucks and run the exhaust
up into them, so when you get them to the hospital you don't got
nothin' to do but bury 'em?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Mr. Helmers... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, first of all, I never said
anything about Cheech and Chong or how I've tried to frame this
issue.&nbsp; Now, don't think that I'm trying to make this into a
Cheech and Chong show.&nbsp; I haven't said anything about
that.&nbsp; I've been pretty open with saying there's been
studies on both sides that have showed, yes, there is some
medicinal value, and other studies that have said no.&nbsp; I haven't
tried to make this a partisan issue.&nbsp; I haven't been in any
way... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; I didn't say you did.&nbsp; That's the
tones I've been getting out of the media.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Out of the what?&nbsp; Out of the
media?&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Yeah. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well,... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; From other politicians. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, you pointed out, that there's, I
didn't say that this was a partisan issue.&nbsp; I know there's
Republicans that want to use it, want to legalize this.&nbsp; And
there's Democrats that do, and there's some on the other side
that don't.&nbsp; President Clinton doesn't think it should be
done.&nbsp; His chief drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, doesn't think
it should be done.&nbsp; Yes, former Senator DeConcini, he
thought it should be.&nbsp; Yeah, there's honest people can have honest
disagreements.&nbsp; And, I haven't criticized anyone for wanting
to push this at all.&nbsp; What I've said is, where do you draw
the line on this slippery slope?&nbsp; How do you prevent the
fraud? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Let's make it... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; In the system? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Put it, reschedule it on the same level
with cocaine, morphine, or any of your other Schedule II drugs. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, we're going to take a call
here.&nbsp; We've had Andy waiting on line one for quite a while
now.&nbsp; 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479.&nbsp; Andy from Waterloo,
you're on the air.&nbsp; How do you feel about this issue? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Well, I agree with that first caller.&nbsp;
I can't understand why this man keeps talking about prohibiting
it.&nbsp; If you're going to, if these people really need marijuana,
and physicians say they do, then they should be able to have
it.&nbsp; But, hey, let's quit fooling around, that's not prohibiting
it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; But, Andy, what about if you were laying
in bed and you said that you needed it, and how can I prove that
you don't?&nbsp; What would happen if that happened? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Well, I have a doctor.&nbsp; And, if he
says I need it, then fine.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; But, don't you think people lie to their
doctors once in a while? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, how do we prevent that? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; You don't prevent liars.&nbsp; I mean, look
at the politicians we got here today. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; (laughter) Well, that's a cheap shot,
Andy. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; What have I lied on? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; You haven't lied to me, sir. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett, go ahead. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; You said, look at the politicians.&nbsp;
What have I lied to you this morning? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; You haven't lied, sir, but Senator Harkin
did a lot of it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Well, we're getting a little off the
topic now. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; But my feeling is this, that if
you, this is the first caller said, that if the doctors say you
need it, you need it.&nbsp; And just because people lie to the
doctors, that doesn't mean that my statement is wrong.&nbsp; If
the doctors say you need it, and if I need marijuana, fine, if
the doctor says so.&nbsp; That's the only thing.&nbsp; And,
talking about profit, my goodness, look at what the dopers are making
today.&nbsp; The prostitutes, the pushers, out on the
streets.&nbsp; They're making big profits.&nbsp; They're robbing
out homes in order to get that dope money.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Andy, I appreciate your call.&nbsp;
Thanks for chiming in. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>ANDY:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Andy from Waterloo.&nbsp; And we
are going to be back, we've got to take a break here for another
CNBC business report, and have more from Ron Corbett, Republican
from Cedar Rapids is the House Speaker, and from Allen Helmers
who's an advocate for the medicinal use of marijuana.&nbsp; More
of the program on local talk radio coming up here on KCNZ.&nbsp;
It's now ten minutes before the hour of ten o'clock.</p>

<p align="center">(part of the tape is missing) </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>RANDY:</b>&nbsp; The chemotherapy and finally died of
cancer.&nbsp; During the last several years, he wanted to address
the nausea problems of chemotherapy with the use of
marijuana.&nbsp; And there were people who offered him marijuana,
but he would not take it, because he only wanted to do it with
the support of a physician.&nbsp; He went to different
physicians, and almost every one of them said that it would help,
and in many cases would help better than the drugs he was being
given.&nbsp; But, they said, I can't help you.&nbsp; You realize
what would happen to me if I did.&nbsp; Through absolute fear of
our lawmakers the physicians were not doing their job with their
patient, even though they knew it was the best road.&nbsp; And,
that's what we're doing by making this thing a criminal
situation.&nbsp; It should be taken out of the class I category
that it's in, and put in just like any other prescribed medication.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, Randy, thanks for the call. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>RANDY:</b>&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett?&nbsp; Any response? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I think the gentleman has a good
point.&nbsp; And, if you could just narrow it down to that aspect
of it, there'd be, you'd think it was easy to do.&nbsp; But, just
as there's people that will abuse drugs, you can have physicians.&nbsp;
I mean, it isn't going to be any matter of time where everybody's going
to know the physician that's going to approve it for whatever
reason, and to get the signature.&nbsp; I mean, that word will be
on the street in no time.&nbsp; An, so, it's extremely hard to police,
and it's hard to prevent the abuses from it.&nbsp; So, we have it
in two states.&nbsp; Let's find out how it works in those two
states.&nbsp; Now, they've legalized it.&nbsp; So, we're going to
have some data and information over the next three or four years
on this subject.&nbsp; This certainly isn't going to be the last time
that this issue is going to be debated.&nbsp; It's going to be
debated hotly around the country more and more as more and more
referendums get on ballots, and, so, let's see, let's let other
states, let the other states experiment with it at this point in
time. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; And if it works there, would you be
willing to go along with it in the future? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, the more information you have, I
mean, I've never been a person that's believed that someone
should be locked in stone for whatever reason on their
opinion.&nbsp; If you have more and more information and data
that can provide you, that's provided to you, it helps you in your
decision making process.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; I would be foolish
to ever say that, I mean, if my questions and concerns are
answered, and we don't find out in Arizona and in California that marijuana
use goes up among fourteen and fifteen year olds, and there aren't
some of the problems that I say possibly could arise.&nbsp; It's
not just me, but the national drug czar and other people, President
Clinton, say can develop from this.&nbsp; We'll know in a couple
of years.&nbsp; </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay, and we're going to go back to the
phones, 277-1918 or 1-800-913-9479, and, Thomas, you're on
KCNZ.&nbsp; Your comments. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>THOMAS:</b>&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; My question is for the
Speaker.&nbsp; Why won't he put it to a vote? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Mr. Corbett?&nbsp; I guess, it came
up.&nbsp; Why not? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, there's several things.&nbsp; I'll
just let you know the legislative process.&nbsp; We're only there
for a few months.&nbsp; And, there's two thousand different bills
that are introduced, and there's no way you could bring every
bill on up into committee and up on the floor.&nbsp; You'd be
there all year long.&nbsp; And so we're part time, so... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>THOMAS:</b>&nbsp; Well, it seems pretty simple to me. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; So you pick and choose the issues that
you're going to bring forward.&nbsp; I don't think there's enough
votes for it.&nbsp; So, why go through three, four, five, six
days of debate on an issue like this and then have it be
defeated? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Well, there's a lot of us voters who
would like to know where you stand on it, for next election. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, you know, (laughter), you know
where I stand. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Would you like some reliable
information?&nbsp; There's a couple pages of full of studies that
have been done which are very easily obtained.&nbsp; I will make
sure you get a list of those studies that were done by scientific people.&nbsp;
The information, the literature is out there. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; I think most of the people that run for
public office will let you know where they stand on this.&nbsp;
You just said locally, a local senator there supports it.&nbsp;
There's a questionnaire that we get on every group and organization
on all their different issues.&nbsp; I remember getting one on
this specific issue.&nbsp; I checked the no box and sent that
back, so I'm certainly not hiding my position, so... </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Elaine Szymoniak introduced a bill for
this last year. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Pardon? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Elaine Szymoniak had a bill that she
introduced on this issue. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I understand.&nbsp; And she's a
senator again, and maybe she'll introduce that legislation again. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Okay. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; I'm not saying that all one hundred
representatives and fifty senators don't oppose this or support
it.&nbsp; There's a difference of opinion.&nbsp; That's the
democracy and the process, but there aren't the votes right now
to pass it in the house. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Ron, last year when that bill came up,
did it come up for discussion last year, or not?&nbsp; Do you
remember what happened to that bill that she introduced? </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; It got assigned to committee.&nbsp; It
didn't even come out of committee.&nbsp; There wasn't any public
hearings on it, or anything.&nbsp; It just, whoever was the floor
manager of the bill didn't do anything with it. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; We're running out of time
here, and, Mr. Corbett, I need a last comment from you. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>CORBETT:</b>&nbsp; Well, I think we've had some good
discussions, and this we're going to continue to have, not just
on talk shows, but on editorial pages and continue discussion and
education about these issues.&nbsp; And, I'm not going to act
like I know all the answers.&nbsp; I'll continue to read the
stuff that Mr. Helmers and other people send me, and I hope that
they would also consider the other side.&nbsp; And this is going
to be something that we'll be discussing for quite some time. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>COLOFF:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Mr. Helmers, about thirty
seconds to wrap it up. </p>

<p><spacer type="horizontal" size="40"><b>HELMERS:</b>&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Well, I think we have to
stop locking up chronically ill people in the name of the drug
war.&nbsp; The cost of this war that the politicians have going
on has risen $15.1 billion in Clinton's 1997 budget.&nbsp; It's
gone too far.&nbsp; It's time that America took a little
difference stance here.&nbsp; When compassion and common sense
are in conflict with the law, then the law is wrong. </p>

Re:&nbsp; State of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen Douglass PIN #483567994
Case No. FECR047575 <br>
<br>
To Whom It May Concern <br>
<br>
I am writing to plead for mercy in the case of <a
href="helmers1.html">Allen Helmers</a> listed above. <br>
<br>
How can any of you morally justify your actions when considering
the facts in this case?&nbsp; To send a disabled man to prison
for smoking marijuana for pain (his <a href="verduyn.html">doctor</a>
advises him that it is the best and safest way for him to manage
his pain), and at the same time allowing an uninsured drunk
motorist to go free (7 days in jail and 18 months probation)! <br>
<br>
Seriously ill people who use marijuana as medicine should not be
arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial. Seriously ill patients should have their claims
heard by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners or some other
qualified board.&nbsp; If a seriously ill patient has a legitimate
medical necessity, that patient should be certified and be
exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa. <br>
<br>
Iowa recognizes the defense of &quot;medical necessity&quot; to
prosecution for the possession of marijuana in the state of
Iowa.&nbsp; <a href="../iowa/pleas.html">State of Iowa v. Jan
Pleas</a>, No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16,
1994).&nbsp; Iowa law recognizes the therapeutic value of
marijuana.&nbsp; Iowa Code 124.206(7)(a). <br>
<br>
Please refer to the enclosed documents. <br>
<br>
Thank you. <br>

<CENTER>_________________________________________________________________</CENTER>
    On the 23rd day of May 1994, the State's Motion to Strike

Affirmative Defense came before the Court.  The Court, having

reviewed the pleadings, heard the oral arguents of the parties,

and examined the case law provided, makes the following

findings:

    Defendant claims, in her Notice of Affirmative Defense of

Medical Necessity, that the marijuana found in her residence

during a police search was medically necessary to stabilize the

interocular pressure in her left eye, which has glaucoma.

Defendant further claims that there was a specific threat of

immediate harm, that Defendant did not bring about the

circumstances necessitating the illegal act, that no alternative

drug was effective in minimizing the effects of glaucoma, and

that the harm avoided was greater than the harm caused.

Plaintiff argues that the affirmative defense of medical

necessity is not a recognized criminal defense in the State of

Iowa, and so should be stricken.

    The Court finds that the necessity defense, by which the

defendant much choose the lesser of two evils, is a recognized

defense in the state of Iowa.  In <U>State v. Walton</U>, the Iowa

Supreme Court stated that the necessity defense is available

only in emergency situations where the threatened harm is

immediate and the threatened disaster imminent.  311 N.W.2d 113,

115 (Iowa 1981).  Additionally, no alternative option must exist

by which the defendant could avoid both evils.  <U>Id</U>.

    Defendant is entitled to attempt to establish the defense of

necessity.  If the trial judge finds that Defendant has

established the required elements of the necessity defense in

the State of Iowa, the judge may then instruct the defense of

necessity.  The Court declines to rule that the defense of

medical necessity does not exist in the State of Iowa.

    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Plaintiff's Motion

to Strike Affirmative Defense is hereby denied.

    DATED this 16th day of June, 1994.

    <p>re: Case No. FECR047575 State of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen
    Douglas PIN # 483567994 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People's Representative, U.S. <a
href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/harkin01.html"> Senator Harkin</a>, I am
a Federal Prisoner at the U.S. Pentitentiary at Lewisburg,
PA.&nbsp; I am serving a 35-year sentence for Conspiracy to
Import and Conspiracy to Possess Marijuana.&nbsp; In 1972 I
visited one of your predecessors to the United States Senate, the
Honorable <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html"> Harold Hughes</a>.&nbsp;
The subject of our discussion at that time was the religious use
and the sacramentality of the herb commonly known as
marijuana.&nbsp; After a brief discussion of approximately one
half hour, the former <a href="../../MEDICAL/IOWA/hughes.html">
Senator Hughes</a> cancelled his schedule for the following
afternoon and spent that entire afternoon discussing all manner
of subject matter as diverse as the possible spiritual properties
of marijuana and ranging to his possible dark horse candidacy for
the Presidency of the United States.&nbsp; I was accompanied by
two colleagues, Thomas Reilly, who later became known nationally
as <a href="../tropic.html"> Brother Louv</a> - the spokesman for
the <a href="../coptic.html"> Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church</a>,
and Jacob Shnurman who is presently living in Des Moines and
employed in some capacity by the State of Iowa.&nbsp; I mention
this previous encounter simply to indicate to you that I have a
long and storied experience with this controversial herb and I do
possess the credentials of an herb man. However, the purpose of
this letter is not for myself nor is it an attempt to enlighten
you concerning the spiritual properties of this &quot;plant of
renown.&quot;&nbsp; I am writing you at the behest of my good
friend of many years, Carl Olsen, in behalf of a man I do not
know at all, <a href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Allen
D. Helmers</a>. I am sure that you are aware of the plight of <a
href="../../MEDICAL/HELMERS/helmers1.html"> Mr. Helmers</a>.&nbsp;
He is attempting to petition for relief from the very real pain
which he suffers daily from the physical debility that he
acquired from breaking his back, initially, and, subsequently,
from a traffic accident caused by an alcohol-impaired driver. Is
there no one within the government at any level in these United
States who possesses the human compassion to hear the cry of
these helpless and hopeless folks who are suffering each
day?&nbsp; Isn't there anyone to speak in these legislative halls
of mischief for the souls who claim that their pain is either
relieved or more tolerable when they puff some smoke from a plant
which has been a part of creation long before pharmaceutical
manufacturers or drug enforcement operatives worked their
diabolical sciences and created the propaganda that has maligned
the most beneficial plant on this planet?&nbsp; Is there anyone
who is not brainwashed by this vicious lie about marijuana or who
is not afraid of the ominous repercussions of a federal
bureaucracy that thoroughly intimidates those it purports to
serve? I do not see anyone whose motives have not been
compromised by the political process.&nbsp; Human suffering is
the least of concerns by this juggernaut that has no
feelings.&nbsp; How is it that these people who claim to
represent the people can ignore the sincere cries of medical
relief that arise from thousands of suffering souls who have
risked the fearsome tactics of law enforcement agencies to
medicate themselves and then risk retribution when they are
honest? Lord, how long will thou look on?&nbsp; Let your
conscience be your guide.&nbsp; Everyone is accountable for their
actions. With minimal hope, I remain your brother, <a

The collection of <i>Cannabis </i>hemp germplasm at the Vavilov
Research Institute (VIR) consists of 397 accessions from 3
different eco-geographical groups: Northern, Central and
Southern. Eighty-five collection accessions were sown in
isolation at 4 locations in Russia in 1993 for the purpose of
maintaining the gene pools and replenishing the reserves of seed
for distribution. Sixty accessions yielded from 10 to 2,000 grams
of seed each. The remaining 25 accessions yielded no seeds.<br>

<p> The most important project of the International Hemp
Association is a grant of humanitarian aid to the N. I. Vavilov
Institute of Plant Industry (VIR) in St. Petersburg, Russia. The
VIR was founded in 1924 by plant collector and geneticist N.I.
Vavilov (Fig. 1), one of the first scientists to recognize the
importance of plant genetic resources conservation. The institute
is the longest existing seedbank in the world and houses a
priceless collection of over 400,000 seed accessions.</p>

<p>The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR maintains the
largest <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection in the world. Most
of these accessions are either wild landraces or fiber hemp
varieties, and many of them are found in no other gene banks.
Under normal storage conditions, hemp seeds can be kept for about
5 years before losing viability. Maintaining a <i>Cannabis</i>
collection therefore involves reproducing the accessions at least
once every 5 years. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union,
the funding of the VIR has dramatically decreased, threatening
the maintenance of its collections. If the <i>Cannabis</i>
accessions of the VIR are not reproduced they will surely become
extinct before their true value is ever realized and utilized.
Especially in light of the renewed interest in <i>Cannabis</i>,
it would be very short-sighted to let this collection die.</p>

<p> In 1993 the VIR, with the sole support of the IHA, began a 4
year program to preserve and evaluate its <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm. The collection consists of 397 accessions of <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds from three basic eco-geographical groups: Northern, Middle,
and Southern, collected from 16 nations (Table 1). The collection
represents wild and traditional cultivated varieties as well as
products of plant improvement programs. The vast majority of the
accessions are classified as low-THC chemotypes of <i>Cannabis
sativa</i> L. All of the accessions will be reproduced during the
first three years, and in 1996 the entire collection will be
grown in replicate gardens and each accession will be
characterized.</p>

<pre>Two key requirements must be fulfilled before an accession can
be considered adequately reproduced. The primary goal of a germplasm
preservation project is the conservation of the entire gene pool.
It is very important that the population size is large enough
to ensure that nearly all of the genes within the gene pool are
reproduced in the resultant seed. We have set a minimum limit
of 1,000 plants in each population. This should ensure 99% preservation
of the gene pool. The second goal is to reproduce the accession
in sufficient amounts to distribute seed to researchers worldwide.
We have set a minimum limit of 200 grams of seed for storage and
later reproductions. Two hundred grams is approximately 10,000
seeds and will allow 5,000 seeds to be stored in an active collection
for reproduction and 5,000 seeds to be kept in long-term storage.
Seeds can only be released to the research community if more than
200 grams of seed from each accession are held by the VIR.

This paper reports the results obtained in 1993.

<font size="3"><b>Materials and methods</b></font></pre>

<p> Eighty-five accessions of hemp contained in the germplasm
collection of the Department of Industrial Crops at the VIR were
sown with the purpose of germplasm maintenance, replenishment of
seed stocks for distribution, and installation in long-term
storage. The accessions were planted at 4 VIR Experiment Stations
in Russia (Fig. 2): Pavlovsk (59¡N) near St. Petersburg,
Ekaterinino (53¡N) in Tambov Province, Kuban (44¡N) near
Krasnodar, and Volgograd (48¡N).</p>

<pre>At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station 15 collection accessions belonging
to the Northern and Central groups were sown in isolated plots.
Each plot contained one hemp accession, the distance between the
plots being 3-4 kilometers.  The accessions were sown according
to their ripening period, with early-ripening varieties planted
nearer to late-ripening varieties to avoid stray pollination.

Agrometeorological conditions during 1993 were unfavorable for
the growth and development of hemp. The spring was late and cold.
Air and soil temperatures in May and early June were lower than
average by 4-5 ¡C. Because of this the spring sowing was
delayed by 15 days compared to the average sowing date. The plots
were planted on June 10-13. The seed was sown in densely planted
rows spaced 20 cm apart. The size of the plot varied from 8-12
m<sup>2</sup> depending on the number of seeds available.

The absence of rainfall in late May and strong winds dried out
the soil. The first seedlings appeared 10-12 days after sowing
and continued to appear for several days. During the course of
the whole vegetative period the air temperature was well below
average, while the rainfall was above average. Therefore, the
development of the plants was delayed.

Sowing of the seed and maintenance of the plants in the isolation
plots were performed according to the methods developed by the
Department of Industrial Crops. Maintenance of the plots consisted
of hoeing the soil when needed, thinning the rows where seedling
density was too high, weeding, applying fertilizer, removing male
plants after they finished flowering, covering the female plants
with gauze nets at the time of ripening to protect the seeds from
birds, and harvesting of the seed plants.

The remaining 70 collection accessions of the Central and Southern
eco-geographical groups were sown at the Ekaterinino, Kuban and
Volgograd Experiment Stations. At the former two stations accessions
were sown in isolated plots. At the Volgograd Station isolation
was achieved by using wooden and gauze isolation chambers. In
1993 the agrometeorological conditions there were as described
for the Pavlovsk Station, especially the dry and cold spring.
This caused a delay in sowing, sporadic germination of the seeds,
and poor condition of the seedlings. During the course of the
vegetative period the rainfall was 2-3 times the average for many
years. This also impeded the development of the plants.

<font size="3"><b>Results</b></font></pre>

<p> At the Pavlovsk Experiment Station, complete flowering was
observed in early August. Seed formation occurred in late August
and early September. Frosts arrived in the end of September and
the temperature fell to minus 5 ¡C. These frosts killed the
plants that had not matured and been harvested. Thus out of the
15 collection accessions planted at the Pavlovsk Station, 10
accessions yielded from 10-1,000 grams of mature seed, two
accessions did not ripen, two accessions were stolen, and one
yielded only immature seeds (Table 2).</p>

<pre>Discussion and conclusions</b></font></pre>

<p> In the introduction to this paper we defined two key
requirements which must be fulfilled before an accession can be
considered adequately reproduced: at least 1,000 plants have to
produce a total quantity of at least 200 g of seed.</p>

<pre>Due to poor weather conditions, poor germination, limited space
and theft, only 14 of the 60 accessions reproduced were of sufficient
population size (more than 1,000 plants). Of these 14 accessions
only 10 were reproduced in sufficient quantity to allow distribution
(more than 200 g seed). This means that although 60 of the 85
accessions were reproduced, only 10 were reproduced with sufficient
population size and in sufficient quantity to satisfy our criteria.

Eighty-five <i>Cannabis</i> seed accessions were sown, 60 <i>Cannabis</i>
seed accessions were reproduced, and 10 seed accessions were reproduced
in sufficient quantity for distribution. Although the 1993 <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm reproductions yielded minimal tangible results, we must
remember that this is the first time any <i>Cannabis</i> reproductions
have been attempted during the confusing period since the dissolution
of the Soviet Union. The extensive VIR system for germplasm preservation
has been partly reactivated and the future is now much brighter.
Our limited success is encouraging, considering that this is only
the first year of the VIR/IHA <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm preservation
project. We feel that the project should certainly be continued.
However, persistence and considerable additional financing will
be required to complete the reproduction and evaluation of the
entire <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm collection of the VIR within
the remaining three years of the project. Only one thing is certain,
we will never succeed if we do not focus our most concerted efforts
on <i>Cannabis</i> germplasm conservation.

<p> In 1994 the VIR and IHA continue their <i>Cannabis</i>
germplasm preservation programme. A third partner, the Italian
ENEA Institute is involved as well. A total of more than 100
accessions has been sown on five locations: Pavlovsk, Ekaterinino
and Kuban in Russia, Ustimovka in Ukraine and Bari in Italy.</p>

<pre>In Russia and Ukraine plant emergence and early growth have been slow due to cold spring wheather, but with the advent of higher summer temperatures crop growth has accelerated.

A detailed report on the results obtained in 1994 will be presented in the next issue of this journal.

Due to inflation in Russia, the costs of the project have doubled in 1994 relative to 1993. Donations to help continue this project are very welcome. Persons or organisations donating US $100 or more to the project will receive a VIR memorial medallion and/or pin and/or a copy of the VIR <i>Cannabis sativa</i> descriptor list, a 34 page booklet in English and Russian.</pre>

<p> The effect of the cultivation of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa
L.), cv Kompolti Hibrid TC, on the population dynamics of the
soil-borne pathogens <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (Fungi), <i>Meloidogyne
chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus penetrans</i> (Nematoda) was
studied in greenhouse and field experiments. Fibre hemp
suppressed the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> strongly. A
reduction in population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was also noted.
Removal of stubble of hemp from soil after harvest was found to
inhibit formation of survival structures (microsclerotia) of <i>V.
dahliae</i>.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> Dutch agriculture faces an increasing problem with soil-borne
pathogens (including nematodes) due to intensive growing of a
limited number of crops in short rotations. Government plans to
reduce the use of soil disinfectants by 50 % by the next century
may well aggravate the situation. A possible solution to the
problem is the introduction of new crops in the rotation.</p>

<p> It is generally assumed that long rotations are less
susceptible to soil-borne diseases than short rotations. However,
this assumption may not apply to soil-borne pathogens with a wide
host range (polyphagous pathogens). Several fungi (e.g. <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>) and nematodes (e.g. <i>Pratylenchus</i>
spp. and <i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) have a very large number of
host plants. Introduction of new crops of unknown host status
into a rotation may cause or aggravate problems with these
pathogens. Therefore, the population dynamics of important
polyphagous pathogens on new crops must be assessed before a safe
introduction can be made.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp is one of the potential new crops under
investigation in the Netherlands. Even though hemp is an ancient
crop, there are few reports on soil-borne diseases in this crop
and the general impression is that cultivation of hemp poses few
problems with plant diseases (Termorshuizen 1991). Soil-borne
diseases however often remain undetected due to the inconspicuous
symptoms. Furthermore, the absence of damage in a host plant does
not mean that the pathogen cannot multiply on the host.
Therefore, the population dynamics of some important soil-borne
pathogens on hemp were investigated.</p>

<p> The pathogens selected in this study were the fungus <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and the nematodes <i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus
penetrans</i>. These pathogens are potentially very harmful to
potato, which is the major crop in arable farming in the
Netherlands. <i>V. dahliae</i> is a major factor in the early
dying syndrome in potato, which can lead to severe yield
reduction. This pathogen has extremely persistent survival
structures (microsclerotia), that can endure in soil for over 12
years. Control of this pathogen is therefore very difficult
(Heale 1988).</p>

<p> The Columbian root-knot nematode <i>M. chitwoodi</i> has a
wide host range including many representatives of the <i>Gramineae</i>,
which are commonly used in rotational programmes with potatoes
(Santo et al. 1980). Low population levels of <i>M. chitwoodi</i>
already cause major crop losses of potato because of reduced
tuber quality and heavy infestations can substantially decrease
yields. Tuber infestation by <i>M. chitwoodi</i> causes necrotic
areas and other blemishes, rendering the tuber unsaleable
(Viglierchio 1987).</p>

<p> <i>P. penetrans</i>, the root-lesion nematode, has an
extremely wide host range. This species can cause severe growth
reduction and yield loss in potato production (Mai et al. 1977,
Santo 1989). Furthermore, <i>P. penetrans</i> increases the
effect of <i>V. dahliae</i> in the early dying syndrome of potato
(Kotcon et al. 1985, Rowe et al. 1985).</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Materials and Methods</b></font></p>

<p> The investigations described in this paper were carried out
using the Hungarian fibre hemp cultivar Kompolti Hibrid TC. This
cultivar was chosen for its good agricultural properties and
prior use as a standard in a cluster of research projects on
fibre hemp as an arable crop for paper production in the
Netherlands (&quot;National Hemp Programme&quot;).</p>

<p> The effect of cultivation of fibre hemp on the selected
pathogens was assessed by comparing the population before sowing
and after harvest of the crop. <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and <i>V.
dahliae</i> were studied in field and greenhouse experiments. The
reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on hemp was studied in the
greenhouse only. The effect of fibre hemp on changes in
population of the pathogens was compared with the effect of crops
with known host status.</p>

<p> The greenhouse experiment with <i>V. dahliae</i> was carried
out using a organic sandy soil to which microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i> were added (2,500/ml soil). In 400 ml pots, hemp,
wheat and pea were grown (5 pots per treatment). A control
treatment contained no plants (fallow). Wheat and pea are
resistant and susceptible, respectively, to <i>V. dahliae</i>.
Afterwards, above-ground parts of the plants were removed and the
population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was estimated.</p>

<p> The population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was assessed with a
bioassay, using the potato as test plant. Rooted potato cuttings
were planted in 400 ml pots containing the soil to be tested. The
pots were placed on a greenhouse bench at 19 ¡C and watered
sparingly. At two to three days intervals, the number of leaves
showing wilt symptoms was determined. The disease progress was
monitored until the first potato plants died (60 days after
planting). The cumulative disease score was calculated per plant
and taken as the measure of the soil population of <i>V. dahliae</i>.</p>

<p> Formation of microsclerotia on crop residues of fibre hemp
such as plant tops and stubble was studied in some detail. Since
microsclerotia were very rarely observed on plant parts that were
vital (green) at harvest, the effect of pulling stubble directly
after harvest on the formation of microsclerotia was determined.
In a field infested with <i>V. dahliae</i>, plant tops were
collected and green stubble was removed from the soil after
harvest. Three weeks later, when the stubble had died, another
batch of stubble was collected in the field. On both occasions,
the plant material was left to dry on top of moist soil in a
greenhouse, to simulate drying in the field. Once they were
air-dried, the number of stubbles containing microsclerotia was
assessed.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> on hemp was studied
in a greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse experiment
reproduction of the nematode was determined after 1 generation.
Three week old hemp seedlings were inoculated with 200, 400, 800,
1,600 or 3,200 nematodes (hatched second-stage juveniles) in 400
ml pots in 5 replications. After 1 generation cycle of the
nematodes (7 weeks at 20 ¡C), the number of newly formed eggs on
the roots was determined by the method of Vrain (1977). The
susceptibility of hemp was also tested in the field. On a sandy
soil heavily infested with <i>M. chitwoodi</i> (mean population
1500 eggs+larvae per 100 ml soil) fibre hemp was compared to five
other crops. All crops were grown in 6 x 6 m plots. Before sowing
and after harvest of the plants, the centre of the plot (1 x 1.5
m) was sampled with an auger (100 random samples, in total ± 3
litre soil per plot). The population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> was
determined with an Oostenbrink elutriator ('s Jacob and van
Bezooijen 1984). The experiment was set up as a randomized block
design with 4 replications.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on fibre hemp and,
for comparison, sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) or
fiddleneck (<i>Phacelia tanacetifolia</i> Benth.) was determined
in a greenhouse experiment. <i>P. tanacetifolia</i> and sugar
beet are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to <i>P.
penetrans</i>. The test plants were grown in 400 ml pots
containing potting mixture and coarse river sand (1:2, on volume
base). The plants were inoculated with a nematode suspension or
with nematode-infested oat root pieces. <i>P. penetrans</i>
originated from a greenhouse culture maintained on oats (courtesy
of Mr. van Bezooijen, Agricultural University Wageningen).
Nematodes for inoculum preparation were extracted from oat roots
in a mist chamber ('s Jacob and van Bezooijen 1984). Nematodes
were inoculated in suspension (470 per plant) or in infected
roots (210 per plant). The experiment was stopped at senescence
of the hemp plants, 2 months after inoculation. Nematodes were
extracted from the root system in a mist chamber and from the
soil with an Oostenbrink elutriator. The experiment was carried
out in a completely randomized design on a greenhouse bench at 20
¡C. Per inoculum type, 5 replicates per plant species were
taken.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Results</b></font></p>

<p> -<i>Verticillium dahliae</i><br>
The effect of the plants tested on the resulting disease index of
the potato test plants is shown in Table 1. Fibre hemp gave a
disease index in the bioassay that was not significantly
different from the resistant host plant wheat and the fallow
treatment. The susceptible host plant pea caused a significantly
higher disease index. This experiment was repeated with similar
results.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp sustained a large population of <i>P. penetrans</i>,
not statistically different from that of the susceptible host <i>P.
tanacetifolia</i>. The resistant host sugar beet had a much lower
final population.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

<p> Fibre hemp (cv. Kompolti Hibrid TC) was shown to be resistant
to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <i>M. chitwoodi</i>, but susceptible to <i>P.
penetrans</i>, under experimental conditions. Furthermore, it is
suggested that pulling of the stubble of fibre hemp directly
after harvest will reduce the formation of new microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. However, the experiments were conducted under
greenhouse conditions or in field trials at a single location and
in one year. This can make generalization of the results
precarious. Inclusion of crops of known host status in the
experiments reduces this problem. In this way it is possible to
draw conclusions on the host status of fibre hemp by comparison
with the other species.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp can possibly be used to suppress <i>M. chitwoodi</i>.
In the field experiment strong suppression was found and in the
laboratory experiment reduction of the population of <i>M.
chitwoodi</i> was evident even at very low inoculum levels. This
is an important result, because of the wide host range and the
high damage potential of this nematode.</p>

<p> The population suppression of <i>V. dahliae</i> by hemp was
similar to that on wheat or in the fallow treatment. But
above-ground parts of fibre hemp may contribute to the population
of <i>V. dahliae</i>, if the stubble is allowed to die off
naturally. Pulling the stubble inhibited the formation of
microsclerotia. This measure can further reduce the population of <i>V.
dahliae</i> after the cultivation of fibre hemp.</p>

<p> It seems that fibre hemp is susceptible to <i>P. penetrans</i>.
The results of the greenhouse experiment call for caution in
introducing fibre hemp in the crop rotation at sites where
problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> occur and susceptible crops are
grown. However, since this conclusion is based on greenhouse
experiments only, further studies are necessary to assess the
risks under field conditions.</p>

<p> The host suitability of a large number of hemp cultivars to
the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne hapla</i> was tested by De
Meijer (1993). This author found varying resistance levels,
ranging from highly resistant to moderately susceptible host
quality. The standard cultivar, Kompolti Hibrid TC, had an
average reproduction rate of <i>M. hapla</i>, both in a
laboratory and a field trial. Similar results were obtained by
Kok and Coenen (unpublished results). However, since some sources
of hemp germplasm showed very high levels of resistance (De
Meijer 1993), it should be possible to develop fibre cultivars
with good yield properties and a high resistance level to <i>M.
hapla</i>.</p>

<p> Modern European fibre hemp cultivars are thought to be
relatively closely related. Landraces, ornamental cultivars and
drug varieties however seem to be more distantly related (De
Meijer and van Soest 1992). Therefore, generalization of the
results to the latter types of hemp is precarious.</p>

<p> The results presented indicate that fibre hemp reacts
differently to various soil-borne diseases and that the notion
that fibre hemp will cause no problems with diseases in crop
rotation is not generally justified. Cultivation of fibre hemp is
likely to reduce the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. Problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> however could be
increased by fibre hemp. The results presented here are, however,
more of a qualitative than of a quantitative nature. Long-term
field studies are necessary to accurately assess the quantitative
impact of the cultivation of fibre hemp on soil-borne diseases.</p>

Cannabis is a plant with worldwide distribution, yielding fiber and food, as well as a psychoactive drug. The flowers have been used as a medicine for millennia. Investigation of its major chemical components has revealed their utility for the treatment o
f a wide variety of diseases. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is currently approved as an oral prescription drug for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and for appetite stimulation in cases of the anorexia associated
 with AIDS. However, many patients find that smoking Cannabis offers a superior route of administration and therefore illicitly self-medicate. <P>

<H4>Introduction</H4>



For those not familiar with marijuana and in need of it for medical purposes, the prospect of consuming an illicit drug may seem rather daunting. However, marijuana is used by 20-30 million people in the US and many times that number worldwide, under comp
letely uncontrolled circumstances, with little apparent harm. It is the world's fourth most popular recreational drug behind caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Unlike these latter drugs, Cannabis is not addictive and no one in the several thousand year histo
ry of its use is known to have died from its effects.  The intent of this article is to provide the prospective medical user with an introduction to this drug as a possible therapeutic option. The basics of our subject start with the realization that this
 much-discussed drug, like many of the others we consume, is from a plant with an interesting natural history. <P>



<H4>Cannabis, the plant</H4>



Cannabis is a dioecious annual producing approximately equal numbers of male and female plants. Marijuana comes from the flower-associated bracts of female Cannabis. The male plant is much less useful for this purpose. Almost all of the Cannabis found wor
ldwide is classified as Cannabis sativa. Many taxonomists argue that C. indica and C. ruderalis are also valid species names (Emboden 1974, Schultes et al. 1974) although this remains controversial (Small and Cronquist 1976). However, even accounting for 
these additional species, 95% of the cultivated Cannabis in the world would still be classified as Cannabis sativa.<P>

<P>

As it grows well at low temperatures, Cannabis is well adapted to temperate climates (Van der Werf 1994). Ancient northern Asian and European societies used Cannabis mostly for its fiber and seed. It is also an aggressive weed plant at higher latitudes wo
rldwide. South Asian and African cultures used Cannabis mostly for its drug content, and the frost-free climates allowed more time for development of the psychoactive resin. Intense levels of ambient ultraviolet radiation and of insect predation in the tr
opics may also have contributed to a natural selection for these drug types (Pate 1983). In any case, Cannabis has evolved into two basic races. Plants grown for fiber and seed are universally called "hemp". Cannabis grown for its drug content is commonly
 called "marijuana" or "drug Cannabis". Its female flower bracts are covered with numerous small resin glands containing the pharmacologically active cannabinoids (Fig. 1) that that are unique to this genus.<P>



Most of the psychoactive properties of marijuana can be attributed to its content of a cannabinoid (Fig. 1a) named delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). In some literature, it is designated as delta-1-tetrahydrocannabinol due merely to a conflict between tw
o methods of naming chemicals, but it is the very same molecule. Modern hemp varieties are nearly devoid of THC and, therefore, cannot be practically diverted into the drug trade. Hemp has been heavily selected for high fiber content, high stalk yield, hi
gh seed yield, and low (<0.3 %) inflorescence THC content (De Meijer et al. 1992). Drug-type Cannabis varies widely in THC content from approximately 1-2% in unselected strains to over 10% in the best modern varieties (Watson 1994). It is not feasible to 
"get high" on hemp, and most marijuana produces very little low-quality fiber. Hemp should never be confused with marijuana, as their roles cannot be reversed.<P>



<H4>Cannabis, the medicine</H4>



Cannabis has been recognized for centuries as a valuable therapeutic agent. Folk uses of Cannabis include treatment of insomnia, inflammation, various psychoses, digestive disorders, depression, rheumatism, migraine, neuralgia, fatigue, constipation, diar
rhea, parasites, appetite disorders and it has also been employed by women to facilitate childbirth, stimulate lactation, and relieve menstrual cramping (Mechoulam 1986). These traditions continue in every region where Cannabis is available. Modern Wester
n Cannabis users also frequently claim relief from many of these same medical complaints. <P>

<P>



Cannabis or THC have been used experimentally to effectively lower the elevated intraocular pressure of glaucoma (Adler and Geller 1986) and have shown potential for the treatment of alcoholism (Rosenburg 1976) and drug dependence (Hine et al. 1975). THC 
has been used as a bronchodilator for the relief of asthma symptoms (Graham 1986) and may also be effectively used as an analgesic for pain relief (Segal 1986). It has even been shown to have antibacterial properties (Van Klingeren and Ten Ham 1976).<P>

<P>

The low toxicity of THC is best indicated by its widespread use with very few reports of anything even approaching an overdose. Occasionally, people may get too "high" for their psychic comfort, but their bodies continue to function fairly normally. The d
osage sufficient to kill half of the organisms tested (LD50) for orally ingested THC is approximately 1 g/kg of body weight. Simply interpreted, this means an average sized human would have to consume 50-100 g of pure THC to reach the LD50 level. Since hi
gh-potency Cannabis contains approximately 10% THC, a person would have to eat at least 500-1,000 g of this marijuana before having a 50% chance of death. A 1 g marijuana cigarette of 10% THC Cannabis contains 100 mg of THC and is usually shared among sev
eral smokers. Clinically effective oral doses for the relief of nausea start at 5-10 mg. This means that, even accounting for pyrolytic decomposition and smoke loss, there is a several-thousandfold difference between an effective dose of THC and a potenti
ally lethal one! For alcohol, this difference is only about twentyfold. Other common non-prescription drugs, such as aspirin, have similar relatively narrow margins of safe use. Research into the actions of the natural cannabinoids led to the creation of 
many artificial ones based on variations of their basic molecular structure. However, none of these artificial compounds are currently approved for medical use in the US. Nabilone proved to be toxic to laboratory test animals and in 1978, human tests were
 suspended, although it is available in Canada, Switzerland and the United Kingdom as Cesamet¬. Levonathrodal, another synthetic cannabinoid analog, was not approved for use in the US, also following incidents of toxicity in test animals.<P>



Other natural cannabinoids (Fig. 1b-d), such as cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) have been shown to have potential therapeutic value, and can be isolated from both non-psychoactive as well as psychoactive Cannabis varieties,
 Epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, dystonias, and other neurological disorders have been experimentally treated with CBD (Consroe and Snider 1986). CBD has also been shown to relieve anxiety, especially the minor anxiety occasionally associated with the medic
al use of THC (Zuardi et al. 1982). CBC, CBD, and CBG and related analogs have been shown to have anti-microbial action (ElSohly et al. 1982, Van Klingeren and Ten Ham, 1976). These non-psychoactive compounds are generally not restricted by international 
regulations prohibiting Cannabis and THC. <P>



Various delivery systems for these cannabinoids, such as suppositories, time release encapsulation, eye drops, nasal sprays, aerosols, topical ointments, and transdermal patches will eventually become available. Several such cannabinoid delivery systems h
ave already been patented (e.g., ElSohly 1990, Hussain 1984).<P>

<P>

The only cannabinoid medicine currently available in the US is a synthetic THC encapsulated in sesame oil (generically known as "Dronabinol"). It is sold under the trade name Marinol¬ as a Schedule II controlled substance (allowing restricted prescription
, similar to morphine and cocaine) and was afforded a narrow, specific legal exemption from the Schedule I status of other Cannabis products (forbidden from clinical use). It has been accepted and prescribed in the United States since 1985 as an anti-emet
ic to treat the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy (Levitt 1986). Use as an appetite stimulant to correct the weight loss related to anorexia in AIDS patients was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 22, 1992 (Anonymous 1992
). THC is not a cure for cancer or AIDS, but helps to relieve suffering and improve quality of life, perhaps prolonging the lives of those afflicted. THC may also eventually win approval as a general appetite stimulant for anorexia nervosa and other appet
ite disorders.<P>

<P>

Before other cannabinoids or Cannabis can become available to patients in the US, they must be similarly rescheduled. This also applies to the non-psychoactive compounds or even an otherwise identical, but plant-derived THC medicine! On April 29, 1991, th
e UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs decided that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol should be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances to facilitate its therapeutic use. Similar rescheduling in each member count
ry would allow doctors to prescribe it as a medicine and permit easier research. This has already been accomplished in England and Germany. Patients claim there is an acute need to reform the laws concerning other Cannabis products, especially in response
 to the medical plight of thousands of cancer and AIDS patients. If economic incentives could be created by liberalizing outdated anti-Cannabis laws and streamlining new drug registration and testing procedures for AIDS related medicines, several new Cann
abis medicines would appear on the market within the next few years.<P>

<P>

Currently, in the US, the cost of a single dose of Marinol¬ ranges between $4.00 and $8.00 and the average patient cost ranges from $12.00 to $32.00 per day. Since Marinol¬ is expensive, narrowly prescribed and often less effective than crude Cannabis pre
parations, potent sinsemilla-type (seedless) marijuana remains the most viable form of Cannabis medicine, despite the fact that its illegality artificially inflates its cost. Physicians learned as much from their patients and began to publish guidebooks o
n the appropriate medical use of Cannabis (e.g., Roffman 1982), which is most often smoked or consumed in baked goods.<P>

<P>

In some respects, it may be unfortunate that Cannabis has played such a prominent role in the American media's coverage of the counterculture movement since the 1960s. The popularization of Cannabis as the drug of choice increased its exposure to the gene
ral public, but government disinformation promoted the mainstream cultureÍs confusion of it with hard drugs. It has been difficult for even the more knowledgeable patients and practitioners to view Cannabis as a genuine medicine rather than merely a recre
ational drug. Of course, many doctors are also reluctant to suggest Cannabis use because it is illegal. Marinol¬ is too expensive for many patients to afford and orally ingested anti-emetics are of questionable value because their application must be care
fully timed to avoid vomiting the drugs. Many patients who both smoke Cannabis and swallow Marinol¬ report that THC absorbed through the lungs offers more immediate relief, better dose titration, fewer side-effects and shorter duration of action. <P>





<H4>Conclusions</H4>



For millennia, Cannabis has been used as an effective medicine. Modern research has revealed the clear potential for this plant and its cannabinoid products to resume their place in the pharmacopoeia. Further work is urgently needed to determine how Canna
bis can be best utilized as a clinical tool. Meanwhile, cancer and AIDS patients and members of the medical marijuana movement have taken responsibility for their own health and self-medicate without a doctor's prescription. <P>

<H6> A brief review of the history of paper making reveals the important role of hemp in the development of the industry. The technical aspects of classical hemp pulping and paper making and the present status of the hemp pulp and paper industry are discu
ssed. It is shown that for new applications of hemp as a paper making fibre source, new pulp technology is required. This article is the first in a series about hemp pulping and paper making. </H6>

<H3>History of paper making</H3>



The use of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) for pulp and paper dates back more than 2,000 years. The oldest surviving piece of paper in the world was discovered by archeologists in 1957 in a tomb near Sian in Shensi province, China (Temple 1986). It is abo
ut 10 cm square and can be dated precisely between the years 140 and 87 BC. This paper and similar bits of paper surviving from the next century are thick, coarse, and uneven in their texture. They are all made of pounded and disintegrated hemp fibres. Pa
per historians agree that the earlier Egyptian papyrus sheets should not be referred to as paper, because the fibre strands are woven and not ñwet-laidî (Hunter 1957). The Chinese paper-making craftsmanship was transferred to Arabic and North-African coun
tries, and from there to Europe. The first European paper making was reported in the first half of the 16th century (Hunter 1957). <P>

Until the early 19th century, the only raw material available for paper making was rags. Rags are worn-out clothes. Since at that time clothing was solely made of hemp and flax (sometimes cotton), almost all paper in history was thus made of hemp and flax
 fibres. With the industrial revolution, the need for paper began to exceed the available rag supply. Although hemp was the most traded commodity in the world up to the 1830Ís (Conrad 1993), the shortage of rags threatened the monopoly for hemp and flax a
s paper-making fibres. This was the major incentive for inventors and industries to develop new processes to use the worldÍs most abundant (and cheap) source of natural fibres: our forests.<P>

Currently, only about 5% of the world's paper is made from annual plants like hemp, flax, cotton, sugarcane bagasse, esparto, wheat straw, reeds, sisal, abaca, banana leaf, ananas and some other more exotic species. The world hemp paper pulp  production i
s now believed to be around 120,000 tons per year (FAO 1991), which is about 0.05 % of the worldÍs annual pulp production volume. Hemp pulps are generally blended with other (wood-) pulps for paper production. There is currently no significant production 
of 100 % true hemp paper.<P>



<H3>Renewed interest in hemp paper</H3>



The recent renewed interest in hemp as a paper-making fibre seems to originate from a strong environmental motive. All primary forests in Europe, and most in North America have been destroyed, amongst others for paper production. Now we accuse the nations
 which still have primary forests of not guarding theirs. <P>

In Europe all trees harvested for paper making were intended for that purpose, so there seems to be no valid reason to switch to a non-wood or ñtree-freeî fibre source. This of course is a little different in the Americas and in Asia and Australia, where 
primary forests are cleared at a huge environmental cost. In these regions hemp has a number of advantages as an alternative source of paper-making fibre. Hemp does not need pesticides or herbicides, and yields three to four times more usable fibre per he
ctare per annum than forests. And last but not least: paper recycling was invented to make up for the mistake of cutting down our primary forests. Technically speaking, one doesnÍt need to recycle hemp paper, because it is a renewable raw material.<P>

One disadvantage of using hemp or other annual plants as fibre source is that the present pulping technology has been optimised for tree-fibre pulping, so some adjustments in the pulping processes need to be made when applying this technology to hemp fibr
es. Before going into technical details, we will first examine the technology of pulp and paper making.<P>





<H3>Pulping and paper making</H3>



Paper making is essentially the rearranging of elementary fibres from whatever source (a tree, a hemp stalk, an old pair of jeans or even a scoop of algae) into a flat thin sheet. <P>

Elementary fibres are the basic building blocks of trees and many plants. The average paper making fibre is about 2 mm long and about 20 micrometers (0.02 mm) thick. All fibres are assembled of chains of cellulose molecules, arranged as a rigid structure.
 These building blocks are glued together with other biological components (lignins, pectins), which give a certain flexibility and strength to the tissue, so that the tree or plant can bend at high stresses, and doesnÍt break in a storm, and is able to c
arry its seeds and fruits. The following explains what is needed to process a fibre source into paper (Smook 1982):



<H4>Pulping (from fibre source to pulp):</H4> 

<UL><LI>cleaning: all non-fibrous components need to be removed from the raw material, and the remaining fibres must be cleaned of dirt, rocks and other contaminants.

<LI> fiberizing: the elementary fibres are taken apart by either chemically removing the glue that holds them together, or mechanically tearing the fibre structure apart. From this step on, the material is referred to as "pulp".

<LI>cutting: especially hemp fibres are too long to give a homogeneous paper sheet, so the fibres have to be cut to the right size. 

<LI>classification: the fibres suitable for use in paper are separated from the ones too short, too long, too wide, too thin, too crooked, too dirty and too old. Fibres can be classified by weight (centrifugal and gravitational processes) and size (variou
s sieving processes).

<LI>bleaching: optionally, the suitable fibres may be bleached to a higher "whiteness". The whiter a sheet, the better the contrast with the ink. Old-style pulp mills use chlorine compounds with hazardous side-effects. Modern pulp mills use oxygen-based b
leaching (compounds like oxygen, ozone and peroxide). Hemp pulp can be bleached with relatively harmless hydrogen peroxide. For some applications bleaching is not required, for instance for packaging paper and board.

<LI>refining: this is a separate process step in which the fibre surfaces are "roughened". The greater surface roughness of a fibre, the better it adheres to other fibres in the paper sheet and the greater the strength of the paper.

</UL>

<H4>Papermaking (from pulp to paper):</H4>

<UL><LI>Dilution: in order to lay the fibres evenly into a homogeneous sheet, the pulp is diluted with large amounts of water (sometimes up to 200 times as much water as fibre pulp).

<LI>Formation: the fibre-water slurry is poured on a fine mesh wire. Most of the water will fall through the wire, leaving the fibres to settle into a flat sheet.

<LI>Drying: in the next steps, the wet sheet is dried by subsequent pressing and steam heating.

<LI>Sheeting: finally, the formed sheet is cut to the required size.</UL>

These processes are essentially the same for manual paper making and for modern paper machines, with the difference that the old paper maker put out one handmade sheet per minute, and the state-of-the-art Fourdrinier newsprint paper machine puts out 15,00
0 square meters a minute: a 10 meter wide sheet at 90 kilometers an hour! <P>





<H3>Remainders of the hemp pulp industry</H3>



Although there are thousands of non-wood paper mills in the world, only a few of them use hemp as a fibre source. At present 23 paper mills use hemp fibre, at an estimated world production volume of 120,000 tons per annum. Most of the mills are located in
 China and India, and produce moderate quality printing and writing paper. Typically, these mills do not really have a fixed source of fibre, but they simply use whatever can be found in the region. About 10 of the mills are located in the western world (
US, UK, France, Spain, eastern Europe, Turkey), and these mills produce so-called specialty papers such as: 

<UL><LI>cigarette paper: even popular American cigarette brands have a 50% hemp cigarette paper and filter. Some countries still have legislation prescribing the use of hemp in cigarette paper, because other fibres (like spruce) generate hazardous fumes w
hen incinerated (!).

<LI>filter paper (for technical and scientific uses)

<LI>coffee filters, tea bags

<LI>specialty non wovens

<LI>insulating papers (for electrical condensators)

<LI>greaseproof papers

<LI>security papers

<LI>various specialty art papers</UL>

These papers can generally only be produced from special fibres like hemp, flax, cotton and other non-wood fibre sources. The average hemp pulp and paper mill produces around 5000 tons per annum. This should be compared to a ñnormalî pulp mill for wood fi
bre, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The only reason the remaining mills can still produce at this extremely small size is that there is a very special use for the pulp. This partly explains the high price for a hemp pulp: about US $25
00 per ton versus about US $400 for a typical bleached wood pulp. The remaining mills in the western world are unable to cope with western environmental regulations because of their small size and archaic technology. Some mills survive by shipping their w
aste water to a large wood pulp mill nearby, others have to close down. There is a clear shift in capacity towards countries that do not as yet take environmental problems very seriously.<P>

One reason for the high price of hemp pulp is the inefficient pulping processes used. Another reason is that hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (most
ly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles, which accounts for a high raw material cost.<P>





<H3>Classical pulping technology</H3>



Most mills predominantly process the long hemp bast fibres, which arrive as bales of cleaned ribbon from preprocessing plants located near the cultivation areas. The bales are opened and fed into a spherical tank, called a digester. Water is added (5 to 1
0 times the fibre weight), together with the cooking chemicals to remove the "glue" components lignin and pectin from the fibres. Most mills use sodium hydroxide and sulphur cocktails.<P>

The fibres are cooked for several hours (sometimes up to eight hours) at elevated temperature and pressure, until all fibres are separated from each other. After cooking, the cooking chemicals and the extracted binding components are separated from the fi
bres by washing with excess water. This is where most of the polluting waste emerges from the process. Often wastes are discharged as such into the local surface water.<P>

The remaining clean fibres are then fed into a Hollander beater, which is best compared to an industrial size bathtub, with a large wheel revolving around a horizontal axis at one point in the tub. The wheel pumps the pulp round and round, and meanwhile c
uts the fibres to the right length, and also gives the fibres the required surface roughness for better bonding capacity. This beating goes on for up to twelve hours per batch. Some mills add bleaching chemicals in this beating process, other mills pass t
he pulp from the beating machines to separate tanks for bleaching. These separate bleaching treatments often use chlorine compounds, which are also discharged into the environment. The bleached pulp is then ready to be pumped to the paper machine, or can 
be pressed to a dryness suitable for transportation to a paper mill elsewhere. The processing time of more than twenty hours make this process very expensive, as the costly equipment and handling must be depreciated over a very low throughput.<P>





<H3>Necessity for new technology</H3>



New applications for hemp as a paper making raw material require a new pulping technology which must be able to use hemp from wet storage. Some new technologies have been developed, albeit in laboratory or on pilot scale. The next item in this series abou
t hemp pulping and papermaking will discuss these new technologies and their benefits.<P>

<body><H1>Commercial hemp cultivation in the Netherlands in the 17th and 18th centuries</H1>



From the late middle ages until the 19th century hemp was grown in the Netherlands for use in the fishing industries. 

Further light has been shed on this interesting subject by a study carried out at Wageningen Agricultural University with financial support from the Historical Research Foundation, which is part of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO
). By the end of this year, H. Hoogendoorn will publish the results of this study in his PhD thesis.<P>



The rise of commercial hemp cultivation was associated with an increasing demand for vegetable oils and for fibrous materials. In a sea-faring nation such as the Netherlands, there was a major demand for hemp fibre as the raw material for making ropes, sa

ils and fishing nets. This demand was very large during the 17th century, which for the Dutch was their Golden Century. The herring fleet and the sailcloth industry gave preference to hemp produced in the Netherlands for the manufacture of nets, rigging a
nd cordage, and sails. (The word canvas is, in fact, derived from the Latin word Cannabis) The sail makers required a fine type of fibre and Dutch hemp producers introduced specific processes in order to meet this demand. This commercial chain from raw ma
terial to finished product provided a living for a large number of specialists such as hacklers (who combed the fibres), spinners, weavers and sail canvas manufacturers and represented a significant contribution to the contemporary economy. The Dutch mode
l became an example for the other countries.<P>



Commercial hemp cultivation was a specialty in the western part of the central Netherlands, and required a number of special facilities in the areas of agricultural engineering, hydraulic engineering and commercial management. The hemp farmers grew the cr
op on a small scale using advanced water-supply methods, and largely as a monoculture, therefore necessitating the intensive use of manure. Hemp cultivation was a labour-intensive activity, and the process of "retting", in which the crop was soaked in wat
er in ditches to separate the fibres, led to a high level of environmental pollution.<P>



After the 17th century, developments on both the supply and demand sides led to the gradual decline of hemp cultivation. Dutch maritime activity had passed its zenith, and other fibrous products such as flax, cotton, jute and even silk competed with hemp.
  Moreover, cheaper hemp was imported from eastern Europe. It became increasingly difficult for Dutch hemp farmers to produce at a profit, and they therefore gradually changed over from a combination of hemp growing and cattle rearing to dairy farming. Cu
rrent overproduction in the foodstuffs sector means that agricultural interest is once again being shown in hemp, while new industrial applications for hemp fibres are also being studied.<P>

<H1>The UK hemp project in 1993</H1>

<H4><I>Ian Low,  Director</I></H4>

<H4> Hemcore Ltd. <BR>

Station Road, Felsted, Essex CM6 3HL, United Kingdom</H4>



<HR>

Pulling, retting, grassing, breaking, scutching and hackling were going on in East Anglia in Elizabethan times. There was even a law which enforced hemp growing on pain of a fine. The hemp produced was quite coarse and was used for smocks, sheets, bolster
s, fishing nets and rope. All over the area there are village names to remind us of the long hemp growing tradition such as Hempstead, Heckfield and Bleach Green. So in 1993 when Hemcore was formed by two East Anglian businesses to redevelop the hemp crop
 in the area, we were treading a well-worn path, albeit one that hadn't been walked for 50 years.<P>



The reasoning behind our move into hemp production involved a common mixture of circumstances and opportunities, in detail:

<UL>

<LI><B>Market Openings:</B>

 for the fibre into paper and textiles, for the core of the plant as livestock bedding, for the seed as fishing bait and bird seed.



<LI><B>Growing Opportunities:</B>

 with farmers looking for alternative crops to remove the pressure from over production in most of the main arable crop markets.



<LI><B>Environmental Benefits:</B>

 which were commonly seen as coming from hemp cultivation, both in the growing crop and in the replacement of synthetic or imported products in the market place.

</UL>

<H3>The project</H3>

In 1992 my partner Robert Lukies and myself set up a trials programme covering as many different varieties of hemp as we could obtain. These trials were taken through to harvest at Hatfield Broad Oak in Essex and the resulting plants were trial processed.
 
Following the successful outcome of these trials, a decision was made to go ahead with a commercial venture. An application was made to the British Home Office for a licence to grow 600 ha (1,500 acres) of hemp in 1993. After considerable discussion a lic
ence was granted on February 18, 1993, and our plans went into action for establishing a new U.K. hemp industry. <P>

 In March 1993, Hemcore Ltd. was formed. It is owned by Harlow Agricultural Merchants, a large East Anglian Merchanting Company and Robert Lukies, who farms and runs a seed processing business in Essex. During March and April, 30 growers were chosen and s
ites were approved by the Home Office. 

<P>

<H3>The growing crop</H3>

Drilling took place during the first week of May at approximately 50 kg/ha of seed, drilled 2-3 cm deep on 10-18 cm row widths. We found it important to obtain as fine as possible a seed bed with minimum compaction and used conventional cereal drills for 
sowing. No agricultural chemicals were used in the growing of the crop, but we did find it very responsive to fertilizer. We used fertilizer rates of about 120 kg/ha of nitrogen, 100 kg/ha of phosphate and 160 kg/ha of potash. 
The impressive growth rate of the hemp crop is already well known and our crops certainly lived up to expectations, average heights reached were 3 metres with some up to 3.5 m. Maximum heights were reached in early to mid August. There were noticeable pla
nt losses between establishment and full growth, with final plant populations ending at around 180 per metre square.<P>



In July and August, a number of incidents occurred where people stole cuttings of our contract crops. It is extremely doubtful whether they were rewarded for their troubles, but they were certainly of considerable nuisance value and caused the authorities
 some concern. One particularly troubled crop was harvested in early August to get it out of the way, otherwise harvesting did not begin until September.<P>



<H3>The harvest</H3>

   September and early October were very wet in East Anglia in 1993. This proved a considerable test of our pioneering harvest plans. Whilst we tried different machines and methods, the mainstay of our operation hinged on a modified rape swather and John 
Deere Round Balers. We are particularly grateful to the latter company for their wholehearted support. Although weather conditions delayed a large proportion of the baling until mid October, we were delighted by the condition of the crop, and in the end e
very hectare of every field was cleared. Following such a steep learning curve, we intend to put into practice for the '94 harvest a number of new plans that give us a lot of confidence for the long-term future of hemp production.<P>



<H3>The market</H3>

I will not go into detail on processing, as a large amount of what we are doing is at the prototype stage and all of it is confidential. Suffice to say that we have at the moment two products coming out of the factory, fibre from the stem sheath for paper
 and possibly for the textile trade, and the core of the stem which is going into the livestock bedding market. Both products have created a lot of interest and there seems at the moment to be good demand. <P>



<H3>Summary</H3>

1993 was a year of considerable achievement for Hemcore. The ripples from what we have done have gone round the world. We succeeded in a difficult year to grow and harvest 600 hectares of hemp and we will build on this in 1994. We have continued to do ext
ensive variety and agronomic trials and these too will be extended this year. Processing caused us many more problems than we originally envisaged. Marketing will also present a challenge as the present volumes are only satisfying a small niche market. We
 have made it clear from the outset that Hemcore's philosophy, unlike that of much of the agricultural world, will be to satisfy market leads, not to be output driven.<P>

<TITLE>Hemp or wood: potential substitutes</TITLE><body>
<H1>Hemp or wood: potential substitutes</H1>
<H2>V.S. Krotov</H2>
<H3>The Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute</H3> <H4>18/7 Kutuzovstreet, Kiev 252133, Ukraine</H4>
<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

Three major factors are restraining the development of the pulp and paper industry of Ukraine:

<UL><LI>1. The capital costs for the construction of new production facilities are high, with payback time often exceeding the normative service life of the main process equipment. 

<LI>2. The current obsolete equipment causes environmental problems, as it has a high consumption of raw materials, water and energy and a relatively low yield of finished products. Over 10 % of the raw materials, the pulping chemicals, and almost all bleaching agents are discharged into the environment.

<LI>3. Ukraine is sparsely wooded, and a lack of traditional raw materials hampers the development of its pulp and paper industry. Forests take up only 13.2 % of its territory, and logging covers about one third of its pulp requirements. At the same time, Ukraine's agriculture generates millions of tons of fibrous products: cereal straw, sunflower and corn stems, flax, hemp and others. 
In this paper fibre hemp as a raw material for paper pulp will be compared to poplar.</UL>

<H4>Pulping of non-wood raw materials</H4>

In principle, all fibre-containing by-products can be used for pulping, but their processing in the pulp and paper industry is more expensive than the processing of wood. Agricultural by-products are more bulky and dispersed over larger territories than wood, making their transport and storage more costly. Other factors increasing the costs of pulping of non-wood raw materials using existing technologies are:

<UL><LI>-heterogenous morphology of the raw material containing stems, leaves, spikes, seeds etcetera, and the presence of non-fibrous impurities (e. g. soil),

<LI>-high ash content of raw materials and especially the presence of silicon compounds,

<LI>-lower pulp yield as compared to wood pulping.</UL>

The negative effect of these factors on production and environmental safety can be minimized by additional expenses for the preparation of raw materials, the removal of silicon and the disposal of wastes. However, the extra costs involved would make non-wood pulp more expensive than wood pulp.


<H4>Poplar or hemp?</H4>

The development of a competitive pulp industry in sparsely wooded countries requires:
<UL><LI>1. Setting up plantations of fast-growing plants with a high yield of fibrous raw materials,

<LI>2. The development of a new technology adapted to the specific characteristics of local raw materials, including  agricultural by-products.</UL> 

For the conditions of Ukraine, the choice of plants to be grown on plantations and to be used for pulp and paper is limited to fast-growing poplars or hemp. The technology for growing poplar in short rotation (12 years) plantations has been developed by one of the Ukrainian Research Stations. In the south of Ukraine, Toropogritsky's poplar is recommended for growing. The annual increment of such poplar plantations on irrigation areas of the Kherson Region varies from 20 to 40 m3/ha, depending on fertility, planting pattern and irrigation practice. Taking an average annual increment of 30 m3/ha, and a poplar wood density of 420 kg/m3, we obtain an amount of wood of 12.6 ton per ha per year. A feasibility study for such poplar plantations has shown that the costs of the wood were four to five times higher than those of aspen wood logged and delivered to the Kherson Pulp and Paper Mill from Central European regions of Russia.<P>

Hemp is promising as a raw material for pulp and paper. Southern hemp is most suitable for growing under the conditions of Ukraine, since it is hardy, suffers little damage from pests and diseases, and can be grown in monoculture for many years. At present its yield of dry stems is 8-10 ton/ha in many areas, which is four to five times more than the average annual increment in Ukranian forests and approaches the increment of the most productive plantations of fast growing poplars. <P>

<H4>Perspectives</H4>


The Ukranian Institute of Bast Crops (UIBC) at Glukhov, Sumy Region, has bred hemp cultivars containing practically no psycho-active components. Until the present the hemp selection was aimed at breeding varieties for the textile industry, i.e. the selection work took into account the bast portion of the stem, as well as the content of THC. In the pulp and paper industry, the entire stem can be used. Based on its large experience, the UIBC expects it can breed cultivars yielding 12-14 ton/ha of dry stems. In this case the stem yield is comparable to the wood yield of the best polar hybrids. As opposed to hardwoods such as poplar, hemp can meet all the requirements of the paper industry for short- and long-fibred pulps for practically any paper or board grade.
In 1992, UIBC compared the labour costs of growing and harvesting hemp to those of poplar. Proceeding from the present average yield of 6 ton/ha for hemp and from an annual increment of poplar of 12.6 ton/ha, the costs were comparable. Thus, hemp plantations are more efficient than poplar plantations as a source of raw materials for the pulp and paper industry. However, the advantages of hemp can be realized only if a new technology allowing pulping of the entire stem is developed. Such a technology has been developed at the Ukrainian Pulp and Paper Research Institute. Its basic concepts are summarized in a research proposal (page 28) and will be presented more in detail in a future paper.<HR>

<TITLE>Hemp in Australia</TITLE><body>

<H1>Hemp in Australia</H1>

<HR>





<H2>The Tasmanian Hemp Company</H2>

<H3>In the beginning</H3>

"What happens to those beautiful native forests in Tasmania?" was the question posed in a Dutch living-room in 1988 when we were sharing photographs and experiences. After explaining that a good proportion ended up as woodchips for Japan which we then bought back as paper, a friend said that he had seen something on Dutch TV about hemp for paper. I was brought up as a logger's daughter in Tasmania, and began to feel very angry with myself for not having seen beyond trees for paper.  

So began our long search to track down this curious phenomenon. Our lives are now totally dominated by hemp, despite the warnings of a visiting Dutch Hemp Project leader not to let it do so.



Frits' niece helped us to locate the Dutch university students researching hemp and our knowledge (and Frits' translation skills) began to improve dramatically. Since then, we have visited the Dutch Hemp Project's pulp researchers and the research farm and hosted two of the top researchers for a whirlwind tour here in 1993.<P>



<H3>The Tasmanian hemp story</H3>

Our achievements, apart from notoriety and positive public education throughout Australia, include three annual licensed trials of low-THC hemp supervised by the University of Tasmania. Frits harvested our 1994 trial between a morning rehearsal and evening orchestral concert with the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra at the end of March. Our bureaucrats are nervous about the venture, but have not yet put a stop to our endeavours, although they suggest that we should walk before we run. In our opininon we have walked for too long: the world can't wait for sensible solutions and our campaign has broadened from hemp for paper to hemp for just about everything! Tasmanian farmers are most interested and the general public is supportive. The only abusive phone call we ever had was from an elderly ex-employee of one of Australia's pulp and paper manufacturers who claimed the Dutch were "decadent"!<P>

 We set up the Tasmanian Hemp Company to help our negotiations with government and business. We had already founded the Hemp for Paper Consortium Incorporated, a small non-profit community association aiming to spread information on the agricultural, industrial and environmental benefits of a hemp industry. I began by submitting a plan to the Tasmanian Government in February 1991 for an environmentally sound pulp mill based on hemp. This was in answer to a call for expressons of interest in a Northern Tasmanian Pulp and Paper Mill. Frits' translations of Dutch research as well as information gathering since 1988 provided the basis for the submission.<P>

The later establishment of the company was seen as a practical example of promoting an industrial approach to hemp, a lead which the consortium had hoped would be taken up by business people in Tasmania. This did not happen, however, mainly through lack of government interest. Considering the enormous obstacles placed in the way of the Hemp for Paper Consortium Incorporated when lobbying for licences to grow hemp, it is little wonder that others have not wanted to venture in.<P>

Our company is the first importer of hemp fabric to Tasmania. We are sewing this into clothes which we sell, to promote products that could be produced from fibre grown here. Our biggest step will be achieving a commercial licence to grow hemp here in Tasmania, for which we began negotiations with the Tasmanian government officials recently.
It is interesting to note that our licence applications now need to go through the Poppy Advisory Board of Tasmania. Tasmania is the only Australian state which grows opium poppies. The poppy officials are nervous of Tasmania's "clean" image being ruined by the media painting Tasmania as the drug state of Australia, were we also to grow hemp. They insist that the low THC content of our crop will not get in the way of a good story.

<H3>Our objectives</H3>

<UL><LI>Long-term: to develop hemp as a new crop and a sustainable industry which will help overcome Australia's problems of soil degradation, pollution from agricultural chemicals, and controversy over the use of native forests.

<LI>  Short-term:<UL><LI> a) to provide organically grown hemp for export to existing markets, 

<LI>b) to set up separating machinery in Tasmania as a first step to down-streaming, so that companies in Tasmania interested in either the bast or core fibre can be supplied (e.g. to replace expensive, imported Kraft pulp; to provide horse bedding), 

<LI>c) to set up a small integrated pulp/paper/textile/fluff mill in Tasmania.</UL></UL><P>

<H2>Tasmanian trials</H2>



During the 1992/93 growing season, the University of Tasmania at Hobart, carried out field trials together with the Tasmanian Hemp Company to investigate the production potential of fibre hemp in Tasmania.<P>

 The dioecious Hungarian cultivar Kompolti was sown in a replicated field experiment at a rate of 50 kg/ha of seed. Sowing dates were November 2, 16 and 30 and the experimental plots were harvested about 4 months later. All crops emerged rapidly within a week of sowing, and full ground cover was reached soon. Weeds were effectively smothered, so no extra control methods were required. No significant pest or disease damage was observed. Irrespective of sowing time, plants started to form inflorescences in the middle of January, which slowed down vegetative growth in favour of reproductive development. Yields were 8.0, 8.4 and 6.1 ton/ha of stem dry matter. Delta-9-THC content was measured in young leaves and female inflorescences several times during the growing season, and it was always well below the legal limit of 0.3 %. If better adapted (i.e. later flowering) varieties were used, yields of 10 to 12 ton/ha of stem dry matter could probably be obtained in Tasmania.<P>

<H2>Australia, Eucalypts and Hemp</H2>



In many countries around the world, the impact of decades of neglect and thoughtless exploitation of the natural environment is beginning to show. Australia is one such country. Despite much rhetoric to the contrary, it remains that our country continues to suffer severe degradation of the land, air and water due to thoughtless agricultural, forest and water management policies.<P>

Australia enjoyed unparalleled prosperity for decades, based on the production of wool and wheat. The agricultural base has broadened to include sugar cane, many fruits and cotton for domestic consumption and export. The fragile soils of the Australian continent were not suitable for chemical methods of farming, neither were they able to withstand the impact of imported domestic cattle and sheep. Intensive herbicide and pesticide dependent cultivation methods lead to high costs and decreasing returns.<P>

One of the most profound problems has been that of water management. Even though Australia has lush tropical rain forests in the north-east, it is the driest continent on earth. Large scale damming of rivers and sinking bores for irrigation have led to severe salination due to evaporation, concentrating trace amounts of salt present in artesian water. This has been compounded by clearing of tree cover. The most shameful aspect of policy here is to allow the clear-felling of old growth forest to be chipped for Kraft paper.<P>

 The roots of Eucalyptus trees reach deep into the subsoil to extract water. After clearing of trees, the water table rises, bringing buried salt to the surface. In some parts of the inland river system thousands of hectares have been permanently lost to a smothering layer of salt. Excess phosphates from chemical fertilizers have entered the waterways. With flow rates seriously reduced by irrigation, the protective flushing effect is lost and there have been several outbreaks of toxic blue green algae.<P>

Fortunately, there have been small improvements. Forward thinking people have formed a "land care" organization to plant trees and practice more sustainable farming. There is a growing movement in Australia to introduce fibre hemp for the production of fabric and paper, as well as developing a ligno-cellulosic ethanol fuel industry. Despite recent developments in Europe and England, where fibre hemp cultivation under licence is in progress, little cultivation is taking place. The legislative power to regulate hemp is held by each state government. Modest progress has been made in Tasmania by the "Hemp for Paper" Consortium.
In New South Wales, the most populous state with the most suitable agricultural land and climate, there has been a complete refusal by the authorities to allow fibre hemp trials, despite the support of Universities, agricultural firms and farmers. Economic projections have indicated that hemp will be a highly profitable crop, provided we can convince the government to follow the United Nations policy on fibre hemp and permit industrial scale trials.<P>

<html><TITLE>Paper from Dutch hemp?</TITLE><body>
<H1>Paper from Dutch hemp?</H1>


<H3>Hayo M. G. van der Werf</H3>
<H4>International Hemp Association, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands</H4>
<HR>
From January 1990 until December 1993, a total of 12 research institutes in the Netherlands spent Dfl 17 million (US $9 million) on a hemp research programme. The objective of this programme was to establish whether fibre hemp can be of economic interest to farmers and to the pulp and paper industry in the Netherlands. The major research disciplines within the programme were: plant breeding, crop physiology, plant pathology, harvest and storage technology, pulp technology, and economics and market research. This research yielded a large amount of factual information, which was recently summarized in two reports in Dutch (Bakker et al. 1993, Van Berlo 1993).<P>

Several researchers who were involved in the Hemp Research Programme will contribute papers on the results they obtained in their field to this and following issues of this Journal. One of the major results of the programme: a business concept, outlining the required specifications for a viable hemp-paper business to be set up in the Netherlands, is summarized in this article (Van Berlo 1993).  
<HR>
<H3>The business concept</H3>
<H4>Pulp markets</H4>
Market research  has shown that both high-value and low-value markets are relevant for fibre hemp grown in the Netherlands. High-value pulp markets consist of applications in Light-Weight Coated paper (LWC), sanitary papers and tissues, and 'fluff', which is used in the production of diapers. In the Netherlands, the size of each of these three markets is about 10,000 ton/year. Low-value pulp markets consist of applications in the production of massive and corrugated cardboard. In the Netherlands, the market for hemp pulp for cardboard production is about 160,000 ton/year. Pulp quality specifications, such as whiteness and purity, are lower for low-value markets than for high-value markets.<P>
The high-value market is the eventual major objective, but initially pulp will be made for the low-value cardboard market, because it does not require top quality specifications. Pulp technology will be gradually optimised, and pulp production for high-value markets will then be possible. First the LWC market will be approached, and finally the sanitary paper, tissue and fluff markets. The low-value market will continue to be served, as the high-value market probably can not absorb all the pulp produced.
Initially, when pulp is produced for low-value markets only, a market price of Dfl 600/ton of pulp is expected. After several years, when pulp will be produced for both high- and low-value markets, a price of Dfl 1,000/ton is possible. <P>

<H4>Hemp production</H4>
A hemp-growers cooperative should be set up by arable farmers in the north-east of the Netherlands. In the first year, the members of this cooperative will grow 2,500 hectares (1 hectare or ha = 2.47 acres) of fibre hemp. Over a period of 6 to 7 years, this area will expand to 11,000 ha and the cooperative will consist of a total of 1,000 to 1,100 farmers. In the crop rotation, hemp will replace cereals. Initially a yield of 10 ton/ha of stem dry matter is expected. After 5 years, improved cultivars will be available and an average stem yield of 12 ton/ha is expected. Initially farmers will get Dfl 130/ton of stem dry matter, this price will increase to Dfl 180/ton as pulp production is geared more to high-value pulp markets. In addition, the European Union (EU) supplies a Dfl 1,700/ha subsidy to hemp growers. The crop is harvested in September by contractors who will use modified silage maize harvesters. The crop is ensiled on the farm and sodium hydroxide is added to the chopped stems for preservation.<P>

Provided the EU maintains its Dfl 1,700/ha subsidy, and if a an average yield of 12 ton/ha at a price of Dfl 180/ton is obtained five years after the start of the project, the farmer's gross margin (financial yield minus direct costs) will be Dfl 2,343/ha. This is more than the gross margin of wheat and less than that of potato.<P>

<H4>Pulp production</H4>
The pulp factory will be set up stepwise. It will start at a production capacity of 20,000 ton/year of pulp. Ensiled hemp will be brought from the farms to the factory and separated into bark and core using a flotation system. Both fractions will be pulped using chemo-mechanical pulp technology. The resulting pulp will meet the requirements of the low-value market. At this scale, pulp technology and waste water treatment technology will be further optimised. 
The size of the factory will then be increased to 40,000 and finally to 90,000 ton/year by adding parallel chemo-mechanical pulp lines. As the pulping process will be more sophisticated, pulps for the high-value markets will be produced. A total investment of Dfl 127 million would be required for a pulp factory producing 90,000 ton/year for both high- and low-value markets.

<H4>Financing</H4>
In order to be economically feasible, the pulp factory should reach a capacity of at least 40,000 ton/year. This would require an investment of Dfl 57 million. Three sources could contribute to this investment:
<UL><LI>a) Shares. Shares are owned by the hemp growers (Dfl 500/ha), other farmer cooperatives, banks and paper factories. Shares should finance 50 % of the total investment.
<LI>b) Subsidies. Subsidies from several sources should supply 25 % of the total investment.
<LI>c) Low-interest loans. These should be supplied by national and regional governments, and make up the remaining 25 % of the total investment.
Based on this financial structure and on the other assumptions outlined above, the shares would yield a return on investment of 16 % with a pay back time of 4.8 years. </UL>

<H4>Feasibility of the business concept
</H4>
A committee, consisting of representatives of farmers, the paper industry, farmers cooperatives and of the provincial and national government, was asked to give its advice on the business plan. This committee concluded that some of the assumptions the business plan relies on are uncertain, which make it impossible to decide on its feasibility. The committee recommends further research to resolve the uncertainties. This research should include setting up a pilot plant producing 1,000-5,000 ton/year of pulp, and growing the hemp required to supply the pilot plant. The pilot plant would allow improvement of the pulp technology and a better estimate of the costs involved. This additional research would take about 2 years and cost Dfl 8-10 million. Currently, funding for this pilot research is being solicited from the paper industry and the national and provincial governments.

<H2>Bioregional Fibres, the potential for a sustainable regional paper and textile industry based on flax and hemp. </H2>



<H3>By S. Riddlestone, P. Desai, M. Evans and A. Skyring.</H3>
<H4> Bioregional Development Group, Sutton Ecology Centre, Honeywood Walk, SM5 3NX Carshalton, Surrey, UK. £33, 130 pp.</H4><HR>

This report, printed on hemp-straw-recycled paper, is a study of the feasibility of reviving the cultivation and processing of flax and hemp as a sustainable industry in south-east England. <P>
The first section of the report provides the background of the study. It explains why the authors think that local production for local needs is required for a sustainable society. The environmental and social problems accompanying the growing of cotton and the need for alternatives to cotton are summarized; the link between paper use and the disappearance of ancient forests is outlined.<P>
The second section starts with an interesting overview of the history of flax and hemp, followed by a review of cultivation and processing of flax and hemp in the 1990s, with particular emphasis on the situation in the European Union. It discusses textile and paper markets in the UK and evaluates the potential of flax and hemp as sustainable alternatives to cotton and wood.<P>
Section three provides details of the expertise and technology available and under development for processing hemp and flax into textiles and paper. It goes into the details of fibre extraction and pulping technologies. The environmental and economic implications of the technologies are discussed.
Sections four and five summarize the main points from the previous sections, build models for a bioregional fibre industry in south-east England and present conclusions and recommendations.
This study makes very interesting reading for all those interested in fibre hemp. It is well written, well documented and very quantitative.  The attitude and approach of this study is nicely illustrated by the following citation from Section II.8, entitled: 'Current and potential uses and markets for hemp': "Much of the information promoted in favour of the revival of hemp comes from the lobby for the legalisation of Cannabis as a recreational drug. Some of these sources are quoted in this section, but our own experience has suggested that in certain instances the case for hemp is overstated. The facts will have to be verified in the field. Nonetheless, hemp is a truly remarkable plant with a myriad of potential uses."<P>
For both flax and hemp the study advocates whole crop utilisation. The highest value line fibre should be processed into textiles, the lower value short fibres (tow) should be pulped to produce high quality paper. The woody core (hurds) can be used for paper, composite boards or heat generation. The study points out that currently, there is no hemp textile industry in western Europe. If hemp is to be revived for textile use, considerable investment in machinery would be required.<P>
In conclusion, this study provides a realistic assesment of the role fibre hemp may play in a more sustainable society. It indicates the potential of the crop, as well as some problems to be resolved. All in all, this publication seems very much worthwhile for those seriously interested in the topic. HvdW.

<H3>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years </H3>



<H4>By Ernest L. Abel</H4>
<H5> 1980. Plenum Press, New York  US $39, 289 pp.</H5>

<B>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years</B> is the single most complete and authorative work on the history of the genus Cannabis. Abel presents his thorough and unbiased investigation of the history of drug Cannabis, as well as the even more ancient uses of Cannabis hemp as a source of edible seed and fiber for the manufacture of paper, rope, and textiles.<P>
The detailed explanations of the spread of hashish by the Arabs, and the introduction of hemp to the New World by European colonists, provide fascinating reading for historians and Cannabis aficionados alike. The section presenting the relationship between hemp and slavery is particularly enlightening. Abel describes the strategic importance of supplies of high quality hemp, especially for naval rigging. The Romans, Venetians, Portuguese, Dutch, and English all used the power of hemp to exert their naval might and build trade routes to the world's corners.<P>
Abel's sources span a wide range of disciplines, and are well referenced in an extensive bibliography. A detailed index allows ready access to the many facts contained in the text.<P>
No Cannabis researchers, nor botanical libraries, could possibly consider their collections complete without including the extensive knowledge contained in <B>Marijuana, the first twelve thousand years</B>.

<H1>Interview</H1>
<H2>Professor Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, the discoverer of THC</H2> 
<HR>
Although research into the psychoactive components of Cannabis began before the start of this century, it was not until 1964 that Dr. Raphael Mechoulam, of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the most active compound. Mechoulam's discovery led to a lot of research into other natural and synthetic cannabinoids. In recent years many exciting discoveries were made. In 1990 the cannabinoid receptor, the "lock" into which cannabinoids fit, activating the specific biochemical events, was discovered. This of course intensified the search for the cannabinoid-like brain molecule that binds to the cannabinoid receptor. In 1992 William Devane and Raphael Mechoulam identified a natural brain molecule that binds to the cannabinoid receptor. They called it anandamide, from the Sanskrit word for "eternal bliss". While the substance mimics the action of THC, interestingly, it doesn't look anything like it. Additional natural anandamides have since been found and it is specula
ted that a family of receptors may exist. 
One thing is certain: the pace of cannabinoid research has picked up and the field is entering a new and exciting era! An exclusive interview (June 17 1994) with the man who has been in the forefront of Cannabis research for the last thirty years: Professor Raphael Mechoulam.<HR>

<B>David Pate:</B> Can you describe anandamide, its possible function in the brain and where its discovery leads us?<P>
<B>Raphael Mechoulam:</B> It has been known since 1988 that THC acts on a specific receptor in the brain. This specific receptor obviously was not built by the brain just for the sake of tetrahydrocannabinol - a compound present in a plant - which is of course foreign to the receptor. Presumably the receptor is present because it has a function, which has nothing to do with a plant constituent. We considered that possibly this particular receptor is activated by a compound found in the brain itself. We succeeded 2 years ago to identify such a compound in pig brain. We called it anandamide. It binds to this cannabinoid receptor. Anandamide differs completely from THC in its structure. THC is an aromatic compound, while anandamide is a fatty acid derivative. It also has a nitrogen atom in it, which is rather unusual for fatty acid derivatives.<P>
 
<B>DP:</B> Any speculation as to why it is there, what it actually does, both the receptor and its ligand?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We know that the cannabinoid receptor system is involved in sedation; at high doses THC can even cause catalepsy in animals. In humans we know that Cannabis has a lot of effects which together cause the well known "high".  These also include memory effects and some effects on movement. Most of the effects caused by THC are also seen with anandamide in animals. Anandamide has not yet been given to humans but judging from the animal effects these two compounds seem to parallel each other in activity. Whatever THC does, anandamide does as well.<P>

<B>DP: </B>What is the role of anandamides in the brain?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Anandamides and the receptor are found in areas of the brain which have to do with the coordination of movement, with memory and with emotions. We assume that the brain has anandamides and the receptors to participate in the regulation of movement and to participate in memory and emotions. But there is no proof that this is indeed the case, it is a circumstantial evidence.<P>
<B>DP:</B> Since three natural anandamides have been found, how broad do you think the family is? Are there multiple types of receptors?<P>


<B>RM:</B> The three anandamides which are known bind to the same receptor. They are actually a family of closely related compounds. This is well known with other fatty acid derivatives in the body which also appear in large families of closely related substances, such as prostaglandins and the leukotriens. The three  anandamides so far known seem to have the same biological activity, but once we know more about how and what they do we may find small differences. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Are there families of receptors as well?<P>

<B>RM:</B> This is another point. In the brain, so far, just one receptor has been found. However, a second receptor has been found in the spleen, it is related chemically to the brain receptor and anandamide binds to both the central receptor (in the brain) and to the peripheral receptor (in the spleen). Anandamide has not been found so far in the periphery, so chances are that the fact that it binds to the receptor in the spleen is just because the structures of the two receptors are somewhat close. Maybe the brain transmits the brain mediator. The peripheral receptor seems to have its own endogenous ligands. As a matter of fact we have found an endogenous compound in the gut which binds to both the central and peripheral receptors. We are working on it at the moment and have not published its structure or function. I think that the peripheral receptor has to do with the immune system as it is well known that THC affects this system. At present however this is just a speculation.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Can you further speculate on what triggers production of anandamides naturally and whether they are degraded by an enzyme system like the cannabinoids?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Incidentally, also in answer to your previous question, the peripheral receptor is found in the spleen, but there is also a receptor in the testis, we do not know whether it is the peripheral or the central receptor and we know that THC and anandamides act on the sperm. There is a paper in publication in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that both THC and anandamides act on activation of the sperm before it fertilizes the egg. So it is involved, whether that is relevant or not, I don't know. <P>
We do not know what triggers the production of anandamides. Inciden-tally, Bill Devane and J. Axelrod at NIH have now found an enzyme which synthesizes anandamide in the brain from arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. The anandamides are labile compounds and they are degraded by an enzyme - an amidase. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Are there interactions between the cannabinoid receptor and other receptors or receptor systems?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Most definitely. The cannabinoids (and presumably the anandamides) like most mediators in the body interact with other systems: the dopaminergic, the adrenergic, the opiate systems etc. For example we have found that when anandamides are injected into the brain the concentration of cortical steroids goes up. There are indications that the cortical steroids themselves may act on the cannabinoid receptor, presumably bringing down its activity.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Were you surprised that anandamide was the structure it was and not a protein?<P>

<B>RM:</B> No, there is no reason why it should be a protein. As a matter of fact, we thought originally that anandamide should be a lipid-soluble compound, because the cannabinoids are lipid-soluble, and therefore chances were that the compound in the body will be lipid-soluble and it turned out to be a fatty acid.<P>

<B>DP:</B> How do cannabinoids and anandamides happen to fit into the same receptor, considering their structures are quite different?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We assume that in space and in distribution of electronic charges the anandamides and the cannabinoids take up the same kind of structure. A few groups are using models to calculate the electronic densities and the structures of both types of compounds in space and to compare them. However, as yet no definite answer has been provided.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Are the relative affinities of cannabinoids and anandamides and their receptors about the same?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Anandamides and THC have more or less the same affinity for the receptor. There are synthetic cannabinoids which are a hundred and maybe a thousand times more active than THC. But that is irrelevant, THC and anandamide are not very potent, but then the body does not want very potent compounds. It wants compounds with intermediate potency, because if the potency is very high and there is a chance increase of the compound the body will go into stress. Changes in the body are usually gradual so one does not need very active compounds in the body. This is of course a generalization which does not aply to all body constituents as there are some compounds present in the body which act at extremely low concentrations.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Do you think there is sufficient research into cannabinoids and will cannabinoids play a significant role in the future of therapeutic medicine? If so, for what indications?<P>

<B>RM:</B> After the identification of delta-9-THC as the active component of Cannabis there was a huge wave of research in chemistry, pharmacology and clinical aspects dealing with this plant constituent. Many thousands of papers were published on it. By the late 1970s research started slowing down as the mode of action was not clear at all. With the discovery of receptors and of endogenous ligands interest has very much increased and numerous new laboratories are working on various aspects. We can expect in the future clarification of many of the problems associated with cannabinoid activity and possibly advances in the field of therapeutics. So far the only cannabinoid which has been legalized is THC for use in cases of vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy. THC has also been used for a few other things like appetite stimulation (in cases of AIDS) as well as in glaucoma. There is also illegal use in some  neurological diseases such as spasticity in multiple sclerosis and even in asthma. In the past several companies worked on synthetic cannabinoids as analgetics or in reduction of blood pressure but these projects were terminated. The synthetic compounds produced still caused psychotropic effects which were unacceptable. In the last few years we have synthesized and widely tested a cannabinoid, HU-211, which causes none of the typical psychotropic cannabinoid effects but is a blocker of the action of the stimulatory transmitter glutamic acid, in particular on one of its subreceptors named NMDA. This receptor is involved in stimulatory activity. However, during trauma it causes excessive opening of ion channels in many cells in the vicinity of the trauma. This introduces large amounts of calcium ions into the cells and they may die. Blocking this activity is of considerable potential importance in cases of trauma and possibly stroke, and a company with which we are associated is developing HU-211 as an anti-trauma agent. We expect to start human testing within a few months.The discovery of anandamide has apparently stimulated interest in several pharmaceutical companies. I am aware of a Japanese company which is working in the field as well as a French one. Apparently the French company has discovered an antagonist to anandamide - the first ever described antagonist in the cannabinoid series. They are about to present it at a forthcoming meeting.<P>

<B> DP:</B> Do you see the very limited use of cannabinoids in medicine as the result of their intrinsic medicinal value or as the result of the restrictions surrounding them?<P>

<B>RM:</B> In the past most companies  refrained from working on cannabinoids mostly  because of the legal restrictions. It seems reasonable to expect that as at the moment there are no such legal restrictions concerning anandamides it will be easier for companies to start projects in this field. I expect that such research projects will be mostly in the neurological area and possibly in inflammation research and immunology. This assumption is based on the high concentrations of the cannabinoid receptor in the basal ganglia - an area involved in coordination of movement and the peripheral receptor being in the spleen - an organ of immune importance.  <P>

<B>DP:</B> Do you think new delivery systems would help cannabinoid therapeutics gain more acceptance?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Definitely. One delivery system which has not been investigated is the aerosol system. People smoke cannabinoids, this is the best way of getting them into the body, and getting them to act fast. And in asthma for example, THC is known to be a bronchodilator. So if people want to use a compound against asthma, obviously they will prefer inhalation rather than any other way and very little work has been done in this area. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Was THC patentable at the time of your discovery? Why didn't you patent its synthesis?<P>

<B>RM:</B> We didn't patent THC as it was of no apparent medical use. One cannot patent compounds which have no practical use. <P>

<B>DP:</B> I'm thinking now of the Unimed use of this as a pharmaceutical.<P>

<B>RM:</B> We didn't patent the synthesis either. I had asked my university authorities about this and they decided against it. There was no apparent practical use of THC or its synthesis. On the other hand we should have patented the major cannabinoid metabolite - THC-11-oic-acid which we identified and synthesized in 1972. This acid stays in the body for a very long time and most tests of cannabinoid use look for the presence of this acid rather than for THC itself. Numerous radio immuno assays are based on this acid  and we realize now that it was foolish not to patent it.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is this approach basically a reflection of your background, which is academic rather than industrial?<P>

<B>RM: </B>Yes, now we patent quite a few things, we patented HU-211 and that's why a company was willing to take it over. We now patent quite a few more compounds, but at that time we didn't and it is a pity, and the university lost a lot of money.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is there any relatively unknown  or unusual Cannabis research, past or present, that deserves a wider mention?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Well, if you look at what is going on now, there is a huge amount of research going in all kind of directions. For example, groups working on the immune system may be using the receptor in the spleen. Research goes into subjects like emotions, asking why does Cannabis do what it does? People are looking into schizofrenia and finding some unusual things, some relationship between cannabinoids and schizofrenia, I think it has to do with the receptor. Even though all these things are not well defined, I am under the impression that there is a burst of research in many directions. Where that will lead I don't know. I think that the most promising approach is to look into neurological problems, coordination of movement and things of that sort.<P>

<B>DP:</B> So the cannabinoids serve less as prototypes for drugs per se, but rather as probes of the systems, which other drugs may be later able to affect.<P>

<B>RM:</B> Many if not most drugs used today are really structural modifications of natural products, be they plant products of known therapeutic value, or hormones, or transmitters. In most cases the new drugs have less side effects than the natural product. I expect that this is going to happen with the cannabinoids and anandamides. Academic and industrial research groups will probably try to modify these molecules in order to minimize the side effects as well as to make the compounds more specific. This is what we did with HU-211 and this is probably going to be done with these compounds in other fields as well.<P>

<B>DP:</B> Is there anything else you may want to add to any of the previous questions?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Research in the last 20 years has shown that Cannabis differs from most other illicit drugs - it is not a major addictive agent and it seems to act through mechanisms which are quite different from those of the opiates and cocaine.  Hence investigations in this field may lead us into understanding of very basic problems in biology such as memory and emotions. There are few tools for work in these areas and any additional one may be of great importance. The National Institute of Drug Abuse of the USA which is the major granting agency in the field of drug abuse is looking into cannabinoids with great interest now and this will be of considerable help. I would like to mention that the United Nations which has a huge budget devoted to drug abuse prevention does not support research at all. This is a strange situation and probably reflects the background of the officials dealing with drug abuse at the UN level. They view drug abuse as a social problem with little value of research for the solution of this problem. Too bad. <P>

<B>DP:</B> Would you say that the perceptions are changing as cannabinoids are seen less as a source of problems and more as a source of opportunity for exploration?<P>

<B>RM:</B> Right, you just put it down very well.<P>
<B>DP:</B> Sorry, I didn't want to put words in your mouth.<P>
<B>RM:</B> No, no, you just said it.<P>

"In 1824, domestic hemp was pitted against Russian hemp by rigging the USS Constitution on one side with 
American and the other with Russian grown hemp, 'and after being thus worn for nearly a year, it was found, 
on examination, that the Russian rope, in every instance, after being much worn, looked better and wore more 
equally and evenly than the American.' But the commander said, 'the difference between them was not so 
great as to warrant a declaration that the proof was conclusive in favor of the Russian....'"<br>

"The Federal Government in 1841 authorized a bounty, which allowed for the payment of not more than $280 
per ton for American water-retted hemp, provided it was suitable for naval cordage. Many of the planters 
prepared large pools and water-retted the hemp they produced. But the work was so hard on Negroes that the 
practice was abandoned. Many Negroes died of pneumonia contracted from working in the hemp-pools in the 
winter, and the mortality became so great among hemp hands that the increase in value of the hemp did not 
equal the loss in Negroes." <br>

"Several [varieties of hemp] are grown in this country, that cultivated in Kentucky and having a hollow stem, 
being the most common. China hemp, with slender stems, growing very erect, has a wide range of culture. 
Smyrna hemp is adapted to cultivation over a still wider range and Japanese hemp is beginning to be 
cultivated, particularly in California, where it reaches a height of 15 feet.  Russian and Italian seed have been 
experimented with, but the former produces a short stalk, while the latter only grows to a medium height. A 
small quantity of Piedmontese hemp seed from Italy was distributed by the Department in 1893, having been 
received through the Chicago Exposition...." <br>

"In Nebraska, where the [hemp] industry is being established, a new and important step has been taken in 
cutting the crop with an ordinary mowing machine. A simple attachment which bends the stalks over in the 
direction in which the machine is going facilitates the cutting...The cost of cutting hemp in this manner is 50 
cents per acre, as compared with $3 to $4 per acre, the rates paid for cutting by hand in Kentucky."  <br>

"The most important fact to be recorded in connection with the hemp industry during the past year is the 
successful operation of a machine brake in the fields of Kentucky. This machine breaks the retted stalks and 
cleans the fiber, producing clean, straight fiber equal to the best grades prepared on hand brakes, and it has a 
capacity of 1000 pounds or more of clean fiber per hour.  So far as we have any record, this is the first 
machine having sufficient capacity to be commercially practical that has cleaned bast fiber in an entirely 
satisfactory manner." <br>

"When the work with hemp was begun in Wisconsin, there were no satisfactory machines for harvesting, 
spreading, binding, or breaking. All of these processes were performed by hand. Due to such methods, the 
hemp industry in the United States had all but disappeared.  As it was realized from the very beginning of the 
work in Wisconsin that no permanent progress could be made so long as it was necessary to depend upon 
hand labor, immediate attention was given to solving the problem of power machinery. Nearly every kind of 
hemp machine was studied and tested. The obstacles were great, but through the cooperation of experienced 
hemp men and one large harvesting machinery company, this problem has been nearly solved. The hemp crop 
can now be handled entirely by machinery." <br>

"The organized hemp growers of Wisconsin, working in cooperation with the field agent of fiber 
investigations [Andrew Wright], have so improved the quality and standardized the grades of hemp fiber 
produced there that it has found a market even in dull times. The hemp acreage in that State has been kept up,

"Early maturing varieties, chiefly of Italian origin, are being grown at Madison, Wisconsin, in cooperation

"The work of breeding improved strains of hemp is being continued at Arlington Farm, Va., and all previous 
records were broken in the selection plats of 1919.  The three best strains, Kymington, Chington and 
Tochimington, averaged, respectively, 14 feet 11 inches, 15 feet 5 inches, and 15 feet 9 inches, while the 
tallest individual plant was 19 feet. The improvement by selection is shown not alone in increased height but 
also in longer internodes, yielding fiber of better quality and increased quantity." <br>

"In 1929 three selected varieties of hemp (Michigan Early, Chinamington and Simple Leaf) were grown in 
comparison with unselected common Kentucky seed near Juneau, Wis. Each of the varieties had been 
developed by 10 years or more of selection from the progeny of individual plants. The yields of fiber per acre 
were as follows: Simple Leaf, 360 pounds; Michigan Early, 694 pounds; Chinamington, 1054 pounds; 
common Kentucky, 680 pounds." <br>

"The hemp breeding work, carried on by the Bureau for more than 20 years, was discontinued in 1933, but 
practical results are still evident in commercial fields. A hemp grower in Kentucky reported a yield of 1750 
pounds per acre of clean, dew-retted fiber from 100 acres of the pedigreed variety Chinamington grown in 
1934. This is more than twice the average yield obtained from ordinary unselected hemp seed." <br>

<H4>March 30, 1943 </H4>
The New Deal Bureaucrats and their fellow "dollar a year" fiber racketeers of the War Production Board are 
now offering Hemp Marijuana (dope) narcotic to the American people instead of increased food production. 
The American people are footing the bill. <P>
In one of the most dastardly propositions ever "cooked" up the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the War 
Production Board are manipulating the proposition of a promotion and scheme to grow and produce hemp 
from a plant, outlawed by law, that is the fount of the insiduous [sic] drug known as Marijuana, the worst and 
most serious source of all (dope) narcotic evils afflicting children, in the schools and outside, and grown-ups 
alike in all walks of life. The fiber itself from this plant is worthless. The seeds from this plant fly far and wide. 
The resultant wild growth becomes dangerously uncontrollable. In the face of shortage and scarcity of labor, 
foodstuffs, linseed oil, fibers and other critical materials which are peculiarly being denied us, these corruptors
 [sic] of American life are now engaged in the promoting of 350,000 acres, erecting 100 buildings and building 
a large volume of equipment and machinery in a number of Mid-Western States for the production of this narcotic
 (dope) plant product, all of which must reach the staggering cost of $500,000,000 and end in catastrophic
 failure. A number of land-
grant educational institutions are in on this racket. The Commodity Credit Corporation and the War 
Production Board and the Defense Plant Corporation, through their own created socalled [sic] "War Hemp 
Industries, Inc., Agency," something new in the New Deal bureaucratic set-up, are running this (dope) 
narcotic show with private racketeers as undercover men. Large profits have been made already by them on 
the seeds by cheating and gipping [sic] the government. The financial "kill" is figured to be colossal for all the 
participants. The kill to agriculture, industry, (the choicest and most fertile land or soils are being demanded) 
and health and welfare of the American people is going to reach disastrous proportions from which recovery 
may never be found possible. Congressman Hampton P. Fulmer, Chairman, Agricultural Committee, and 
Congressman Paul Brown, overseeing the Commodity Credit Corporation, and certain other members of the 
Congress, among them Senators Harry S. Truman and Scott W. Lucas, and Donald 
M. Nelson, Chairman, War Production Board, and John R. Hutson, President of the government Commodity 
Credit Corporation, Agricultural Adjustment Administration, etc. (the latter active participant) are acquainted 
with the facts as are being described here and have been presented to them in detail. The power-pressure of 
the participants in this narcotic (dope) racket is obviously superior to the best interests of the American people 
even during these dangerous times of their sacrifices and sufferings at home and on the battle front. The truth 
of the above report is vouched for. Do you want this (dope) narcotic in your community? You are lined up for 
it. It is to be noted that increased acreage for guayule rubber has been stopped because of the acute food 
shortages but though rubber scarcities exist yet. <P>

NOTE:---This whole hemp marijuana racket will be dumped out of existence right after the war is over in 
accordance to with [sic] a statement from Washington, D.C., but obviously not before the "kill" in taxpayers' 
money has been made and the narcotic has been spread to dope them. <br>

<H3>Clean hemp pulp technology</H3>

<P>
At the Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute (UPPRI) a new  ammonia-sulfite-alcohol drip percolation pulping technology has been developed on laboratory scale. Current pulping technology for bast fibre crops such as hemp and kenaf requires the separation of the stems into bast and core. The processes of removal, storage and utilisation of the core involve environmental and technical problems which had not been solved so far. The pulping of the bast encounters problems associated with the tendency of its long fibres to twist. 

The new drip percolation technology makes it possible to process the whole hemp stem into pulp. Costs for capital, energy and labour are less than with current technologies and environmental pollution is strongly reduced.<P>

The UPPRI wants to set up a pilot plant with a capacity of 7 ton/day of air dried pulp to further develop and optimize the new technology. The project will be partially financed from the institute's budget. The UPPRI is looking for parties interested in this project. A more detailed proposal is available at the IHA, or inquiries can be made to The Ukranian Pulp and Paper Research Institute: 18/7 Kutuzovstreet, Kiev 252133, Ukraine. <P>

<H3> Marijuana and driving ability</H3>
After alcohol, Cannabis is the drug which is found most often in the blood of drivers involved in road accidents. The effects of THC, the major psychoactive component of Cannabis, on driving ability have been investigated by Dr. H.W.J. Robbe at the Institute of Human Psychopharmacology of the University of Limburg in Maastricht, The Netherlands.<P>

In his PhD thesis, "Influence of Marijuana on Driving" (available through the IHA), which  Robbe defended on May 26, he concludes that marijuana is not a safe drug in traffic. After using marijuana drivers were less able to drive in a straight line. However, compared to the effects of alcohol and many medicines (antidepressants and sedatives) on driving ability, the effects of marijuana are not exceptional.<P>

The use of a moderate amount of marijuana did not affect driving ability, but the drivers thought their ability had been negatively affected. The use of a moderate amount of alcohol had a negative effect on driving ability, while the drivers thought their performance had not been affected.  The use of alcohol seems to stimulate risky behaviour, whereas the use of marijuana leads to a more prudent driving style. <P>
<HR>
<H3>Higher yields from late hemp</H3>
By growing very late-flowering  cultivars at a relatively low plant density, fibre hemp yields can be much higher than when using conventional cultivation techniques. This is the main practical conclusion from the research on fibre hemp conducted by Dr. H.M.G. van der Werf at the Research Institute for Agrobiology and Soil Fertility and the Agricultural University in Wageningen, The Netherlands.
<P>
In his PhD thesis, "Crop physiology of fibre hemp" (available through the IHA), which van der Werf defended on June 30, he concludes fibre hemp may be an interesting new crop. Traditionally fibre hemp is sown very densely (300-400 plants/m2), and harvested in August. By using late-flowering hemp cultivars and harvesting these at the end of September the growing season is longer and yields can be increased by about 30 %. <P>
Such late high-yielding hemp crops are not compatible with the traditional high plant density. As a result of severe inter-plant competition, many plants die during August and September in these late crops ("self-thinning"). As a consequence of the occurrence of self-thinning, in fibre hemp optimum plant density is lower when the yield is higher.

<p>The production of cannabinoids and their associated terpenes
in <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to environmental influences as
well as hereditary determinants. Their biosynthesis occurs in
specialized glands populating the surface of all aerial
structures of the plant. These compounds apparently serve as
defensive agents in a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial,
antifeedant and UV-B pigmentation roles. In addition, the more
intense ambient UV-B of the tropics, in combination with the UV-B
lability of cannabidiol, may have influenced the evolution of an
alternative biogenetic route from cannabigerol to
tetrahydrocannabinol in some varieties. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<em>

<p>Cannabis</em> may have been the first cultivated plant.
Records indicate use of this crop for paper, textiles, food and
medicine throughout human history (Abel 1980). It is a dioecious
annual with rather distinctive palmate leaves, usually composed
of an odd number of leaflets. Best growth occurs on recently
disturbed sites of high soil nitrogen content, so it is commonly
found as a persistent weed at the edge of cultivated fields.
Mature height ranges from 1 to 5 meters, according to
environmental and hereditary dictates. Typically, the male plant
is somewhat taller and more obviously flowered. These flowers
have five yellowish tepals, and five anthers that hang
pendulously at maturity, dispersing their pollen to the wind. The
female plant exhibits a more robust appearance due to its shorter
branches and dense growth of leaves and flower-associated bracts.
Its double-styled flower possesses only a thin, closely adherent
perianth, but is further protected by enclosure in a cuplike
bracteole (i.e., perigonal bract), subtended by a usually
monophyllous leaflet. A single achene is produced per flower and
shed or dispersed as a result of bird predation. The life cycle
of the male is completed soon after anthesis, but the female
survives until full seed ripeness. </p>

<p><em>Cannabis</em> seems a virtual factory for the production
of secondary metabolic compounds. A variety of alkanes have been
identified (Adams, Jr. and Jones 1973, De Zeeuw <em>et al.</em>
1973b, Mobarak <em>et al.</em> 1974a &amp; 1974b), as well as
nitrogenous compounds (ElSohly and Turner 1976, Hanus 1975b),
flavonoids (Gellert <em>et al.</em> 1974, Paris <em>et al.</em>
1975b, Paris and Paris 1973) and other miscellaneous compounds
(Hanus 1976a &amp; 1976b). Terpenes appear in abundance (Hanus
1975a, Hendricks <em>et al.</em> 1975) and contribute to the
characteristic odor of the plant (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973) and
some of its crude preparations, such as hashish. The compounds
which comprise the active drug ingredients are apparently unique
to this genus and are termed cannabinoids. Cannabinoids were
originally thought to exist as the phenolic compounds, but later
research (Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971a, Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Small and Beckstead 1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b) has
indicated their existence predominantly in the form of carboxylic
acids which decarboxylate readily with time (Masoud and Doorenbos
1973, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973b), upon heating (De Zeeuw <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Kimura and Okamoto 1970) or in alkaline
conditions (Grlic and Andrec 1961, Masoud and Doorenboos 1973).
There are over 60 of these type compounds present in the plant
(Turner <em>et al.</em> 1980). </p>

<p>Much has been published concerning the influence of heredity
on cannabinoid production (e.g., Fetterman <em>et al.</em> 1971b,
Small and Beckstead 1973), but ecological factors have long been
thought to have an important influence by stressing the <em>Cannabis</em>
plant (Bouquet 1950). The resultant increased biosynthesis of the
cannabinoid and terpene containing resin, in most cases, seems
likely of advantage to the organism in adapting it to a variety
of survival-threatening situations. This work reviews these
biotic and abiotic challenges and speculates on the utility of <em>Cannabis</em>
resin to the plant. </p>

<h3>Anatomical distribution and biogenesis of the cannabinoids</h3>

<p>The major sites of cannabinoid production appear to be
epidermal glands (Fairbairn 1972, Hammond and Mahlberg 1973,
Lanyon <em>et al.</em> 1981, Malingre <em>et al.</em> 1975) which
exhibit a marked variation in size, shape and population density,
depending on the anatomical locale examined. While there are no
published reports of glands present on root surfaces, most of the
aerial parts possess them, along with non-glandular trichomes (De
Pasquale <em>et al.</em> 1974). These epidermal glands seem to
fall into two broad categories: stalked and sessile. The stalked
gland (Fig. 1, front page) can consist of a single cell or small
group of cells arranged in a rosette on a single or multicellular
pedestal. Lack of thorough ontogenetic study has led to the
speculation that some of this variation may be attributable to
observation of various developmental stages (Ledbetter and
Krikorian 1975). The sessile gland possesses no stalk and has
secretory cells located at or below the epidermal surface
(Fairbairn 1972). In either case, the glandular cells are covered
with a &quot;sheath&quot; under which the resins are secreted via
vesicles (Mahlberg and Kim 1992). This sheath consists of a
cuticle that coats a polysaccharide layer (presumed cellulose)
originating from the primary cell wall (Hammond and Mahlberg
1978). The resins accumulate until the sheath bulges away from
the secretory cells, forming a spheroid structure. The resin is
then released by rupture of the membrane or through pores in its
surface (De Pasquale 1974). The cannabinoid content of each plant
part varies, paralleling observable gland distribution (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp; 1971b, Kimura
and Okamoto 1970, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971, Ono <em>et al.</em>
1972), although Turner <em>et al.</em> (1978) have disagreed.
Roots contain only trace amounts. Stalks, branches and twigs have
greater quantities, although not as much as leaf material.
Vegetative leaf contains varying quantities depending on its
position on the plant: lower leaves possessing less and upper
ones more. Leaf glands are most dense on the abaxial (underside)
surface. The greatest amount of cannabinoids is found in the new
growth near each apical tip (Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Steinberg <em>et
al.</em> 1975), although Ono <em>et al.</em> (1972) seem to
differ on this point. This variation in leaf gland placement may
be due to either loss of glands as the leaf matures or a greater
the endowment of glands on leaves successively produced as the
plant matures. Additional study on this point is required. </p>

<p>Once sexual differentiation has occurred, the generation of
female reproductive organs and their associated bracts increases
total plant cannabinoid content. Bracts subtending the female
flowers contain a greater density of glands than the leaves. The
small cuplike bracteole (perigonal bract) enclosing the pistil
has the highest cannabinoid content of any single plant part
(Kimura and Okamoto 1970, Honma <em>et al.</em> 1971a &amp;
1971b). Second only to this is the flower itself (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b). Since it has no reported epidermal gland
structures, the cannabinoids present must be due to either
undiscovered production sites or simple adherence of resin from
the inner surface of its intimately associated bracteole. This
conjecture is supported by the finding that the achenes do not
contain substantial amounts of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et
al.</em> 1971b, Ono <em>et al.</em> 1972). Reproductive
structures of the male plant are also provided with greater
concentrations of the cannabinoids (Fetterman <em>et al.</em>
1971b, Ohlsson <em>et al.</em> 1971). Stalked glands have been
observed covering the tepal, with massively stalked glands
occurring on the stamen filament (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976). In
addition, rows of very large sessile glands are found situated in
grooves on the anther itself (Dayanadan and Kaufman 1976,
Fairbairn 1972) and apparently provide the pollen with a
considerable cannabinoid content (Paris <em>et al.</em> 1975a). </p>

<p><em>Delta</em>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the cannabinoid
responsible for the main psychoactive effects of most <em>Cannabis</em>
drug preparations (Mechoulam 1970). In some varieties of <em>Cannabis</em>,
additional cannabinoid homologs appear that have the usual pentyl
group attached to the aromatic ring, replaced by a propyl (De
Zeeuw <em>et al.</em> 1972b &amp; 1973a, Fetterman and Turner
1972, Gill 1971, Gill <em>et al.</em> 1970, Merkus 1971, Vree <em>et
al.</em> 1972a, Turner <em>et al.</em> 1973a) or occasionally a
methyl group (Vree <em>et al.</em> 1971 &amp; 1972b). Other
claims have been made for butyl (Harvey 1976) or heptyl (Isbell
1973) substitutions, but the latter announcement seems
particularly tenuous. THC is thought to be produced by the plant
(Fig. 2, next page) from cannabidiol (CBD) which, in turn, is
derived from cannabigerol (CBG) generated from non-cannabinoid
precursors (Hammond and Mahlberg 1994, Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1984, Turner and Mahlberg 1988). CBG is also the biogenetic
precursor of cannabichromene (CBC). Some of the cannabinoids
(e.g., cannabielsoin, cannabinol, and cannabicyclol) are probably
degradation products of the enzymatically produced cannabinoids
(e.g., CBD, THC and CBC, respectively). </p>

(THC). </p>

<h2>Cannabinoids and environmental stress</h2>

<h3>Desiccation</h3>

<p>THC is a viscous hydrophobic oil (Garrett and Hunt 1974) that
resists crystallization (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1971) and is of low
volatility (Adams <em>et al.</em> 1941). Since the sticky resins
produced and exuded on the surface of the plant are varying
combinations of THC, other cannabinoids and a variety of
terpenes, they can be seen as analogous to the waxy coatings of
the cacti and other succulents that serve as a barrier to water
loss in dry environments. </p>

<p>Bouquet (1950) has mentioned that the western side of
Lebanon's mountainous <em>Cannabis</em> growing areas is less
favorable for resin production because of humid sea winds. De
Faubert Maunder (1976) also observed that the copious separable
resin needed for hashish production occurs only &quot;in a belt
passing from Morocco eastwards, taking in the Mediterranean area,
Arabia, the Indian sub-continent and ending in Indo-China.&quot;
These are mostly areas notable for their sparse rainfall, low
humidity and sunny climate. Is it merely coincidence that resin
is produced according to this pattern, as well? </p>

<p>Experimental evidence is accumulating that reinforces these
notions. Sharma (1975) reported a greater glandular trichome
density on leaves of <em>Cannabis</em> growing in xeric
circumstances. Paris <em>et al.</em> (1975a) have demonstrated a
marked increase in the cannabinoid content of <em>Cannabis</em>
pollen with decreased humidity. Murari <em>et al.</em> (1983)
grew a range of <em>Cannabis</em> fiber cultivars in three
climatic zones of Italy and found higher THC levels in those
plants grown in the drier &quot;continental&quot; (<em>versus</em>
&quot;maritime&quot;) climate. Hakim <em>et al.</em> (1986)
report that CBD-rich English <em>Cannabis</em> devoid of THC
produced significant amounts of THC and less CBD, when grown in
the Sudan. This trend was accentuated in their next generation of
plants. </p>

<p>Haney and Kutscheid (1973) have shown significant correlations
of plant cannabinoid content with factors affecting soil moisture
availability: content of clay or sand, percent slope of plot, and
competition from surrounding vegetation. In some cases, this last
factor was noted to have induced a stunted plant with
&quot;disproportionally smaller roots&quot;, which would tend to
increase both the frequency and severity of desiccation stress. </p>

<p>In a study of 10 Kansas locations, Latta and Eaton (1975)
found wide differences in plant cannabinoid content, observing
that &quot;<em>delta</em>-9-THC ranged from 0.012 to 0.49% and
generally increased as locations became less favorable for plant
growth, suggesting increased plant stress enhanced <em>delta</em>-9-THC
production.&quot; Mention was also made of a positive correlation
between competing vegetation and THC content. Although the
sampling area was not considered very moisture deficient, they
speculated that &quot;Greater difference among locations might
have been observed under drought conditions.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature </h3>

<p>Temperature may play a role in determining cannabinoid
content, but perhaps only through its association with moisture
availability. Boucher <em>et al.</em> (1974) reported an increase
in cannabinoid content with temperature (32o C. <em>vs.</em> 22o
C.), however, some variables such as increased water loss due to
accelerated evaporation and plant transpiration at high
temperatures were left unaccounted. In contrast, Bazzaz <em>et
al.</em> (1975), using 4 <em>Cannabis</em> ecotypes of both
tropical and temperate character, demonstrated a definite
decrease in cannabinoid production with increased temperature
(32o C. <em>vs.</em> 23o C.). Later studies by Braut-Boucher
(1980) on clones of 2 strains from South Africa revealed a more
complex pattern of biosynthesis according to strain, gender and
chemical homologue produced. Clearly, further study of this
parameter is needed. </p>

<h3>Soil Nutrients</h3>

<p>Mineral balance seems to influence cannabinoid production.
Krejci (1970) found increases related to unspecified &quot;poor
soil conditions&quot;. Haney and Kutcheid (1973) have shown the
influence of soil K, P, Ca and N concentrations on Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>.
They report a distinctly negative correlation between soil K and
plant <em>delta</em>-9-THC content, although K-P interaction, N
and Ca were positively correlated with it. These minerals were
also shown to affect the production of CBD, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and cannabinol (CBN), although the latter two compounds are now
thought to be spontaneous degradation products of <em>delta</em>-9-THC.
Kaneshima <em>et al.</em> (1973) have demonstrated the importance
of optimal Fe levels for plant synthesis of THC. Latta and Eaton
(1975) reported Mg and Fe to be important for THC production,
suggesting that these minerals may serve as enzyme co-factors.
Coffman and Gentner (1975) also corroborated the importance of
soil type and mineral content, and observed a significant
negative correlation between plant height at harvest and THC
levels. Interestingly, Marshman <em>et al.</em> (1976) report
greater amounts of THC in Jamaican plants growing in
&quot;organically&quot; enriched (<em>vs.</em> artificially
fertilized) soils. </p>

<h3>Insect predation</h3>

<p>Wounding of the plant has been employed as a method to
increase resin production (Emboden 1972). This increase may be a
response to desiccation above the point of vascular disruption.
Under natural circumstances, wounding most often occurs as a
result of insect attack. This is a source of environmental stress
which the production of terpenes and cannabinoids may be able to
minimize. <em>Cannabis</em> is subject to few predators (Smith
and Haney 1973, Stannard <em>et al.</em> 1970) and has even been
utilized in powdered or extract form as an insecticide (Bouquet
1950) or repellent (Khare <em>et al.</em> 1974). Its apparent
defensive mechanisms include a generous covering of non-glandular
trichomes, emission of volatile terpenoid substances, and
exudation of the sticky cannabinoids. <em>Cannabis</em> is often
noted for its aromatic quality and many of the terpenes produced
are known to possess insect-repellent properties. Among these are
alpha and beta pinene, limonene, terpineol and borneol. Pinenes
and limonene comprise over 75% of the volatiles detected in the
surrounding atmosphere, but account for only 7% of the essential
oil (Hood <em>et al.</em> 1973). Consistent with glandular
trichome density and cannabinoid content, more of these terpenes
are produced by the inflorescences than the leaves, and their
occurrence is also greater in the female plant (Martin <em>et al.</em>
1961). </p>

<p>No insect toxicity studies using isolated cannabinoids have
been published to date. Rothschild <em>et al.</em> (1977) found
THC-rich Mexican (<em>vs.</em> CBD-rich Turkish) <em>Cannabis</em>
fatal to tiger moth (<em>Arctia caja</em>) larvae, but not
Nigerian grasshopper (<em>Zonocerus elegans</em>) nymphs.
Rothschild and Fairbairn (1980) later found that pure THC (<em>vs.</em>
CBD) sprayed on cabbage leaves, does repel the large white
cabbage butterfly (<em>Pieris brassicae</em>). </p>

<p>The cannabinoids may also serve as a purely mechanical
defense. A tiny creature crossing the leaf surface could rupture
the tenuously attached globular resin reservoirs of the glandular
trichomes (Ledbetter and Krikorian 1975) and become ensnared in
resin. A sizable chewing insect, if able to overcome these
defenses, would still have difficulty chewing the gummy resin,
along with the cystolithic trichomes and silicified covering
trichomes also present on the leaf. The utility of these
epidermal features as insect antifeedants is also inferable from
their predominant occurrence on the insect-favored abaxial leaf
surface. Although the above strategies represent a seemingly
sophisticated system, many other plants (Levin 1973) and even
arthropods (Eisner 1970) utilize similar defense mechanisms,
often employing identical terpenes! </p>

<h3>Competition</h3>

<p>Terpenes may also help to suppress the growth of surrounding
vegetation (Muller and Hauge 1967, Muller <em>et al.</em> 1964).
Haney and Bazzaz (1970) speculated that such a mechanism may be
operative in <em>Cannabis</em>. They further ventured that since
the production of terpenes is not fully developed in very young
plants, this may explain their inability to compete successfully
with other vegetation until more mature. The observation (Latta
and Eaton 1975) of increased THC production by plants in
competition with surrounding vegetation &quot;at a time in the
growing season when moisture was not limiting&quot;, may indicate
a stimulus for cannabinoid production beyond that of simple water
stress. </p>

<h3>Bacteria and fungi</h3>

<p>The cannabinoids may serve as a protectant against
microorganisms. <em>Cannabis</em> preparations have long served
as medicines (apart from their psychoactive properties) and are
effective against a wide variety of infectious diseases (Kabelic <em>et
al.</em> 1960, Mikuriya 1969). These antibiotic properties have
been demonstrated with both <em>Cannabis</em> extracts (Ferenczy <em>et
al.</em> 1958, Kabelic <em>et al.</em> 1960, Radosevic <em>et al.</em>
1962) and a variety of isolated cannabinoids (ElSohly <em>et al.</em>
1982, Farkas and Andrassy 1976, Gal and Vajda 1970, Van Klingeren
and Ten Ham 1976). CBG has been compared (Mechoulam and Gaoni
1965) in both &quot;structure and antibacterial properties to
grifolin, an antibiotic from the basidiomycete <em>Grifolia
conflens</em>.&quot; Ferency (1956) has demonstrated the
antibiotic properties of <em>Cannabis</em> seed, a factor that
may aid its survival when overwintering. Adherent resin on the
seed surface, as well as a surrounding mulch of spent <em>Cannabis</em>
leaves, may serve in this regard. </p>

<p>Some of the many fungal pathogens that affect <em>Cannabis</em>
include <em>Alternaria alterata</em> (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), <em>Ascochyta
prasadii</em> (Shukla and Pathak 1967), <em>Botryosphaeria
marconii</em> (Charles and Jenkins 1914), <em>Cercospora
cannabina</em> and <em>C. cannabis</em> (Lentz <em>et al.</em>
1974), <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> (McCain and Noviello 1985), <em>Phoma</em>
sp. (Srivastava and Naithani 1979) and <em>Phomopsis ganjae</em>
(McPartland 1984). </p>

<p>While <em>A. alterata</em> attacks Illinois <em>Cannabis</em>
and destroys 2.8-45.5% of the seed (Haney and Kutsheid 1975), the
balance of these species are leaf spot diseases. McPartland
(1984) has demonstrated the inhibitory effects of THC and CBD on <em>Phomopsis
ganjae</em>. However, De Meijer <em>et al.</em> (1992), in
evaluating a large collection of <em>Cannabis</em> genotypes, did
not find a correlation between cannabinoid content and the
occurence of <em>Botrytis</em>. Fungal evolution of a mechanism
for overcoming the plant's cannabinoid defenses may be
responsible for their success as pathogens. Indeed, some have
been demonstrated to metabolize THC and other cannabinoids
(Binder 1976, Binder and Popp 1980, Robertson <em>et al.</em>
1975). </p>

<h3>Ultraviolet radiation</h3>

<p>Another stress to which plants are subject results from their
daily exposure to sunlight. While necessary to sustain
photosynthesis, natural light contains biologically destructive
ultraviolet radiation. This selective pressure has apparently
affected the evolution of certain defenses, among them, a
chemical screening functionally analogous to the pigmentation of
human skin. A preliminary investigation (Pate 1983) indicated
that, in areas of high ultraviolet radiation exposure, the UV-B
(280-315 nm) absorption properties of THC may have conferred an
evolutionary advantage to <em>Cannabis</em> capable of greater
production of this compound from biogenetic precursor CBD. The
extent to which this production is also influenced by
environmental UV-B induced stress has been experimentally
determined by Lydon <em>et al.</em> (1987). Their experiments
demonstrate that under conditions of high UV-B exposure,
drug-type <em>Cannabis</em> produces significantly greater
quantities of THC. They have also demonstrated the chemical
lability of CBD upon exposure to UV-B (Lydon and Teramura 1987),
in contrast to the stability of THC and CBC. However, studies by
Brenneisen (1984) have shown only a minor difference in UV-B
absorption between THC and CBD, and the absorptive properties of
CBC proved considerably greater than either. Perhaps the
relationship between the cannabinoids and UV-B is not so direct
as first supposed. Two other explanations must now be considered.
Even if CBD absorbs on par with THC, in areas of high ambient
UV-B, the former compound may be more rapidly degraded. This
could lower the availability of CBD present or render it the less
energetically efficient compound to produce by the plant.
Alternatively, the greater UV-B absorbency of CBC compared to THC
and the relative stability of CBC compared to CBD might nominate
this compound as the protective screening substance. The presence
of large amounts of THC would then have to be explained as merely
an accumulated storage compound at the end of the enzyme-mediated
cannabinoid pathway. However, further work is required to resolve
the fact that Lydon's (1985) experiments did not show a
commensurate increase in CBC production with increased UV-B
exposure. </p>

<p>This CBC pigmentation hypothesis would imply the development
of an alternative to the accepted biochemical pathway from CBG to
THC via CBD. Until 1973 (Turner and Hadley 1973), separation of
CBD and CBC by gas chromatography was difficult to accomplish, so
that many peaks identified as CBD in the preceding literature may
in fact have been CBC. Indeed, it has been noted (De Faubert
Maunder 1970) and corroborated by GC/MS (Turner and Hadley 1973)
that some tropical drug strains of <em>Cannabis</em> do not
contain any CBD at all, yet have an abundance of THC. This
phenomenon has not been observed for northern temperate varieties
of <em>Cannabis</em>. Absence of CBD has led some authors (De
Faubert Maunder 1970, Turner and Hadley 1973) to speculate that
another biogenetic route to THC is involved. Facts scattered
through the literature do indeed indicate a possible alternative.
Holley <em>et al.</em> (1975) have shown that Mississippi-grown
plants contain a considerable content of CBC, often in excess of
the CBD present. In some examples, either CBD or CBC was absent,
but in no case were plants devoid of both. Their analysis of
material grown in Mexico and Costa Rica served to accentuate this
trend. Only one example actually grown in their respective
countries revealed the presence of any CBD, although appreciable
quantities of CBC were found. The reverse seemed true as well.
Seed from Mexican material devoid of CBD was planted in
Mississippi and produced plants containing CBD. </p>

<p>Could CBC be involved in an alternate biogenetic route to THC?
Yagen and Mechoulam (1969) have synthesized THC (albeit in low
yield) directly from CBC. The method used was similar to the acid
catalyzed cyclization of CBD to THC (Gaoni and Mechoulam 1966).
Reaction by-products included cannabicyclol, <em>delta</em>-8-THC
and <em>delta</em>-4,8-iso-THC, all products which have been
found in analyses of <em>Cannabis</em> (e.g., Novotny <em>et al.</em>
1976). Finally, radioisotope tracer studies (Shoyama <em>et al.</em>
1975) have uncovered the intriguing fact that radiolabeled CBG
fed to a very low THC-producing strain of <em>Cannabis</em> is
found as CBD, but when fed to high THC-producing plants, appeared
only as CBC and THC. Labeled CBD fed to a Mexican example of
these latter plants likewise appeared as THC. Unfortunately,
radiolabeled CBC was not fed to their plants, apparently in the
belief that CBC branched off the biogenetic pathway at CBD and
dead ended. Their research indicated that incorporation of
labeled CBG into CBD or CBC was age dependent. Vogelman <em>et
al.</em> (1988) likewise report that the developmental stage of
seedlings, as well as their exposure to light, affects the
occurrence of CBG, CBC or THC in Mexican <em>Cannabis</em>. No
CBD was reported. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Although the chemistry of <em>Cannabis</em> has come under
extensive investigation, more work is needed to probe the
relationship of its resin to biotic and abiotic factors in the
environment. Glandular trichomes are production sites for the
bulk of secondary compounds present. It is probable that the
cannabinoids and associated terpenes serve as defensive agents in
a variety of antidessication, antimicrobial, antifeedant and UV-B
pigmentation roles. UV-B selection pressures seem responsible for
the distribution of THC-rich <em>Cannabis</em> varieties in areas
of high ambient radiation, and may have influenced the evolution
of an alternate biogenetic pathway from CBG to THC in some of
these strains. Though environmental stresses appear to be a
direct stimulus for enhanced chemical production by individual
plants, it must be cautioned that such stresses may also skew
data by hastening development of the highly glandular flowering
structures. Future studies will require careful and
representative sampling to assure meaningful results. </p>

<H2>Dear Membership,</H2>
It has been an exciting 6 months since
publication of our premier issue and your response has been overwhelming.
Our membership has doubled, substantially advancing us toward
the goal of 1000 dues-paying members. This goal represents a financial
break-even point, enabling the IHA to become self-sufficient!
We suggest that all our present members send us a list of people
they consider good candidates for membership, and we will contact
them. Also, please show the first two issues of the journal to
libraries, universities or other institutions that you think might
be interested in subscribing to the JIHA, on a Sustaining Member
basis. Don't forget to send us your 1995 membership renewal fee
before March 31! Remember, all operating expenses and project
funding come from annual membership dues and the private donations
of a generous few.
<P>
We have received a lot of good publicity
around the world, having been mentioned or featured in articles
from Economic Botany (US), Farmers Weekly (UK), the Amsterdam
daily newspaper Het Parool, the Dutch national newspaper Agrarisch
Dagblad and the last 3 issues of Hemp World (US). Upcoming articles
about the IHA will appear in Diversity (US) and elsewhere. We
are also seeking funding from foundations, the Italian government
and the European Union, for support of our project to save the
world&iacute;s most extensive collection of hemp varieties, located
at the Vaviliov Research Institute (VIR).
<P>
Many prospective new members ask, "What
do I get for my annual membership fee, besides the journal?".
Your dues go towards initiation and support of many projects,
worldwide. Included are the following:
<P>
1. The aforementioned VIR project, with
activities expanded in 1994 to include grow-outs in Italy and
the Ukraine, as well as Russia. (See page 68 of this issue.)
<P>
2. Although not yet fully implemented,
the IHA is developing archives of live hemp seed lots (1-50 kg)
for every developed hemp variety available and a few native land
races, too. This gives researchers and entrepreneurs quick access
and enables them to avoid having to spend many months locating
and procuring these seeds. As a result, start-up projections will
be shorter for their pilot projects. We can also aid in locating
commercial amounts of most varieties.
<P>
3. The IHA is attempting to put the
world&iacute;s <I>Cannabis</I> literature (&gt;20,000 citations)
on a computer. First to come will be a simple title/author/journal-or-book
citation. Later, they will be annotated or abstracted. Finally,
their full text and illustrations will be included. The cost of
this will be very high (&gt;US$ 200,000) and there are copyright
problems to be worked out, but a feasibility study has been done
and the initial steps have been made. Included in this project
is translation of the entire VIR bibliography from the original
Russian to English. This project will forge a tool that we feel
will eventually become an indispensible part of every serious
<I>Cannabis</I> researcher&iacute;s information-access repertoire.
<P>
4. We are entertaining the idea of having
a convention of IHA members in the Netherlands, sometime in 1996,
as our membership rolls and funding permit. We are presently involved
in the upcoming BIORESOURCE HEMP events in Frankfurt, March 2-5,
1994 (see page 64).
<P>
A computer group in Luxembourg has offered
to distribute the JIHA over the Internet (USENET ALT.HEMP). This
is being done by other scientific publications (see <I>Scientific
American</I>, December 1994, pages 72-77). The advantages of having
more information accessable to more people are obvious, and may
well result in a larger membership. However, this may alienate
present dues-paying members. For the moment, as a trial, we will
display the VIR cover story of the JIHA Vol. 1, #1, along with
our Guide for Authors and the back cover displaying a membership
application, in an effort to increase membership and donations.
A compromise has been suggested that only outdated issues of the
JIHA be put on "The Net". Please let us know what
you think about this topic. We do care about your opinion!
<P>
Speaking of computers, an apology is
due to those who may have tried to contact us at our e-mail address.
Our computer has been "down" for many weeks. For
the present, the most reliable way to contact us is by fax or
via the good ol&iacute; post office. <BR>

<H2>Congratulatory</H2>
Congratulations on a journal, well done. The Journal of the International Hemp Association is the world&Otilde;s first authoritative organ on the economic botany of hemp. A peer reviewed journal offering a balanced blend of scholarly and newsworthy information, JIHA is destined to become the main vehicle of information critical to the renewed industrializaton of hemp. I recommend it as essential reading, whether one&#146;s interest is medical, economic, agricultural or general.

<H2>Australian</H2>

Australian Hemp Recource and Manufacture (AHRM) is a business recently formed in Brisbane, Australia. The ultimate objective of this business is to pave the way for broad acre planting of fibre hemp throughout the country.
<P>

In all the states and territories of Australia, <I>Cannabis</I> is classified as an illicit drug and as a consequence, <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> seeds, plant material and various by-products are subject to legal prosecution. Slowly, Australians are waking up to the fact that selected varieties of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> have a very high agricultural value with absolutely no drug value.
<P>

Past endeavours to start a hemp industry in Australia have been clouded over by the highly volatile drug debate involving the decriminalisation or legalisation of marijuana. This debate has been running for several decades and appears to be no closer to a united resolution.
<P>

In the meantime, any importation of <I>Cannabis</I> seed is illegal and subject to extensive scrutiny (as experienced in the Tasmanian experiments, see JIHA, Vol. 1, #1).
<P>
As an initial step in the development of a hemp industry in this country, AHRM aims to challenge the blanket drug status of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I>. We are asking the governments to distinguish between the drug and fibre varieties of the plant. This is certainly not a novel approach, as both the United Nations and the E.C. have recognised <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> as an agricultural crop for a number of years. Understandably seed would be sourced by authorised bodies from registered fibre hemp seed companies that comply with international standards.
<P>
Once the two types of <I>Cannabis</I> <I>sativa</I> have been officially distinguished and recognised  hemp industry on a major scale will be the same as introducing any other major crop into this country. Fibre hemp will finally be disentangled from the drug debate where it logically does not belong.
<P>

<H2>Serious</H2>

I have received the premier issue of the Journal, and I am pleased to note the serious approach that you are taking; we certainly need much more solid research than we now have.
<P>
It is shameful that our approach to hemp use and abuse remains so puerile, ignorant and vindictive. We do need truthful information about responsible drug use and irresponsible drug abuse, of both licit and illicit drugs. We need to change the entrenched bureaucratic policies so totally committed to zero tolerance that police state environments are created. We need to change from repressive responses (police arrest, prosecution, and prison) to positive responses (education, decriminalization, treatment and rehabilitation) - no easy task, for it entails demonstrating that existing policies are counterproductive and only exacerbate a very sad situation. We seem unable to learn from history, but perhaps the generations to come can learn. And perhaps the Journal of the International Hemp Association can play a major role in effecting needed change of national and international policies. Good luck!

technology to harvest and store fibre hemp for paper pulp</b>.
Journal of the International Hemp Association 1: 38-41.</p>

<p> After mowing fibre hemp in September, field-drying is
weather-dependent and therefore not reliable under Dutch weather
conditions. Direct harvesting can be done by field choppers
equipped with a row-independent header. Storage and preservation
of the wet material on the farm is possible under acid and
alkaline anaerobic conditions. No losses of cellulose were
measured, but fibre strength was decreased. Bark and core can
easily be separated by water flotation of the preserved chopped
stems. Decortication of the stems in the field was less effective
and would be more expensive. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 1990, the Dutch government initiated a four year programme
to research the technical and economic feasibility of cultivating
fibre hemp for paper pulp. Both bast and core had to be processed
and the objective was to cultivate a crop with a maximum fibre
yield. This meant that harvest could not start before September
and that traditional harvesting methods might not be suitable. </p>

<h3>Available harvesting systems for tall fibre crops</h3>

<p>Fibre hemp is usually grown for textile fibres. For this
application, the strength, colour, softness and fineness of the
bast fibres are very important and harvesting technique focuses
on these aspects (for example, a retting process is necessary).
Because of the decreased demand for bast fibres, in most areas
the mechanization of bast fibre crops is not advanced. In the
Ukraine, hemp is mown and laid down in swaths to ret (van der
Werf 1994). In the USA, an experimental machine was developed to
cut kenaf. The stems were also laid down in a swath to ret or to
dry (USDA 1988). In Australia, sugar cane harvesters and field
choppers have been used to harvest kenaf for paper pulp (Wilkes <i>et
al.</i> 1969, Wood <i>et al</i>. 1978). Both types of machines
technically functioned well, but the harvest costs of a sugar
cane harvester were found to be much higher than those of a field
chopper. In the USA and Australia, initial attempts to start a
kenaf-processing industry failed.</p>

<p> In France, 6000 ha of fibre hemp is grown for processing into
paper pulp. Two harvesting systems are used, depending on whether
the seed is to be harvested or not (FNPC 1985). For the best and
highest fibre yield, the hemp is cut with a mower conditioner for
field drying in the third week of August. In about 4 days, the
moisture content is under 15% and the hemp is baled with a round
baler. However, if the seed is also to be harvested, the stem
tops are cut and threshed with a combine in the first week of
September. Subsequently, the crop is mown and laid down in a
swath to dry. With this second harvesting system the fibre yield
is much lower (depending on the cutting height of the combine)
and because of poor weather conditions in September, the fibre
quality can be lower. </p>

<h3>Research objectives</h3>

<p>From the beginning of the Dutch Hemp Research Programme, two
specific research topics were formulated. First, a system for
preservation and storage of the harvest was needed so as to
enable supply of pulp processing plants with fibres for the whole
year. Because hemp may not be harvested dry, many experiments
were performed concerning the preservation and storage of wet
hemp. Secondly, the processing of hemp into paper pulp demands a
separation of bark and core because these fractions differ
physically (fibre length and diameter) and chemically (cellulose
and lignin content) (Zomers <i>et al</i>. 1991). The separation
may be done as a harvest operation in the field or as a
preprocessing step of the pulping. The Institute of Agricultural
and Environmental Engineering (IMAG-DLO), together with the
Department of Agricultural Engineering and Physics of the
Wageningen Agricultural University, investigated these aspects to
determine the best processing chain in which harvest,
preservation, storage and bark/core separation are integrated. </p>

<h2>Materials and methods</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>Field tests were carried out with a cutter bar, a mower
conditioner, balers, field choppers and a decorticator. All
machines, except the decorticator, are commonly used in other
crops. When relevant and necessary, minor adaptions were made to
make them suitable for hemp. The main objective of the field
tests was to learn and solve the difficulties in handling a fibre
hemp crop utilizing different techniques.</p>

<p> We investigated the possibility of wet preservation by
anaerobic storage. The hemp stems were cut in short pieces (1 cm)
and preserved in bottles of 1.5&nbsp;l capacity. After flushing
with nitrogen, the bottles were closed air tight. To create
different environments, we used the following additives: <i>Foraform </i>(Barenbrug
Holland BV), a silage additive consisting primarily (92%) of
formic acid; kitchen salt; sodium hydroxide; and <i>Silage
inoculant 1188</i> (Pioneer Hi-bred Nederland BV), a silage
additive containing <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> and <i>Streptococcus
facium</i>. After preservation, pH was measured of a 1:10 aquatic
extract. The cellulose and hemicellulose sugars and the lignin
were determined using an analysis derived from TAPPI-249 and
TAPPI-222 (de Maeyer and Huisman 1994). Bast fibres were cooked
for 1 hour in a 2% sodium hydroxide solution and the strength was
measured in a controlled environment (23<sup>o</sup> C, relative
humidity 50%) with a stelometer according to ASTM D-1445 (ASTM
1967). </p>

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<p>We used 3 methods to separate bark and core: decortication of
green stems in the field, sieving of chopped stems, and flotation
of chopped stems. The decorticator broke the core of whole stems
and beat the core pieces from the bark. The sieving and flotation
of chopped stems were done after a 6 month wet preservation
period. The sieve dimensions were 2 x 4 cm. With flotation, the
hemp was thrown into a bath of slow moving water in which part of
the pieces floated and the rest sank. By measuring bark and core
masses, we determined the efficiency of each operation. </p>

<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<h3>Harvesting technique and preservation</h3>

<p>For storage of dry hemp, the moisture content must be less
than 15% to avoid fibre decay by micro-organisms. In France,
field drying takes at least 4 days for the crop to reach the
necessary dry matter (dm) content of 85%. Comparing weather data
from two Dutch and two French weather stations, we estimate that
in the Netherlands, on average, 6 days of dry weather in
succession are needed to have the hemp sufficiently dried. Based
upon data of the workability of the grain harvest (Portiek 1975),
in September for 9 out of 10 years, only 3.5 days are available
to harvest winter wheat with a moisture content below 24%. If the
moisture content of wheat is higher than 23%, it is not expected
that a mown hemp crop, lying on the ground, will reach the
necessary moisture content of less than 15%. So, in September,
the field drying period would be longer than 6 days for many of
the years and the crop would start dew retting. This would
decrease bast fibre strength (Hessler 1945, Robinson 1946). If
the crop stays wet, retting can even become rotting. So, we
concluded that field drying is not reliable in the Netherlands in
September.</p>

<p> Chopping of the standing crop is less weather dependent and a
field chopper with a row independent header can mow the crop
easily. Fewer problems occurred with a drum type chopper than
with a flywheel type chopper. To avoid blockages, the crop chute
must be smooth and without any augers or blind areas. The knives
must be sharp and the chopping length set short (6&nbsp;mm). To
handle hemp, great attention has to be paid to avoid bark
wrapping around rotating machine parts.</p>

<p> After chopping, the hemp has a dm content of 33%. Artificial
drying is too expensive, so we tried to preserve the hemp by
ensiling (wet anaerobic preservation). In corn or grass silages,
lactic acid bacteria consume available sugars and produce lactic
acid to yield a pH of 4.2. Then the product is preserved and no
further losses occur (McDonald <i>et al</i>. 1991). In hemp
silage, the pH did not drop to 4.2, even after addition of lactic
acid bacteria. The reason for this was lack of the necessary
sugars. Only 4 g of sugars per kg of stem dm were available and
based upon grass silage, about 75 g are needed for a sufficient
fermentation (Wieringa 1961). Despite the inadequate
fermentation, no cellulose or hemicellulose was lost in silage
(Table 1). Only with the addition of sodium hydroxide did some
hemicellulose and lignin dissolve. This was also shown by de
Groot <i>et al</i>. (1994). Impregnation of hemp core, during 30
minutes with 1 M sodium hydroxide at 20<sup>o</sup> C, removed
some xylan (the main component of the hemicellulose) and some
lignin.</p>

<p> It is important to maintain fibre strength when processing
the bast for paper pulp. Paper tensile strength is positively
correlated with the quantity and the quality of the bast fibres.
The bast fibre strength was best preserved in an acidic
(pH&lt;4.5) or alkaline (pH&gt;12) environment (Table 2).
However, even under these circumstances fibre strength decreased.
Because the control fibres, after 3 and 6 months, were not the
same (dry compared to frozen fibres), no clear results can be
given on the decrease of fibre stength in time. However, the big
difference between the data after 3 and 6 months' storage
indicate that fibre strength may be slowly decreasing, even in a
stable acidic or alkaline environment. More research is necessary
to determine how much this strength decreases and whether this
decrease can be stopped. </p>

<hr size="4">

<h3>Separation of bark and core</h3>

<pre>Figure 1 presents the results of decortication in the field and the separation of bark and core after chopping and ensiling, by sieving or by flotation. With decortication, the bark could not be cleaned well enough and still contained more than 40% of the core. About two thirds of this core was not attached to the bark. Bark and loose core should be easily separable by sieving since the size of the bark and of the loose core pieces greatly differ. The length of the core pieces ranged from 1 to 8 cm and the length of the bark from 0.5 to 2.5 m. The quantity of the remaining fixed core would be very difficult to reduce. It was clear that the quantity of fixed core mainly depended on stem diameter: the smaller the diameter, the higher the quantity of fixed core.</pre>

<p> With field chopping, the bark was not cut as short as the
core. The bark was very tough and the knives stripped some of the
bark from the core. So after chopping, about 90% of the mixture
consisted of clean bark and core pieces. This made it possible to
separate bark and core by sieving or flotation. Sieving of
chopped hemp resulted in a 'contamination rate' of both bark and
core of about 25%, since the size difference between the chopped
bark and core was not big enough to separate them by sieving.
With flotation, very clean bast could be collected, although some
bark floated because it stuck to a piece of core, resulting in
its collection with the core.</p>

<p> A disadvantage of decortication is the low processing
capacity. The costs would be high, approximately 110 Dfl per ton
of dm, especially because the machine only can be used in hemp.
Flotation seems most satisfactory and would cost approximately 5
Dfl per ton of dm. It is expected that a simple chopping
operation of the floating material can reduce the mass of bark in
the core. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<pre>Field choppers equipped with a row-independent header can harvest fibre hemp, but the sharpness of the knives and the throughput of the chopped fibres need special attention to prevent wrapping or blocking. The chopping operation loosens about 90% of the bark and core. Because the bark sinks in water and the core floats, flotation is an easy and effective separation method. This operation perfectly fits into a harvesting system with chopping and ensiling. In a system of cultivation, harvest and storage of fibre hemp, wet anaerobic preservation is the most uncertain factor for the supply of consistent good-quality fibres throughout the year. Acidic and alkaline preservation techniques seem to be the best methods, but more research is needed on these processes, with special attention paid to the observed decrease in fibre strength.

<p>McPartland, J.M., 1994. Microbiological contaminants of
marijuana</b>. Journal of the International Hemp Association 1:
41-44.</p>

<p> Use of marijuana as a medicament is on the rise. Many medical
marijuana users have a suppressed immune system, owing to their
disease or treatment. Herbal marijuana, whether field grown or
hydroponically cultivated, contains many microorganisms. Many of
these organisms may pose a threat to immunosuppressed
individuals. The microflora of marijuana is well described in the
literature. Similarly, the microflora that cause opportunistic
infections in AIDS patients is well documented. These separate
literatures are correlated with commentary, and methods for
detecting and eliminating microbial contaminants are discussed. </p>

<hr size="1" noshade>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug &quot;having no
medical use, with a high potential for abuse&quot; by the US Drug
Enforcement Administration. Nevertheless, a handful of US
citizens are permitted use of government-supplied &quot;medical
marijuana&quot; for a variety of ailments (Bowersox 1992).
Additionally, a large clinical trial utilizing marijuana in AIDS
patients has been approved in San Francisco (Doblin 1994).</p>

<p> Doblin and Kleiman (1991) document the widespread illicit use
of marijuana for medical purposes. Nearly half of the oncologists
polled by Doblin and Kleiman recommended that their patients
experiment with marijuana as a medicine. Many of these patients,
however, are immuno-suppressed, making them very susceptible to
opportunistic bacteria and fungi. Since hundreds of bacteria and
fungi are associated with the cultivation of marijuana
(McPartland 1991), possible microbiological hazards need to be
assessed.</p>

<p> A majority of the organisms associated with marijuana are
strictly plant pathogens. They cannot infect healthy humans. But
a subset of opportunistic plant pathogens are associated with
&quot;post-harvest&quot; or &quot;storage&quot; decay of
marijuana. These organisms may infect immuno-compromised
individuals and become opportunistic human pathogens.
Additionally, many opportunist organisms on plants produce
dangerous toxins and/or elicit allergenic reactions when inhaled.</p>

<p> Lastly, a handful of strictly human pathogens have been
isolated from marijuana, as contaminants. These agents are highly
infectious, and some also exude toxins. </p>

<h2>AIDS and opportunistic infections</h2>

<p>People with AIDS are immunosuppressed, and very susceptible to
infections. According to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), the most
common infectious agents include viruses (cytomegalovirus,
hepatitis A &amp; B, herpes simplex), bacteria (<i>Mycobacterium</i>
spp., <i>Salmonella</i> spp.), fungi (<i>Cryptococcus neoformans,
Coccidiodies immitis, Histoplasma capsu-atum, Candida</i> spp.),
and protozoans (<i>Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii,
Cryptosporidium</i> sp.).</p>

<p> Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990) also describe rare infections in
AIDS patients caused by opportunistic fungi &#151; <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus, Penicillium marneffei, Fusarium proliferatum,
Alternaria alternata, Mucor</i> sp., <i>Rhizopus</i> sp., <i>Curvularia</i>
sp., and <i>Bipolaris</i> sp.</p>

<p> Most of these organisms infect people <i>via</i> the
respiratory tract, or by oral-mucosal contact with contaminated
material. Inhaling a marijuana cigarette contaminated with any of
these organisms poses a risk. </p>

<h2>Microflora of marijuana</h2>

<h3>Viruses and protozoans</h3>

<p>Cates &amp; Warren (1975) associated marijuana use with an
epidemic of hepatitis B in Germany, but did not isolate the virus
from plant material. An outbreak of Hepatitis A in Washington
state was linked to consumption of Mexican marijuana, fertilized
with human excrement (Alexander 1987). No protozoans are reported
from marijuana in the literature. </p>

<h3>Bacteria</h3>

<p>Several bacteria species cited as present on marijuana are
human pathogens, and produce toxins: Taylor <i>et al.</i> (1982)
isolated <i>Salmonella muenchen </i>from illicit marijuana.
Ungerlerder <i>et al.</i> (1982) cultivated <i>Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae,</i> <i>E. agglomerans,</i>
group D <i>Streptococcus, </i> and <i>Bacillus</i> sp. from
marijuana supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA). Kurup <i>et al.</i> (1983) isolated several thermophilic
actinomycetes from marijuana cigarettes, including <i>Thermoactinomyces
candidus, T. vulgaris, </i> and <i>Micropolyspora faeni.</i>
These organisms, while not infectious, cause allergic pneumonitis
in hypersensitive individuals. </p>

<hr size="4">

<h3>Fungi</h3>

<p>In the popular press, Margolis and Clorfene (1975) and DuToit
(1980) describe molds colonizing marijuana in the United States
and South Africa, respectively. Surprisingly, both accounts
report the mold enhancing psychotropic effects of marijuana.
These publications initiated a fad among marijuana users, who
exposed their marijuana to molds in the hope of increasing the
potency of their crop.</p>

<p> The &quot;black weblike fungus&quot; described by Margolis
&amp; Clorfene (1975) suggests an <i>Aspergillus</i> species.
Chusid <i>et al.</i> (1975) cite <i>A. fumigatus</i> causing
pneumonitis in a patient who buried his marijuana in the ground
for &quot;aging.&quot; <i> </i>Llamas <i>et al.</i> (1978)
recovered <i>A. fumigatus </i> from marijuana owned by a patient
suffering allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Kagen (1981)
isolated several <i>Aspergillus</i> species from moldy marijuana,
including <i>A. fumigatus, A. niger </i>and <i>A. flavus. </i>Babu <i>et
al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>A. niger, A. flavus, A. tamarii, A.
sulphureus,</i> and <i>A. repens</i> from seeds in marijuana.
Schwartz (1985) isolated <i>A. niger</i> from the sinuses of a
marijuana smoker who suffered severe headaches. Llewellyn &amp;
O'Rear (1977) demonstrated aflatoxin production in marijuana
contaminated with <i>A. flavus</i> and <i>A. parasiticus.</i></p>

<p> <i>Penicillium</i> species have been isolated from marijuana
cigarettes by Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i>
(1983). Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured <i>P. chrysogenum</i>
from <i>Cannabis</i> seeds. Bush Doctor (1993) reports isolating <i>P.
italicum</i> from marijuana stored with an orange peel at 0<font
size="1">o </font>C.</p>

<p> <i>Mucor</i> species have been recovered from marijuana by
Kagen <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kurup <i>et al. </i> (1983). A
related zygomycete, <i>Rhizopus stolonifer,</i> was isolated from
damp marijuana by Bush Doctor (1993).</p>

<p> Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977) cultured several other fungi from <i>Cannabis</i>
seeds that, according to Bossche <i>et al.</i> (1990), may cause
opportunistic infections in AIDS patients. These include <i>Alternaria
alternata </i>and <i>Curvularia lunata.</i> McPartland (1983,
1991, 1992) recovered these fungi from <i>Cannabis</i> in the
field, plus a <i>Fusarium</i> spp. All these fungi produce
toxins. Ramrez (1990) reports four policeman contracting
histoplasmosis, caused by <i>Histoplasma capsulatum,</i> after
destroying a <i>Cannabis</i> field in Puerto Rico. </p>

<h2>Detecting contaminants in marijuana</h2>

<p>Cultivators and consumers of illicit marijuana identify
microbiological contaminants by several crude, but seemingly
effective, screening techniques (Bush Doctor 1993). Their methods
mimic those used by tobacco growers (Lucas 1975). </p>

<h3>Visual screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana often darkens in color and exhibits
changes in surface texture. Strands of white to pale-gray fungal
hyphae become visible in moldy material. Exposed to light, the
fungi sporulate, providing a &quot;fuzzy&quot; appearance.
Generally, <i>Rhizopus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species produce
grey-black spores, <i>Penicillium</i> conidia are light
blue-green, and <i>Aspergillus</i> conidia are dark green-black. </p>

<h3>Olfactory screen</h3>

<p>Uncontaminated marijuana produces a minty or aromatic odor.
Once infested, the smell changes to a &quot;stale&quot; or
&quot;musty&quot; odor. Bush Doctor (1993) reports <i>P. italicum </i>producing
a lavender or lilac odor, and <i>A. flavus</i> &quot;smells like
a locker room.&quot; </p>

<h3>Temperature screen</h3>

<p>Contaminated marijuana undergoing rapid decay may feel warm to
touch. </p>

<h3>Fluorescence screen</h3>

<p>Bush Doctor (1993) screened marijuana for aflatoxin-producing <i>A.
flavus</i> with a UV-A lamp. Contaminated material fluoresces a
light green color. This screening method has not been tested by
other researchers (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear 1977). </p>

<h3>Identification</h3>

<p>If any of the above screening tests is positive, the suspect
marijuana is discarded, without identifying the contaminant. If
identification is desired, the marijuana is either cultured or
bioassayed. Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) and Kagen<i> et al.</i>
(1983) provide the description of culture methods used to
identify microbiological contaminants.</p>

<p> Marijuana can also be tested with bioassay kits, to detect
specific organisms. These assays utilize ELISA (enzyme linked
immunoabsorbent assay) biotechnology. They are more sensitive
than cultures and much quicker, but also much more expensive.
Positive identification of microbiological toxins may require gas
chromatography (Rood <i>et al</i>. 1988) </p>

<h2>Eliminating contaminants</h2>

<p>Kurup <i>et al. </i>(1983) demonstrated that spores of <i>Aspergillus
fumigatus</i> and <i>Mucor</i> species survive in smoke drawn
from pyrolyzed marijuana cigarettes. Also, some microbiological
toxins are not degraded by combustion (Llewellyn &amp; O'Rear
1977).</p>

<p> Moody <i>et al. </i>(1982) evaluated waterpipes for smoking <i>Aspergillus-</i>
contaminated marijuana. They found only a 15% reduction in
transmission of fungal spores.</p>

<p> Levitz and Diamond (1991) suggested baking marijuana in home
ovens at 150<font size="1">o </font>C, for five minutes before
smoking. Oven treatment killed conidia of <i>A. fumigatus, A.
flavus</i> and <i>A. niger, </i>and did not degrade the active
component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).</p>

<p> Ungerlerder <i>et al. </i>(1982) gas-sterilized marijuana
with a mix of 12% ethylene oxide and 88% dichlorodifluoromethane,
at 8.5-10 psi, for 4.5-5 hours. They report no loss of THC from
fumigation. But residues remain in air pockets of fumigated
material, posing another health hazard. They also sterilized
marijuana with high-dose Cobalt 60 irradiation (20,000 Gray Units
or less), again without THC reduction.</p>

<p> None of these methods, however, degrade microbial antigens.
Sensitized patients may still develop bronchospasm after smoking
treated material. Nor do these methods decompose microbial
toxins.</p>

<p> The best method of eliminating microbial antigens and toxins
is by exclusion. This requires careful attention by both
cultivators and consumers. Proper cultivation techniques should
eliminate human pathogens. Careful cultivation also excludes most
opportunistic plant pathogens. Particular attention is required
at harvest, to avoid damaging marijuana before it completely
dries. Flue-cured marijuana contains fewer opportunistic fungi
than air or sweat-cured crops. Sweat-cured <i>Cannabis </i>
(common in illicit marijuana from Colombia) maintains a
&quot;tradition&quot; of <i>Aspergillus</i> contamination (Bush
Doctor 1993).</p>

<p> Bush Doctor (1975) states that infestation by opportunistic
fungi cannot occur in plant material below 15% moisture content
(MC). Properly dried marijuana contains about 10% MC (material
below 10% MC becomes excessively brittle). The dried, unmanicured
marijuana, in small aliquots, can then be vacuum-sealed in
plastic pouches. This packaging differs from the marijuana
currently supplied by NIDA. NIDA supplies marijuana as manicured,
pre-rolled cigarettes, in tin cans (Chait and Pierri 1989).</p>

<p> Opening sealed pouches of marijuana reexposes the material to
contamination. Consumers must prevent marijuana from resorbing
moisture above 15% MC. Storage at freezer temperatures will not
protect marijuana above 15% MC. Placing a lemon or orange peel in
stored marijuana (to impart a &quot;pleasant bouquet,&quot;
according to Frank and Rosenthal, 1978) is discouraged, because

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Many publications have described a variety of microorganisms
resident on marijuana. Nevertheless, most researchers remain
unaware of these hazards. Schwartz (1987) wonders if the source
of a young patient's <i>Curvularia lunata</i> sinusitis could be
from contaminated marijuana. Brummund <i>et al.</i> (1987) reply
that this is possible, but no <i>Curvularia </i>species have been
cited in the <i>Cannabis </i>literature. However, this was indeed
reported by Babu <i>et al.</i> (1977). More recently, another
Schwartz (1992) states, &quot;I am unaware of any report of non-<i>Aspergillus </i>fungal
contamination of marijuana cigarettes.&quot; The publications
cited herein, provide such reports.</p>

<p> Carefully cultivated and harvested marijuana harbors a
minimum of hazardous microorganisms. For added protection,
material must be screened for contamination before it is packaged
for use as medical marijuana. Since opportunistic infections pose
the greatest danger to immunosuppressed consumers, marijuana
should be sterilized, preferably by gamma irradiation. Lastly,
consumers must be given careful instructions to ensure their
marijuana does not become contaminated prior to use. </p>

This article concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. It presents the major results of one laboratory and three on-road driving studies. The latter were conducted on a closed section of a primary highway, on a highway in the presence of other traffic and in urban traffic, respectively. This program of research has shown that marijuana produces only a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to the consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a steady lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight into their performance and will compensate where they can (<I>e.g</I>., by increasing distance between vehicles or increasing effort). As a consequence, THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program.
<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

After alcohol, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), marijuana's major psychoactive constituent,  is the drug which is found most often in the blood of drivers involved in road accidents. With some exceptions, epidemiological studies indicate the presence of THC in roughly 4-12% of drivers injured or killed in traffic accidents: for example, 10% in New York (Terhune 1982), 7% in New South Wales (Chesher and Starmer 1983), 8% in North Carolina (Mason and McBay 1984), 11% in D&#159;sseldorf (Daldrup <I>et al</I>. 1987), 10% in Tasmania (McLean 1987) and 11% in Ontario (Cimbura <I>et al</I>. 1990). The most recent data regarding the incidence of drugs in fatally injured drivers in the United States are available from a nationwide study conducted in 1990 and 1991 (Terhune <I>et al.</I> 1992): THC was found in only 4% of the drivers. This relatively low percentage may indicate a declining trend in the incidence rate of THC in fatally injured drivers in the United States, explainable by the declining prevalence of marijuana use throughout the 1980s (Johnston <I>et al</I>. 1992).<P>
These numbers are, however, inconclusive regarding THC's contribution to accidents because alcohol has been a severe confounding factor in all surveys of injured or killed drivers: generally 60-80% of drivers who were found positive for THC also showed the presence of alcohol. Another problem of these surveys is the common lack of sound control groups. To determine whether drivers under the influence of THC are overrepresented in accidents, the THC incidence in accident victims should be compared to the THC incidence in randomly selected drivers passing the same accident site at the same times and days of the week. This has been done for alcohol (Borkenstein <I>et al</I>. 1974), but not for THC.<P>
The lack of separate control groups has been circumvented by the use of a 'culpability index'. This index is the ratio of the percentage of drivers with detectable drug levels and deemed responsible for a traffic accident to that of drug-free drivers from the same sample who were likewise culpable. But results from this approach have not been consistent: three studies yielded a culpability index of about 1.7 (Warren <I>et al</I>. 1981, Terhune 1982, Donelson <I>et al</I>. 1985), two other studies failed to find a significantly elevated culpability index for marijuana users (Williams <I>et al</I>. 1985, Terhune <I>et al</I>. 1992). For this and other reasons given above, the independent contribution of THC to accidents remains exceedingly obscure. Several literature reviews, the most recent by Robbe (1994), have shown that the results from driving simulator and closed-course tests indicate that THC in inhaled doses up to 250&#160;&#181;g/kg has relatively minor effects on driving performance, certainly less than blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) in the range 0.08-0.10&#160;g%. In contrast to this, laboratory studies have repeatedly shown performance impairment occurring after inhaled doses as low as about 40 &#181;g/kg. These became large and persistent after 100-200 &#181;g/kg doses. Tracking, divided attention and vigilance test performance were particularly vulnerable to THC's effects. Assuming that both sets of results are valid for the particular circumstances under which they were obtained, they demonstrate that performance decrements obtained under the artificial and non-life threatening conditions in the laboratory do not automatically predict similar decrements in driving simulations that are closer to real-world driving. These conflicting results led, however, to opposing opinions regarding marijuana's effects on driving performance. Real-world driving studies were therefore warranted.<P>
Only one study (Klonoff 1974) had been conducted in actual traffic before the present research program started. In a city driving study, Klonoff assessed the effects of two THC doses, 4.9 and 8.4 mg, which are equivalent to 70 and 120&#160;&#181;g/kg for a 70 kg person. Aspects of subjects' driving performance were scored by a professional examiner. The results showed that subjects performed less competently when under the influence of the highest, but not the lowest dose. In particular, they scored lower on judgment and concentration scales. Several investigators, however, criticized the method used by Klonoff for measuring driving performance on the grounds that the examiners' reliability was never determined and that the scoring instrument had never been shown to provide measures related to driving safety (Moskowitz 1985, Smiley 1986). Furthermore, Klonoff administered relatively low THC doses to his subjects. The effects of high doses of THC on driving in real traffic still needed to be determined.<P>
The studies reported in this article were conducted to escape these limitations. First, the effects of low, moderate and high THC doses on highway driving were determined, both in the absence and presence of other traffic. Second, Klonoff's city driving study was replicated, with some modifications with regards to the employed procedures and with the addition of another group of subjects who undertook the same driving test but then under the influence of a low dose of alcohol.<P>
An important practical objective of the program was to determine whether degrees of driving impairment can be accurately predicted from either measured concentrations of THC in plasma or performance measured in potential roadside 'sobriety' tests of tracking ability or hand and posture stability. The results (Robbe 1994), like many reported before, indicate that none of these measures accurately predicts changes in actual driving performance under the influence of THC. 


<H2>General procedures</H2>
Subjects in all studies were recreational users of marijuana or hashish, <I>i.e.</I>, smoking the drug more than once a month, but not daily. They were all healthy, between 21 and 40 years of age, had normal weight and binocular acuity, and were licensed to drive an automobile. Furthermore, law enforcement authorities were contacted, with the volunteers' consent, to verify that they had no previous arrests or convictions for drunken driving or drug trafficking.<P>
Each subject was required to submit a urine sample immediately upon arrival at the test site. Samples were assayed qualitatively for the following common 'street drugs' (or metabolites): cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines and barbiturates. In addition, a breath sample was analyzed for the presence of alcohol using a Lion-SD3 breath-analyzer.<P>
	Subjects were accompanied during every driving test by an licensed driving instructor. A redundant control system in the test vehicle was available for controlling the car, should emergency situations arise.<P>
Marijuana and placebo marijuana cigarettes were supplied by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse. The lowest and highest THC concentrations in the marijuana cigarettes used in the studies were 1.75% and 3.57%, respectively.


<H2>Pilot study</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The pilot study was conducted in a hospital under strict medical supervision to identify THC doses that recreational marijuana users were likely to consume before driving. Twenty-four subjects, twelve males and twelve females, participated. They were allowed to smoke part or all of the THC content in three cigarettes until achieving the desired psychological effect. Cigarettes were smoked through a plastic holder in a manner determined by the subjects. The only requirement was to smoke for a period not exceeding 15 minutes. When subjects voluntarily stopped smoking, cigarettes were carefully extinguished and retained for subsequent gravimetric estimation of the amount of THC consumed.

<H3>Results</H3>
	Six subjects consumed one cigarette, thirteen smoked two and four smoked three. The average amount of THC consumed was 20.8&#160;mg, after adjustment for body weight, 308&#160;&#181;g/kg. It should be noted that the amounts of THC consumed represent both the inhaled dose and the portion that was lost through pyrolysis and side-stream smoke during the smoking process. There were no significant differences between males and females, nor between frequent and infrequent users, with respect to the weight adjusted preferred dose. It was decided that the maximum dose for subsequent driving studies would be 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. This is considerably higher than doses that have usually been administered to subjects in experimental studies (typically, 100&#173;200&#160;&#181;g/kg THC).

<H2>Study 1: Driving on a restricted highway</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
The first driving study was conducted on a highway closed to other traffic. One objective of this study was to determine whether it would be safe to repeat the study on a normal highway in the presence of other traffic. The second objective was to define the dose-effect relationship between inhaled THC dose and driving performance. The same twelve men and twelve women who participated in the laboratory study served again as the subjects. They were treated on separate occasions with marijuana cigarettes containing THC doses of 0 (placebo), 100, 200, and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. Treatments were administered double-blind and in a counterbalanced order. On each occasion, subjects performed a road-tracking test beginning 40 minutes after initiation of smoking and repeated one hour later. The test, developed and standardized by O'Hanlon <I>et al.</I> (1982, 1986), involved maintaining a constant speed at 90&#160;km/h and a steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the traffic lane. Subjects drove 22&#160;km on a primary highway and were accompanied by a licensed driving instructor. The primary dependent variable was the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), which has been shown to be both highly reliable and very sensitive to the influence of sedative drugs and alcohol. Other dependent variables were mean speed, and standard deviation of speed and steering wheel angle.

<H3>Results</H3>
	All subjects were willing and able to finish the driving tests without great difficulty. The study demonstrated that marijuana impairs driving performance as measured by an increase in SDLP; all three THC doses significantly affected SDLP relative to placebo. The driving performance decrement after smoking marijuana persisted almost undiminished for two hours after smoking. Marijuana's effects on SDLP were compared to those of alcohol obtained in a very similar study by Louwerens <I>et al.</I> (1985, 1987). It appeared that the effects of the various administered doses of THC (100&#173;300&#160;&#181;g/kg) on SDLP were equivalent to those associated with BACs in the range of 0.03-0.07&#160;g%. Other driving performance measures were not significantly affected by THC. Both the observed degree of driving impairment, and what subjects said and did, indicated that normal safeguards would be sufficient for ensuring safety in further testing. Hence, the final conclusion was to repeat this study on a normal highway in the presence of other traffic.


<H2>Study 2: Driving on a normal highway in traffic</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
	The second driving study was conducted on a highway in the presence of other traffic and involved both a road-tracking and a car-following test. A new group of sixteen subjects, equally comprised of men and women, participated in this study. A conservative approach was chosen in designing the present study in order to satisfy the strictest safety requirements. That is, the study was conducted according to an ascending dose series design where both active drug and placebo conditions were administered, double-blind, at each of three THC dose levels. THC doses were the same as those used in the previous study, namely 100, 200, and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg. Cigarettes appeared identical at each level of treatment conditions. If any subject had reacted in an unacceptable manner to a lower dose, he/she would not have been permitted to receive a higher dose.<P>
	The subjects began the car-following test 45 minutes after smoking. The test was performed on a 16&Ecirc;km stretch of the highway and lasted about 15 minutes. After the conclusion of this test, subjects performed a 64-km road-tracking test on the same highway which lasted about 50 minutes. At the conclusion of this test, they participated again in the car-following test.<P>
	The road-tracking test was the same as in the previous study except for its duration and the presence of other traffic. Subjects were instructed to maintain a constant speed of 95&Ecirc;km/h and a steady lateral position between lane boundaries in the right traffic lane. They were allowed to deviate from this only if it became necessary to pass a slower vehicle in the same lane. Data from the standard test were analyzed to yield the same performance measures as in the previous study.<P>
	The car-following test involved attempting to match velocity with, and maintain a constant distance from a preceding vehicle as it executed a series of deceleration/acceleration maneuvers. The preceding vehicle's speed would vary between 80 and 100 km/h and the subject was instructed to maintain a 50 m distance however the preceding vehicle's speed might vary. The duration of one deceleration and acceleration maneuver was approximately 50 seconds and six to eight of these maneuvers were executed during one test, depending upon traffic density. The subject's average reaction time to the movements of the preceding vehicle, mean distance and coefficient of variation of distance during maneuvers were taken as the dependent variables from this.

<H3>Results</H3>
	All subjects were able to complete the series without suffering any untoward reaction while driving. Road-tracking performance in the standard test was impaired in a dose-related manner by THC and confirmed the results obtained in the previous closed highway study. The 100&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a slight elevation in mean SDLP, albeit not statistically significant. The 200&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a significant elevation, of dubious practical relevance. The 300&#160;&#181;g/kg dose produced a highly significant elevation which may be viewed as practically relevant but unexceptional in comparison with similarly measured effects of many medicinal drugs. After marijuana smoking, subjects drove with an average speed that was only slightly lower than after a placebo and very close to the prescribed level.<P>
	In the car-following test, subjects maintained a distance of 45&#173;50&#160;m while driving in the successive placebo conditions. They lengthened mean distance by 8, 6 and 2&#160;m in the corresponding THC conditions after 100, 200 and 300&#160;&#181;g/kg, respectively. The initially large drug-placebo difference and its subsequent decline is a surprising result. Our explanation for this observation is that the subjects' caution was greatest the first time they undertook the test under the influence of THC and progressively less thereafter. The reaction time of the subjects to changes in the preceding vehicle's speed increased following THC treatment, relative to placebo. The administered THC dose was inversely related to the change in reaction time, as it was to distance. However, increased reaction times were partly due to longer distance. Statistical adjustment for this confounding variable resulted in smaller and non-significant increases in reaction time following marijuana treatment, the greatest impairment (0.32 s) being observed in the first test following the lowest THC dose. Distance variability followed a similar pattern as mean distance and reaction time; the greatest impairment was found following the lowest dose.


<H2>Study 3: Driving in urban traffic</H2>

<H3>Methods</H3>
	The program proceeded to the third driving study, which involved tests conducted in high-density urban traffic. There were logical and safety reasons for restricting the THC dose to 100&#160;&#181;g/kg. It was given to a group of regular marijuana (or hashish) users, along with a placebo. For comparative purposes, another group of regular alcohol users was treated with a modest dose of its members' preferred recreational drug, ethanol, or a placebo, before undertaking the same city driving test. Two groups participated, each composed of sixteen new subjects comprising equal numbers of men and women. Subjects in the alcohol group were regular users of alcohol, but not marijuana. Both groups were treated on separate occasions with the active drug and a placebo. Marijuana was administered to deliver 100&Ecirc;&#181;g/kg THC. The driving test commenced 30 minutes after smoking. The alcohol dose was chosen to yield a BAC approaching 0.05&#160;g% when the driving test commenced 45 minutes after onset of drinking. Active drug and placebo conditions were administered double-blind and in a counterbalanced order in each group.<P>
	Driving tests were conducted in daylight over a constant 17.5 km route within the city limits of Maastricht. Subjects drove their placebo and active-drug rides through heavy, medium and low density traffic on the same day of the week, and at the same time of day. Two scoring methods were employed in the present study. The first, a 'molar' approach, required the driving instructor acting as the safety controller during the tests to rate the driver's performance retrospectively using a standard scale. The second, a more 'molecular' approach, involved the employment of a specially trained observer who applied simple and strict criteria for recording when the driver made or failed to make each in a series of observable responses at predetermined points along a chosen route.

<H3>Results</H3>
	The study showed that a modest dose of alcohol (BAC = 0.034&#160;g%) produced a significant impairment in city driving, as measured by the molar approach, relative to a placebo. More specifically, alcohol impaired both vehicle handling and traffic maneuvers. Marijuana, administered in a dose of 100&Ecirc;&#181;g/kg THC, on the other hand, did not significantly change mean driving performance as measured by this approach. Neither alcohol nor marijuana significantly affected driving performance measures obtained by the molecular approach, indicating that it may be relatively insensitive to drug-induced changes.<P>
	Driving quality, as rated by the subjects, contrasted with observer ratings. Alcohol impaired driving performance according to the driving instructor, but subjects did not perceive it; marijuana did not impair driving performance, but the subjects themselves perceived their driving performance as such. Both groups reported about the same amount of effort in accomplishing the driving test following a placebo. Yet only subjects in the marijuana group reported significantly higher levels of invested effort following the active drug. Thus there is evidence that subjects in the marijuana group were not only aware of their intoxicated condition, but were also attempting to compensate for it. These seem to be important findings. They support both the common belief that drivers become overconfident after drinking alcohol and investigators' suspicions that they become more cautious and self-critical after consuming low doses of THC, as smoked marijuana.


<H2>Discussion</H2>

The results of the studies corroborate those of previous driving simulator and closed-course tests by indicating that THC in inhaled doses up to 300&#160;&#181;g/kg has significant, yet not dramatic, dose-related impairing effects on driving performance. Standard deviation of lateral position in the road-tracking test was the most sensitive measure for revealing THC's adverse effects. This is because road-tracking is primarily controlled by an automatic information processing system which operates outside of conscious control. The process is relatively impervious to environmental changes, but highly vulnerable to internal factors that retard the flow of information through the system. THC and many other drugs are among these factors. When they interfere with the process that restricts SDLP, there is little the afflicted individual can do by way of compensation to restore the situation. Car-following and, to a greater extent, city driving performance depend more on controlled information processing and are therefore more accessible for compensatory mechanisms that reduce the decrements or abolish them entirely.<P>
	THC's effects after doses up to 300&#160;&#181;g/kg never exceeded alcohol's at BACs of 0.08&#160;g% and were in no way unusual compared to many medicinal drugs (Robbe 1994). Yet THC's effects differ qualitatively from many other drugs, especially alcohol. Evidence from the present and previous studies strongly suggests that alcohol encourages risky driving whereas THC encourages greater caution, at least in experiments. Another way THC seems to differ qualitatively from many other drugs is that the former's users seem better able to compensate for its adverse effects while driving under the influence.<P>
	Although THC's adverse effects on driving performance appeared relatively small in the tests employed in this program, one can still easily imagine situations where the influence of marijuana smoking might have a dangerous effect; i.e., emergency situations which put high demands on the driver's information processing capacity, prolonged monotonous driving, and after THC has been taken with other drugs, especially alcohol. Because these possibilities are real, the results of the present studies should not be considered as the final word. They should, however, serve as the point of departure for subsequent studies that will ultimately complete the picture of THC's effects on driving performance.

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Current state of hemp breeding in C.I.S.</H1>

In the course of the last 30 years, the amount of land used in hemp production area in the former USSR as well as present-day Russia has been incessantly decreasing. Prior to the disintegration of the USSR, hemp was produced on 50-60 thousand hectares. However, the reduction in crop acreage was basically due to a mistaken government economic strategy, in which they preferred to purchase hemp fibre abroad, spending the equivalent of over US $200 million per year instead of developing domestic production. This policy resulted in the absence of complex harvest and post-harvest mechanized procedures and in insufficient funding of hemp breeding programmes.<P>
Despite these constraints, a number of regions (Poltava, Oryol, Krasnodar, etc.) produced good yields of fibre (1.0-1.2 tons/hectare) and seed (0.6-0.8 tons/hectare).


<H2>Fiber varieties</H2>
Breeding also progressed. Conventional breeding techniques were applied: hybridization, followed by continuous family/group selection. In later stages of seed production, mass selection methods were used.<P> 
The unceasing 20 year systematic selection for higher fiber content, performed at the All-Union Research Institute of Bast Crops (in Glukhov, Ukraine), increased this parameter by 13.8%, achieving a total plant fiber content of 35-37% in a number of varieties.<P>
These breeding programmes were based on the accessions of the plant genetic resources collection of the Vavilov Institute (VIR). For instance, cv. Yuzhnosozrevayushchaya Odnodomnaya 14 (YUSO-14) produced by the Institute was bred by family/group selection methods on progeny from crosses of female YUSO-1 (VIR Cat. no. 429*) and pollen from the monoecious Bernburg hemp of the former East Germany. This resulting cultivar now covers nearly half of the present hemp production area of Russia and is fairly uniform in its sexual expression, monoecious pistillate hemp accounting for up to 90% of the plants. Agricultural production of this strain yielded 1.0-1.2 tons of fiber and 1.3-1.5 tons of seed per hectare.<P> 
Cv. YUSO-16 has been bred from the French monoecious hemp cultivar Fibrimon 56 (VIR 537*). This cultivar is notable for a low cannabinoid content and a long vegetative period. Average fibre yield is 2.0 tons/hectare and seed yield is 1.0-1.2 tons/hectare.<P>
Cv. Dneprovskaya Odnodomnaya 6, a southern hemp cultivar, has been obtained by hybridization of the Hungarian cultivar Szegedy 9 (VIR 437) with Fibrimon 56 (VIR 537*), followed by family/group selection. This cultivar has high fibre yield (31.5%) and a seed yield of 0.55 ton/hectare. Plant height is up to 2.5 meters. 


<H2>Low-THC varieties</H2>

One of the priorities for the next few years of hemp breeding may be to obtain cultivars without active drug substances. In the initial breeding phase, the recommended cultivars with low cannabinoid content will be YUSO-14, YUSO-16 and Dnepropetrovskaya Odnodomnaya 6. The next phase will be marked by developing the cultivar Yuzhnosozrevayushchaya Odnodomnaya (YUSO-31), which contains half the THC content and ripens 5-6 days earlier than YUSO-14, but gives the same yields. An even lower cannabinoid content has been noticed in cv. Zolotonozhskaya YUSO-11.<P>
In recent years, the Krasnodar Research Institute of Agriculture has accomplished a series of experiments on breeding southern hemp with an absence of active cannabinoids. Selection of southern hemp without cannabinoids has been closely linked to breeding for higher fibre content and yield. This breeding was based on the families identified by means of multiphase family/group selection in the hybrid Szegedy 9 (VIR 437) X Krasnodarskaya 56 with individual analysis of each plant for its seed weight, stem fibre content and flower cannabinoid content, followed by testing of the identified families. Ten phases of selection resulted in a dioecious cultivar of southern hemp, Kuban, having a vegetative period of 160 days, only 20% of the THC content of the Krasnodarskaya 35 standard, a fibre content of 28.3%, a seed yield of 0.35 ton/hectare and a plant height of 260 cm. This cultivar is being produced commercialy on an area of 3,000 hectares.<P> 
Hemp breeders mastered a method which made it possible to identify cannabinoid content by thin-layer chromatography of selected leaves from each crop during the period from budding to flowering. This led to the establishment of the Transpollination Direction Nurseries (TDN) where plants were discarded or selected in accordance with precise data on their THC contents. In 1990, application of this method resulted in such new cultivars as YUSO-42 and YUSO-45, with THC contents of 0.004 and 0.007%, respectively.<P> 
Recently, a rapid method for plant cannabinoid content analysis has been developed on the basis of a qualitative reaction, and this has now been introduced into practice. It takes just 10-13 seconds to analyze each plant in the field before budding. Thus it is now possible to discard cannabinoid-containing plants before budding, greatly increasing the efficiency of selection against this trait and allowing a wider range of initial breeding stock. It should be noted that breeding for the absence of cannabinoids is accompanied by strict control over commercially valuable traits, despite the fact that practically no interrelationship between yield and cannabinoid content has been established.

<H2>Seed varieties</H2>

Hemp is cultivated primarily for fibre production, but hemp seed is also important. Seeds contain approximately 30-35% oil, which is used widely for industrial purposes and in food production. Optimum ratios of the fatty acids depend on the purpose of the oil. Industrial utilization requires a quick-drying oil with a high content of polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. These fatty acids are also highly desirable for human nutrition, but their chemical lability causes them to spoil easily in the presence of air and light. This imparts an unpleasant flavor to mishandled oils and requires special precautions to preserve oil freshness.<P> 
The Department of Industrial Crops of the VIR in cooperation with the Biochemistry Laboratory have analyzed 100 hemp accessions of different origins, including 48 domestic and 52 foreign varieties acquired by the VIR which are characterized by good fibre quality and low drug content. Plantings were performed in the fields of the Ustimovka Experimental Station of the VIR (Poltava Province, 1983-1985). In spite of the plant varieties being from widely diverse origins, the variability in their seed fatty acid content was not large. Average data reported for three years revealed that palmitic content varied from 5.8 to 7.4%, stearic acid from 1.6 to 3.0%, oleic acid from 10.6 to 15.3%, linoleic acid from 55.6 to 59.5%, and linolenic acid from 16.2-24.3%.<P> 
Relatively high in linoleic acid (over 22%) were the accessions from Uzbekistan (VIR 455*), Armenia (VIR 482), Hungary (VIR 548*), and the cultivars Maikopskaya 1 (VIR 491*), Dneprovskaya 4 (VIR 510), Dneprovskaya 5 (VIR 511). High oil content (over 35%) was identified in the accessions from Daghestan (VIR 524), Karachaevo-Cherkessia (VIR 525), Hungary (VIR 481, VIR 535), Yugoslavia (VIR 479*) and cv. Maikopskaya 1 (VIR 491*).


<H2>Conclusions</H2>

Hemp breeding faces a series of complex problems which may be solved by wide utilisation of the global hemp germplasm collection stored at VIR. For this purpose, it would be necessary to perform in depth and complex studies of the accessions in this collection, especially of the monoecious drug-free varieties identified for their earliness. Research should aim to identify sources of flexibility, firmness and other fibre quality traits, including disease and pest resistance, and sources of variation in oil yield and quality. It is necessary to create varieties with more economically valuable traits by individual selection, applying the express method of cannabinoid content evaluation, and to perform hybridization with the purpose of uniting all required parameters in a single genotype. This would result in obtaining early ripening monoecious materials for breeding, which would also possess high productivity and high quality of fiber and oil.<P>
It is necessary to conduct research on the genetics of sexual, technological and biochemical characteristics, lack of which impedes the efficiency of hemp breeding.<P> 

* = Accessions no longer maintained in the VIR collection. The remainder of the accessions noted in this article are threatened with extinction. A concerted effort must be made to preserve these valuable accessions for future breeders.

Houses have always been built out of what was around &#151; mostly stones and lumber. But where stones and trees were scarce, chopped straw mixed with a soil, rich in clay, was a common material. Modern building with hemp is very different from this old technique, yet it too allows for building with what grows around you. (At least in a country like France, where hemp is a legal crop).<P>
Hemp, when grown for fiber, is sown very densely, so as to grow into branchless slender stalks that so resemble straw that French farmers call them hemp straw (&quot;paille de chanvre&quot;). After harvest, the long fibers that make up to about 25% of the hemp stalks are removed. In some parts of the world, like China, these fibers are still spun and woven into cloth. In France, the machinery presently used to remove the fibers from the stalk does not allow processing of the fibers into a thread strong enough to be woven into cloth.<P>
Hemp is still grown for its fiber but today, in France, these are entirely bought by paper making companies (mostly by de Mauduy, a French company now belonging to Kimberley Clarke). Added to ordinary wood pulp, hemp fibers make &quot;specialty paper&quot; particularly pliable and resistant, for banknotes or cigarette paper.

<H2>For cats and horses, too</H2>

The strong fibers are what hemp has always been grown for. Yet
after the fibers have been removed from the stalk, there remains
about 75% of the plant. This bulky by-product, known as hurd (&quot;ch&egrave;nevotte&quot;
in French) looks like fine wood chips, only much lighter. Hemp
hurds are extremely absorbent: they will soak up about five times
their own weight in moisture. They are commercialised in France
by the hemp growers co-op &quot;La Chanvri&#143;re de l'Aube&quot;,
as bedding for livestock under the brand name &quot;Aubiose&quot;.
Aubiose is used, in particular, for race horses, who will have
nothing but the best. The most minute hurd particles are molded
into pellets and commercialized as cat litter. These were first
made by La Chanvri&#143;re de l'Aube, who commercializes them
as &quot;Biochat&quot; in France, or &quot;All Hugro&quot; in
Germany. Since hemp growing became legal in England in 1993, cats
there can enjoy the same product, made out of British hemp, known
as &quot;Posh Paws&quot;. Hemp hurds are not only very absorbent,
they are also uncommonly rich in silica, a chemical compound naturally
occurring as sand or flint. The high mineral content of hemp hurds
brings us naturally to one of their most interesting applications:
building. Hemp hurds mixed with lime undergo a process of mineralisation,
sometimes referred to as &quot;petrification&quot; (changing into
stone).

<H2>Midway between mineral and vegetable kingdoms</H2>

In France, where houses have been built with hemp hurds as the
main material (apart from the wooden structure), there are slight
differences in technique. But the basic process is the same: hemp
hurds are mixed with natural lime (not cement !) and water. Sometimes
plaster of Paris (pure gypsum) or sand is added. The mixing can
be done in a cement mixer and at this stage the resulting mix
does look a bit like cement. It can be poured like cement, likewise
it hardens and becomes mold and insect resistant. And yet it retains
some of the virtues proper to plant matter: the resulting material,
which becomes a lighter, tawny color when dry, has a texture vaguely
reminiscent of cork. It is many times lighter than cement (which
workers fully appreciate) and it offers both thermal and sonic
insulation. The mixture sets in a matter of hours, while the process
of &quot;petrification&quot; continues.<P>
The mix can be poured as a floor, or between sheets of plywood
(which will be removed a few hours later) for walls. Here one
material replaces several layers of conventional building materials:
bricks or cement, vapor barrier, insulation, and plaster board.
All that is needed, inside as well as outside, is a whitewash
finish (with or without pigments added). Alternatively, for interior
use, the look of the material can be preserved with a simple waxing
or varnishing, which brings out the cork-like structure of the
material.

<H2>Different schools of thought</H2>

Can the basic process of petrification of hemp hurds be improved?
This is where people working in this field disagree. The hemp
farmers co-op that initially perfected this technique (La Chanvri&#143;re
de l'Aube) registered a patent for a process that coats the hurds
with silica. The prepared hurds, meant for building, are commercialized
under the brand name &quot;Canobiote&quot;. &quot;Isochanvre&quot;
is another brand name for a similar product, prepared in another
hemp-growing area (near Le Mans). Canobiote and Isochanvre look
identical, though the latter is almost twice as expensive. Isochanvre
costs about 800 FF per cubic meter, Canobiote about 500 FF. France
P&eacute;rier, the woman who developed Isochanvre, initially worked
for La Chanvri&egrave;re de l'Aube, promoting Canobiote (and then
left to start her own business). She insists that Isochanvre is
a better product, though it is not clear exactly in what way.<P>
Finally there are those like Yves Kh&uuml;n who think that regular
hemp hurds, untreated, just as nature made them, are as perfect
as can be for the petrification process to best take place &#151;
provided the right kind of lime or plaster of Paris, is used.
He calls this technique &quot;Canosmose&quot;.<P>
This former solo dancer with the prestigious B&#142;jart company,
now an entrepreneur who works with his architect wife, maintains
that coating the hurds with silica makes them less absorbent,
which in turn interferes with the petrification process. He therefore
prefers to use the hurds as they are, and points out that they
are also much cheaper that way (only 270 FF per cubic meter).<P>
Whatever form of hurd is used, it certainly provides a very attractive
building material, one that is both healthy for people to live
in and environmentally friendly.<P>

<h2>Historical overview</h2>

<p>The cultivation and use of hemp in Germany has a long history
(Krber-Grohne 1988). The earliest findings of hemp-based ropes
and fabrics in Europe were made in the Stuttgart area and can be
dated back to the pre-Roman period (800-400 BC). Fabrics were not
yet made from processed hemp fibers, but from the bast stripped
from the plant's stem. During the early Middle Ages, retting, a
biological process for the separation of plant fibers which had
been used for flax, was transferred to hemp. The nutritious hemp
seeds have been used as a food staple since the Middle Ages and
early descriptions of the plant's medical applications date back
to the 16th century. To this day, traditional hemp dishes are
prepared in some of the former German provinces, such as the
Silesian hemp soup made from hemp seeds and millet (Pelz and
Kretschmer 1977).</p>

<p> In the 14th century, the traditional Chinese art of making
paper arrived in Germany <i>via</i> Italy. Exclusively used as
raw material were rags from flax and hemp textiles. Wood based
paper came into use only after mechanical and chemical pulping
was developed in the mid eighteen hundreds in Germany and
England, respectively. Because of the significantly lower costs
of wood, often obtained by clear-cutting, flax and hemp as
resources for the pulping industry were rapidly displaced.</p>

<p> Hemp experienced its heyday in Germany in the 17th century.
Because of the high tensile strength of its fibers and their
tolerance of moisture, essentially all sails, tows, nets, flags,
and uniforms for the growing fleet of sailing ships were made
from hemp. Within the boundaries of what later became Germany,
hemp was grown on an area of approximately 150,000 hectares (ha).</p>

<p> The decline of hemp in Germany began in the 18th century,
when technical improvements simplified the processing of cotton.
This subsequently displaced flax and hemp from the textile market
because their processing remained labor intensive. The concurrent
decline in sailing caused the loss of yet another important
market for hemp fibers.</p>

<p> </p>

Germany), BRD = Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). </p>

<hr size="4">

<p>In the 19th century, jute and sisal, novel fiber plants from
the colonies, were introduced to Germany. Jute in particular
competed with hemp in its traditional domains at only half the
price because of the pittance paid to workers in the colonies. At
the same time, German hemp came under pressure from cheaper hemp
imports from Russia. The already mentioned displacement by wood
in the pulping sector resulted in the loss of yet another market
for hemp fibers. Figure 1 demonstrates the steady decrease in
acreage used for hemp cultivation in Germany during the 19th and
20th century, before it essentially ceased in 1915. </p>

<h2>During the world wars</h2>

<p>Hemp became a war profiteer during the two world wars. Cut off
from its overseas supplies of cotton, jute, sisal and ramie, the
German governments reconsidered hemp and supported improvements
to cultivation, harvesting and processing technologies. For
example, the development of the so-called cottonization process
allowed production of a short-fiber, high-quality cotton
substitute from hemp fiber. During the 1920s, the substitution of
all cotton imports by cottonized domestic hemp was seriously
discussed. It would have required an area of approximately one
million hectares (Gminder 1924). While these considerations were
driven mainly by a desire for self-sufficiency, they still
demonstrate the potential which was attributed to hemp fiber.
Towards the end of World War II, hemp was grown in Germany on
about 21,000 ha, which supplied approximately 20% of the demand
for hemp fiber. Most of the balance was imported from Italy.</p>

<p> Of high relevance today are the various fiber separation and
processing technologies, which were intensively developed and
tested in Germany after the turn of the century in order to
expand the range of applications for hemp fiber and to lower
production costs. A comprehensive summary of these developments
can be found in the book <i>Hemp and Hard Fiber</i> by Herzog <i>et
al.</i> (1927). </p>

<h2>Post war developments</h2>

<p>After World War II, the cultivation of hemp in Germany rapidly
shrank to insignificant levels, mainly due to the competition
from imported natural fibers and the newly developed synthetic
fibers. In the former GDR (East Germany) the cultivation of hemp
survived through the late 1960s. Despite the concurrent decline
of German hemp research, researchers were able to breed several
varieties which combined a high fiber yield with a low content of <i>delta</i>-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of hemp (Bredemann 1952,
Bredemann <i>et al.</i> 1961). These varieties are now considered
lost in Germany, but their existence elsewhere (e.g., Russian
gene banks) is conceivable.</p>

<p> The final blow to the cultivation of fiber hemp in West
Germany was dealt by the 1982 amendments to the federal narcotics
act (BtMG) which outlawed the cultivation of hemp, regardless of
its THC content. Exemptions may only be granted for scientific
purposes or in the case of public interest. To this day, these
amendments effectively ban the commercial cultivation of hemp in
Germany. In 1981, they also forced the last West German hemp
farmer, Martin Butter, to give up his production (Karus <i>et al.</i>
1994). At the time, he employed 15 persons involved in the
cultivation of hemp on 150 ha of land. Fibers were sold to
manufacturers of ropes, textiles and cigarette paper. The woody
core (shives or hurds) of the stems was used locally to produce
building materials, such as particle board and pellets for
thermal insulation. The leaves were used as litter in stables.
Instead of taking his case to the European Court (the European
Community had already permitted the cultivation of low-THC
varieties at that time) Butter accepted a DM 800,000 settlement
from the German government.</p>

<p> Subsequently, agricultural research on hemp essentially
ceased. One of the few exceptions is the work of Prof. Megnet who
investigated, in the early 1980s, whether hemp could be grown on
soils contaminated with heavy metals. Initial results indicated
that the fibers remain virtually free of heavy metals. However,
Megnet soon had to abandon his work because of governmental
requirements he could not comply with.</p>

<p> When renewable bioresources, such as flax, were rediscovered
in Germany in the 1980s, hemp was simply ignored. The knowledge
of its potential uses had largely been lost within just a few
decades. Younger agricultural scientists and engineers knew hemp
merely as an exotic drug plant, not as a traditional, domestic
fiber resource.</p>

<p> At this point, only one agricultural use of hemp in Germany
has been exempted from this general prohibition: as a pollen
insulator in the commercial breeding of beets. No other plant
forms such impermeable hedges and minimizes undesirable outside
pollination. </p>

<h2>Current research</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s, even this remaining application came under
attack from a Bavarian politician. In this context, the late
Prof. Dambroth at the Agricultural Research Laboratory (FAL) in
Braunschweig was asked to investigate the variability in the THC
content of low- THC varieties and the development of the THC
content during the plant's growth period. Hemp has been grown at
the FAL for research purposes since 1992. Dambroth added to this
program the investigation of the impact of chemical (nitrogen)
fertilizer and plant density on fiber quality, and fiber and seed
yield. Delayed by his death in 1993, the results are now
scheduled for publication in early 1995. Preliminary findings
indicate hemp's comparatively low nitrogen demand and the high
fiber yield of the Hungarian Kompolt variety. </p>

<h2>Rediscovery of the &quot;new &quot; bioresource, hemp</h2>

<p>The rediscovery of hemp in Germany as a promising,
ecologically benign resource was largely triggered by the
publication of <i>The Rediscovery of the Resource Hemp Cannabis
Marihuana</i> in September 1993 (Herer, Brckers, KATALYSE
1993). The book became an immediate bestseller. It contains, in
addition to the German translation of Jack Herer's popular book <i>The
Emperor Wears no Clothes</i>, a historical review of the use of
hemp in Europe by Mathias Brckers and a current scientific
evaluation of the industrial crop hemp by the KATALYSE Institute,
Cologne (Karus <i>et al.</i> 1993, 1994a).</p>

<p> The book was well received by the German media and general
public and caused a downright hemp &quot;avalanche&quot;.
Following a decade-long period of neglect, numerous dissertations
covering a broad range of subjects in the areas of cultivation,
processing and use of hemp are now under way or have already been
published. At the same time, numerous domestic firms are
developing technologies and product lines based on imported hemp.
A number of professionally manufactured products entered the
market in 1994 with good initial success. Total sales in 1994 of
these products are estimated at DM 20-40 million, up from
essentially zero in 1993. Much of the enthusiasm of these firms
is due to hemp's positive marketing image. It results from the
ecological advantages of the bioresource hemp, as well as from
its modern, fresh image caused by the association with its sister
plant, marihuana.</p>

<p> In January 1994, &quot;Die Hanfgesellschaft&quot; (The Hemp
Society) was founded in Berlin as an association of hemp
protagonists in the areas of agriculture, processing, industry
and marketing. Its goal is to promote the reintegration of hemp
into the economic cycle by creating a network of major players,
providing public education and supporting specific projects. The
society's most visible venture is the &quot;Hanfhaus&quot; (Hemp
House) chain. In addition to its Berlin headquarters, it operates
retail outlets in six major German cities which market, under
considerable attention by the media, a wide range of hemp-based
products.</p>

<p> This rapid development in the areas of research, development
and marketing had to manage essentially without public funding.
The federal agencies in charge, the Ministry of Agriculture (BML)
and the Agency for Renewable Bioresources (FNR) are not willing
to fund hemp projects for the time being. Their main objections
are that the cultivation of hemp is still illegal in Germany and
that they do not want to sponsor a plant which would compete with
flax, the promotion of which has received DM 60 million of public
funding to date, without the hoped-for breakthrough.</p>

<p> Meanwhile, the general ban on the cultivation of hemp and its
main supporter, the newly created federal drug administration,
Bundesinstitut f&#159;r Arzneimittel und Medizin-produkte (BAM),
have come under intense public criticism. The debate centers
around the question of whether even low-THC varieties may somehow
be used for the production of marihuana and can therefore not be
tolerated. In this context, the validity of the EU-wide accepted
limit of 0.3% THC content in the upper one third of the leaves is
questioned by BAM. A publication which demonstrates the
irrelevance of the arguments used by the supporters of the ban is
being prepared by the nova-Institute. Results from another recent
study (Karus <i>et al.</i>, 1994b) also suggest that low-THC
varieties cannot be misused as a drug and that the EU limit of
0.3% is sufficient.</p>

<p> Prior to presenting potential solutions for this somewhat
muddled situation, the major ongoing R&amp;D activities in
Germany in the various sectors will be summarized in the
following. </p>

<h2>Cultivation tests</h2>

<p>In addition to the already mentioned tests at the FAL
Braunschweig, several cultivation tests have been approved in
1994 by the authorities as scientifically useful, and are now
being carried out at various universities. Worth mentioning are
tests at the Humboldt University, Berlin aimed at the cultivation
of low-THC varieties, and an investigation of the suitability of
hemp as boiler fuel at the Gesamthochschule Kassel. </p>

<h2>Harvesting and fiber separation</h2>

<p>Innovative harvesting and fiber separation processes for flax
plants have been researched and developed on a laboratory scale
in Germany for the last decade. Various public and private
institutions were involved in this program, supported by
considerable amounts of public funding (approximately DM 60
million). The primary goal of this program is the development of
ecologically benign processes which produce fiber material with
high yields and standardized quality, particularly for industrial
fiber use, at a competitive price. A detailed understanding of
the product characteristics demanded by industry, and the
identification and quantification of their respective fiber
parameters are essential for the achievement of this goal. This
approach was based on the desire to eliminate the dependence of
flax sales on short-lived trends in textile fashion and to create
stable markets in the industrial sector. Studies carried out
under this program suggest that market potentials for short flax
fibers exist, particularly as substitute for glass and mineral
fibers and in the production of press-molded parts.</p>

<p> Various fiber separation processes, based on the use of steam
explosion, detergents, or ultrasound have now been developed on
the laboratory scale. While the quality of the produced fibers
has been met with keen interest from industry, these technologies
still lack demonstration on the pilot and production scales. Most
advanced at this point are purely mechanical methods which
combine harvest and separation. They provide a limited range of
product qualities or serve as preprocessing step for the already
mentioned biochemical or physical processes.</p>

<p> Despite this favorable starting position, the implementation
of innovative flax technologies has been slowed down considerably
due to the virtual elimination of public funding.</p>

<p> These initial results from the R&amp;D program for flax are
highly relevant for the use of hemp as well. For a fraction of
the funds spent to date on flax, the results could also be
applied to the use of hemp fiber. These favorable starting
conditions raise the hope that hemp, with its players being fresh
and not yet involved in quarrels, and its modern marketing image,
may bring about the breakthrough for both domestic fiber
resources, flax and hemp. Consequently, major players in the flax
domain, most notably the Institute for Applied Research (IAF) at
the Fachhochschule Reutlingen, have begun in 1994 to apply these
newly developed technologies to hemp. This includes a detailed
analysis of the fiber's characteristics. However, to get off the
ground at a pace that could satisfy the rapidly growing demand,
demonstration projects are essential. Obtaining adequate public
or private funding of such projects is difficult as a result of
the recent funding priorities in post-reunification Germany. The
implementation of a modern facility for the separation and
processing of hemp and flax fibers should be the natural focus of
these efforts. </p>

<h2>Pulp and paper</h2>

<p>In 1993, Schneidershne, Germany's largest paper
manufacturer, introduced its first hemp-based paper products, and
presently markets a complete line of hemp paper. The collection
includes basic paper for the production of books, as well as four
different varieties of graphical papers under the names
Sativaprint (stationery) and Luxosativa (art paper). The papers
are based on mixtures of bleached hemp pulp and de-inked recycled
paper, most commonly 50/50 blends. Since the fall of 1994, paper
based on 100% hemp pulp is also available. Sales of 500 (metric)
tons are anticipated for 1994, corresponding to revenues of DM
4-5.5 million.</p>

<p> The hemp pulp is provided by the Spanish firm Celesa,
currently the sole supplier in Western Europe. The comparatively
high prices for hemp pulp, approximately DM 4,000/ton, are due in
part to its monopoly position. However, ongoing developments in
the pulp supply will soon break this monopoly, resulting in lower
prices and improving the cost competitiveness of hemp pulp.</p>

<p> A remodeled pulp mill is scheduled for startup near Dresden
in early 1995. It will be capable of producing 6,000 tons per
year of pulp based on hemp, flax and linseed. Both unbleached and
hydrogen peroxide bleached pulp will be offered. Hemp tow,
initially imported from Eastern Europe, will be the raw material
for the hemp pulp. Prior to pulping it will be cut to a fiber
length of 2-6 millimeters. Schneiders&#154;hne will not remain
the sole buyer of hemp pulp produced in Germany. Several German
firms are also interested in the use of hemp pulp for
manufacturing technical and household filters. Their main
motivation is the development of product lines which provide
ecological benefits compared to wood pulp based products. For
example, hemp-based filter papers are more resistant to moisture
and can meet quality requirements without the addition of
synthetic resins. The first of these products will likely be
introduced in early 1995.</p>

<p> The major German producer of cigarette paper, EFKA-Werke,
introduced 100% hemp based paper for the first time in the summer
of 1994. These Cauma hemp papers were introduced successfully
by a smart marketing campaign. The paper is manufactured in
France where all of the hemp pulp produced is converted
domestically to paper. </p>

<h2>Textiles</h2>

<p>The market for hemp-based textiles has grown much faster than
was expected based on the results from previous studies. Since
early 1994, the Hemp House chain has successfully marketed
various kinds of hemp textiles, such as denim-type jackets and
pants. The textiles are predominantly manufactured in Hungary.
Over the last several months, ecologically minded textile
companies have shown an increased interest in the bioresource
hemp. It can be expected that fabrics and garments, some of them
probably produced in Germany, will soon be available on the
market, sold not only by outlets specializing in hemp products
but also by ecologically oriented mail-order businesses and
boutiques.</p>

<p> Apparently, the German market is particularly open for
natural hemp fiber because the ecological aspects are taken more
seriously in the textile sector there, and because natural
fiber-based textiles, well suited for a strict eco-labeling, are
rare and expensive. The positive marketing image of hemp will
further contribute to the development of markets which are not as
accessible to flax.</p>

<p> A frequently heard argument is that hemp fiber is not well
suited for the production of soft and easy-care textiles, which
provide the familiar cotton comfort. However, initial tests in
the textile industry have shown that certain environmentally
friendly, predominantly mechanical processes allow improvements
in the everyday-wear characteristics of hemp textiles. Additional
processes are currently being developed. The already mentioned
use of cottonized short fibers, instead of the traditional long
fiber, will create further opportunities for hemp, once the
process is established on the full-scale level. This may allow
hemp to make inroads into the market now held by cotton-based
textiles in the not too distant future. </p>

<h2>Building materials</h2>

<p>Following publication of the &quot;Hanf&quot; book in Germany,
the already strong domestic ecologically-oriented building
movement developed a high level of interest in the use of hemp
shives as a material for construction. Most popular to date has
been the French product ISOCHANVRE which is used as a building
and thermal insulation material. In 1994, ISOCHANVRE was first
used in Germany, in combination with lime, as an insulating
plaster in the remodeling of older buildings. A German company
has been using hemp shives for the construction of floors since
1957. Current efforts to use shives in the production of
ecological particle boards and building blocks are also
promising.</p>

<p> In the long-term, the use of hemp fiber may become more
important for the building industry. Potential products include
light-weight construction boards, fiber-cement boards and
fiber-reinforced plaster. Earlier this year, a German firm
introduced flax fiber-based insulating mats which substitute for
rock wool mats and provide the same level of thermal insulation.
The company is also developing hemp tow based mats but will
suspend their release until domestic hemp is available, since
they deem the necessary long-distance transport of the tow
ecologically unacceptable. </p>

<h2>Hemp oil</h2>

<p>The characteristics and potential uses of hemp seed oil are
the subject of several ongoing studies in academia and industry.
Initial results show that hemp oil is one of the most valuable
vegetable oils, both for food and technical applications. The
research focuses on various aspects which had been investigated
previously for oil seeds other than hemp. This includes, for
example, the composition of the fatty acid spectrum of hemp oil
from various sources, shifts in this spectrum during plant
growth, the biodegradability of hemp oil based detergents, and
taste and durability of hemp oil.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It can be expected that the application for registration of
hemp oil as an edible oil will be initiated in early 1995. In
1994, an Austrian firm surprised the public with the presentation
of a complete line of hemp oil-based personal care products, such
as soap, shampoo, bubble bath etc. A German firm recently
introduced a hemp oil perfume which is based on a 19th century
recipe. </p>

<h2>Medical uses</h2>

<p>The potential medical applications of hemp, or rather
cannabinoids, have been under a taboo in Germany for a long time
and cannabinoid research is virtually non-existent. This
situation is now changing, due in part to the translation of the
well-known book &quot;Marihuana - the forbidden medicine&quot; by
Grinspoon and Bakalar (1993), which was complemented by a review
of the results from recent medical research and a summary of the
legal and medical situation in Germany (Grotenhermen and Karus
1994). This and a concurrent modification of the federal
narcotics act (BtMG) which simplified clinical tests with <i>delta</i>-9-THC
are likely to result in an increase in the research of
cannabinoids in the near future. </p>

<h2>Forecast</h2>

<p>At this point, it can only be speculated how the current
German prohibition on the cultivation of low-THC hemp will
eventually be overcome. Ongoing legal activities include a law
suit filed by the agricultural association GAIA against BAM with
a Berlin court. The subject is permission to cultivate hemp on a
110 ha plot near Berlin. While filing a suit with the European
Court is another promising strategy, this route has not been
taken because of the costs and time involved. Administratively
the easiest way to eliminate the prohibition is a modification of
the BtMG to EU guidelines as part of its routine adjustment, a
process which is carried out almost annually without much
publicity. The fact that a majority of political players in the
agricultural and environmental arenas, such as the German
Association of Farmers, have already come out in support of the
re-admission of hemp for cultivation suggests that such a change
will probably occur once the cultivation and use of fiber hemp
become more established in other European countries.</p>

<p> Until such time, it is advisable to press forward with the
development of hemp technologies and products and to benefit from
the current favorable technological and marketing conditions in
Germany. Such a strategy would allow hemp to be processed by
modern and ecologically sound technologies and turned into
innovative products as soon as the prohibition on cultivation is
ended. This would effectively close the value-adding chain
between cultivation and marketable product. Thus, the primary
tasks ahead are to overcome the existing lack of funding for hemp
R&amp;D through the use of scientifically founded arguments, and
then to integrate the numerous ongoing activities, undertaken
with much enthusiasm and little financial support, into
professionally coordinated, interdisciplinary projects.</p>

<p> The first steps in this direction are currently being taken.
Only a few examples can be mentioned here. The Hanfgesellschaft
is currently in the planning stages for a large scale
German-Polish hemp cultivation and processing project. Co-funding
from the EU's Eastern Europe Incentive program will be applied
for. The nova-Institute, Cologne, is coordinating the planning
for a major technology project which would focus on research,
development and pilot-scale implementation of innovative,
ecological product lines based on hemp. Finally, the BIOROHSTOFF
HANF (Bioresource Hemp) trade fair and conference will be held in
March 1995 in Frankfurt. BIOROHSTOFF HANF combines the first
international product and technology exhibit with the first
technological-scientific symposium on the subject of hemp as a
bioresource. Scientists, farmers, and developers and vendors of
technology and products from around the world will present the
status of their research, concepts and products. For more
information on this event refer to the announcement on page 64. </p>

<H3>The Dutch hemp-for-paper project</H3>
In February 1994, the final report of the Dutch hemp research programme was presented. It took Dfl 17 million to evaluate several alternatives for a hemp paper production sequence from seed to final product. The most viable sequence was transformed into a business concept (Van Berlo 1993). The developed methods should have provoked a major breakthrough in large-scale hemp processing in the Netherlands. However, the paper industry was not interested in risking an investment in a pilot plant. 
<H3>Hemp-Flax, a new initiative</H3>
Contrary to the paper industry, some people believe that the time is ripe for reintroduction of hemp for fibre. In early 1994, one of the authors (E.D.) founded Hemp-Flax B.V. for the production and processing of hemp and flax. These annual fibre crops may provide a solution to problems in agriculture and industry (and thus the economy). A modern flax processing factory in Nagele, the Netherlands, was purchased and in this facility a new hemp processing line is being installed next to the existing one for flax, which will remain operational. 
<H3>Hemp cultivation</H3>
Several farmers were contracted to cultivate 140 hectares (ha) of hemp in the Veenkoloni&euml;n (N.E. Netherlands) during the summer of 1994. This was the largest hemp cultivation area in the Netherlands in sixty years. The objective of this first season was to explore the agronomy, the logistics, and Dutch markets for hemp. Paper-based products and textile markets were not primary targets for strategic reasons.<P>
The farmers did the soil preparation and sowing according to their own views. Seed from the French monoecious hemp varieties F&#142;dora, F&#142;lina, Fibrimon, and F&#142;drina were supplied by Hemp-Flax. The crop was harvested by Hemp-Flax in cooperation with the farmers. This way, the farmers gained experience and developed various practical methods. The influence of soil structure and water regime on hemp growth were surveyed. Furthermore, liquid manure was demonstrated to be a good fertilizer. The farmers applied for a larger hemp growing area for 1995 because they were enthusiastic about hemp's effect on the soil structure, its cultivation, and its performance. Local youths, who had taken some plants, were probably less enthusiastic about its performance.
<H3>Hemp harvesting</H3>
Although fungicides or pesticides were not used, the losses from <I>Botrytis cinerea</I> and other pathogens were insignificant. Self-thinning, as described by van der Werf (1994), was observed, but the level was unclear. Plant numbers of 50-200 per m<FONT SIZE=1>2 </FONT>have been counted with a sowing density of 30-90 kg/ha. The harvested yield was 6-9 tonnes/ha of air-dried matter. The yield was not expected to be optimal, since farmers had no previous experience with hemp cultivation and harvesting. Several harvesting methods were tested and the most practical method proved to be swath mowing, followed by dew retting and turning of the swath. The air-dried crop was pressed in large bales and transported to a storage place. This harvesting method resulted in clean fibre during the dry period in August and a nicely retted fibre after the wet periods in September, 1994. 
<H3>Hemp processing</H3>
In the factory, hemp bast fibres are separated from the core by a special process developed by Hemp-Flax. Several applications of the bast and core have been optimized. These products include a planting substrate, a building material, non-wovens, bio-filters and adsorbants. Industries that want to explore applications with hemp are welcome to contact Hemp-Flax for consultation and sample material.
<H3>Future developments</H3>
Hemp is a strong natural fibre with great endurance.
The agronomic advantages of hemp over other fibre crops include:
a high yield, reduction of agro-chemical requirements, soil improvement
and weed control. Hemp fibre can replace other natural fibres,
wood, asbestos, glass fibre, steel, polypropylene and polyethylene
(Brouwer 1991). Prices of current artificial and mineral fibres
have increased, which makes substitution by natural fibres possible.
So, sooner or later, hemp will become more attractive as a sustainable
source of fibre produced in the western world. Governmental and
agricultural organizations can help to bring about regulations
which will make it easier for farmers to grow this crop. Regulations
and public acceptance will determine the rate of introduction.
Hemp-Flax B.V. will encourage all parties to grow more hemp, which
will contribute to a more healthy, natural environment.

<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Hemp facts and hemp fiction</H1>
Hayo M.G. van der Werf<P>
International Hemp Association, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, the Netherlands</CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
Jack Herer's book, <I>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</I>, edited by Chris Conrad, Lynn Osburn and Judy Osburn, provides fascinating reading. It was one of the major causes of the enormous increase in interest in fibre hemp in recent years. Although most of the information contained in the book is valid, some of its claims are clearly incorrect.<P>
Like Jack Herer and his editorial team, I am convinced that hemp has real potential as a 'new' crop and that it deserves more attention from farmers and agronomists. We are currently witnessing the renaissance of fibre hemp, but I think this renaissance is not well served by making unrealistic claims regarding the potential of hemp.<P>
Some quotes from <I>The Emperor Wears No Clothes</I> :<P>
&quot;Hemp [...] uses the sun more efficiently than virtually any other plant on our planet&quot; (page 2).<P>
&quot;Depending on which U.S. agricultural report is correct, an acre of full grown hemp plants can sustainably provide from four to 50 or even 100 times the cellulose found in cornstalks, kenaf or sugar cane - the planet's next highest annual cellulose plants&quot; (page 44).<P>
&quot;Hemp hurds are 77 % cellulose&quot; (page 44).<P>
Herer and his editorial team claim that hemp produces higher yields than other crops and that hemp hurds, which make up 60 to 80 % of the stem dry weight, contain 77 % cellulose. These claims are repeated in other books: <I>Energy Farming in America</I> (by Osburn), <I>Hemp, Lifeline to the Future</I> (by Conrad). Both claims are simply wrong.<P>
For a start, cellulose content of hemp hurds has been found to vary between 32 and 38 % (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994). Possibly, Herer confuses the hurds, which form the woody core of the hemp stem, with the bark, which forms the outer layer of the hemp stem. The bark contains the long bast fibres which are used in textile manufacturing. The cellulose content of the bark is much higher than that of the core. It has been found to lie between 53 and 74 % (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994).<P>
One of the objectives of the research I conducted over the last four years was to investigate the yield of hemp relative to that of other crops.<P>
Essentially, all agricultural crops do the same thing: they intercept light with their canopy and, in the leaves, sugars are formed as a result of photosynthesis. Most of the sugars move out of the leaves to other parts of the plant and are transformed into other organic substances, e.g., cellulose and lignin in the stem, and starch, protein and oil in the seed.<P>
When growing conditions are optimal, that is, in the absence of limitations due to lack of water or nutrients, or due to pests, diseases, or other stresses the yield of any crop will depend on:<P>
a) the total amount of light (L) intercepted by the crop canopy during the growing season;<P>
b) the radiation use efficiency (RUE): the amount of dry plant material produced per unit of light intercepted by the canopy;<P>
c) the harvest index (HI): the fraction of the plant parts of economic value in the total plant dry matter produced.<P>
This can be summarized in a simple formula:<P>
<H4>Yield = L x RUE x HI</H4>
Grown side by side under favourable growing conditions, different crops may have different yields. Relative to most other crops grown in the Netherlands, fibre hemp intercepts quite a lot of light (L is high) because the crop can be sown early and it grows well at low temperatures, so the canopy is established rapidly. The radiation use efficiency of fibre hemp is relatively low, probably as the result of the structure of the canopy and the relatively high lignin content in the stem. As with other annual fibre crops, such as flax or kenaf, the harvest index of fibre hemp is relatively high.<P>
In the most favourable growing conditions, we obtained yields of up to 15,000 kg of stem dry matter per hectare (6,070 kg per acre). Under simular conditions, other crops such as maize, sugar beet or potato produced similar dry matter yields. All results indicate that as far its yield is concerned, fibre hemp is in no way exceptional.<P>
These results have been detailed in my thesis, <I>Crop Physiology of Fibre Hemp</I> (<I>Cannabis sativa </I>L.). From these results I cannot help but conclude that the claim that hemp produces higher yields than other crops, simply is not true. This, of course, does not necessarily mean that hemp is not an interesting crop for farmers. I think that hemp is an excellent candidate to fill the niche for an annual fibre crop in temperate climates. Hemp seems to be an attractive crop for a sustainable agricultural system, as it has moderate fertilizer requirements, needs little or no pesticides and suppresses weeds and some major soil-borne pathogens.<P>
<I>Cannabis</I> is certainly a valuable crop plant, and its future succes will depend in part on the responsible dissemination of accurate information concerning its benefits.<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>Re-discovery of the Crop Plant <I>Cannabis</I> Marihuana Hemp<BR> 
(Die Wiederentdeckung der Nutzplanze <I>Cannabis</I> Marihuana Hanf).</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
By Jack Herer, Mathias Br&ouml;ckers  and Katalyse. Zweitausend-eins, Frankfurt am main, Germany. Nineteenth printing, 463 pp.<P>

Judging by its length and the broad spectrum covered, this book could be regarded as a monograph if the style, contents and presentation were not of such a popular nature. It will still fill a definite need, however, since over the past 40-50 years not only has the production and processing of this crop been discontinued in Western Europe, but the plant itself has almost faded into oblivion. One reason for this was the craze for synthetic fiber materials in the late fifties and early sixties (e.g., nylon) which supplanted not only hemp, but flax as well, though they were also unable to compete with cotton. The other reason was the hysterical attitude towards drugs, which started in the USA and had such an influence on other governments. They were poorly informed on this subject, but committed to this campaign for other reasons and even fibre hemp, which is not classified as a drug, was banned from cultivation (as in Germany, for instance). The only exceptions to this were France, where 4,000-5,000 hectares of hemp have always been grown for paper manufacturing purposes, and Holland, with its liberal drug policy, where the sale and consumption of hashish was tolerated in the justified hope that this would distract the attention of the population from harder drugs (e.g. heroin, cocaine etc.). This concept has been a success.<P>
Returning to a criticism of the book itself, it is a pity that the title includes the word marihuana, which is compromised throughout the world. This is hardly the way to popularise hemp. To date, only specialists are aware of the medical effects of THC, while marihuana still has a disreputable sound for society in general.<P>
The book is characterised throughout by an enthusiasm and bias in favour of a good cause that sometimes goes to extremes, leading to material errors and illusory lines of argument. Nevertheless, the book does good service towards the enlightenment of the relevant authorities, organisations and governments in the hope that this propaganda on behalf of hemp will be a success.<P>
The book is a &quot;hybrid&quot;: chapters II and III were written by Germans on the European and specifically German aspects of the plant. While the first chapter, written by the American author Herer, deals mainly with the many-sided practical utilisation of hemp, the German sections attempt to give a certain amount of scientific background: botany, ecological requirements, production technology, etc. Of particular interest are the detailed discussion of the process which finally led, in 1937, to the prohibition of hemp production in the USA and to the banning of research into THC, again in the USA, in 1978, and the description of the road which led to synthetic THC. The struggle being wrought in the USA by marihuana lobbyists at all levels right up to the president also makes fascinating reading, while the arguments and factual information presented on the medicinal action of THC are convincing, as are references to the collusion between the pharmaceutics industry and the government, aimed at maintaining the ban on THC.<P>
Finally, there is a unique summary of the history of hemp cultivation, the like of which, as regards both the extent and richness of data, has never previously been published.<P>
The Americans have every right to complain about the prohibition of hemp production and to lobby for its reauthorisation since the ban was actually lifted for a few years during the war (&quot;Hemp for Victory&quot;), but Western Europeans have no cause to complain about the disappearance of hemp, because they have undeservedly forgotten about it over the last 40 years.<P>
In Western Europe, nobody banned the cultivation of hemp. It was simply ousted by artificial fibres. The largest hemp producing state was Italy, where cultivation also ceased in the sixties, so the statement that hemp is still grown commercially in Italy (p. 269) is incorrect. On the other hand, French hemp production is mentioned as if it had begun again in 1990, although it was never abandoned there, an area of 4,000 - 5,000 hectares having been constantly sown to hemp for paper manufacturing purposes. It was also the French who produced the first low THC monoecious varieties. In Eastern Europe, the production of hemp was never discontinued, though the situation differed considerably from one country to the other. Large-scale production was only carried out in the Soviet Union, Romania, and Hungary, which is not mentioned at all in the book, but where the highest yield averages were produced (9 t stems/ha on 6,000 ha in 1989). Hungary was also the biggest exporter of hemp cloth to the Soviet Union (5 million m<FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT>/year), since it provided the best quality. I do not know where the author found his data on the highly developed hemp production of Romania, because the average yields in this country were actually extremely low. Regarding the Bulgarian hemp production, it was never of great importance and there has been no breeding for the last 30 years.<P>
It is true that no books on hemp have been published in Germany over the last 40 years, but there was no call for such books, as nobody was interested in the subject. It is only now that the time is ripe for this venture. It is also true, however, that in 1961 Prof. Hoffmann devoted a full chapter to hemp breeding in the monumental work by Roemer and Rudorf <I>Handbuch der Pflanzen-z&uuml;chtung</I> in which he made frequent references to the author of this review. A decade later, the book by Hoffmann, Mudra and Plarre, <I>Lehrbuch der Z&uuml;chtung landw. Kulturpflanzen,</I> also discussed hemp breeding at far greater length than was justified by its importance in Germany, and this was repeated in the 2nd edition published in 1980. Finally, in 1988, Prof. Geisler included a brief but correct chapter on hemp production in his book entitled <I>Pflanzenbau</I>. So there was no shortage of literature, just a lack of interest.<P>
It is disappointing to note that both the American and the German authors betray a great deficiency in knowledge on hemp production and research in Eastern Europe, though a book of this calibre deserves to have been supported by more accurate data. Instead,  the authors plead the difficulty of not understanding the language (though the publications always have a German or English summary). I myself, for example, have written four articles in German, published in various German journals, reporting on the results of Hungarian hemp breeding. If the authors had read these articles they would not have written the erroneous statement that monoecious hemp varieties have a 50% higher fibre content than dioecious varieties. The variety with the highest fibre content in the world is, in fact, the Hungarian dioecious variety KOMPOLTI, which was used to improve the fibre content of French varieties and which has a considerably greater stem yield than any monoecious variety. It was also in Hungary that the first hybrid varieties were produced and the first unisexual forms consisting solely of females. Dutch researchers from Wageningen set up the experiments needed for their paper project (p. 344) using the Hungarian variety Kompolti hybrid TC, which proved to have the greatest stem yield.<P>
Romania is often mentioned in the book, though it has only two varieties with moderate yield potential (Fibramulta and Secueni 1). A number of dioecious varieties are available in Italy, but these are not cultivated now. Many monoecious varieties are available at Gluchov in the Ukraine, and many types of harvesters have been developed in Gluchov, but yield averages are very low. It is strange that the book makes no mention of French monoecious hemp varieties (Futura, F&eacute;drina, F&eacute;lina, etc.), although these are grown on the greatest area in EU countries at present.<P>
As already indicated above, over- enthusiasm, sometimes without good groundings, often leads the authors into the dead-end of objective errors and illusory lines of argument. For instance, it is a great exaggeration to calculate that hemp could be grown on 6 million hectares in the EU countries. This would require an enormous infrastructure, for which the funds are simply not available. Several dozen hemp factories, oil plants, spinning and weaving mills and panel-making factories would be needed within the production area, since it is not worth transporting hemp more than 40-50 km even in bales. It is a great error to expect an oil yield of 24 million tons: this is obviously based on the data in Table 12 (p. 452), which have been incorrectly understood from Romanian literature, suggesting that hemp gives a seed yield of 4000 kg/ha (pp. 314, 347, 349). This is a biological absurdity. Present knowledge puts the yield potential of the best seed-producing varieties (mid-Russian) as 1000 kg/ha, which is far lower than that of sunflower, and on average only 600-800 kg can be expected. It follows from this that in Germany rapeseed far surpasses hemp in seed-yielding ability and thus in oil yield. It can thus be seen that hemp is not, and never will be, a mass oil-producing plant, as it produces few seeds. For this reason, its excellent but expensive oil will remain the foodstuff of the rich. Herer's speculation on the conversion of hemp into methanol is equally illusory (p. 105). If even 10% of the many hundreds of millions of tonnes of oil used in the USA each year were to be replaced by hemp methanol, hemp would have to be sown on 5-10 million hectares: the cost of infrastructure and technology would exceed even the capital potential of the USA. In addition, due to transportation problems, thousands of decentralised methanol plants would be required. This belongs to the world of fantasy.<P>
I think it is also unrealistic to expect a dry stem yield of 10-12 t/ha in Germany. This can only be achieved in more southern-lying countries and only with southern (late) varieties.<P>
It is an exaggeration to suggest that hemp fibre could be used without mixing with other fibres to weave the finest cloths (shirts), since it is common knowledge that with the present technology, threads of at most Nm 10-12 can be spun from hemp, compared to Nm 40-50 for flax. The difference in fineness between the two plants requires no explanation. We do know that very fine hemp yarn is made in China using various half-manual technologies. However these processes can not be directly applied in Europe.<P>
In summary, the publication of this book was very timely and provides interesting, convincing and useful reading for all those who wish to work with or perhaps invest in this crop, or who have to teach or study it. Although it is a popular account rather than a scientific work, it will nevertheless prove informative for researchers, since it contains many data which are only otherwise available after long searching in libraries.<P>
The errors and exaggerations listed above do not detract from the usefulness of the book or from the burning desire of the authors to see hemp reinstated to its rightful place among the valuable crops, for the good of humanity. The criticism is not intended to deter the authors, but to encourage them to eliminate the exaggerations and errors from later editions of the book.<P>

<CENTER>61<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Interview</H1>
<FONT SIZE=4>Professor Dr. Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa, the breeder of Kompolti hemp</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa is the eldest and one of the most successful active hemp breeders of Europe. For 40 years, he improved eight state-registered fibre hemp varieties, four of which are still cultivated. The improvement of the first unisex hybrids (pure female F1 originating from a monoecious x dioecious crossing) and the development of Bredemann's idea and method are linked with his name.<P>
During his career he bred only dioecious and unisex hybrids. He used monoecious varieties only as crossing partners because he was convinced (later proven by experimental evidence) that the monoecious varieties produce lower yields than the dioecious ones due to a 20 % inbreeding depression. He also improved the chlorophyll-deficient yellow-stemmed and the spherical ornamental varieties that characterise the extensiveness of his breeding work.<P>
We introduce here a part of this multifarious and rich life-work via interview (12 October 1994).<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
<STRONG>Journal of the IHA:</STRONG> When was hemp introduced to Hungary?<P>
<STRONG>Iv&aacute;n B&oacute;csa:</STRONG> We don't know exactly. The Slavic people, who inhabited what is now Hungary up 'till about 900 AD, probably cultivated hemp. The first written reference to hemp is found in a royal customs bill of Esztergom from 1198 AD (At the time Esztergom was the capital of Hungary, where the kings of the first dynasty ruled). In this 800-year old customs document written in Latin, hemp was mentioned together with flax. At the time, hemp was not imported into Hungary but was an age-old native crop. Until 1860-1870 hemp was grown and processed solely by peasants. After that time, Italian hemp cultivars, which were grown and processed on an industrial scale, were introduced into Hungary. Until 1960, peasant and industrial hemp production coexisted. The forced collectivisation of agriculture in 1960 caused the disappearance of hemp production by peasants.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you get interested in hemp breeding?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In 1949, at the beginning of my career, I was appointed as the assistant of Dr. Rudolf Fleischmann, who founded the Kompolt Research Institute in 1918 and who started working with hemp in 1920. His cultivar &quot;Fleischmann&quot; was very famous in all of Eastern and Central Europe. It replaced the Italian cultivars Carmagnola and Bolognese which were grown until then. Our cultivar &quot;Kompolti&quot; initially originated from &quot;Fleischmann&quot;. After Fleischmann's death in 1951 his 'inheritance' was divided between the three breeders working at Kompolt. As I was the youngest of the three, I got the two crops the others did not want: hemp and alfalfa. Hemp was not an easy crop to do breeding work on, as there was not much literature available. At that time only German and Russian literature was available.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Why have you bred dioecious cultivars while many other hemp breeders have developed monoecious cultivars?

<HR SIZE=4>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> The natural state in which hemp appears was and is dioecious. Monoeciousness is artificial in hemp, it can only exist with the help of man, and without selection, the dioecious state will return in two or three generations. It is therefore very hard and demanding to keep 90 to 95 % monoeciousness during seed multiplications. Apart from that, however, monoecious hemp is appropriate only when the crop is grown for so-called double use, i.e. when both stem and seed are harvested. This is the case in France and in the former Soviet Union, where most crops are grown for double use. In a dioecious crop, the male plants will be strongly deteriorated when the crop is harvested at seed ripeness, so in this case one needs monoecious cultivars. In Hungary and its neighbouring countries, like formerly in Italy, this double use is unknown. Here fibre hemp is grown as a dense crop which is harvested at the time of male flowering (&quot;green hemp&quot;), while seed production takes place in crops grown at a low plant density and with completely different growing techniques. For this 'classic' use monoecious cultivars are of no use, so we never bred a monoecious cultivar.<P>
Furthermore, monoeciousness has two large disadvantages. In the first place, all monoecious cultivars which I tested over the last 20 to 25 years yielded 10 to 20 % less than dioecious cultivars. This is caused by the possibility of self-pollination and the resulting inbreeding. With model experiments and with biometric determinations we have established that 20-25 % of self-pollination takes place in monoecious hemp, and this is the cause of the lower stem yield. In the second place, in monoecious hemp, the genetic progress for fibre content is slow, because the so-called Bredemann principle can not be used. The Bredemann principle consists of the rapid determination of fibre content in male plants before they flower, so that only the males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate the female plants. In a breeding garden (nursery) of one hectare, I have 15,000 to 20,000 plants and I need only the very best 50 to 100 males for the pollination. (This can be compared to breeding of dairy cows, where a few hundred extremely good bulls inseminate all the cows of an entire country.) In monoecious hemp this approach can not be used, so the rate of genetic progress is only 50 % or less of that in dioecious hemp. In spite of these disadvantages, we use a monoecious hemp cultivar in breeding, but only as a parent for unisexual hemp.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Which brings up the next question: why did you develop a unisex cultivar?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> After the collectivization of agriculture in Hungary in the early sixties, the farmers were no longer interested in producing hemp seed, an activity which has not been mechanized until the present day. As a result of this, seed for sowing became scarce and the hemp industry had to import poor-quality land races from Turkey. From the research conducted by McPhee, von Sengbusch and Hoffmann we know that when a monoecious hemp plant pollinates a dioecious female the offspring (F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>) consists for over 90 % of females, for 3-5 % of monoecious plants bearing mainly female flowers and for only 2-3 % of true males. This small number of males however is sufficient to ensure adequate pollination of the crop. As the stand consists mainly of seed-bearing (female + monoecious) plants, with the same habit, we called it unisexual hemp. Such a stand yields 60 - 80 % more seed than a dioecious cultivar. The seed produced on this stand (F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>) is used as sowing seed for fibre production. We called this cultivar &quot;UNIKO-B&quot;. It is, in fact, a &quot;single-cross&quot; between Kompolti and Fibrimon, but it is the F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT> generation which is commercialized. Von Sengbusch and Hoffmann described the phenomenon, but they did not think of its practical use. In Kompolt we make the cross between Kompolti and Fibrimon on a surface of 5 hectare (ha), this yields 2,500 kg of F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> seed. The F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> seed is sown on a surface of 500 ha, yielding 400,000 kg of F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT> seed, which is used to sow 3,000-3,500 ha of fibre hemp.<P>
Unisexuality also can be used to exploit the effect of heterosis which occurs when Chinese and European (Kompolti) cultivars are crossed. This heterosis can increase stem yield by 8-15 %. To be able to cross two cultivars we have to construct a female parent which is &quot;male sterile&quot;, a unisexual F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> can be used as such. In order to obtain a unisexual chinese line we used Fibrimon as the donor, which was backcrossed many times until we obtained a monoecious line with a Chinese habit. We crossed this line with the original dioecious Chinese cultivar to obtain a unisexual Chinese F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>. This F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> was crossed with Kompolti hemp to obtain Kompolti Hybrid TC. The stem yield of Kompolti Hybrid TC  is 5-8 % higher than that of Kompolti. The unisexual Chinese F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT> has an unsurpassed seed yield potential of up to 1,500-1,600 kg per ha.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> You made Kompolti Hybrid TC by crossing populations. Do you think much can be gained by using inbred lines to make hybrids?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> I can not answer this question because I never made inbred lines. It takes too long to make inbred lines and it is technically very difficult.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What techniques did you use to develop your cultivars which have the highest fibre content of all existing hemp cultivars?<P> 
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> As I explained in response to an earlier question, I used the Bredemann principle, which consists of the rapid determination of fibre content in male plants before they flower, so that only the males with the highest fibre content are allowed to pollinate the female plants. In some of my cultivars bark content is 38 - 40 %, this corresponds to a bast fibre content of 32 - 34 %. If the bark content is higher than 40 % the crop may lodge.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How important is fibre quality relative to fibre content?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Fibre quality is negatively related to fibre content. As we continue to select for fibre content we unwillingly increase the proportion of secondary fibre, which has a negative effect on fibre quality.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Do cultivars differ in fibre fineness?
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In a study comparing several cultivars on a number of locations, we found that the differences in fibre fineness between the locations were bigger than the differences between the cultivars.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you develop Panorama, the world's only ornamental hemp cultivar?<P>  
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> In a grow out of hemp from Lebanon we found two or three short and strongly branched plants. This character was lost in the F<FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>, it reappeared in the F<FONT SIZE=2>2</FONT>. Through breeding I obtained a pure variety. We also made a monoecious version, because for an ornamental cultivar it is preferable if there are no male plants which die early. Panorama was commercialized in Hungary in the 1980s, but it was not much sold.<P> 
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> How did you develop Kompolti S&aacute;rgasz&aacute;r&uacute;, the yellow stem hemp cultivar?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Yellow stem was a mutation from professor Hoffmann, it was very early and very short. I crossed and backcrossed it often with the normal Kompolti to improve its stem yield and fibre content. In the end, we reached a very high fibre content, but its stem yield remained 15 % inferior to that of Kompolti. The textile factory liked the yellow stem very much, because in poor weather conditions the yellow stems can be dried in sheafs instead of being dried on the field. If this is done with normal hemp it causes problems because the stems in the middle of the sheaf do not lose their green colour, which eventually has a negative effect on the fibre colour.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> Current hemp cultivars were developed for textile fibre production. Do you think it will be feasible to develop special cultivars for seed production or for paper production?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> For textile production, new cultivars are not needed, because we have maximum stem yield and maximum fibre content. For paper production the high-fibre cultivars are very suitable, the presence of secondary bast fibre is no problem in this case. For seed production we have unisex, the single cross mother of Hybrid TC. It can yield up to 1,600 kg/ha of seed.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What is the present status of your hemp cultivars, which can be bought in commercial quantities and through whom?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> Currently available are Kompolti, UNIKO-B, Kompolti Hybrid TC (but this cultivar contains too much THC for growing it in the EU) and Fibriko, which is like Kompolti Hybrid TC but with Kompolti  S&aacute;rgasz&aacute;r&uacute; instead of Kompolti as the father. Fibriko is not yellow but its fibre quality is better than that of Kompolti Hybrid TC. The cultivars belong to the GATE Agricultural Research Institute, but the institute is not allowed to do business, so a company called Fibroseed was founded. Fibroseed sells seed and pays the royalties to the GATE Institute.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What was the most important discovery or technique in the history of hemp breeding?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> The use of the Bredemann principle was the most important innovation, the second most important  contribution to hemp breeding was the development of monoecious hemp and in the third place I would list the making of unisexual hemp.<P>
<STRONG>JIHA:</STRONG> What would be the most important developments to help make hemp a main-stream agricultural crop?<P>
<STRONG>IB:</STRONG> First the laws which forbid hemp growing in a large number of countries will have to be changed. In the second place technical innovation is needed, we need better machines for harvesting and for the entire processing chain.

<CENTER>63<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>The 1994 TAPPI pulping conference</H1>
<FONT SIZE=4>Ir. Gertjan van Roekel, Jr.</FONT><P>
ATO-DLO Agrotechnology, P.O. Box 17,  6700 AA Wageningen, The Netherlands.<BR>

The scenic San Diego (California, USA) bay was this year's setting for the annual pulping conference of the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry of the USA.<P> 
Eleven hundred engineers, managers, consultants, equipment manufacturers, suppliers and researchers presented and discussed almost 150 papers on various aspects of pulping wood and non-wood fibre sources. Papers covered the whole range of raw material supply, up to the quality of pulps for papermaking, with a clear emphasis on raw material supply and on advances in bleaching technology.<P> 
A number of countries are experiencing shortages in wood supply: western Canada, northwest USA, Japan, China, and India. The US and Canada import trees from, for instance, Chile to keep a major economic activity (pulping) going, and Japan is importing Eucalypts from Australia. Especially for Asia, the importance of nonwood fibres to meet the rapidly increasing demand for paper was widely recognised.<P>
Bleaching operations and research for advanced bleaching technology were widely discussed, since the industry is in the process of changing from open bleaching systems using chlorine to closed systems using peroxide, oxygen and ozone with reduced emissions to the environment. Also, the recently developed use of microbial enzymes in the so-called biobleaching process has actually been implemented in large scale pulpmills.
<H3>Non-wood pulp</H3>
In the non-wood sessions, papers were presented on cultivation, harvest, storage, preprocessing, pulping and papermaking properties of kenaf, bagasse, bamboo, reed canary grass, wheat straw, seedflax and hemp. The heavily crowded &#147;non-wood room&#148; gave the impression that non-wood fibres have gained increased interest.  
<H3>New technologies</H3>
Several research institutions had come up with new systems and ideas for more efficient pulping methods, with higher yields and less environmental impact.<P> 
The process of treating hemp and kenaf fibre with fungi prior to mechanical pulping showed that such a method can prove useful in reducing energy consumption without losing pulp quality. The fungal treatment may be combined with the storage between harvest and processing.<P>
A paper by J.E. Harsveld van der Veen from ATO-DLO in the Netherlands disputed one of the most firm beliefs in fibre pulping: the idea that fibres are held together only by lignin. The paper suggests that not only lignin, but also pectin plays an active role in fibre bonding in plants and trees. Therefore, pulping methods designed for removing lignin are inefficient, and should be modified to remove the complex of both lignin and pectin.
<H3>Hemp</H3>
The use of hemp as a papermaking fibre was mentioned a few times in  relation to very special and technical applications. Delegates tended to opt for kenaf and seedflax for bulk non-wood papermaking in the US. Seedflax is a fibre very much comparable to hemp, and actually in use as a specific cigarette paper. It is available in huge quantities in Canada, virtually for free, since it is a byproduct of linseed oil production. Kenaf is grown in the southern US states, and seems to do very well. It is preferred over hemp for non-wood &#147;tree-free&#148; paper production in the US, because of the prohibition of hemp cultivation.
<H3>General impression</H3>
The pulping industry is running short of trees. As a result, woodpulp prices have gone sky-high (+130% in one year). Even with this in mind, the majority of delegates still feel that it will take another thirty years before fibre crops will be grown on a large scale in the western world. The reason is the low cost of bulk transport, and the often government-supported exploitation of wood plantations all over the world. It is still cheaper to ship wood from Chile to Canada than to grow hemp there (although the situation is changing rapidly). When the cost of bulk transportation increases,  certain areas will be better off growing their own fibre crops.<P>
Until then, the use of agricultural wastes such as seedflax straw and cereal straw will be encouraged. These materials are available free, and will probably attain a negative cost as they become more and more difficult to dispose of by incineration.<P>
Asian countries like China and India will see continued and increased use of non-wood fibre, but with improved and environmentally cleaner technology. It may well be that the technologies developed in the West will be applied and fine-tuned in the East, until the West starts using nonwood fibre. The only exception in the western world is the market where consumers insist on paper made without cutting trees. The tree-free paper market is expected to grow further, since cutting of primary forests is still going on, even for papermaking, and many consumers are not willing to support deforestation.<P>

<CENTER>64<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Bioresource Hemp</H1>
Product and Technology Exhibition  &amp; Technological-Scientific
Symposium<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>March 2-5, 1995, Frankfurt, Germany, as part of the BIO FACH '95</FONT></CENTER><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>
The nova-Institute for Political and Ecological Innovation
in Cologne and the marketing firm TriTec, Bochum, have organized
the first international product and technology exhibition on hemp
as a bioresource, to be held from March 2-5, 1995.in Frankfurt.
The first international scientific-technological symposium on
the subject of hemp will be held concurrently.
<H3>Product and Technology Exhibition</H3>
The aim of the BIORESOURCE HEMP  is to support the realization
of innovative ecological products based on hemp; to bring together
scientists, companies and institutions involved in hemp technology
and hemp product development. Further synergistic effects result
from its proximity to BIO FACH '95, which is the largest trade
fair of ecological consumer goods world-wide. In March 1994, more
than 675 BIO FACH exhibitors displayed their products. At the
same time, the BIO FACH Congress also takes place. There, experts
report on current topics relevant to the eco-industry.<P>
Owing to the proximity to BIO FACH,  the exhibitors of BIORESOURCE
HEMP  have the opportunity to present their new product lines
and innovative technologies to a great number of ecologically
interested visitors. Approximately 30 companies and institutes
from various countries will present their technologies and products
in a projected exhibition area of 1,000 square meters.
<H3>Technological-Scientific Symposium</H3>
A four-day hemp symposium will also be held. Conference languages
are German and English and the admission fee for 4 days is DM
600 (students DM 300). For one day it is DM 250 (students DM 125).
For IHA members, a 20% reduction applies if the registration fee
is paid before February 28.<P>
The symposium will cover the entire spectrum of current international hemp research and technology development. The scientific level of the symposium is intended to allow a realistic assessment of the unquestionably attractive biological resource, hemp.<P>
Preliminary program:<P>
First day, March 2:
<UL>
<LI>Introduction 
<LI>The rediscovery of hemp: status reports from selected countries.
</UL>
Second day, March 3:
<UL>
<LI>The hemp plant, breeding, cultivation and harvesting.
</UL>
Third day, March 4: 
<UL>
<LI>Hemp fibre, processing and products: paper, textiles and building
<LI>and other materials. 
</UL>
Fourth day, March 5:

<CENTER>65<H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE>Guide for authors</H1><HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE></CENTER>The Journal of the International Hemp Association publishes original research, literature reviews and news items on hemp. Contributions concern fibre, seed and resin, and can come from a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, chemistry, ecology, economy and markets, genetic resources and breeding, history, medicine, physiology, phytopathology, products and applications, and technology. Since the readership of the IHA Journal is much broader than for a single-discipline journal, highly specialized terminology should be defined or avoided. The significance of a statement, or the reasoning behind a conclusion, may have to be more fully explained than in a more specialized journal.<P>
Contributions should be written in English and not exceed 10 double-spaced typed pages (ca. 4000 words), longer contributions may be accepted if they can be serialized in two consecutive issues. Authors not fluent in English must have their paper reviewed and checked by a colleague who is fluent.<P>
Manuscripts can be submitted to: IHA Journal, Editorial Office, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The preferred medium of submission is on disk with accompanying manuscript in triplicate.<P> 
<B>Units</B>. Research papers and literature reviews should use the International (SI, or metric) system throughout.<P>

<H3>Manuscript preparation.</H3> 
The entire manuscript, including abstract and references, should be typed on one side of standard-size paper, double spaced with all margins 2.5 cm. Starting with the title page, label all pages in the upper righthand corner with the first author's last name and the page number. Do not use hyphens unless the hyphen is part of the word. Tables should fit on one page, be numbered consecutively, and each table should be on a separate sheet. Every figure and table should have an explanatory title, so that it can be understood without reference to the text. For both tables and figures, authors should indicate on the manuscript the preferred position of insertion in the text of the paper. Every table and figure should be mentioned at least once in the text.
<H3>Manuscript submission.</H3>
Manuscripts should be submitted in triplicate to: Editorial Office, IHA Journal, Postbus 75007, 1070 AA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. All research papers and literature reviews will be carefully refereed for international relevance and quality. Submission of an article is understood to imply that the article is an original contribution that has not been published elsewhere in substantially the same form, and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere. 
<H3>Electronic manuscripts.</H3>
Once a paper is accepted, the preferred medium of submission is on 3.5 inch disk (Macintosh or MS-DOS format), preferably MS word 5.0 or later, with accompanying manuscript. It is important that the file on disk and the printout are identical. Do not allow the word processor to introduce word splits and do not use a 'justified' layout. It is very important that files are saved in the word processor format. If the word processor features the option to save files &quot;in flat ASCII&quot;, please do not use it. Please ensure that only the relevant file (one complete article) is on the disk. Also, specify the type of computer and word processing package used and label the disk with the first author's name and the name of the file on the disk.

<H1>VIR germplasm preservation project</H1>

In 1994, the Vavilov Research Institute/International Hemp Association <I>Cannabis</I> Germplasm Preservation Project had its second successful year of growing out endangered seed accessions. The project was expanded in 1994 to include facilities in the Ukraine and Italy. However, additional grow out locations must be arranged for 1995 and 1996. A progress report will be presented by the IHA at the Bioresource Hemp symposium to be held in Frankfurt, Germany, March 2-5, 1995 and will also be published in the third issue of the Journal of the International Hemp Association.<P> 
The most important obstacle the VIR/IHA project faces is funding for the 1995 grow outs. A concerted effort will be made to canvas the symposium participants for both IHA membership and public/private grants to support the <I>Cannabis</I> Germplasm Preservation Project.<P>
The IHA will also present several other talks at Bioresource Hemp concerning various aspects of <I>Cannabis, </I>its production and utilization. We anticipate that this symposium will bring together many interesting members of the <I>Cannabis</I> community and it should be very worthwhile for those interested in the advancement of <I>Cannabis</I> as an environmentally friendly crop (see announcement on pg. 64).

<H1>Diversity in <I>Cannabis</I></H1>

The PhD thesis, &quot;<B>Diversity in <I>Cannabis</I></B>&quot; (available through the IHA), which  Etienne de Meijer defended on 22 December 1994, reports on the evaluation of a collection of <I>Cannabis</I> germplasm at the Centre for Plant Breeding and Reproduction Research, at Wageningen, in the Netherlands.  About 160 accessions were evaluated for traits related to stem production, stem quality, psychoactive potency and resistance to soil pathogens. Prospects for the breeding of improved cultivars for paper pulp production were based on the diversity for these traits, their stability, and mutual relations.<P>
Variation in stem production could be attributed largely to differences in phenological development, which again was related to the latitude of origin of the accessions. Large variation was found for the fraction of bark tissue, woody core and primary and secondary bark fibre in the stem. Since woody core fibres of <I>Cannabis</I> are on average too short to produce high quality paper, the evaluation was directed at variation for core fibre dimensions as well. This variation proved to be very limited and breeding for improved core quality was not considered promising. Accessions were classified into the phenotypes 'drug', 'intermediate' and 'non-drug' on the basis of their contents of the cannabinoids <I>delta</I>-9-tetra-hydrocannabinol and cannabidiol. There were no strict relationships between the cannabinoid profiles and other traits. Significant variation was further revealed in host reactions to the root-knot nematode <I>Meloidogyne</I> <I>hapla</I>.<P>
The study indicated that many combinations of character states can be established through breeding. An <I>a</I> <I>priori</I> grouping of accessions based on the purpose and status of domestication (fibre cultivars, fibre landraces, drug strains, and wild or naturalized populations) was validated by the experimental observations. Contents of bark fibre and cannabinoids discriminated most between groups. A genetic characterization on the basis of electrophoretic patterns of seed proteins was unsatisfactory as it neither reflected common ancestry, nor showed a relation with groupings based on origin or agronomic and morphological traits.

<p align="center">...a weekly service for the media on news items
related to Marijuana Prohibition.</p>

<p align="center">January 2, 1997 </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Clinton Plan Attacks
Medical Marijuana Initiatives,<br>
Targets Doctors</strong></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>January 2, 1997, Washington D.C.:</strong>&nbsp; The
Clinton administration announced at a December 30 press
conference that doctors who prescribe or recommend marijuana
under voter-approved provisions in California and Arizona may
face criminal prosecution under federal law and lose their
ability to write prescriptions.&nbsp; Federal officials had
threatened to take such action for months, but had not endorsed a
formal strategy until Monday's press conference.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The recent passage of propositions which make dangerous
drugs more available in California and Arizona poses a threat to
the National Drug Control Strategy goal of reducing drug abuse in
the United States,&quot; stated Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey in a
seven-page release outlining the administration's response to the
initiatives.&nbsp; &quot;These propositions are not about
compassion, they are about legalizing dangerous drugs,&quot; he
told reporters.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The administration's proposal states that the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) will revoke the federal registrations of
physicians who recommend or prescribe marijuana according to the
provisions of the newly enacted state laws.&nbsp; McCaffrey and
Attorney General Janet Reno also stated that the Justice
Department may criminally prosecute physicians who prescribe
marijuana for use in treatment.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe it's outrageous that the federal government is
using taxpayer's money in this way, to go after honest doctors
caring for very sick people,&quot; said Dr. Toni Brayer of the
San Francisco Medical Society, which represents about 2,200 AIDS
and cancer specialists in the bay area and backs California's
medical marijuana measure.&nbsp; Brayer was one of many
physicians nationwide who criticized the administration's
strategy.&nbsp; She accused the administration of using
&quot;scare tactics to frighten legitimate doctors from using
[marijuana] for very sick people.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Fellow San Francisco physician, Dr. Richard Cohen agreed.
&quot;The federal government is stepping in and literally
intimidating ... a patient population that could be helped,&quot;
he told reporters.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">They can't go after the voters in California and Arizona, so they
go after the medical profession,&quot; said Dr. David C. Lewis,
director of the Center for Alcohol and Addictive Studies at Brown
University.&nbsp; &quot;Now the federal government is entering
the practice of medicine, placing itself in the physician's
office between the doctor and patient.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) also announced his opposition
to the Clinton-backed plan.&nbsp; &quot;Medical practitioners who
are following the dictates of their profession and the laws
adopted by the voters of their states by prescribing the method
they think best suited to reduce suffering in seriously ill
people do not deserve to be persecuted by the federal
government,&quot; said Frank, a longtime supporter of medical
marijuana.&nbsp; Frank worked with <strong>NORML</strong> in 1995
to introduce federal legislation permitting physicians to
prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent for seriously ill
patients (H.R. 2618).&nbsp; &quot;What we have here is an
instance of the Federal Executive Branch... overturning the
voters of two states, not because of some conflict with some
Constitutional principle, but because the federal government
disagrees with the citizen's policy choices.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>NORML</strong> Executive Director, Attorney R. Keith
Stroup elaborated on Frank's statements.&nbsp; &quot;Although the
state initiatives exempt medical patients from state criminal
penalties prohibiting the cultivation and use of marijuana,
Justice Department lawyers concede that there exists no solid
constitutional grounds for attacking the initiatives in
court.&nbsp; There is no requirement that each state adopt
criminal penalty to mimic each and every federal drug law.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stroup also questioned the administration's assurance that it
&quot;will continue to review claims about the possible [medical]
benefit of smoked marijuana,&quot; noting that an FDA-approved
protocol by San Francisco researcher Dr. Donald Abrams to examine
marijuana's effect on the AIDS wasting syndrome has been
stonewalled by the National Institute on Drug Abuse for four
years.&nbsp; Recent plans to conduct a state-sponsored study at
Washington State University to evaluate claims by cancer patients
and others about the medical effectiveness of marijuana have also
been delayed by federal officials, Stroup added.&nbsp;
&quot;Government officials are engaging in sophistry.&nbsp; On
the one hand, they deny the existence of scientific studies
conducted throughout the 1970's and 1980's indicating marijuana's
medical utility and block new federal research, while on the
other, they argue that the sick and dying should be denied an
effective medication because there is not enough research.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Loren Siegel, director of public education for the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) agreed. Calling McCaffrey's remarks the
&quot;height of hypocrisy&quot; in a released statement, Siegel
noted that the federal &quot;government has consistently impeded
research into medical marijuana -- for political, not scientific
reasons.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Another critical aspect of the controversial federal plan allows
the DEA to &quot;adopt&quot; seizures of marijuana and other
Schedule I controlled substances made by state and local law
enforcement officials following an arrest where state and local
prosecutors must decline prosecution because of the newly
established state laws.&nbsp; Once in the possession of the DEA,
the drugs can be destroyed and further criminal action may be
pursued.&nbsp; However, federal officials admit that it is
unlikely that the agency will prosecute small time offenders.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The administration also warned employees and contractors who
received federal funds that individuals may not use the state
provisions as an exemption to the requirements of the Federal
Drug-Free Workplace program.&nbsp; &quot;Medical Review Officers
will not accept physician recommendations for Schedule I
substances as a legitimate explanation for a positive drug
test,&quot; the plan states.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the plan recommends that physicians who prescribe or
recommend marijuana to patients be excluded from the Medicaid and
Medicare programs.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The American Medical Association (AMA), one of the country's
primary physician's groups, urged doctor's &quot;to prescribe
[only] effective, legal medications ... to compassionately treat
disease and relieve pain&quot; for now, and requested for
&quot;federal funding of research to determine the validity of
marijuana as an effective medical treatment.&quot;<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The administration's actions this week effectively wreak
havoc on not only states' rights and the will of the voters, but
also on the First Amendment rights of doctors and the privileged
relationship between a physician and his or her patient,&quot;
summarized <strong>NORML</strong> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Patients who could benefit from marijuana's
therapeutic value remain held hostage by a federal administration
that appears more concerned about political rhetoric than the
well being of the sick and dying.&quot;<br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Latest High School Senior
Survey Data Fuels Anti-Drug Rhetoric<br>
NORML Responds To Calls To Escalate Drug War</b></font></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The statistics indicating rising levels of teen marijuana use
among secondary school students as reported by the Monitoring the
Future study should be an issue of concern for both parents and
political leaders alike.&nbsp; <b>NORML opposes the use of
marijuana, or other drugs including alcohol and tobacco, by
adolescents.&nbsp; NORML remains committed to the notion that
adolescents should grow up drug-free.</b>&nbsp; <u>However, there
is no evidence to demonstrate that increasing penalties against
adult users will address this problem.</u>&nbsp; In fact, federal
statistics indicate that just the opposite is true.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite criticism that the Clinton administration has
abandoned the drug war, FBI figures show that nearly six hundred
thousand Americans were arrested on marijuana charges in
1995.&nbsp; This brings the total number of arrests under the
Clinton administration to 1,450,751 and equates to an arrest
every 54 seconds over the past year!&nbsp; (More than 83 percent
of those arrests were for simple possession.)</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In spite of this significant increase in the enforcement of
marijuana laws, recent evidence such as the Monitoring the Future
study indicates that the use of marijuana is rising, especially
among adolescents.&nbsp; <b>This fact confirms that marijuana
prohibition does not effectively deter marijuana use.</b></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Today's rates of adolescent drug use are better understood
when put in historical perspective.&nbsp; Data from the
Monitoring the Future study indicate that current rates of
adolescent marijuana use, both regular and lifetime, remain well
below what they were some years ago.&nbsp; According to the
Monitoring the Future Study, lifetime prevalence of marijuana use
among high-school seniors peaked in 1979 at 60 percent, a figure
that remains almost one-third higher than today's 44.9 percent.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We will probably never know why marijuana use-rates fluctuate
over time.&nbsp; It is crucial to note, however, that the recent
increase has occurred among the same population of young people
who have been exposed to a decade-long anti-marijuana campaign in
the schools and the media.&nbsp; <b>That campaign, based on
exaggerations of marijuana's alleges harms and a 'Just say no'
ideology has clearly failed.</b>&nbsp; Programs like DARE lack
credibility and have not influenced adolescents to abstain from
drugs.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The issue of adolescent marijuana use remains a key concern
for <b>NORML</b> and must be dealt with rationally by
America.&nbsp; Recently, we have offered to work with Office of
National Drug Control Policy Director Barry McCaffrey
specifically on this matter.&nbsp; Clearly, today's figures
should serve as a wake-up call to change our current, often
extremist drug education strategies.&nbsp; Moreover, while
today's figures should warrant concern among parents and all
Americans, they certainly do not justify intensifying the war
against adult marijuana users.</p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Allen St.

<p align="center"><b>Drug Reform Measure Signed Into Law In
Arizona</b></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 9, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; Arizona Gov. Fife
Symington has signed Proposition 200 into law.&nbsp; The
voter-approved measure, formally known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; drastically
reforms state drug policy by shifting the emphasis from law
enforcement to treatment and education.&nbsp; Symington had
threatened to veto the measure last month despite it having
passed with 65 percent of the vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although more attention has been paid to California's recenfly
approved medical marijuana law, Arizona's measure is a far more
radical departure from current anti-drag strategies.&nbsp;
Specifically, Proposition 200 states the following: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Any person convicted of the personal possession or use of a
controlled substance shall be eligible for probation.</b>&nbsp;
Eligibility for probation is limited to first and/or second time
offenders and is contingent upon an individuals participation in
an &quot;appropriate drug treatment or education
program.&quot;&nbsp; State funds will be set aside and made
avallable to those unable to pay for such programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Non-violent persons currently in prison for personal
possession of illegal drugs and not serving a concurrent sentence
for another crime shall be made eligible for immediate parole and
drug treatment, education and community service.</b>&nbsp;
Prisoners so eligible must be deemed not to be a &quot;danger to
the general public&quot; by the Arizona Board of Executive
Clemency.&nbsp; Currentiy, the state Department of Corrections
has identified 976 inmates who are eligible for release under the
new law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Any person who commits a violent crime while under the
influence of illegal drugs should serve 100 percent of his or her
sentence with absolutely no early release.</b> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>* Any medical doctor licensed to practice in Arizona may
prescribe a controlled substance included in Schedule I to treat
a disease, or to relieve the paln and suffering of a seriously or
terminally ill patient.</b>&nbsp; In order for the prescription
to be valid, Proposition 200 requires the prescribing physician
to &quot;obtain the written opinion of a second medical doctor
[stating] that the prescribing of the controlled substance is
appropriate.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, the prescribing physician
must document that scientific research exists which supports the
use of the Schedule I drug being prescribed.&nbsp; Drafters of
the legislation maintain that this last clause currently limits
the Schedule I drugs that may be prescribed solely to marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* A nine-member Parents Commission on Drug Education and
Prevention shall be created to establish programs that will
increase parental involvement and education about the risks and
public health problems caused by the abuse of alcohol and
controlled substances.&nbsp; Members of the commission shall be
appointed by the governor for a term of two years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Taken as a whole, the message sent by 65 percent of the
Arizona voters who supported Proposition 200 is staggering,&quot;
announced <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Never in recent memory have such a large number of American
voters so resolutely rejected our nation's federal policy of 'Do
Drugs, Do Time.'&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This could be a crack in the Berlin Wall,&quot; rejoiced
Phoenix surgeon Jeffrey Singer, who campaigned for the law.&nbsp;
&quot;Five years from now, people will see Arizona is not
suffering from mass addictions and, perhaps, even having rational
discussions about decriminalization of all drugs -- that's what
the drug warriors fear most.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;As with We fall of Communism, the drug wars will be over in
a few years and America will be safer for it,&quot; agreed
Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson.&nbsp; Wilson and other
AZ4NORML members are hoping to work with the offices of Gov.
Symington and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio to establish
&quot;tolerance zones&quot; where patients with marijuana
prescriptions may have them filled by state licensed marijuana
dealers. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Arizona can take pride in being the first state in the
nation to realize the 'War on Drugs' is a dismal failure and has
gone on long enough,&quot; summarized Arizona NORML Secretary
William Green, who is licensed by the state to sell and possess
marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Arizona is set to lead the nation out of
the nightmarish 'War on Drugs.'&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Drug Czar, Secretary Of
Transportation Reaffirm<br>
Federal Drug Testing Laws</b></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey and Department of Transportation Secretary
Federico Penn held a joint press conference today to issue a
strong national warning from the Clinton Administration that the
federal transportation drug testing laws will continue to be
fully enforced without any effect whatsoever from the recent
passage of Proposition 215 in California or Proposition 200 in
Arizona. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The [federal] law is clear,&quot; said McCaffrey and Pena.&nbsp;
&quot;If you are a safety-sensitive transportation worker and
you're caught using drugs, these propositions don't mean a
thing.&nbsp; You're out of a job.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Drug Czar elaborated that users of medical marijuana will not
be granted an exemption from federal drug testing
regulations.&nbsp; &quot;The use ... of marijuana under
California Proposition 215 or of any Schedule I drug under
Arizona Proposition 200 is not a legitimate explanation,&quot; he
emphasized.&nbsp; &quot;As a matter of fact and a matter of
federal law, marijuana and other drugs listed on Schedule I of
the Controlled Substances Act do not have legitimate medical use
in the United States.&nbsp; Thus, if you test positive for
marijuana, and tell the MRO that a doctor recommended or
prescribed the use of marijuana for you, the MRO will [still]
verify the test positive&quot; and you will lose your job. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since the passage of these initiatives, it has been clear
that the administration would rather work against the will of the
voters rather than with them,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

Buyers' Club founder and co-author of California's Proposition

venue.&nbsp; Peron and five others are charged with several
felony marijuana counts stemming from an August 4 raid by state
law enforcement on the nearly 12,000 member club.&nbsp; The
defendants contend that the trial should be moved from Oakland to
San Francisco because that is where the club was located. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Peron told reporters that he is looking forward to the
trial.&nbsp; &quot;It's going to be the funniest case in the
history of the U.S.,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;They have no

<p align="center">December 3, 1996 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Rhetoric Mounts Over Medical Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 3, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Voter-approved initiatives in California and Arizona regarding
medical access to marijuana are not only garnering national
headlines, but also the ire of various federal and state
officials.&nbsp; Most recently, the initiatives were the subject
of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which federal elected
officials and representatives from law enforcement reaffirmed
their opposition to the notion of medical marijuana and warned of
the potential for similar initiatives to crop up in other states. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This ballot measure] begins a road to destruction of
people's lives in this country,&quot; said Sen Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.),
one of only three senators who attended the hearing.&nbsp; Kyl
called the Arizona and California drug-law reform campaigns
classic examples of &quot;bait and switch&quot; tactics and
alleged that the voters in those states were &quot;deceived&quot;
by proponents. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The contention that the public was duped is absurd,&quot;
countered Marvin S. Cohen, who testified on behalf of Arizonans
for Drug Policy Reform.&nbsp; &quot;Voters knew exactly what they
were doing on November 5.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Rather than accept the outcomes of the initiatives as a
mandate that Americans want access to medical marijuana for the
seriously ill, some elected officials on both the state and
federal level are in a state of denial,&quot; charged <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It is more
convenient for them to claim that voters were somehow misled by
initiative proponents rather than to acknowledge that they are
out of step with their constituents.&nbsp; The voters of America
strongly favor allowing seriously ill patients to use medical
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the initiatives' passage, there has been considerable
public speculation as to whether the federal government will
target physicians and patients who comply with the new state
laws.&nbsp; To date, no specific recommendations have come from
the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).&nbsp; Both
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey and Drug Enforcement Administrator
Thomas Constantine testified that federal law prohibiting
cultivation and possession of marijuana remain in full force
despite the states' actions.&nbsp; Constantine also threatened
that the federal government could &quot;take both administrative
and criminal actions against doctors who violate the terms of
their DEA drug registrations that authorize them to prescribe
controlled substances.&quot;&nbsp; However, both officials also
admitted the federal government lacks the manpower to enforce the
federal marijuana laws on a wide scale within the states. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that, &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions
of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It further provides that, &quot;Physicians
shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for
recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The Act does not supersede state
legislation prohibiting persons from possessing or cultivating
marijuana for non-medical purposes.&nbsp; California voters
approved the measure by a vote of 56 to 44 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; is broader than
California's measure and would essentially &quot;medicalize&quot;
Arizona's drug policy.&nbsp; The Act calls for mandatory, court
supervised treatment and probation as an alternative to
incarceration for non-violent drug users and provides expanded
drug treatment programs.&nbsp; It also permits doctors to
prescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patients
suffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiple
sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS.&nbsp; Arizonans voted in favor of
the initiative by a vote of 65 to 35 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Fallout from the ongoing medical marijuana debate has quickly
branched out to other states.&nbsp; In Ohio, lawmakers have
threatened to repeal a 1995 provision that provides patients with
an &quot;affirmative defense&quot; in court if they can prove
they were using marijuana under the prior written order of their
physician.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> activists in Ohio lobbied the state
legislature for nearly two years on behalf of the measure which
took effect on July 1, 1996.&nbsp; To date, no medical marijuana users
have had to utilize the new law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If it is repealed, there is every reason to believe that
the voters will get a chance to put the law back on the books in
1998, through an initiative,&quot; said Dave Fratello of
Americans for Medical Rights (AMR), which sponsored the
successful Proposition 215 campaign in California.&nbsp;
&quot;Our group will work with local patients' rights advocates
and medical groups to examine the options if repeal
happens.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML President John Hartman, who lobbied for the
provision, is hopeful that such action will not be
necessary.&nbsp; Currently, he is mobilizing citizens to urge
legislators to keep the present law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, in Connecticut, Chief State's Attorney John M. Bailey
warned Monday that a similar referendum regarding medical access
to marijuana could develop in that state as well.&nbsp; &quot;People
who are promoting legalizing drugs will be coming into
Connecticut,&quot; he told the press in reference to the
successful Arizona and California campaigns.&nbsp; Ironically,
Connecticut already has a law on the books that allows physicians
to prescribe marijuana to patients suffering from glaucoma or
cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp; Because of apparent conflict with
federal law and the fact that the state measure fails to make
provisions regarding a legal supply of marijuana, the law has
never been used. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is somewhat presumptuous for the Connecticut State
Attorney General to claim that medical marijuana reformers will
be coming to his state, specifically when Connecticut is one of
the few states that already has a law on the books allowing
physicians to prescribe marijuana,&quot; said St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;I am unaware of any current plans by medical marijuana
proponents to target Connecticut.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The outpouring of national debate and public sympathy
regarding medical marijuana since the election has been
tremendous,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Publications Director Paul
Armentano.&nbsp; &quot;The American people have spoken and our
state and federal officials have an obligation to listen, not to plot
against them.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre or Paul
Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp;

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Senate To Hold Hearing Regarding
Medical Marijuana Initiatives</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 26, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Monday,
December 2, regarding the potential impact of and federal
response to voter-approved drug reform initiatives in California
and Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as a
medicine.&nbsp; The committee, headed by vocal medical marijuana
opponents Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Joe Biden (D-Del.), has
entitled the hearing: &quot;A Prescription for Addiction?&nbsp;
The Arizona and California Medical Drug Use
Initiatives.&quot;&nbsp; Biden and others previously voiced their disapproval
over the notion of medical marijuana at a September 4 hearing
regarding adolescent drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among those who have reportedly been invited to attend the
hearing are Drug Czar Barry Mccaffrey, California Attorney
General Dan Lungren, Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, Drug Enforcement
Administrator Thomas Constantine, and Maricopa County Prosecutor
Rick Romley, all ardent opponents of the initiatives.&nbsp;
Reportedly, neither McCaffrey nor Lungren is likely to appear
because of scheduling conflicts.&nbsp; It is expected that a
physician opposed to medical marijuana will be brought in to
testify as well. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In defense of the initiatives, <b>NORML</b> is currently working
with Senate Judiciary Committee member Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
to try to get Harvard Medical Professor, Dr. Lester Grinspoon,
scheduled to testify at the hearing.&nbsp; Grinspoon is a member
of <b>NORML</b>'s Board of Directors and has authored numerous
books and articles in scientific journals regarding marijuana's therapeutic
value.&nbsp; At this time, the committee has yet to make a final
decision. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the initiatives' passage, proponents have speculated as to
whether the federal government will target physicians and
patients who comply with the new state laws.&nbsp; So far, no
specific recommendations have come from the Office of National
Drug Control Policy (ONDCP).&nbsp; Both McCaffrey and the Drug
Enforcement Administration have issued statements affirming that
federal law prohibiting cultivation and possession of marijuana
remain in full force despite the states' actions. <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The voters of California and Arizona have given a mandate
to Washington to address the issue of access to medical
marijuana,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately, by limiting the invitees to
mainly law enforcement personnel, it appears that this hearing
will be far from balanced.&nbsp; Hopefully, subsequent hearings
will feature broader points of view and will allow both doctors
and patients to testify.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Office Of National Drug Control Policy
Restates Opposition To Medical Marijuana Initiatives</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 15, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey re-emphasized the administration's
opposition to voter-approved drug reform initiatives in
California and Arizona that endorse the use of marijuana as a
medicine.&nbsp; The announcement came following several closed-door
meetings with law enforcement and state officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There could not be a worse message to young people than the
provisions of these referenda,&quot; stated McCaffrey in a
November 15 press release.&nbsp; &quot;Just when the nation is
trying its hardest to educate teenagers not to use psychoactive
drugs, now they are being told that 'marijuana [is] medicine.'&nbsp;
The conflicting message is extremely harmful.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that, &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions
of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It further provides that, &quot;Physicians
shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for
recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The Act does not supersede state
legislation prohibiting persons from possessing or cultivating
marijuana for non-medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; is broader than
California's measure and would essentially &quot;medicalize&quot;
Arizona's drug policy.&nbsp; The Act calls for mandatory, court
supervised treatment and probation as an alternative to
incarceration for non-violent drug users and provides expanded
drug treatment programs.&nbsp; It also permits doctors to
prescribe controlled drugs such as marijuana to patients
suffering from serious illnesses such as glaucoma, multiple
sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS; however, this aspect of the measure
is in direct conflict with federal law.&nbsp; Arizonans voted in
favor of the initiative by a vote of 65 to 35. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By our judgment, increased drug abuse in every category
will be the inevitable result of the referenda,&quot; said
McCaffrey. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the weeks following the initiatives passage, proponents have
speculated as to whether the federal government will target
physicians and patients complying with the new state laws.&nbsp;
On this matter, McCaffrey stated that federal law remains in
&quot;full force&quot; despite the states' actions and that the
Justice Department &quot;will take action&quot; when the evidence
merits. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is unfortunate that General McCaffrey chose only to meet
with those who oppose the notion of marijuana as medicine when
meeting to strategize the federal response to the passage of the California
and Arizona initiatives,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre, who noted that at least two physicians who
learned of the meetings were barred from attending.&nbsp;
&quot;These initiatives address health issues; to exclude input
from physicians who are explicitly and specifically mentioned is
unacceptable.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Drug Czar's Office Refuses NORML
Meeting</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has denied <b>NORML</b>'s
request for a meeting with Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
had offered to meet with McCaffrey following comments made by the
General on National Public Radio that he &quot;welcomed&quot; <b>NORML</b>'s
involvement in the national debate over drug policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to a letter signed by Janet Crist, Chief of Staff,
&quot;The Director feels strongly that, in light of <b>NORML</b>'s
vigorous support for pro-marijuana ballot initiatives in
California and Arizona along with its longstanding advocacy for
the legalization of marijuana, the meeting you proposed would
serve no useful purpose.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">She added that, &quot;Your organization's agenda to legalize the
use of ... marijuana ... is unsupportable (sic) on health,
safety, as well as humanitarian grounds.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a shame that the Drug Czar was not sincere in his
offer to meet with <b>NORML</b> to discuss certain aspects of
American drug policy,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Executive Director
R. Keith Stroup.&nbsp; &quot;He has said on numerous occasions
that we cannot arrest our way out of the drug problem; <b>NORML</b> has
said for 26 years that an adult marijuana user should not face
criminal penalties.&nbsp; I think that there are a number of
points that we could agree on.&nbsp; Certainly, healthy discourse
on this pertinent topic can only move the issue forward.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, McCaffrey reiterated his invitation to meet with <b>NORML</b>
representatives while speaking at American University in
Washington D.C. on November 13.&nbsp; This action prompted <b>NORML</b>'s
Executive Director to again request a meeting with the Drug Czar
to discuss policy options. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Overturns Ohio Traffic Stop
Decision</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Supreme Court ruled that police do not have to inform drivers
during a routine traffic stop that they are legally free to go
before asking for consent to search their vehicle.&nbsp; The
ruling overturns a 1995 Ohio Supreme Court decision mandating
that police must first inform motorists that they are
&quot;legally free to go&quot; before requesting the driver's
permission to search their car for drugs or other contraband. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist said that the court has &quot;consistently eschewed
bright-line rules&quot; in Fourth Amendment analysis, and instead
must examine the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; on a
case by case basis.&nbsp; &quot;It would be unrealistic to
require the police to always inform detainees that they are free
to go before a police consent search may be deemed
voluntary,&quot; Rehnquist concluded. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In deciding the case, the High Court rejected the argument that
many individuals will assume that they are in a police officer's
custody as long as the officer continues to interrogate
them.&nbsp; &quot;While knowledge of the right to refuse consent
is one factor to be taken into account, the government need not
establish such knowledge as the <i>sine qua non</i> of an
effective consent,&quot; Rehnquist opined. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The case is cited as <i>Ohio v. Robinette</i>, No. 95-891. <br>

The Counter</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 19, 1996, Schleswig-Holstein,
Germany:</b>&nbsp; The small German state of Schleswig-Holstein
recently announced plans to sell marijuana over the counter in an
attempt to separate cannabis from the &quot;hard&quot; drug
market, according to <i>Reuters News Service</i>.&nbsp; The state said
it will soon apply to the federal drugs agency for a permit to
sell marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The state Health Minister, Heide Moser, said authorities were
losing credibility by treating marijuana as if it were as a
dangerous as other &quot;harder&quot; drugs such as cocaine and
heroin.&nbsp; &quot;General warnings about the dangers of drugs
are no longer being taken seriously,&quot; she said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The idea drew criticism from the German federal government whose
spokesman said that, &quot;Schleswig-Holstein's stance has little
to do with reality.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The state, which is governed by a coalition of Social Democrats
and environmentalist Greens, said it had not yet decided
precisely where and how much cannabis would be available if its project
wins approval. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is technically illegal in Germany, but the Supreme
Court ruled in 1994 that possession of small amounts of cannabis
for personal use should no longer be punished.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Holds Meeting With California Law
Enforcement To Discuss</b> <b>New State Medical Marijuana Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 14, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey is scheduled to meet today with
California law enforcement officials from the &quot;No on
215&quot; campaign, including Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates,
to discuss the federal response to the passage of Proposition
215. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Office of National Drag Control Policy (ONDCP) had vigorously
campaigned against the initiative and reaffirmed the
Administration's opposition to the passage of the measure in a November
9 press release. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The passage of [Proposition 215] creates a significant
threat to the drug control system that protects our
children,&quot; the release said.&nbsp; &quot;...As the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the Department of Justice have
stated, Federal law is unchanged by the passage of th[is]
initiative.&nbsp; Doctors in ... California ... who prescribe a
Schedule I drug as medicine, notwithstanding state law, will
violate federal law.&nbsp; The provision in the California
measure that allows patients and caregivers to grow and possess
marijuana also violates federal law.&nbsp; The decision to bring
appropriate criminal or administrative enforcement action will
be, as always, decided on a case by case basis.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dr. Tod H. Mikuriya, who has long been involved with medical
marijuana research, recently learned of the meeting, but was
denied attendance by Assistant General Counsel Warren Hall.&nbsp;
It was explained to Mikuriya that the list of participants was
limited to those opposed to Proposition 215.&nbsp; A follow up
letter requesting Mikuriya's attendance was faxed by Rep. Ronald
Dellums (D-Calif.) who asked that the White House &quot;do
everything possible to gain admission to this meeting for Dr.
Mikuriya. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mikuriya has requested that the meeting be rescheduled to a later
date in order to allow representatives from the California
medical community to attend the meeting.&nbsp; &quot;The
limitation of the list of invitees to those in law enforcement to
strategize on the response to the passage of Proposition 215 in
California ... would appear to be possibly illegal if not grossly
improper,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;[This] proposition involves
health issues.&nbsp; To exclude input from physicians who are explicitly
and specifically mentioned is unacceptable.&nbsp; This act of
institutional denial demonstrates bad faith on the part of the
participants from California who are sworn to uphold and enforce
state law.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Supporters Plan
'Effective, Responsible' Procedures, Legislation To Implement
Proposition 215</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 6, 1996, Santa Cruz, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
meeting has been scheduled in Santa Cruz on November 16 to
discuss plans for implementing legislation to provide for the
well regulated distribution of medical marijuana to patients and
researchers.&nbsp; Although Proposition 215 makes concessions for
patients who possess and use marijuana for a legitimate medical
need, it does not address the question of distribution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We want Proposition 215 to work as effectively and
responsibly as possible in meeting the needs of patients and
researchers, with appropriate safeguards to prevent abuses,&quot;
says Lynnette Shaw, co-chair of the California Medical Marijuana
Council (CMMC), which is organizing the meeting.&nbsp; The CMMC
includes representatives of the state's medical marijuana
&quot;Cannabis Buyers' Clubs,&quot; that are currently supplying
patients through the underground market. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference will discuss ways in which CBC's can legitimize
their operations under Proposition 215, with well defined
procedures for identifying medical marijuana patients, validating physicians'
recommendations, and preventing diversions to non-medical
uses.&nbsp; Proposition 215 supporters are hoping to propose some
form of legal licensing system for CBC's via implementory legislation
in the state legislature next year.&nbsp; They also want to
establish legal cultivation facilities to supply both patients
and researchers with high-quality marijuana under legal, well
controlled conditions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 215 supporters contest claims by opponents, such as
Attorney General Dan Lungren, that the initiative was written
loosely so as to encourage abuses.&nbsp; &quot;Proposition 215
was deliberately framed in general terms so that the state and
federal governments could work out regulatory details of the
distribution system,&quot; says Dale Gieringer of California
NORML.&nbsp; &quot;We want to work with local state and federal
authorities in ironing out any ambiguities in the law so as to
prevent abuses.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Proposition 215 is not the last word on the subject, just
the first,&quot; said Shaw. <br>

Initiative</b> </p>

Gov. Fife Symington may attempt to veto a recently passed state
initiative allowing physicians to prescribe marijuana as a
medicine and mandating that non-violent drug offenders receive
treatment rather than incarceration.&nbsp; The initiative passed
on November 5 by a vote of 65 percent to 35 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An aide to Symington said last week that the governor believes he
has the authority to veto successful ballot initiatives which
pass with a simple majority of voters, but without a majority of
all <i>registered</i> voters.&nbsp; The governor has up to 30
days to decide a course of action.&nbsp; Symington campaigned
against the measure prior to the election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">John MacDonald, Government Affairs Director of the Arizona
Attorney General's Office, said a veto by the governor would
violate the state's constitution, though he added that the
subject of referendum vetoes hasn't been fully studied by the
attorney general or members of his staff. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Our opinion is that the governor has no constitutional
authority to veto what the people have voted in favor of,&quot;
he said.&nbsp; &quot;We expect he will follow the law.&nbsp; If
he does not, we expect that one way or the other he will wind up
in court.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><font size="3">November 6, 1996</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><b>California, Arizona Voters
Approve Initiatives In Favor Of Medical Marijuana</b> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Voters in both California and
Arizona have approved initiatives endorsing marijuana's therapeutic
value and allowing patients to use marijuana for medical purposes
where its use has been deemed appropriate by a physician.&nbsp;
The result came despite heavy campaigning by opponents and
decades of anti-marijuana hysteria. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The passage of Proposition 215 in California and Proposition 200
in Arizona demonstrates that Americans can clearly distinguish
between the use of marijuana as a medicine for serious ill
patients and legalization for recreational use.&nbsp; It further
shows that the country has reached a consensus on the former, even
as it remains divided on the latter. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is a victory for medical marijuana as well as for
patients and doctors,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It shows that Americans do not want
the federal government to interfere with the relationship between
a seriously ill patient and the recommendation of his or her physician.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both state and nationwide polls taken prior to this election's
vote have shown that a majority of Americans favor medical
marijuana reform.&nbsp; The recent events in California and
Arizona may finally push those on Capitol Hill to take a close and
objective look at this issue.&nbsp; It may also encourage some of
the 23 states that currently have laws regarding medical
marijuana to modify their measures so that they can begin
directly benefiting patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;These votes demonstrate that the public are ahead of the
politicians when it comes to reforming our drug policies,
specifically medical access to marijuana,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Executive Director R. Keith Stroup.&nbsp; &quot;Americans do not
believe that denying medicine to the sick and dying should ever be
a part of the drug war.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California initiative says that &quot;Patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from the general provisions
of law which otherwise prohibit possession or cultivation of
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It further provides that, &quot;Physicians
shall not be punished or denied any right or privilege for recommending marijuana
to a patient for medical purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The Act does not supersede
state legislation prohibiting persons from possessing or
cultivating marijuana for non-medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Despite heavy opposition from federal politicians and law
enforcement, the California medical marijuana initiative passed
because individuals know by either their own personal experience
or by the experiences of those around them that marijuana has
medical utility,&quot; said St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The government
has lost all credibility on this issue by claiming
otherwise.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;With the passage of Proposition 215 in California, new
legal protections will be put into place for patients who use
marijuana under a doctor's order,&quot; said Dave Fratello of
Californians for Medical Rights (CMR), one of the primary proponents
of the measure.&nbsp; The group also announced that they will
offer a toll-free number, 1 (888) YES-4-215, to explain how 215
works, and for whom it is and is not designed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 200 in Arizona, known as the &quot;Drug
Medicalization, Prevention and Control Act,&quot; is broader than
California's measure and would essentially &quot;medicalize&quot;
Arizona's drug policy.&nbsp; The Act calls for mandatory, court supervised
treatment and probation as an alternative to incarceration for non-violent
drug users and provides expanded drug treatment programs.&nbsp;
It will also allow doctors to prescribe controlled drugs such as
marijuana to patients suffering from serious illnesses such as
glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and AIDS.&nbsp; Arizonans
voted in favor of the initiative by a vote more than two to one. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;These votes give a flashing green light to the American
public that they have the power to change the course on American

NEWS RELEASE </strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="3">October 30, 1996</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="1"><b>In light of next week's vote
regarding a California ballot initiative to allow physicians to
prescribe marijuana to seriously ill patients, NORML is forgoing
its usual weekly news release to spotlight the following *special*
report.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Making The Case For Medical
Marijuana</b></font><font size="4"><br>
</font><font size="3"><b><i>by NORML Publications Director Paul
Armentano</i></b></font><font size="4"> </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Marijuana is medicine.&nbsp; It
has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of ailments.&nbsp;
Marijuana was legal in the United States and prominent in the
pharmacopoeia until 1937, when possession and use of marijuana
was outlawed by the federal government.&nbsp; Today, eight patients receive
marijuana legally from the government; for all other Americans
who could benefit from its therapeutic value, it remains a
forbidden medicine.&nbsp; The passage of Proposition 215 in California,
the Medical Marijuana Initiative, would be a first step in
amending this grievous and unnecessary crisis. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Contrary to popular belief, there have been
hundreds of studies on the medical uses of cannabis since its
introduction to western medicine in the mid-nineteenth
century.&nbsp; The best established medical use of smoked
marijuana is as an anti-nauseant for cancer chemotherapy.&nbsp;
During the 1980s, smoked marijuana was shown to be an effective
anti-emetic in six different state-sponsored clinical studies
involving nearly 1,000 patients.&nbsp; For the majority of these
patients, smoked marijuana proved more effective than both conventional
prescription anti-nauseants and oral THC (marketed today as the synthetic
pill, Marinol).&nbsp; For example, in a 1988 study by Dr. Vincent Vinciguerra
published in the <b><i>New York State Journal of Medicine</i></b>,
78 percent of patients who had shown no improvement with standard
anti-emetics responded favorably to marijuana.&nbsp; In addition,
29 percent of those patients who did not respond to oral THC did
respond to smoked marijuana.&nbsp; Vinciguerra concluded that the
results of the pilot study &quot;demonstrate that inhalation marijuana
is an effective therapy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting
due to cancer chemotherapy.&quot;[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#1"><font size="3"><b>1</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Similar findings were noted in state-sponsored
studies in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, and California.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#2"><font size="3"><b>2</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Currently, many oncologists are recommending marijuana
to their patients despite its prohibition.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#3"><font size="3"><b>3</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In addition to its usefulness as an
anti-emetic, there exists evidence -- both scientific and anecdotal
-- that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering
for patients with a variety of other serious ailments, and that
it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines for which
it may be substituted.&nbsp; For example, marijuana alleviates
the nausea, vomiting, and the loss of appetite caused by the AIDS
wasting syndrome and by treatment with AZT and other drugs without
accelerating the rate at which HIV positive individuals develop
clinical AIDS or other illnesses.&nbsp; Reportedly, 75 percent of the
12,000 members of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club were
Patients With AIDS (PWAs) and a recent survey of HIV-positive
patients in Australia found that one-quarter were using marijuana
therapeutically.[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#4"><font size="3"><b>4</b></font></a><font
size="3">,</font><a href="96-10-30.html#5"><font size="3"><b>5</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">It is generally accepted -- by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) and others -- that marijuana reduces
intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients suffering from glaucoma,
the leading cause of blindness in the United States.&nbsp; This
was first shown in a series of experiments by Robert S. Hepler of
UCLA, stemming from research aimed at finding out whether
marijuana dilated pupils.&nbsp; Hepler found a
&quot;statistically significant&quot; drop in IOP in 429 subjects
treated with marijuana or THC, 29 of which showed continued
benefits during 94 days of treatment with no signs of tolerance.[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#6"><font size="3"><b>6</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Currently, three of the eight patients who
receive medicinal marijuana legally use it to treat glaucoma. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">There also exists historical evidence that
marijuana is effective in treating a variety of spastic conditions
such as multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, epilepsy, and
quadriplegia.&nbsp; In the book, <u>Marijuana: The Forbidden
Medicine</u>, Dr. Lester Grinspoon of Harvard Medical School
describes several case histories of patients suffering from
multiple sclerosis and other disorders whose condition improved
while they smoked marijuana and deteriorated after they stopped smoking.&nbsp;
In addition, a number of animal studies have supported
marijuana's ability to suppress convulsions.&nbsp; These studies
specifically indicate cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive ingredient
of marijuana unavailable in Marinol, to be a potent
anti-convulsant.&nbsp; This latter fact was recently reaffirmed
by the government's premiere marijuana expert, Dr. Mahmoud
ElSohly of the Marijuana Project at the University of
Mississippi, who stated during an interview with the <b><i>Journal
of the International Hemp Association</i></b> that, &quot;CBD
[cannabidiol] is famous for [its] anti-convulsant
activity.&quot;&nbsp; ElSohly concluded that, &quot;There is no
question about the use of cannabis for certain conditions.&nbsp;
It does have a history.&nbsp; It does have utility.&quot;[</font><a
href="96-10-30.html#7"><font size="3"><b>7</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Marijuana is also used to treat those who seek
relief from chronic pain.&nbsp; Historically, marijuana was used
as an analgesic from ancient times through the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; This usage declined with the introduction of
faster acting and more potent, yet sometimes addicting, opiates
such as morphine.&nbsp; However, anecdotal reports demonstrate
that some patients currently receive their most effective pain
relief from using marijuana.&nbsp; Limited scientific studies on
nearly 100 patients have shown marijuana to be a potent
analgesic.[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#8"><font size="3"><b>8</b></font></a><font
size="3">] </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Evidence in support of marijuana's medical
value has existed for centuries and has been validated by
numerous studies, researchers, committees, health organizations,
and even the Drug Enforcement Agency's Chief Administrative Law
Judge, Francis L. Young, who in 1988 declared marijuana to be
&quot;one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man.&quot;[</font><a href="96-10-30.html#9"><font size="3"><b>9</b></font></a><font
size="3">]&nbsp; Unfortunately, patients who could benefit from
marijuana's therapeutic value have been held hostage by a federal
government that continues to treat the issue as a political football.&nbsp;
American medical patients deserve better and Proposition 215 is a genuine
and encouraging step to address their needs. </font></p>

<p align="center"><b>American Nurses Association Reviews Medical
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Congress of Nursing Practice recently approved two motions
regarding the use of marijuana as a medicine.&nbsp; The Congress
agreed to: A) &quot;Support education for RNs regarding current
evidence based therapeutic uses of cannabis,&quot; and B) &quot;Support
investigation of therapeutic efficacy of cannabis in controlled
trials.&quot;&nbsp; These recommendations will be included in a
report from the Congress to the American Nurses Association (ANA)
Board of Directors at their next scheduled meeting. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Congress took up the issue of medical marijuana following a
presentation at the Centennial Conference of the American Nurses
Association by two of the eight legal marijuana patients in support
of the drug's therapeutic value.&nbsp; The Congress also reviewed
a position paper submitted by the Virginia Nurses Association
entitled &quot;Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis,&quot; but failed to
issue a position statement on that issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nevertheless, Mary Lynn Mathre, RN, of Patients Out Of Time said
that the Congress' twofold motion &quot;is a de facto statement
by the ANA that marijuana has medical value; a way of showing support
for similar resolutions passed by other U.S. health care
organizations; and should be recognized by the U.S. government as
a polite way of calling for the denial of marijuana as medicine
for the sick and dying as illogical.&quot;&nbsp; Mathre notes
that state nursing associations of Virginia, Mississippi,
Colorado, New York, and California have endorsed the use of
marijuana as a medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Patients Out of Time is a non-profit organization comprised of
five of the eight legal marijuana patients in the United States
and various health care professionals. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Iowa Man Faces Prison Term For Using
Marijuana To Ease Pain</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Waterloo, IA:</b>&nbsp; An
Iowa man is facing prison for using marijuana to relieve the
symptoms of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, a painful
muscle disorder.&nbsp; On Monday, October 28, the Black Hawk
County District Court will decide whether to revoke his probation for
refusing to stop smoking marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Allen Helmers sustained a broken back in a 1983 car accident and
was injured again in 1994 after being struck by a drunken
driver.&nbsp; Six months before the second accident, police
seized three ounces of marijuana from Helmers' home.&nbsp; He was
placed on probation for 2 to 5 years under intensive supervision
and fined $1,800. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Helmers says that the pain he suffers daily makes it necessary
that he use marijuana.&nbsp; Helmers' doctor, W. H. Verdyne,
agrees.&nbsp; &quot;Chronic neurological pain responds well to
the medicinal use of marijuana ... causing much less side effects
than the standard pain medications,&quot; Verdyne said.&nbsp; He notes
that routine medications have been unsuccessful in managing
Helmers' pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The state of Iowa gave Allen a criminal conviction for
possession of marijuana, and now they want to revoke his
probation because he refuses to stop smoking it,&quot; said Carl
Olsen of Iowans for Medical Marijuana, who organized a protest on
Helmers' behalf earlier this month.&nbsp; &quot;The state of Iowa

<p align="center"><b>Clinton Proposes Drug Testing Teenage
Applicants For Driver's Licenses</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 19, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton proposed a new federal mandate on Saturday to
require teenagers to pass a drug test before receiving a driver's
license. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stating that a driver's license is a &quot;privilege that should
not be available to those who fail to demonstrate responsible
behavior,&quot; Clinton directed the Office of National Drug
Control Policy to come up with a strategy to implement nationwide
drug testing for all teen applicants.&nbsp; Clinton said that he
hoped the &quot;90 percent [of adolescents] who are
drug-free&quot; would participate in the program willingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We're already saying to teens if you drink you aren't
allowed to drive.&nbsp; Now we should say that teens should pass
a drug test as a condition of getting a driver's license.&nbsp;
Our message should be simple: No drugs or no driver's
license.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Clinton's announcement drew harsh criticism from civil
libertarians. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Once again we see civil liberties being pulverized by the
political posturing of the president,&quot; charged Libertarian
Presidential candidate Harry Browne.&nbsp; &quot;Once again, we
see millions of Americans having to prove their innocence to
government bureaucrats.&nbsp; ... Once again, we see the 'War on
Drugs' being used as an excuse to give the federal government
more power.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Arthur Spitzer, the legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union's (ACLU) District of Columbia branch, said the
move was an example of &quot;this drug mania gone
crazy.&quot;&nbsp; He said the organization would consider
mounting a legal challenge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is not yet known whether Clinton's proposal, if implemented,
would be in violation of Constitutional guarantees against
unreasonable search and seizure.&nbsp; Most recently, the Supreme Court
ruled that high school athletes could be randomly drug tested
regardless of individualized suspicion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mandatory drug testing is an affront to human dignity, and
it's making a mockery of the United States Constitution,&quot;
said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Clinton's latest proposal is ill conceived and unjustly
labels an entire generation as suspected drug users.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Allen St. Pierre
or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> at (202)

<p align="center"><b>California Man Fired From Job After Charged
With Growing Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Santa Rosa, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
epileptic charged with marijuana cultivation this past August was
suddenly dismissed from his two caregiver jobs.&nbsp; Alan
Martinez of Santa Rosa maintains that he grows and uses marijuana
as a medicine and plans to raise a medical necessity defense in
court.&nbsp; He notes that individuals like himself, if they
possess a physicians recommendation, would have an exemption
under the law if Proposition 215 passes this November. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez worked for eight years as a well respected caregiver
until his arrest this summer.&nbsp; He believes that the media
attention that surrounded his plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; and
request for a trial to prove his medical necessity has caused his
employers to fire him without notice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I don't know what I'll do for money, but I know I will be
acquitted and my name will be cleared,&quot; said Martinez.&nbsp;
&quot;I did not expect all the uproar, but I will not back
down.&nbsp; This is a matter of my life and my health.&nbsp; I
hope no other patients have to go through this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A rally in support of Alan Martinez and his caregiver, Jason
Miller, is scheduled for 12 noon in front of the Santa Rosa Court
House on Tuesday, October 29. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEA Herbicide Under Fire From
Hawaii Residents</b></font><b><br>
Locals Complain Of Nausea, Other Ailments Due To Spraying</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 17, 1996, Hawaii Island, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp;
Residents of Hawaii's Big Island are complaining of nausea,
headaches, and fatigue and some are pointing fingers at the
federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For nearly a decade, Drug Enforcement Agency-coordinated
marijuana eradication efforts have targeted Hawaii Island, often
spraying a glyphosate-based herbicide from low-flying helicopters over
suspected marijuana patches.&nbsp; Recently, however, some
residents are claiming that the pesticide, a chemical weed-killer
similar to &quot;Round Up,&quot; is killing wildlife and making
some citizens sick. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;You can actually taste it in your mouth,&quot; said Roger
Christie of the Hawaii Hemp Council, who alleges that diesel fuel
is occasionally mixed with the pesticide.&nbsp; Christie claims
that gusts of wind disperse the pesticide to outlying
communities, where it collects in rainwater catchments.&nbsp;
Rooftop catchments are a common source of residents' drinking
water. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In the last two weeks, hundreds of people have come to me
with their complaints and said that's why I'm feeling this way
too,&quot; said Ka'u resident Susan Smith in an interview with KGMB-TV
earlier this month.&nbsp; &quot;[Law enforcement] are flying over
my house every other day.&nbsp; ... It's like a war zone out
here.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our
bio-diversity,&quot; said Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw
Institute Inc., an Oklahoma organization that works to strengthen
environmental laws.&nbsp; Berry cited a 1995 <i>Journal of
Pesticide Reform</i> report that said glyphosate exposure was the third
most commonly reported pesticide illness among agricultural
workers in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DEA spokesman Sidney Hayakawa acknowledged the residents' concern
and noted that the spraying procedure is currently under
evaluation.&nbsp; He told KGMB-TV that the agency will issue an updated
Environmental Impact Statement next year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lenny Terlip of the state Department of Land and Natural
Resources (DLNR) told <b>NORML</b> that claims of glyphosate
harming the environment and endangering the health of residents
were &quot;erroneous.&quot;&nbsp; He denied reports that the
herbicide was mixed with any additives and said that the sprayings
were not being conducted near houses or residential areas.&nbsp;
The helicopter-mounted spray-guns have &quot;pin-point
accuracy,&quot; he added. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For now, however, the battle rages on and many residents remain
unconvinced.&nbsp; This is an example of &quot;law enforcement
run amuck,&quot; claimed environmental activist and resident
Jerry Rothstein, who recently attended a town meeting where
numerous residents complained of health complications such as eye
irritation, itchy throats, and bronchial problems due to
spraying.&nbsp; Photographs on display at the meeting documented
orange-sprayed foliage in forests and yards as well as dead bird
carcasses.&nbsp; &quot;From the response of the Ka'u community,
th[ese] latest aerial herbicide attack[s] appear to be among the
worst yet,&quot; noted Rothstein. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Why do we have to wait [until] five years from now [for an
answer?]&quot; asked Smith.&nbsp; &quot;Why do we have to wait
... till they tell us, okay, it's toxic and now it's
outlawed?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, only one other state, South Dakota, engages in aerial
herbicide spraying. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Roger Christie of
the Hawaii Hemp Council @ (808) 961-0488 or Jerry Rothstein @

<p align="center"><b>Drug Tax Ruled Unconstitutional By Texas
Appeals Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1996, Austin, TX:</b>&nbsp; A
state law meant to penalize drug dealers by making them pay taxes
on confiscated drugs violates constitutional guarantees against
double jeopardy, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled
Wednesday.&nbsp; The decision is similar to a 1995 Arizona ruling
that prohibited an individual who possessed marijuana from
criminal prosecution &quot;because the tax imposed prior to the
prosecution served a punitive purpose.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lawyers involved in the case said the 5-4 decision means the
state can either impose a drug tax or prosecute an individual for
illegal activity; it can't do both.&nbsp; &quot;This [ruling]
means the state only gets one chance to punish you,&quot; said
Tom Moran, a Houston attorney representing the defendant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision could lead to the review of nearly 1,000 of drug
cases in which both criminal penalties and taxes were
assessed.&nbsp; In cases which all or some of the state drug tax
has been paid, this ruling could be &quot;a pretty good
get-out-of-jail-free card,&quot; said Dan McCrory, an assistant district
attorney for Harris County.&nbsp; A spokesman for the state
comptroller's office told the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> that
counties had referred over 9,000 cases to their offices for
collection of the drug tax. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the recent decision, the court found that Texas' $98 tax on an
ounce of marijuana and $200 per gram of controlled substance was
so high as to conclude, &quot;it ... is a penalty for criminal conduct.&quot;&nbsp;
Therefore, the court ruled that because the defendant had already
been punished by &quot;imposition and partial collection of a
tax,&quot; further prosecution would violate his Fifth Amendment protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The case had initially been denied by Texas courts, but the U.S.
Supreme Court ordered the state courts to reconsider based upon a
1994 Supreme Court ruling on double jeopardy.&nbsp; In that case, <i>Department
of Revenue v. Kurth Ranch</i>, the Supreme Court ruled that to
collect a tax on the possession of drugs from defendants who had
already been charged, convicted, and sentenced on criminal
charges involving the same drugs was the functional equivalent of
a successive criminal prosecution. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Enforcement Administration Attacks
California Medical Marijuana Measure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Drug Enforcement Administration has come out against a
California ballot initiative (Proposition 215) to prevent the
state prosecution of patients who use marijuana for a documented
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a press release issued by Thomas Constantine, chief
administrator, the agency states that it is &quot;firmly
opposed&quot; to the proposal.&nbsp; The agency cites rising
adolescent drug use and an alleged lack of evidence regarding
marijuana's therapeutic value as reasons for holding its
position. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;How can we tell American children to refuse to use illegal
drugs when medical practitioners are prescribing marijuana as
casually as they prescribe penicillin or cough syrup?&quot; he
asked.&nbsp; &quot;The children of America deserve to live a
drug-free life, safe from the effects of drugs, and safe from the
crime and degradation that drug-taking breeds.&nbsp; Proposition
215 sends the unequivocal message that we have surrendered to the
legalizers and have relinquished our principles.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This initiative is not about sending messages to kids, it's
about reality,&quot; said Dave Fratello of Californians for
Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;The reality is that marijuana is
helpful as a medicine.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Marijuana has a 5,000 year medical history and was declared
to be 'one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man' in 1988 by the DEA's own Chief Administrative Law
Judge,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana's medical utility has been endorsed
by such well respected organizations as the American Public
Health Association, National Academy of Sciences, and Federation
of American Scientists.&nbsp; For the DEA to claim otherwise is
fallacious.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proposition 215 is currently endorsed by the San Francisco
Academy of Family Physicians, San Francisco Medical Society,
California Nurses Association, and others.&nbsp; It continues to
have strong voter support and leads by 33 percent, according to
an October 15 Field Poll. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Marijuana Arrests For 1995
Most Ever</b></font><b><br>
FBI Data Confirm Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Toughest Yet</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An estimated* <b>588,963 total marijuana arrests</b>
were made by state and local law enforcement during 1995,
according to the latest edition of the FBI <i>Uniform Crime
Report</i>.&nbsp; This figure is an 18 percent increase above the
1994 level and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests under
the Clinton administration to a staggering 1,450,751.&nbsp; The
1995 yearly arrest total for marijuana violations is the highest
ever recorded by the FBI. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of the 588,963 arrests made for marijuana in 1995, approximately <b>86
percent (503,350) were for simple &quot;possession.&quot;</b>&nbsp;
The remaining 14 percent (85,614 arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot;
a category that includes <b>all</b> cultivation offenses -- even
those where the marijuana was being grown for personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data confirms what <b>NORML</b> has been maintaining
all along,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Despite criticism on Capitol Hill
that this present administration is soft on drugs, the raw data
clearly demonstrates that the federal government's war on
marijuana smokers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime.&nbsp; <b>These new FBI statistics indicate that
one marijuana user is arrested every 54 seconds in America</b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's three
year average of total marijuana arrests (483,548 arrests per
year) is 30 percent higher than the average number of yearly
arrests under the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp;
&quot;These latest figures expose those who claim that America
has abandoned the drug war under Clinton as the political
charlatans they are,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Publication's
Director Paul Armentano.&nbsp; &quot;The fact that adolescent use
rates for marijuana are rising at the same time that law
enforcement is arresting record numbers of users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s
long-held belief that marijuana prohibition is not an effective
deterrent to marijuana consumption.&nbsp; Clinton hasn't
abandoned the drug war; the drug war simply isn't working.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Additional statistics gathered from the <i>Uniform Crime Report</i>
reveal <b>that law enforcement made 1.5 million arrests for drug
abuse violations in 1995,</b> the most ever.&nbsp; This figure is
a 7 percent increase above the 1994 level, 41 percent higher than
in 1991, and 65 percent higher than in 1986.&nbsp; The FBI report
further discloses that the number of individuals arrested for
marijuana possession in 1995 virtually equaled the <b><u>combined</u></b>
total number of individuals arrested for possessing heroin,
cocaine, and/or their derivatives. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on marijuana arrests, please contact
Allen St. Pierre or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>
@ (202) 483-5500.</i></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">*No arrest data for Kansas,
Montana, and most of Illinois law enforcement agencies were available
to the FBI for 1995.&nbsp; Therefore, arrest totals for these
states were estimated by the FBI for inclusion in the overall
total.</font></p>

On October 14, Jim and Cheryl Miller will embark on a 235-mile
walk to Washington D.C. to raise awareness for medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1971, Ms. Miller has been
unable to walk for over a dozen years.&nbsp; Her physician has
prescribed her numerous medications, including the synthetic THC capsule
Marinol, yet she claims that natural marijuana offers her the
greatest relief for her illness.&nbsp; Her doctor states that he
would prescribe her marijuana in the plant form if it was legal
to do so. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that by bringing attention to my wife Cheryl, I can
cause marijuana to be made available so that she and others are
no longer needlessly forced to suffer with their pain or risk
arrest,&quot; said Mr. Miller.&nbsp; &quot;Right now, the only
relief Cheryl can get from her painful muscle spasms subjects her to
the risk of being put in jall and having her bank account and
property seized.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Millers intend to arrive in Washington, D.C. on October 21,

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Challenges Harassment Of
Students With Hemp Jewelry</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 8, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML has sent a letter to the Willoughby/Eastlake School
District demanding that the school system stop harassing students
for wearing jewelry made from hemp fiber.&nbsp; Schools in the
district have been sending students to the principle's office and
calling parents to &quot;discourage&quot; students from wearing
hemp jewelry, in accordance with a new policy enacted by school
officials in September. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Spokespeople for the school system claim that the policy is
designed to promote a drug-free environment and stifle
&quot;sympathetic&quot; leanings toward marijuana, but Northcoast
NORML contends that the administrators' intentions do not give
them license to violate the First Amendment.&nbsp; &quot;Legal precedents
make it clear that students have the right to engage in symbolic
speech,&quot; said Northcoast NORML President John Hartman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter, written by Attomey William Saks, states that the
courts have consistently ruled that &quot;students' viewpoints
cannot be constitutionally suppressed even if they can be
interpreted as being pro-drug.&nbsp; Assuming ... that the
students wearing hemp are expressing sympathy for marijuana use,
... the fact that marijuana use is illegal does not invalidate
the First Amendment protection for the students'
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The letter demands a written promise that the school system will
cease all action inhibiting the wearing of hemp in school. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Hemp is a natural, [legal] fiber that is attractive and
hip,&quot; said Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;A student has a right to
wear it whether they are promoting the medicinal value of
marijuana, protesting the laws against it, or just for fun.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Dole Aide Reportedly Used Pot In College</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1996, Hartford, CT:</b>&nbsp; John
Buckley, communications director for Republican Presidential
Candidate Bob Dole, may have regularly used marijuana while in
college, according to allegations made by former classmates. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a story that first ran in a Boston weekly last month, former
classmates of Buckley said that they recall him using and
occasionally selling marijuana while he attended Hampshire
College in Amherst, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Most describe Buckley's
alleged relationship with marijuana to have been typical for the
environment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Yes, he smoked pot.&nbsp; So what?&nbsp; A lot of people
smoked pot,&quot; said former college roommate Ed Benfey during
an interview with <i>Reuters News Service</i>.&nbsp; &quot;It was
socially acceptable in that place and time to smoke pot.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Benfey said that he didn't specifically remember Buckley ever
selling pot, but a second classmate speaking to the Boston
Phoenix anonymously maintained he both smoked and bought marijuana
from Buckley. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the allegations in a prepared statement, Buckley
maintained that, &quot;Whether I or any member of the Dole or
Clinton staff used marijuana 20 years ago when in college is not
a relevant issue and I'm not going to respond to further
questions on the subject.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole has recently attacked Clinton as being soft on the drug
issue and specifically criticized the President for hiring people
to the White House who had used drugs in the past.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Aims For 1998
Election</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1996, Portland, OR:</b>&nbsp; A
proposed Oregon initiative measure to allow adults to purchase
cannabis in state liquor stores has been certified by the state
Supreme Court and activists are already gearing up to place the
measure on the November 1998 state ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although this year's proposal failed to collect the 73,261
registered voters' signatures necessary to place the initiative
on the 1996 ballot, organizers are convinced that a future, more
organized, and better funded campaign will be successful.&nbsp;
&quot;The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA) made it two-thirds of
the way to the ballot with less than $10,000,&quot; stated a
press release from initiative organizers.&nbsp; &quot;That is
amazing in this age of dollar driven politics.&nbsp; We [expect]
to raise $100,000 to qualify OCTA for the 1998 Oregon ballot
[and] we will begin on a volunteer effort now.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If passed, OCTA will replace all state and local marijuana laws
except for DUI laws and will permit adults to purchase marijuana
from state liquor stores.&nbsp; The measure would also allow doctors
to prescribe marijuana to patients through pharmacies, allow
farmers to grow marijuana with a license for sales to the state,
allow adults to grow marijuana for personal use without a license,
and allow for industrial hemp cultivation.&nbsp; Ninety percent
of the net proceeds will go to a state general fund, and the
remaining 10 percent will be used to fund drug abuse education
and treatment programs.&nbsp; Sale and possession to minors will
still remain strictly prohibited. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Political Cartoonist Supports Proposition
215, Angers State Attorney General</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 3, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California State Attorney General Dan Lungren thinks that the
nationally syndicated comic-strip <i>Doonesbury</i> is going to
pot, and he isn't amused. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lungren is upset over this week's series of Doonesbury cartoons
focusing on the police raid on the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers
Club and promoting Proposition 215, a state ballot initiative to prevent
the state prosecution of patients who use marijuana for a
documented medical need.&nbsp; Lungren was responsible for
ordering the August 4 raid on the club and is one of the chief opponents
of Proposition 215.&nbsp; He has asked Universal Press Syndicate,
which distributes the cartoon, to either pull this week's strips
or include a disclaimer saying the cartoon is inaccurate.&nbsp; UPS
is doing neither. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This week's <i>Doonesbury</i> strips clearly advance the
wink-and-nod attitude toward drug use that is most responsible
for the addition of thousands of American kids to the drugged and
at risk roster,&quot; argued Lungren in a letter to the <i>San
Francisco Chronicle</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cannabis Buyers' Club Founder Dennis Peron countered that Lungren
was advocating censorship.&nbsp; &quot;Instead of attacking
characters in a cartoon, why doesn't he meet me in a
debate?&quot; he asked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This week's <i>Doonesbury</i> strips are bringing national
exposure to a situation in dire need of widespread attention and
reform,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;National polls indicate that Americans
delineate between marijuana use for recreational purposes and medical
needs and strongly support the latter.&nbsp; If Doonesbury can
help further the debate, then it's a positive step.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Doonesbury</i> creator Garry Trudeau has refused to comment
specifically on Lungren's attacks, but did weigh in on the issue
of marijuana prohibition in the September 16 issue of <i>Time
Magazine</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Before we can get any traction on controlling pot, ... the
generation that popularized the stuff has got to finally come
clean about what made it so alluring in the first place -- and
then square that with current marijuana policy,&quot; Trudeau
wrote.&nbsp; &quot;A good start might be for every middle-aged public
official in America to take the following oath. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... I concede that I once did not view marijuana as
dangerous.&nbsp; ... It was only after my appetite for
recreational drugs had abated, and I produced children whom I did
not believe capable of 'handling' marijuana as responsibly as I
had, that I came to oppose decriminalization.&nbsp; I acknowledge
that it was this fear, and not new medical evidence, that caused
me to subsequently support mandatory sentencing for other
people's children caught emulating the actions of my generation.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court To Rule On Drug Testing Of
Political Candidates</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Supreme Court will review the constitutionality of a Georgia
law mandating candidates to pass a drug test before qualifying to
run for elected state office. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The law is being challenged by attorney and former Libertarian
candidate for Lieutenant Governor Walker Chandler.&nbsp; Chandler
is appealing a 2-1 decision issued this past January by the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals upholding the law.&nbsp; Chandler said
that the 11 page dissent in that case made his challenge
appealing to the High Court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I do not believe that the suspicionless search in these
circumstances serves any special governmental need beyond the
normal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe that
the candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmental
interests,&quot; opined dissenting Circuit Judge Rosemary
Barkett, raising questions about the U.S. Constitution's Fourth
Amendment guarantee to be free from unreasonable search and
seizure.&nbsp; &quot;We are not merely dealing with the denial of
a job opportunity, but with the denial of the opportunity to
participate in our democratic form of government.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barkett's dissent also called into question apparent First
Amendment violations posed by the controversial law.&nbsp;
&quot;The majority maintains that the government's purpose [in
passing this legislation] is not suppression of free
expression.&nbsp; Yet, it supports it by citing the importance of ensuring
that elected officials are 'persons appreciative of the perils of
drug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction efforts.'&nbsp;
Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holding
public office appears to be a content-based restriction on free
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In taking the case, the Supreme Court will also determine how far
the government may go in requiring people to submit to drug tests
where there is no particular suspicion of individual wrongdoing,
reports the Washington Post. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s Amicus Curiae Committee will file an amicus brief
in the case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Georgia law does not apply to congressional candidates, whose
qualifications are prescribed by the U.S. Constitution and
Congress itself. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Attorney Walker Chandler
@ (800) 560-3882.&nbsp; For more information about drug testing,
please contact Allen St. Pierre or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>

<p align="center"><b>Ohio High School Cracks Down On Hemp</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 3, 1996, Eastlake, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Students at North High School in Eastlake Ohio who wear jewelry
made out of hemp fiber will be sent to the principle's office and
have their parents notified, according to a new policy enacted by
school officials this past Tuesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Critics of the policy argue that the new rule inhibits freedom of
expression and amounts to nothing more than harassment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's extremism on the [anti-drug] issue,&quot; said
Northcoast NORML chapter president John Hartman, who announced
that he would provide hemp clothing and twine to interested
students.&nbsp; &quot;Is the intention to pick out students and
harass them or attempt to enforce their drug-free school policy?&nbsp;
Either way, [it's] persecuting them for wearing [legal] hemp
jewelry.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to principle George Spinner, a proponent of the policy,
hemp jewelry symbolizes &quot;sympathy&quot; toward marijuana, a
view that he believes to be unacceptable in a school
environment.&nbsp; &quot;The truth is, they are wearing it
because of the relationship of hemp and marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Spinner noted that the jewelry will not be confiscated, but
admits that officials are asking students not to wear it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By their own admission, school officials are trying to
suppress a political statement about our government's policies
toward marijuana and industrial hemp,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This harassment
clearly infringes upon a student's constitutional guarantee of freedom
of expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Several students have approached Northcoast NORML to complain
about the new policy and some have begun to hand out fliers
challenging the rule.&nbsp; Over 1,500 students attend the
school. <br>

<p align="center">September 26, 1996</p>

<p align="center"><b>Government Marijuana Researcher Speaks
Favorably About Marijuana's Medical Utility</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 21, 1996:</b>&nbsp; In a recent
interview conducted by the Journal of the International Hemp
Association (JIHA) in Amsterdam, Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly -- Director
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA's) Marijuana
Project at the University of Mississippi and one of the federal
government's premiere marijuana experts -- spoke openly about
marijuana's medical potential. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, ElSohly discussed the possible medical role of
cannabichromene (CBC), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in
marijuana.&nbsp; He also spoke about the limited effectiveness of
oral THC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to ElSohly, CBC occurs in high portions of certain
strains of marijuana, but has been typically overlooked because
it is difficult to distinguish from the more familiar property, cannabidiol
(CBD), in standard chemical tests.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the
pharmaceutical properties of CBC and CBD are quite distinct. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;CBD is famous for [its] anti-convulsant activity ... [and]
CBC obviously has good anti-inflammatory activity,&quot; remarked
ElSohly.&nbsp; &quot;Certainly there is the [anecdotal use of
medical marijuana historically] and every day you look at the
cannabinoids and activities in the light of today's science and
today's pharmacology and so on, and you can really go back and
scientifically and legitimately explain the use of cannabis over
the years for so many things. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot; ... There is no question about the use of cannabis for
certain conditions.&nbsp; It does have a history.&nbsp; It does
have the utility and so on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the issue of smoked inhalation of marijuana versus
orally consumed THC, ElSohly commented that THC in oral
preparation &quot;doesn't seem to be doing the good job it should.&quot;&nbsp;
He speculated that this is because oral and smoked THC produce
different pharmacological profiles in the body.&nbsp; Because
oral doses are processed by the liver before entering the
bloodstream, oral THC produces high levels of the metabolite
11-hydroxy-THC, while smoked marijuana does not.&nbsp; Since
11-hydroxy-THC is four to five times more psychoactive than regular
THC, this may explain why some users report a high rate of
overdoses and discomfort with Marinol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The comments made by Dr. ElSohly indicate that their exists
not only anecdotal, but accepted scientific evidence supporting
marijuana's medicinal properties,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It also specifies that
there exists chemical properties in marijuana other than THC that
hold medical value, further supporting the argument that
marijuana appears superior to synthetic THC as a medicine.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information or for a copy of the interview please

<p align="center"><b>House Holds Hearing On Adolescent Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, 1996, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Purporting that adolescent drug use has reached &quot;epidemic&quot;
levels, a joint hearing of the House Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Youth and Families, and the House Government Reform
and Oversight Subcommittee on National Security was held today. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Those testifying before the House included Former Administrator
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Robert Bonner,
Executive Vice President of the Parents' Resource Institute for
Drug Education (PRIDE) Douglas Hall, Ohio Congressman Rob
Portman, and others. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hall's appearance before the committees coincided with the
release of a 1996 PRIDE survey indicating rising levels of
adolescent illicit drug use.&nbsp; According to the study, nearly
38 percent of high school seniors reported trying marijuana once
within the past year.&nbsp; &quot;Drug use by today's teenagers
is not just part of growing up, a youthful indiscretion,&quot;
said Hall.&nbsp; &quot;More students are using more drugs more
frequently, and their use is more hardcore than we have ever
seen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Ladies and gentleman, drugs kill,&quot; announced Rep.
Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham, Chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families.&nbsp;
&quot;It is more important than ever to be absolutely
uncompromising about this message.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This hearing was nothing other than a pre-election dog and
pony show,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Despite claims from both parties that
spending toward anti-drug efforts have been slashed, federal
figures demonstrate that annual federal drug control spending increased
from less than five billion in 1988 to more than 15 billion for
fiscal year 1997.&nbsp; According to government statistics,
illicit drug use during this period of time has remained
virtually unchanged among adults and actually risen slightly
among adolescents.&nbsp; We cannot continue to keep throwing money
at the problem and arresting record numbers of adult users and
expect any sort of tangible results.&quot; <br>

both doctors and patients and will include a host of speakers,
including San Francisco Supervisors Angela Alioto and Tom Ammiano
as well as representatives of the Proposition 215 campaign for

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Though the focus of the exposition will be on the medical uses of
cannabis, the event will also have forty booths relating to
hemp's industrial uses.&nbsp; In addition, the Human Rights 95

medical purposes, were also seized. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This marks the third bust of a cannabis buyers' club since August
and demonstrates a definite pattern among law enforcement to
target medical marijuana organizations.&nbsp; &quot;This [bust
signifies] a new low in the war on pot,&quot; said California
NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp; &quot;Our marijuana laws
are clearly bankrupt when they let law enforcement authorities
run amok arresting people for providing medicine to the

medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to an article that appeared in the August 9 edition of

only accepted if they were referred by local AIDS treatment
organizations. <br>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Alternative Therapies Group
Distributes Medical Marijuana<br>
To San Francisco's Sick</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 13, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A group that specializes in providing nontraditional remedies to
AIDS sufferers worldwide has begun distributing marijuana to
patients out of the Metropolitan Community Church in San
Francisco. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This was not an easy decision,&quot; said Curtis Ponzi of
the Healing Alternatives Foundation (HAF), the organization
responsible for the distribution.&nbsp; &quot;It was very stormy,
very emotional.&nbsp; But we're filling a void.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The foundation, founded in the early l980s, provides a variety of
herbal remedies and non-FDA approved drugs at-cost to seriously
ill patients.&nbsp; The organization makes no therapeutic claims about
its products and urges buyers to discuss therapies with a doctor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Patients purchasing marijuana from the foundation must provide a
note from their doctor stating that they have a legitimate
medical need for cannabis.&nbsp; The foundation then double
checks with the physician, a process that takes about a
week.&nbsp; The verification process is thorough enough to discourage
recreational users from attempting to purchase marijuana, stated
Ponzi. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Community reaction to the program appears positive.&nbsp;
&quot;Both Mayor [Willie] Brown and I think this is a sound
program,&quot; said Dean Goodwin, an aide to the San Francisco
mayor.&nbsp; &quot;They're concentrating on the people who really
need [the marijuana.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the San Francisco Police Department seems ready to
exercise a policy of benign neglect with regard to the renewed
distribution.&nbsp; &quot;We would only be interested in this if
it became obvious that they were selling [marijuana] to people
who weren't sick,&quot; said narcotics division Sgt. Kurt
Bruneman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Metropolitan Community Church pastor Jim Mitulski said he is
allowing his church to be used for the foundation's marijuana
sales because medical cannabis is essential to the well-being of
many congregation members.&nbsp; The current program is expected
to operate on a weekly basis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are not distributing it -- the foundation is,&quot;
Mitulski said.&nbsp; He notes that at least three additional
churches may also participate in medical marijuana distribution
in the near future. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, state law enforcement officials claim they will
watch and wait.&nbsp; &quot;We're looking at it and we're aware
of [marijuana being distributed by the HAF,]&quot; said Steve
Telliano, press secretary for state Attorney General Dan
Lungren.&nbsp; &quot;We're just keeping an eye on the situation
to see what's happening.&quot; <br>

Medical Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, 1996, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp;
Cancer patient and medical marijuana activist Ralph Seeley will
argue before the state Supreme Court on September 25 that the
state's constitution requires marijuana to be available as a
prescription substance. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1995, Seeley won a declaratory judgment from trial court Judge
Rosanne Buckner that Washington's ban on medical marijuana
violates the state's constitution's reliance on &quot;fundamental principles.&quot;&nbsp;
Under guidelines agreed upon by both Seeley and the state
Attorney General's Office before the trial, the losing party
would seek a direct review of the decision in the state Supreme Court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An amicus brief in support of medical marijuana, prepared by
Attorney Michael Cutler of Boston, Massachusetts, has been filed
by <b>NORML</b>'s Amicus Curiae Committee.&nbsp; Additional briefs
on behalf of Seeley have been filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) and The Drug Policy Foundation
(DPF).&nbsp; &quot;A positive verdict in this case would further
bolster the growing public support for access to medical
marijuana both in Washington state and nationally,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; St. Pierre noted that on
March 30, 1996, Washington State Governor Mike Lowry signed into
law a state budget allocating $130,000 to medicinal marijuana
research, including investigating ways of cultivating marijuana
to be used for medicinal purposes. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Polls Show Voters Strongly Favor
Medical Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, 1996, California:</b>&nbsp; Two
separate California polls released today indicate that voters
strongly favor Proposition 215, a statewide initiative that would
allow patients with a physician's recommendation to possess and
cultivate marijuana for medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the results of a Field Poll reported by the <i>San
Jose Mercury News</i> and <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, among
those likely to vote, 62 percent said they would vote for
Proposition 215 and 29 percent said they would vote against it;
nine percent were undecided.&nbsp; Among all registered
California voters, 61 percent favor the measure and 30 percent
are opposed.&nbsp; The survey of 291 respondents has a margin of
error of six percentage points. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a separate telephone poll conducted by the <i>Los Angeles
Times</i>, 53 percent of respondents said they would vote for the
proposal and 31 percent said they would vote against it; 16
percent were undecided. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is overwhelming support,&quot; said Steve Hopcraft of
Californians for Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;California voters
cannot accept that their doctors can prescribe morphine for
cancer, AIDS, and other [serious illnesses] but not
marijuana.&nbsp; This is great news. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;These findings, coupled with the results of similar polls
conducted both in California and nationally, demonstrate that
there is ample support for the legalization of medical marijuana
among the voting public,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The results of the two recent California polls are the latest in
a series of surveys indicating strong support for medical
marijuana.&nbsp; A 1995 survey conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of the
American public agreed that patients who find marijuana an
effective therapeutic agent should be able to use it
legally.&nbsp; In addition, nine state polls have shown that a
strong majority of Californians support medical marijuana. <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The AIDS commission's resolution urged McCaffrey, who on
September 12 held a press conference in Los Angeles attacking the

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
A state Attorney General official said Grand Traverse County
Sheriff Harold Barr's decision to allow jail inmates to help put

state election laws.&nbsp; The assertion comes nearly one month
after Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance, who helped to

<p align="center"><b>Califano Attacks Attitudes Of Baby-Boomer
Parents<br>
Regarding Adolescent Mariiuana Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 9, 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
fact that a growing number of today's teens are experimenting
with marijuana is not seen as a &quot;crisis&quot; by many
baby-boomer parents who tried marijuana during their youth,
reported a recent study released by the National Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, approximately half of the parents surveyed admItted
to having tried marijuana in their youth and 46 percent said they
expected their teen to try illegal drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;What is infuriating ... is the resignation of so many
parents,&quot; said CASA head Joseph Califano.&nbsp; &quot;That
is not a climate that is sending a clear and loud message to a
kid: Don't use drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, Califano was alarmed at the attitudes of parents
who had formerly used marijuana.&nbsp; According to the study, 65
percent of parents who had tried marijuana believe their own
children will use drugs.&nbsp; Also, 42 percent of those parents
did not perceive use of marijuana by an adolescent under 16 years
of age as a crisis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Califano argued that many parents need to be aware that the
marijuana used by individuals today is far stronger than the
marijuana of yesteryear.&nbsp; This claim has been refuted by <b>NORML</b> repeatedly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There exists absolutely no evidence that marijuana THC
content has increased significantly over the past two
decades,&quot; responded <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This fact is acknowledged by both the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) and is confirmed by the scientific data
from the Potency Monitoring Project in Mississippi.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study also indicated that many adolescents have easier access
to marijuana than they do other regulated intoxicants like
cigarettes and alcohol.&nbsp; Califano did not believe that this
finding supported a need to regulate marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Legalization of marijuana would be a disaster,&quot; he
responded on a National Public Radio broadcast.&nbsp; Califano
did not elaborate further. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that children currently have easier access to
marijuana than they do cigarettes or alcohol speaks volumes of
the need to legalize and regulate marijuana, if only to more
effectively keep it out of the hands of children,&quot; said St.
Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;CASA National Survey of American attitudes on Substance
Abuse II: Teens and Parents&quot; was conducted during July and
August by telephone of 1,200 adolescents age 12 through 17 and 1,166
parents, all with children of the same age group. <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Like many other Republican politicians, Dole loves the
insane 'War on Drugs,'&quot; said Brown.&nbsp; &quot;But all
freedom-loving Americans should reject this vision of a nation at

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... Government can't keep drugs out of the country, it
can't even keep drugs out of its own prisons.&nbsp; Militarizing
the 'War on Drugs' won't solve the problem; the only realistic

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It makes great ink, and it makes great film at 11, but in
reality I question the effectiveness of such a program, said
defense attorney David Boone.&nbsp; Boone argued that most

<p align="center"><b>Senate Holds Special Hearing On Teen Drug
Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 4, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In wake of a Department of Health and Human Services report
indicating that monthly use of illicit substances has doubled
among adolescents since 1992, the Senate Judiciary Committee
convened a special hearing to examine the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Speaking before the committee were Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY),
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala, and John Walters.&nbsp; All agreed that programs
to reverse current trends in teen drug use must focus on 1)
tougher drug penalties for adult users; 2) a clear and concise
message that use of any illicit substance is wrong; and 3) increased
federal spending on youth education programs such as DARE. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;What both the speakers and senators neglected to mention is
that none of these options have been effective in reducing teen
drug use,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Publications Director Paul
Armentano, who attended the hearing.&nbsp; &quot;Today's
graduating seniors are the first generation of adolescents who were
exposed to the most massive, consistent, and expensive federal
anti-drug campaign ever launched.&nbsp; They grew up listening to
DARE officers in the classroom and public service announcements
from the Partnership for a Drug Free America when they came home;
yet the statistics indicate that they are using drugs at far
higher rates than were their predecessors just four and five
years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In addition, more drug offenders are being arrested and
incarcerated for longer periods of time than ever before in our
nation's history.&nbsp; Clearly, this problem requires more than
the standard Washington rhetoric.&quot; <br>

Joint, Lose Your License&quot; Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 3, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Minutes before its post-midnight adjournment, the California
State Senate enacted a temporary, emergency &quot;Smoke a Joint,
Lose Your License&quot; bill.&nbsp; The decision surprised many
who noted that the Senate had turned down a similar measure
earlier in the day. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation was passed at the insistence of Gov. Pete Wilson,
a long-time advocate of the federal mandate.&nbsp; The law
requires a six-month driver's license suspension for all drug
offenses, regardless of whether they are driving-related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">State Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer is said to have
reluctantly agreed to the measure as a means of guaranteeing
federal highway aid.&nbsp; Under federal law, California must be
in compliance as of October 1, 1996 or else lose $100 million in
highway funding.&nbsp; The bill was passed as an emergency
measure so as to take effect immediately upon the Governor's
signature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In deference to opponents, the new law is set to expire within
six months.&nbsp; This will set the stage for another &quot;Smoke
a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; battle next year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Gov. Wilson's insistence on this foolish federal mandate is
one more costly example of Republican anti-drug hypocrisy,&quot;
said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp;
&quot;It's clearly absurd for the government to take [your]
driver's license away for possessing a joint in your home, yet
not for speeding and reckless driving with a bottle in your
car.&quot; <br>

Charges<br>
After Being Banned From Attending Public Rally</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Columbus, NC:</b>&nbsp; A
North Carolina couple were arrested and charged with trespassing
by the Polk County Sheriff's Department after attending a public
rally to promote medicinal marijuana in front of the county
courthouse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both Steve and Jean Marlowe were involved in organizing
the event, billed as the Second Annual Freedom Rally, Mr. Marlowe
had been told by county officials that he was forbidden from
attending because of allegations he smoked marijuana at last
year's festival.&nbsp; Marlowe was arrested on charges of
marijuana possession after last year's event, but the case is still
pending. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jean Marlowe argues that the recent arrest was in violation of
their civil liberties and the couple plans on pursuing legal
action against the county.&nbsp; &quot;County council says they
can set their own rules, but they can't violate your
rights,&quot; she said.&nbsp; &quot;They can't forbid you to
attend a rally.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Philadelphia attorney Lawrence Hirsch has agreed to take the case
on behalf of the Marlowes and called the suit a matter of
principle.&nbsp; &quot;To me, every step of the way, [the county]
seem to be creating a case that's bound to blow up in there
face,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1995, <b>NORML</b> and the Southern California American Civil
Liberties Union filed a civil rights lawsuit against an Anaheim

<p align="center"><b>Juror Held In Contempt After Refusing To
Convict Drug Offender</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1996, Gilpin County, CO:</b>&nbsp; A
juror who maintains that she had &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;
regarding the guilt of a drug defendant could face over six
months in prison and an unspecified fine after being cited by
Gilpin County Judge Kenneth Barnhill for contempt of court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Laura Kriho is scheduled to begin a jury trial in late September
to defend herself against allegations that she tainted a jury in
the case of a 19 year-old female defendant charged with felony possession
of methamphetamine.&nbsp; According to Barnhill, Kriho allegedly
disobeyed a court order by discussing sentences in her
deliberations.&nbsp; Kriho insisted that she ultimately voted to
acquit because she had reasonable doubts as to the defendant's
guilt based on the facts of the case as presented by the
prosecution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barnhill also alleged that Kriho committed perjury by lying under
oath to the Judge and the attorneys by failing to volunteer
information regarding a prior drug conviction from 1984.&nbsp;
Kriho argued that she was never specifically asked about her
criminal history and notes that she received a deferred sentence
for the 1984 conviction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I tried to do my job as a juror well,&quot; Kriho
said.&nbsp; &quot;I had never been on a jury before, and the whole
experience was unique and very stressful.&nbsp; Now I feel I am
being unfairly singled-out and punished for coming up with the
'wrong' verdict.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Paul Grant, who is representing Kriho in this case,
warned that the prosecution of his client threatens to undermine
the jury system.&nbsp; &quot;Jurors must be able to deliberate
independently of the judge, without the threat of criminal
prosecution hanging over their heads,&quot; he stated. <br>

<p align="center"><b>State Looks Into Filing Tax Violations
Against Marijuana Club Proprietors</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
State officials are probing into whether proprietors of the San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club may have violated federal and
state tax laws by failing to report club revenue to the
IRS.&nbsp; Failing to report income, including income generated
through illegal activities, is against the law.&nbsp; The
allegation is the latest in a series of accusations made by state
law enforcement officials since the club was raided on August
4.&nbsp; To date, no individuals have been arrested in connection
with the club, nor have any formal charges been filed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California Bureau of Narcotics Chief Joe Doane said that the
issue of possible tax evasion arose because agents found no
documents related to the withholding of salary for Social
Security, state and federal taxes and workers' compensation for
employees of the club.&nbsp; &quot;That indicates [that club
founder Dennis Peron] was not following state and federal laws
regarding payment of taxes on salaries and benefits,&quot; argued
state attorney general's office spokesman Steve Telliano. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dennis Peron told United Press International that standard
business practices were not followed at the club because of the
underground nature of supplying medical marijuana to those who
needed it.&nbsp; &quot;Until we change the law, you have to
realize that what we are doing is illegal.&nbsp; We've had to do things
a certain way to protect the people whose lives we were trying to
help.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Californians for Compassionate Use treasurer John Entwistle
called the state's latest allegation &quot;another red
herring&quot; and reiterated that all profits were distributed
back into the club.&nbsp; &quot;If we had bought big houses, then
we'd be ashamed,&quot; he remarked.&nbsp; &quot;But we didn't;
we've all taken vows of poverty.&nbsp; There is no hidden
money.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Officials report that criminal charges involving both the tax
issue as well as other facets of the club's activities may be
filed in three to four weeks. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Governor Signs Law Reinvigorating State
Medical Marijuana Research Program</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August, 1996, Boston, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
Gov. William Weld signed into law legislation (H. 2170) that
would reinvigorate the state marijuana therapeutic research
program and eventually provide for a medical necessity legal
defense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As amended by the state legislature, H. 2170 will direct the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to pass rules and
regulations within 180 days for the establishment of a marijuana
medical research program.&nbsp; Like many states, Massachusetts
had previously adopted legislation allowing for such a program,
but had never addressed the issues of funding, regulations, or viable
sources for marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The legislation was proposed by Rep. Pat Jehlen (D-Somerville)
after communicating with a constituent who used marijuana as a
therapeutic agent to combat severe nausea.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
Legal Committee member Michael Cutler, Esq. helped draft the
legislation. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Cincinnati Buyers' Club Founder Pleads
Guilty To Reduced Marijuana Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 20, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Buyers' Club,
plead guilty to a reduced misdemeanor charge of trafficking in
marijuana under eight ounces and was sentenced to serve 29 days in
county jail.&nbsp; Evans will begin his sentence in
September.&nbsp; Evans had been facing three felony counts of
trafficking in marijuana within 1,000 yards of a school following
a February raid by law enforcement officers on the club's headquarters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I was facing a total of 15 years in prison; they were
offering 29 days in county jail,&quot; Evans said after he
entered his guilty plea in Kenton Circuit Court.&nbsp; Initially,
Evans had considered battling the charges on constitutional
grounds. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prosecutors agreed to reduce the charges against Evans after
conceding that his actions &quot;were not done as part of a
commercial enterprise [or] ... for purposes of
profit.&quot;&nbsp; Evans told <b>NORML</b> that the judge in the
case remarked that she believed that marijuana for medical
purposes would eventually be legal in America, but noted that
individuals have to abide by the law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked whether he would continue to operate the buyers' club
once he completes his jail term, Evans responded that it wouldn't
be &quot;in this country.&quot;&nbsp; However, he added that,
&quot;There's plenty of people lined up to take over.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans called the judgment a &quot;partial victory&quot; and told <b>NORML</b>
that a short stay in jail was a fair price for the large amount
of publicity his case generated.</p>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Files Complaint<br>
After Voters Strike Down Ballot Proposal To Decriminalize
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1996, Traverse City, MI:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a city ballot initiative to decriminalize marijuana
possession have filed a complaint with the Secretary of State
alleging that opponents of the measure violated state campaign
finance laws.&nbsp; The proposal was rejected by voters by a 58
to 42 percent vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The complaint, spearheaded by Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance,
maintains that Traverse City Police Chief Ralph Soffredine, Prosecutor
Dennis LaBelle, and others acted as a political committee but
failed to file any papers with the county clerk as required under
the Michigan Campaign Finance Acts.&nbsp; The complaint also
alleges that opponents sent out a biased flyer against the
proposal using the tax-funded mailing permit of Traverse
City.&nbsp; Bustance is demanding a new election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We've had two successful initiatory petitions filed and if
these claims [prove] substantial then we at least deserve one
fair election,&quot; Bustance said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Traverse City officials admit that the city paid to send out over
9,400 flyers in a one-time mailing, but deny that the mailing was
an attempt to influence voters against the ballot proposal.&nbsp; The
flyer was titled &quot;Marijuana: Facts to Consider.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Michigan law, a person who knowingly violates
campaign finance rules could be punished by up to a year in jail
or a $2,000 fine.&nbsp; An organization that does so may receive
up to a $20,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot had been a rocky one for marijuana
activists. Chapter organizers' 1994 initiative drive was rejected
by the city commission despite having well over the required
number of signatures, because it allegedly conflicted with state
law.&nbsp; This year's petition was devoid of legal problems, but faced
severe opposition from city commissioners who in December unanimously passed
a resolution asking residents not to sign the petition.&nbsp; The commission
later passed a resolution encouraging voters to vote against the proposal. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Dutch Cities Get Into The Marijuana Business</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1996, Delfzijl, Netherlands:</b>&nbsp;
For two decades, Dutch officials have tolerated the sale of
marijuana and hashish in coffee shops; now some are going into
business for themselves. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Authorities in the town of Delfzijl are spending $294,117 to open
a coffee shop on September 1, reports the Associated Press.&nbsp;
It is modeled on a similar project in the town of Bussum, outside Amsterdam.&nbsp;
Profits from the store will fund education campaigns on drug use,
and the store will be staffed with counselors and youth workers
offering free health information on drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Of course we don't want people to use drugs, but that's not
realistic,&quot; said Delfzijl City Hall spokeswoman Marjon
Edzes.&nbsp; &quot;This is a healthier solution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite their policy of tolerating the sale of marijuana and
hashish, the number of Dutch adolescents who have ever used
marijuana is far lower than in America.&nbsp; Dutch politicians
maintain that their policy discourages hard drug use by
separating the illicit drug markets. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Dole Calls For Larger Military Presence In
Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 25, Palos Park, Ill:</b>&nbsp;
Responding to figures of rising illicit drug use among
adolescents, Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole vowed to
greatly increase the role of the military in combating drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We will make drug interdiction a priority for our
intelligence services, beefing up not just technical operations
but also human intelligence operations,&quot; said Dole during a
recent campaign speech.&nbsp; &quot;We will expand the use of
military technology, including reconnaissance and satellites and area
surveillance and listening posts to track drug movements toward
our borders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole also advocated using the National Guard in domestic drug
interdiction efforts.&nbsp; &quot;Working with the governors, we
will create designated National Guard units with appropriate
training and equipment to provide a rapid response
capability.&nbsp; If we need the National Guard to move in, they'll
have the training.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Dole's proposals are nothing new,&quot; commented <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Increasing the use
of military technology to interdict drugs began under the Bush
administration at the cost of millions of taxpayers' dollars, yet
yielded few tangible results.&nbsp; Also, the National Guard has
been utilized in domestic drug enforcement -- generally marijuana
eradication -- since Congress authorized its use in 1988 by
sidestepping the Posse Comitatus Act of 1879 that forbids the use
of federal troops in civilian law enforcement.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dole defended his proposals by alleging that the threat of drugs,
like the threat of terrorism from abroad, was an area where the
military had a proper role. <br>

<p align="center"><b>America's Prison Population More Than
Doubles In A Decade</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 18, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
There were approximately 1.6 million men and women in the
nation's jails and prisons last year, reported the Department of
Justice.&nbsp; This figure is a 113 percent increase since 1985
and equates to one out of every 167 U.S. residents in jail or
prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since 1980 -- when the number of inmates in state or federal
prisons or in local jails stood at just over 500,000 --
incarceration growth in the United States has ballooned over 200
percent.&nbsp; According to federal statistics, the most
significant factor for this dramatic increase is drug
arrests.&nbsp; Drug offenders now comprise more than 25 percent
of all U.S. inmates, up from less than ten percent in the
mid-1980s. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While Congress and politicians are calling for tougher
sentencing and tougher judges, they are conveniently neglecting
the fact that America already incarcerates a larger percentage of
its population than any other country; this is a direct result of
the drug war,&quot; said NORML Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately, after listening to recent
campaign speeches by both the Dole and Clinton camps, it appears
this trend is far from over.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Latest Edition Of Household Survey Fuels
Election Year Fodder <br>
NORML Responds To Calls To Escalate The Drug War</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 21, 1996: Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Illicit drug use (defined as use at least once in the past month)
among adolescents age 12 to 17 rose 33 percent since last year
and now stands at 10.9 percent, reports the latest annual
findings from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.&nbsp; The
use of marijuana, the illicit drug used primarily by adolescents,
increased from 7.3 percent to 8.2 percent. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Not surprisingly, both prohibitionists and politicians are using
the latest statistics to call for increased anti-drug
efforts.&nbsp; &quot;This is nothing short of a national
tragedy,&quot; said Republican nominee Bob Dole.&nbsp;
&quot;Starting next January, I'm going to make the drug war
priority No. 1 once again.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In light of the recent data, <b>NORML</b> issued the following
statement.&nbsp; As always, <b>NORML</b> remains committed to the
notion that adolescents grow up drug-free. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statistics indicating rising levels of teen marijuana
use cited by the National Household Survey should be an issue of
concern for both parents and political leaders alike.&nbsp; <u>However,
there is no evidence to demonstrate that increasing penalties
against adult users will amend the problem.</u>&nbsp; In fact,
federal statistics indicate that just the opposite is true. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Despite criticism that the Clinton administration has
abandoned the drug war, FBI figures from its annual Uniform Crime
Report illustrate that nearly one-half million Americans were
arrested on marijuana charges in 1994 -- more than 83 percent of
them for simple possession.&nbsp; This inflated figure is a
remarkable 42 percent increase over the average yearly total for
marijuana arrests under the Bush administration and equates to an
arrest every 65 seconds! <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Yet, in spite of this significant increase in the
enforcement of drug and marijuana laws, recent studies such as
the Household Survey indicate that the use of narcotics and
marijuana is rising in popularity -- especially among
adolescents.&nbsp; <b>Specifically, the fact that the use of
marijuana is rapidly growing at the same time that law
enforcement officials are arresting record numbers of users
clearly confirms that marijuana prohibition does not effectively
deter marijuana consumption.</b> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In addition, it must be noted that today's rates of
adolescent drug use are rather moderate when put in historical
perspective.&nbsp; For example, as late as 1988, during the
height of the Reagan/Bush 'Just say 'no' campaign,' the number of
adolescents age 12 to 17 who reported using an illicit substance
within the past month stood at 9.2 percent, just slightly below
today's so-called 'emergency levels.'&nbsp; In addition, today's
use rates -- despite the recent increase -- still remain well below
the peak levels recorded in the late i970s and early 1980s. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We will probably never know why marijuana use-rates go up
and down over time.&nbsp; However, it is worth noting that the
recent increase occurred among the same population of young
people who had been exposed to a decade-long anti-marijuana
campaign in the schools and the media.&nbsp; That campaign, based
on exaggerations of marijuana's alleged harms and a 'Just say no'
ideology has clearly failed.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Study To Determine Whether Marijuana Helps
Individuals Suffering From AIDS Wasting Syndrome Rejected By
National Institutes of Health</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 7, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Dr. Donald Abrams of UC-San Francisco learned that his proposal
to conduct a pilot study into the use of smoked marijuana in the
treatment of the AIDS wasting syndrome was rejected by a
peer-review committee of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&nbsp; This means the study cannot
proceed because the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
arbitrarily required that it pass the NIH peer-review process to qualify
for receiving marijuana from NIDA.&nbsp; This condition has not
been previously required of other FDA-approved studies.&nbsp;
NIDA retains a monopoly on the legal supply of marijuana for research
purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NIAID will send a letter explaining the reason for the rejection
in six to eight weeks.&nbsp; At that time, Dr. Abrams will
evaluate the comments to see if, in his opinion, they are
scientifically justified or politically motivated.&nbsp; A
decision regarding the revision and resubmission of the protocol
will be made at that time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b> board member Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has been working
closely with Dr. Abrams for four years to sponsor this
study.&nbsp; He noted that this was the second time a specific
pilot study proposed by Dr. Abrams to investigate the use of
smoked marijuana in the treatment of weight loss in patients
suffering from the AIDS wasting syndrome has been rejected by
federal health officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although having an initial protocol design extensively reviewed,
critiqued, modified, and approved by the both the FDA and the
California Research Advisory panel in 1994, Abrams was denied
receiving the marijuana necessary for his study by NIDA in April
of 1995.&nbsp; After addressing several of NIDA's concerns --
including revising the protocol to an all in-patient study --
Abrams resubmitted a grant proposal to NIH on May 1, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This latest rejection &quot;delays [us] at least a year, if not
permanently,&quot; said Doblin.&nbsp; &quot;In 1992, DEA
Administrator Robert Bonner stated: 'Those who insist that
marijuana has medical uses would serve society better by
promoting or sponsoring more legitimate scientific
research.'&nbsp; All we are asking for is simply to conduct that
research.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The events of the past weeks in San Francisco make the
bankruptcy of the government's policy glaringly evident,&quot;
said California NORML Coordinator Dale Gieringer.&nbsp; &quot;Why
is it easier for your kids to get marijuana than for researchers,
physicians, and patients?&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Swiss State To Legalize Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 19, 1996, Zurich, Switzerland:</b>&nbsp;
The government of the state of Zurich in Switzerland approved a
proposal that could legalize the use of cannabis, reported the
Reuters news agency. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 85-40 vote, the state council endorsed a resolution by the
liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) that calls for a change in
the narcotics law through a referendum. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The FDP argued that using marijuana should no longer remain a
punishable offense because 20 years of federal prohibition have
not proved to be an adequate deterrent of either marijuana use or availability.&nbsp;
Therefore, the proposal recommends that the sale of cannabis be
organized and regulated by the state in order to insure quality
and eliminate the black market.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Board Strikes Down Proposal<br>
To Declare Medical Marijuana 'Emergency' For San Francisco's Sick</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 16, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A measure to declare a city-wide state of emergency allowing
marijuana to be used for medical purposes has been struck down by
San Francisco city officials.&nbsp; The proposal, spearheaded by
city Board of Supervisors member Tom Ammiano, was introduced
following a raid by state narcotics officers on the San Francisco
Cannabis Buyers' Club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On the advice of the city's District Attorney Terence Hallinan
and Director of Health Sandra Hernandez, a Board of Supervisors
committee backed off from the declaration.&nbsp; Many officials claimed
that approving such a controversial measure could jeopardize the
city's needle-exchange program that currently operates under an
emergency declaration.&nbsp; The decision came one day after Mayor
Willie Brown withdrew his support for the proposal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If it were up to me, I would have a state of emergency, but
given the [advice], it doesn't look a state of emergency is going
to fly,&quot; said Ammiano. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown said that he also felt a declaration of a medical marijuana
emergency could legally endanger the clean needle program.&nbsp;
He added that city officials were attempting to work out an agreement
with the state attorney general's office to let another
organization distribute marijuana to patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If they say that it can't be done [by the San Francisco
Cannabis Buyers' Club and] it has to be done [by] some other
organization that's free of any taint, then we'll do that,&quot;
Brown said at his bi-weekly press conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;My interest is to get [medical marijuana] to an
organization that has no history with legal or illegal use of
marijuana,&quot; added police commissioner Pat Norman.&nbsp;
&quot;[This] should not be a political issue; it should be
provided as treatment.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the possibility that city officials may attempt to
procure an outside entity to distribute medical marijuana, San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club founder Dennis Peron told the San
Francisco Chronicle that he would support any and all efforts to
viably get medical marijuana to the sick. <br>

Medical Marijuana Giveaway</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 19, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A city church distributed marijuana on Sunday to patients who
possessed a doctor's recommendation in wake of the temporary
injunction closing the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">About 25 patients showed up for the giveaway, news of which was
spread through word of mouth.&nbsp; Those possessing valid
documentation were provided with one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe the moral stance [in this instance] is to break
the law to make this marijuana available,&quot; said Rev. Jim
Mitulski of the Metropolitan Community Church of San
Francisco.&nbsp; &quot;Our church's spiritual vitality has always
come from a willingness to act where people have been reluctant
to act.&nbsp; This is not a bystander church.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Allen White, a community activist who helped organize the event,
said he had notified Mayor Willie Brown, Assistant Police Chief
Earl Sanders, and District Attomey Terence Hallinan Saturday
night about the church's plan to distribute marijuana.&nbsp;
Organizers said that they knew of no other church that had
conducted such an operation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mitulski did not specify whether he would hold repeat giveaways,
but added that there were no plans to do distribute marijuana on
a long-term basis.&nbsp; He said he hoped other churches will become

<p align="center"><b>Law Enforcement Bust Cannabis Buyers' Club
In Key West, Florida <br>
Founder, One Other Arrested On Felony Marijuana Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 14, 1996, Key West, FL:</b>&nbsp; For
the second time in two weeks, law enforcement officials have
raided and shut down operations of a cannabis buyers' club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Police sparked a wave of citizen outrage when Special Operations
detectives raided a cannabis buyers' club in Key West and
arrested two people, including club founder Zvi Baranoff.&nbsp;
Both individuals were charged with possession of felony amounts
of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of drug
paraphernalia.&nbsp; The Key West club serviced approximately 90
patients and has existed for one year.&nbsp; It is one of an
estimated 30 underground clubs throughout the United States that
distributes marijuana as a medicine to seriously ill patients who
possess a doctor's recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It seems like shabby treatment of someone who's trying to
do something good,&quot; said a former Key West city commissioner
who spoke anonymously with the Key West Citizen.&nbsp;
&quot;Where's the compassion?&nbsp; These people were dispensing
medicine to people who can't eat, sleep, or hold food in their
stomachs.&nbsp; [The raid is nothing more than an] inhumane witch
hunt.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Detective John Elmore defended the raid by saying that police
have no choice but to enforce the law.&nbsp; Elmore further
alleged that marijuana was sold to some individuals who did not
suffer from valid medical illnesses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Local citizens appeared to be strongly supportive of the club and
many club members voiced their discontent to the local
media.&nbsp; &quot;We're just trying to extend our lives a little
bit,&quot; said one HIV-positive club member.&nbsp; &quot;Maybe
these officers should attend every funeral, or read the newspaper
which would be stuffed with obituaries&quot; if we didn't have
underground access to medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Key West bust comes on the heels of a raid by California
state narcotics agents last Sunday on the 11,000 member San
Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club.&nbsp; No arrests have yet to be made
in connection with the raid, but a temporary injunction has been
granted to keep the club closed.&nbsp; The decision by state
Attorney General Dan Lungren to order the bust has outraged many members
of the San Francisco community -- including Mayor Willie Brown,
Sheriff Michael Hennessey, District Attorney Terence Hallinan,
former Police Commissioner Jo Daly, and several members of the
city's Board of Supervisors -- and cast harsh criticism upon
state politicians and law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;With the recent raids of cannabis buyers' clubs in
Cincinnati, San Francisco, and now Key West, the message is
clear: law enforcement is targeting the sick and dying,&quot;
said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Our sympathy goes out to the individuals and patients
affected by these unfortunate incidents.&quot; <br>

Proposition 215</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 8, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Two statewide medical societies, representing a combined total of
almost 10,000 physicians, have endorsed a California ballot
initiative to legalize marijuana for medical use (Proposition
215). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The San Francisco Medical Society (SFMS), which represents about
2,200 doctors in San Francisco, announced its support for
Proposition 215 just four days after state law enforcement officers
raided and closed down San Francisco's Cannabis Buyers'
Club.&nbsp; They were joined in their endorsement by the
California Academy of Family Physicians (CAFP), which represents approximately
7,500 physicians statewide. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">San Francisco Medical Society President Dr. Toni J. Brayer said
that the society based its decision on the results of an opinion
poll of doctors who treat MDS and cancer patients as well as drug
addicts.&nbsp; The doctors surveyed reportedly told the society
that they believed legalizing marijuana for medical purposes was
a good idea because it has therapeutic value to many seriously ill
patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This initiative is an important one.&nbsp; ... It will
protect our patients,&quot; Bayer said.&nbsp; &quot;What we want to
do as physicians is to relieve pain and suffering.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The society also recommends clinical testing of marijuana as a
medicine so that scientific data may be generated on its
effectiveness in treating patients. <br>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Judge Orders Changes in
&quot;Misleading&quot; Ballot Argument Against Proposition 215</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 9, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Organizers of a campaign against a California ballot proposal to
legalize marijuana for medical use (Proposition 215) took one on
the chin as Sacramento Superior Court Judge William Ridgeway
called part of the campaign's prohibitionist argument
&quot;misleading&quot; and ordered changes.&nbsp; Advocates for
the medical marijuana initiative applauded Ridgeway's ruling and
remarked that the statements in question were &quot;yet another
in a series of deceptions&quot; waged by opponents of Proposition
215. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The judge's action was sparked by an American Cancer Society
(ACS) petition.&nbsp; The ACS asked to have two references to the
organization by opponents, collectively known as &quot;No on 215,&quot;
dropped or changed before publication in the ballot pamphlet
distributed by the secretary of state.&nbsp; The pamphlets went
to press this week. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The original &quot;No on 215&quot; rebuttal argument portrayed
the ACS as vocal opponents of the medical marijuana
initiative.&nbsp; In truth, ACS attorney George Waters maintained
that the organization neither supports nor opposes the
measure.&nbsp; Therefore, Judge Ridgeway ordered that &quot;No on
215&quot; alter their chief rebuttal argument: &quot;American
Cancer Society says no.&quot;&nbsp; In addition, the judge
ordered that a second reference to the Society's opinion on
marijuana be removed entirely. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ballot initiative proponents also note that the rebuttal falsely
claims that &quot;no major doctor's organization supports
Proposition 215&quot; when, in fact, both the San Francisco
Medical Society (SFMS) and the California Academy of Family
Physicians (CAFP) -- together representing nearly 10,000
physicians -- have already endorsed the initiative. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Perhaps the reason 'No on 215' keeps stretching the truth
is [because] the campaign has no choice,&quot; suggested Dave
Fratello of Californians for Medical Rights.&nbsp; &quot;The
entire campaign is predicated on a falsehood -- the notion that
marijuana has no medical value.&nbsp; This is proved wrong by the
experience[s] of tens of thousands of patients, nurses, and
doctors across California, many of whom support Proposition
215.&quot; <br>

Local residents rejected a city ballot proposal that would have
made possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce of marijuana

to ten hours community service for a first-time offender by a 58

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the outcome, Traverse City NORML President Bill Bustance

Decriminalization Should Be Considered</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1996, Scotland:</b>&nbsp; One of
Scotland's most senior judges, Lord McLuskey, has sharply criticized
a federal &quot;white paper&quot; calling for enhanced anti-drug
penalties.&nbsp; In addition, the former solicitor general stated
that there needs to be an open debate on the issue of
decriminalizing cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The people who advocate the decriminalization of cannabis
need to be listened to and not condemned,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;Open debate is not only healthy, it is essential.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a nine page response to the June &quot;white paper,&quot;
McLuskey maintained that current prohibition ostracizes a large
percentage of the younger generation and encourages disrespect
for the law overall.&nbsp; &quot;A particular problem for the
criminal justice system is that, if the law continues to treat
all use of scheduled drugs [other than on prescription] as
criminal abuse, it will further alienate and criminalize large
numbers of younger people who regard the use of certain drugs in
sensible quantities and settings as providing enjoyment without
significantly threatening their health,&quot; McLuskey
wrote.&nbsp; &quot;Alienating large numbers of people by making
them into undetected offenders against criminal law greatly
weakens the criminal justice system.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McLuskey also argued that marijuana has medicinal value and
contested the prohibitionist belief that any use of an illicit
substance &quot;must be an abuse.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The sentiments and concerns of Lord McLuskey greatly echo
those of <b>NORML</b> and the testimony we presented this year

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August, 1996, Copperhill, TN:</b>&nbsp;
Copperhill Mayor Janelle Kimsey has been indicted by a grand jury
on marijuana possession charges after police discovered 10
marijuana plants growing on the deck of her home.&nbsp; Kimsey
turned herself in to authorities following her arraignment and
was later released on $500 cash bond. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kimsey's legal problems began last June when 10 marijuana plants
were found growing on her front porch.&nbsp; At the time, Kimsey
alleged that she was growing the marijuana for

a couple of months ago, and citizens wanted to know what [marijuana]
looked like,&quot; she explained shortly after the
incident.&nbsp; &quot;Dumb me, I didn't know I couldn't do
it.&nbsp; I know ignorance is no excuse, but in my case, it was
ignorance.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Authorities are not buying the mayor's claim and have set a trial

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Shari Taylor, assistant district attorney for the
10th Judicial District, the 10 plants possessed by Kimsey
&quot;came to less than one-half ounce&quot; (14 grams) when
weighed all together and did not merit felony charges.&nbsp;
However, according to federal sentencing guidelines, one marijuana
plant is presumed to weigh 100 grams.&nbsp; &quot;Apparently,
there exists one set of marijuana plant-weight ratios for
politicians and another set for the rest of America,&quot;
commented <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

<p align="center"><b>San Francisco Buyers' Club Raided, Closed By
State Authorities</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
San Francisco Superior Court Judge William Cahill granted a
temporary injunction on August 5 to close down the San Francisco
Cannabis Buyers' Club.&nbsp; The club -- the largest of
approximately 30 underground clubs located across the nation that supplies
marijuana as a therapeutic agent to patients who possess a
doctor's recommendation -- provided relief for an estimated
11,000 seriously ill patients throughout the bay area. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The injunction was granted following a raid by state narcotics
agents one day earlier.&nbsp; The early morning raid -- which
occurred without the cooperation of local law enforcement or
District Attorney Terence Hallinan -- was ordered by state
Attorney General Dan Lungren, an outspoken opponent of this
year's state ballot initiative to legalize marijuana for medical
use (Proposition 215).&nbsp; According to newspaper and
eye-witness accounts, the raid took place at 7:30 a.m., a time when
the club was not serving clients.&nbsp; Armed with a search
warrant, nearly 100 gun-toting agents broke down the club's front
door and seized medical records, at least two computers, 40
pounds of marijuana, some documents pertaining to Proposition
215, and an undisclosed amount of cash.&nbsp; In addition, five
other locations associated with the club personnel were
raided.&nbsp; A spokesman for the state Justice Department, Steve
Telliano, said that no arrests were made during the morning sweeps,
but acknowledged that charges may be filed against some of the
club's organizers at a later date. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many San Francisco leaders expressed both shock and outrage at
the actions of the state narcotics officers.&nbsp; District
Attorney Hallinan denounced the raid as a political act by
Lungren, who has been mentioned as a Republican candidate for
Vice-President.&nbsp; San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessy said
that he will refuse to enforce the injunction and Mayor Willie
Brown stated that he was &quot;dismayed by the Gestapo tactics
displayed by [the attorney general.]&quot;&nbsp; In addition,
several members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led by
Tom Ammiano, expressed support for the legalization of medicinal
marijuana and requested hearings into the raid.&nbsp; Also, the
board passed a resolution calling on the Department of Health to
draw up a public health state of emergency declaration for
medical marijuana.&nbsp; Some proponents believe that this
measure could eventually pave the way for the suspension of laws
against medical marijuana in San Francisco. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I feel really angry at the way [the attorney general's
office] did it,&quot; Ammiano told the San Francisco
Chronicle.&nbsp; &quot;It's the worst kind of political
opportunism.&nbsp; We could have worked with them.&nbsp; Instead,
they chose these storm-trooper tactics.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision to close the San Francisco Buyers' Club was granted
by Judge Cahill based on affidavits from narcotics officials that
the club had sold marijuana for non-medical purposes to undercover
agents.&nbsp; In a tape released to the media, club founder
Dennis Peron was shown selling a quantity of marijuana to an
undercover agent for what were alleged to be non-medical
purposes.&nbsp; The agent was posing as an AIDS patient who
wished to provide marijuana to fellow patients in a neighboring
county.&nbsp; Evidence substantiating additional allegations of
misconduct against the club, such as the charge that club
staffers sometimes sold marijuana in excess of that required for personal
use, was not presented during the hearing. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Judge Cahill ordered the club closed, but you cannot close
the spirit of the club,&quot; announced Dennis Peron to a crowd
of approximately 800 demonstrators who attended a candlelight
march later that evening.&nbsp; &quot;We'll stay open as [the]
headquarters for Proposition 215.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The big question now looming for activists on both sides of the
medical marijuana issue is how the raid and subsequent shut-down
of the Cannabis Buyers' Club will effect California voter's sentiments
in November.&nbsp; While some Californians speculate that the
timing of the raid may have been motivated by political reasons,
many marijuana activists forsee the raid as potentially being a catalyst
to inspire voters to support Proposition 215.&nbsp; &quot;The
[actions of the attorney general] prove the need to pass
Proposition 215,&quot; said California NORML Coordinator, Dale
Gieringer, Ph.D.&nbsp; &quot;[He] has made it plain that he not
only opposes the medical use of marijuana, but is also intent on wasting
taxpayer's money enforcing laws against it.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Buyers' Club Raid Spurs Resolution To
Declare Medical Marijuana Emergency<br>
Issue To Be Examined At August 15 Hearing</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
In the wake of a state raid on the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers'
Club, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors -- led by Tom
Ammiano -- has passed a resolution asking city health officials
to declare a medical emergency allowing for patients to use
marijuana as a medicine.&nbsp; Ammiano and others believe that
state laws forbidding the use of marijuana may be circumvented by
declaring an emergency.&nbsp; San Francisco already has such a program
in place regarding needle exchange. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The city attorney's office told the San Francisco Chronicle that
it has no legal opinion on the resolution at this time and Sandra
R. Hernandez, the city's director of health, remained noncommital.&nbsp;
State Justice Department spokesman Steve Telliano alleged that
county supervisors lack the authority to declare medical
emergencies with the intention of circumventing the law.&nbsp; He explained
that the needle exchange program is &quot;illegal&quot; despite
being sanctioned by the city. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The San Francisco Department of Health and the city attorney are
set to examine the issue at an August 15 hearing. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Dale Gieringer of

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Oakland City Council Passes
Resolution<br>
To Ensure Local Law Enforcement Do Not Arrest Medical Marijuana
Users</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 30, 1996, Oakland, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
Oakland City Council has unanimously passed a resolution (#72881)
establishing a working group to ensure that Oakland police
officers adhere to the city's tolerant medical marijuana
policy.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the council declared its desire
&quot;not to expend city resources in any investigation,
detention, arrest, or prosecution arising out of alleged
violations of state and federal law regarding the possession,
cultivation, and/or distribution of marijuana for medical
use.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe that this marks the first time a legislative body
at any level of government has established an official committee
with the express purpose of ensuring that the police do not enforce
marijuana laws,&quot; said Attorney Robert Raich of Oakland. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, the resolution states that a &quot;working group
shall consider legislative and administrative methods to ensure
enforcement of and compliance with the city's medical marijuana policy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The passage of the resolution occurred just days prior to a state
raid on the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers' Club.&nbsp; A similar
yet far smaller club currently operates in Oakland and has been endorsed
by local officials. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Massachusetts Medical Marijuana Research
Program<br>
May Breathe New Life From Assembly Measure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 30, 1996: Boston, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
A bill (H. 2170) introduced by Rep. Patricia Jehlen (D-Somerville)
that would reinvigorate the state marijuana therapeutic research
program and eventually provide for a medical necessity legal
defense has passed the Massachusetts state assembly and now
awaits the signature of Gov. William Weld.&nbsp; Sources close to
Gov. Weld indicate that he will sign the bill into law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As amended by the state legislature, H. 2170 will direct the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to pass rules and
regulations within 180 days for the establishment of a marijuana
medical research program.&nbsp; Like many states, Massachusetts
had previously adopted legislation allowing for such a program,
but had never addressed the issues of funding, regulations, or
viable sources for marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The new law does not solve the problem of the federal
government's denial of access to legal marijuana, but it puts
Massachusetts on the record as aggressively researching the
issues of treatment and supply,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee member Michael Cutler, Esq. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[It] creates pressure for a legal source to be
created,&quot; added an aid from Rep. Jehlen's office.&nbsp; &quot;[It
is] a step in the right direction.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The measure also provides patients who are certified to
participate in the program a legal defense against marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This provision was a concession from the
legislation's original intent which would have allowed any
patient with a physician's pre-trial diagnosis of medical necessity
to use the defense.&nbsp; Weld expressed concern that the bill~s
original language was overly broad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The governor has 10 days to either sign or veto the measure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;By enacting this law, [Gov. Weld] will allow attention to
the medicinal needs of patients, whose access to treatment is
blocked by the identity of their necessary medicine rather than
by conduct which they can control,&quot; summarized Cutler.&nbsp;
&quot;For many patients, their use of marijuana enables them to
support themselves and their families rather than being totally
disabled and publicly supported.&nbsp; For these patients, who
risk arrest and prosecution every day for the crime of desiring an
ordinary quality of life, this law provides hope for a rational
future of doctor-patient therapies free from governmental
interference.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Welfare Reform Bill Amendment
Altered<br>
To Deny Federal Benefits To Those Convicted On Felony Drug
Charges Only</b> </p>

<p align="left"><br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Most recreational
marijuana smokers will be exempted from the provisions of a last
minute amendment (Samdt. 4935) introduced by Sen. Phil Gram (R-Texas)
that denies for life federal assistance-based benefits to all
individuals convicted on felony drug charges.&nbsp; The amendment
is part of Congress' overall welfare reform package. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the measure's original form, the law additionally denied
&quot;means-tested&quot; federal benefits for five years for
anyone convicted of a marijuana misdemeanor.&nbsp; Possession of
a small amount marijuana is generally treated as a misdemeanor in
all 50 states.&nbsp; The initial language was overwhelmingly
approved by the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gramm's amendment was altered during recent debate in conference
committee.&nbsp; As the amendment stands now, it will only apply
to future felony drug convictions and states will be able to opt
out of the program if they enact legislation to do so.&nbsp;
President Bill Clinton has agreed to sign the welfare reform
package into law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The conference committee has provided relief for some
marijuana smokers by altering Gramm's amendment; however, this
bill still unfairly and inappropriately targets drug users,&quot;
noted <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; Pierre
noted that under the revised amendment, a murderer, rapist, or
robber could receive federal funds and benefits, but not an
individual convicted of cultivating marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Gwen Rubenstein of

<p align="center"><b>California Law Enforcement Must Procure A
Warrant<br>
Before Using Heat Scanning Devices</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 26, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Supreme Court has let stand a 1st District Appellate
Court decision mandating that state law enforcement officials
must procure a warrant before conducting thermal imaging searches
of private residences where they suspect drug cultivation may be
taking place.&nbsp; The lower court ruling is now binding on
trial courts statewide. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Only Justices Marvin Baxter and Ming Chin voted to grant a
hearing on the prosecution appeal; four votes are required for a
hearing by the seven-member court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The use of thermal imaging devices can give law enforcement
information regarding activities taking place inside a residence
that they would not otherwise be privy to without procuring a search
warrant and entering the house,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;By its very nature, it is
an intrusive practice that constitutes an unreasonable search
within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.&nbsp; Therefore, it should require a warrant.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
applauds the actions of the California court.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In its decision this April, the 1st District Court of Appeals
likened the use of thermal imaging to that of electronically
tracking the movement of chemicals inside a home by using a
beeper.&nbsp; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1984 (<i>U.S. v.
Karo</i>) that a warrant must be attained before law enforcement
can use a beeper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Like the beeper signal ... the thermal imaging scan of
[the] residence told the police something about activities within
the house which they could not otherwise have learned without
obtaining a warrant,&quot; opined Justice Marc Poche.&nbsp;
&quot;PreciseIy because the thermal imaging is indiscriminate in registering
sources of heat, it is an intrusive tool which tells much about
the activities inside the home which may be quite unrelated to
any illicit activity.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... [Therefore,] we find that society recognizes as
reasonable an expectation that the heat generated from within a
private residence may not be measured by the government without a warrant
permitting such a search.&quot; <br>

Agrees To Modify Ad Criticized As &quot;Patently Homophobic&quot;</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 29, 1996, New York City, NY:</b>&nbsp;
The Partnership for a Drug Free America has agreed to re-edit a
series of anti-heroin public service announcements that had drawn
sharp criticism from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ad in question featured a teenager named David whose life
plummets downhill because of an addiction to heroin.&nbsp; The ad
concluded with the narrator saying: &quot;And now I have sex with
men for money to support my habit.&nbsp; ... I wish I didn't have
to be like this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">GLAAD first voiced opposition to the spot early this month
alleging that the ad &quot;had the potential to exacerbate
higher-than-average risks gay and lesbian youths face for
substance abuse and suicide by implying that being gay is worse
than being addicted to heroin.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, PDFA President
Richard Bonette refused GLAAD's request to pull the ad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, however, Bonette has experienced a change of
heart.&nbsp; He now says that the spots will be re-edited to omit
the references to prostitution.&nbsp; &quot;A perception of
offense, however unintended, [may] dilute or interfere our basic
message&quot; of keeping adolescents drug free, Bonette recently explained
in a letter to GLAAD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Alan Klein, news media director at GLAAD said, &quot;We're very
much pleased that the Partnership has taken the concerns of the
gay and lesbian community serious.&quot;</p>

patients who have the approval of a licensed physician to use

political conservatives and the general public.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The results of the <i>Orange County Register</i> poll are the
latest in a series of polls indicating strong support for medical
marijuana.&nbsp; A 1995 survey conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of the
American public agreed that patients who find marijuana an
effective therapeutic agent should be able to use it
legally.&nbsp; In addition, six California polls -- including one
conducted by the Binder Research Group -- have shown that a
strong majority of Californians support medical marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Welfare Reform Bill Amended To Deny
Convicted Drug Users Federal Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 22, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; An
amendment introduced by Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas) that would
deny federal assistance-based benefits to those individuals
convicted of drug offenses -- including marijuana misdemeanors --
has been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate.&nbsp; The
amendment is part of an overall welfare reform package (S. 1956)
that is currently in conference committee and is expected to be
sent to the president's desk shortly.&nbsp; It is not yet known
if Clinton will sign the bill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendment proposed by Gramm would deny for five years all
&quot;means-tested&quot; federal benefits, including programs
such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, and student loans, to any individual
who is found guilty of a minor drug offense.&nbsp; Those found
guilty of drug felonies would be ineligible for life. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If we're serious about our [anti-]drug laws, we ought not
to give people welfare benefits who are violating the nation's
drug laws,&quot; said Gramm. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gramm's amendment struck a chord with some congressmen, including
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) who voiced strong opposition to the
measure. &quot;Under this amendment, if you are a murderer, a
rapist, or a robber, you can get federal funds; but if you are
convicted even for possession of marijuana, you cannot,&quot; he
said.&nbsp; &quot;[This amendment] would undermine the whole notion
of providing drug treatment as an alternative sentence to a
first-time drug offender if the individual requires federal
assistance to obtain the treatment.&nbsp; ... It is overly broad
and is strongly opposed by [both] the [Conference of] Mayors and
the National League of Cities.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Over 10 million individuals have been arrested on
marijuana-related charges since 1965 with nearly one-half million
arrested in 1994 alone,&quot; stated NORML Deputy Director Allen
St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This amendment could potentially make
millions of otherwise law abiding Americans ineligible for federal
benefits and is yet one more example of how our nation's alleged
'War on Drugs' is nothing more than a war on marijuana
smokers.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendment passed by a 75 to 25 vote. <br>

State Capitol<br>
In Support Of Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Olympia, WA:</b>&nbsp; Washington
state marijuana law reform proponents are anticipating a crowd of
thousands to gather on the front steps of the Washington state
capitol for the first ever Hemp Education Day on August 5.&nbsp;
In past years, marijuana reform events such as the Seattle
Hempfest have drawn crowds in excess of 20,000 people. Organizers
of the upcoming festival are hoping to harness the popularity of
past gatherings and transform the Washington hemp reform movement
into a strong political force. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are aware that in the current political climate, you
can't even discuss [the] issue [of marijuana law reform] publicly
or privately without being singled out in the media as ...
'pro-drug,'&quot; stated event organizer Gideon Israel.&nbsp;
&quot;We must use this opportunity to open up a forum for truth and
free expression on this matter.&nbsp; ... Hemp Education Day will
provide a soapbox for the people of Washington state, lawmakers,
and other citizens to educate and be educated [about]
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists scheduled to speak at the rally include NORML Legal
Committee member Jeffrey Steinborn, Esq., Hemp BC owner Marc
Emery, author Jack Herer, Don Wirtshafter of the Ohio Hempery,
medical marijuana patient Ralph Seeley, and others.&nbsp; The
gathering is planned to take place from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. <br>

Watchdog Group</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; A recent
public service announcement produced by the Partnership for a
Drug Free America (PDFA) has been branded homophobic by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), a media watchdog
organization based in New York City. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ad, scheduled to air nationwide this month, depicts a
teenager named David whose life plummets downhill because of an
addiction to heroin.&nbsp; The ad concludes with the narrator
saying, &quot;And now I have sex with men for money, to support
my habit.&nbsp; ... I wish I didn't have to be like this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to GLAAD, the ad suggests that drug use ultimately
leads males to engage in homosexual sex and portrays
homosexuality as a social ill more severe than drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The spot sends a misguided message to America's young
people and specifically to lesbian and gay youth,&quot; stated
GLAAD managing director William Waybourn.&nbsp; &quot;The ad has
the potential to exacerbate higher-than-average risks gay and
lesbian youths face for substance abuse and suicide by implying
that being gay is worse than being addicted to heroin.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although GLAAD has voiced their objections about the PSA to the
Partnership, PDFA President Richard Bonette responded that he
will not pull the ad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While I appreciate your concerns, I simply disagree with
your perspective and, therefore, cannot honor your request to
remove 'David' from distribution,&quot; said Bonette.</p>

<p align="center"><b>USA Today Endorses Access To Medical
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 18, 1996, Arlington, VA:</b>&nbsp; <i>USA
Today</i>, the nation's most widely read daily newspaper, has
endorsed access to medical marijuana.&nbsp; The endorsement
stemmed from a <i>USA Today</i> editorial entitled
&quot;Anti-drug focus keeps marijuana from the ill&quot; and came
just two days after the newspaper featured a major article on a
California ballot initiative that would allow seriously ill patients
to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent with a doctor's
recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Calling marijuana &quot;one of the least toxic medical compounds
in the world,&quot; the editorial cited both marijuana's relative
safety when compared to other legal drugs and medicines and
decades of scientific and anecdotal research maintaining its
medical efficacy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is entirely possible to fight the drug war without
harming innocent civilians in the process,&quot; concluded the <i>USA
Today</i>. &quot;But lawmakers must be careful to choose the
right battles.&nbsp; Therapeutic marijuana isn't one of
them.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statements made by <i>USA Today</i> in support of
medical access to therapeutic marijuana should have a positive
impact on America's views toward this issue and may translate
into a significant number of votes among California citizens in
favor of the Medical Marijuana Initiative,&quot; stated NORML
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Chapter Places Advertising Billboards
On Buses</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 11, 1996, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Several buses of the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority
will start promoting marijuana law reform thanks to the work of
dedicated local activists.&nbsp; After a year long struggle, the
Northcoast NORML chapter has paid for a three month advertising campaign
to run on the inside and outside of RTA buses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML first approached the RTA with their advertising
campaign in 1995 at which time the RTA denied the chapter's
request because they claimed the public service announcements
would promote the illegal use of marijuana.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML refused to accept the RTA's reasoning and brought the issue
to the attention of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of
Ohio.&nbsp; After several correspondences between the ACLU and
RTA's legal staff, the RTA conceded that NORML's ad was not
promoting marijuana use and was political in nature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Northcoast NORML president John Hartman, the
chapter's billboards carry two basic messages.&nbsp; The
announcement appearing on the tailgate of buses emphasizes the 10 million-plus
marijuana arrests that have occurred since 1965 while the
billboard displayed on the inside reads: &quot;If you don't care
about the people sent to prison for smoking marijuana, at least consider
who gets released to make room for them.&quot;&nbsp; Hartman adds
that the RTA will soon begin displaying prohibitionist billboards
to counter Northcoast NORML's message. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML's billboards began running on area buses this
week. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Man Sentenced To Probation<br>
After Killing Individual He Suspected Sold His Son Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Hartsville, TN:</b>&nbsp; A father
was given three year's probation after pleading guilty to killing
the man he suspected of selling marijuana to his teenage
son.&nbsp; The defendant, Dennis Denham, had been indicted for
second degree murder. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emotions ran high for participants on both sides of the
case.&nbsp; At one point, the shooting victim's mother told the
court that the defendant could see his children, but added that,
&quot;[She has] to go to the cemetery to see [hers.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Denham apparently blamed the man for injuries his son sustained
in an auto accident while allegedly driving under the influence
of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Have we demonized marijuana consumers in this country to
such a point that we allow citizens to murder them and get away
with it?&quot; questioned <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Law That Allows Citizens To Sue Drug Dealers
For Damages<br>
Moves Forward In California</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California state Senate has unanimously approved a sweeping bill
(S.B. 1754) that would allow private parties to sue drug dealers
for damages even if the defendant had nothing to do with the
specific drugs or incident that caused the damage. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Drug Dealer Liability Act, introduced by Sen. Charles
Calderon (D-Whittier) and co-sponsored by Attorney General Dan
Lungren, drug dealers could be sued in civil court for any damages
caused by the same kind of drug elsewhere in the same city or
county, regardless of who actually furnished it, using a radical,
new &quot;market participation&quot; liability doctrine.&nbsp;
For example, under the provisions of a similar law in Michigan,
dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of a controlled
substance are liable for injuries throughout the state, while
those who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuries
in the county where the sales occurred. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Those allowed to sue under the California proposal would include:
parents or family members of users; employers of users; medical
facilities, insurers, or other institutions that fund drug treatment
programs; individuals exposed in utero to an illegal substance;
and persons injured as a result of the willful, reckless, or
negligent actions of an individual substance user. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a way of fighting [drug dealers] by hitting them right
in the pocket,&quot; said actor Carroll O'Connor, who has lobbied
for the measure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendants could be sued if they (1) provided the drug or (2) had
&quot;as a pattern&quot; participated in the market for that drug
within the same city or county.&nbsp; The latter is defined to
mean that they provided the same illicit drug on at least two
instances, with at least one conviction.&nbsp; Cultivation of under
25 marijuana plants would not count as an offense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;When is enough enough?&quot; asked Mark Kappelhoff,
legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
in Washington, D.C., in a recent <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
article.&nbsp; Kappelhoff maintained that adding civil judgments
to criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could be tantamount
to constitutionally cruel or unusual punishment or double
jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The California state assembly is expected to approve the measure
by the end of August. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Teacher Under Fire For Hemp
Presentation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 2, 1996, Simpsonville, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Donna Cockrel, the fifth grade school teacher who brought Hollywood
actor and hemp businessman Woody Harrelson to her class to
discuss industrial hemp approximately one month ago, is under
fire from both parents and school officials who have voiced strong
opposition to her actions.&nbsp; Recently, the award-winning
teacher was informed by the Simpsonville Elementary School Board
that she is being investigated because of complaints that followed
Harrelson's visit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Audrey Yeager, the DARE officer for the Shelby County Sheriff's
Office, was one of Cockrel's most outspoken critics.&nbsp;
&quot;Everybody says hemp and marijuana are not the same thing,
but they are; they're both illegal and it was being promoted to
10 and 11-year-old kids,&quot; she told camera crews from the
television show &quot;American Journal.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I am
terribly against it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the criticism, Cockrel adamantly defended her actions and
maintained that Harrelson's presentation related directly to her
curriculum.&nbsp; &quot;I still believe what I did in the
classroom was positive,&quot; said Cockrel who participates in a
state program known as Environment in the Classroom.&nbsp; She
said that industrial hemp, as well as kenaf, soybeans and other
alternatives to growing tobacco are frequently discussed in her
class.&nbsp; &quot;I believe in myself.&nbsp; My students believe
in me.&nbsp; If I'm not allowed to teach the truth to students,
I'd rather quit teaching.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Cockrel further added that she believed Harrelson -- who was
adorned in hemp clothing for the occasion -- was just
&quot;showing what a product could be, not promoting it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Shelby County School Superintendent Leon Mooneyhand acknowledged
that Cockrel is being investigated, but failed to indicate how
long the investigation may take.&nbsp; &quot;I am looking into
the matter as I would follow up on any matter that got this level
of concern by staff, parents, and community.&quot;&nbsp;
Mooneyhand was reluctant to speculate about what sanctions, if
any, may be taken against Cockrel, but said that her job was not
in jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the past, Cockrel has been recognized and awarded for
enthusiasm in the classroom.&nbsp; In a 1992 magazine article,
The <i>New York Times</i> called her &quot;a dynamo [with] ...
boundless energy who's geared toward change.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harrelson, who is an ardent proponent of industrial hemp and is
part owner of a California company that specializes in hemp-based
clothing, was in town to speak at an international conference on
industrial hemp in Lexington.&nbsp; He was arrested in Kentucky
two days after speaking to Cockrel's class for planting four
seeds of industrial hemp in an orchestrated protest to bring attention
to the differences between hemp and marijuana. <br>

controversy on July 10, 1996.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>High Court Strikes Down Pennsylvania Rulings<br>
Requiring 'Exigent Circumstances' To Justify Warrantless Searches
Of Automobiles</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that has drawn criticism from civil libertarians, the
United States Supreme Court has ruled in a <i>Per Curiam</i>
decision that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was incorrect in
requiring police to obtain a warrant before searching an automobile
unless &quot;exigent circumstances&quot; were present. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In two separate cases, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court suppressed
evidence uncovered in warrantless automotive searches because the
&quot;Commonwealth's jurisprudence of the automobile exception
has long required both the existence of probable cause and the
presence of exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless
search.&quot;&nbsp; The court maintained that the police had
sufficient time in both cases to secure a warrant.&nbsp;
Therefore, they held that, &quot;The warrantless search of [a] stationary
vehicle violated constitutional guarantees.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The United States Supreme Court concluded that Pennsylvania's
interpretation of the &quot;automobile exception of the Fourth
Amendment's warrant requirement&quot; was incorrect.&nbsp; The
court maintains that an automobile's &quot;ready mobility&quot;
is a sufficient circumstance to excuse failure to obtain a search
warrant once probable cause has been established.&nbsp; In
addition, &quot;the individual [has a] reduced expectation of
privacy in an automobile, owing to its pervasive
regulation.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the court affirmed that,
&quot;If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to
believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits
police to search a vehicle without more.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Essentially, the court has stripped Pennsylvanians of their
state constitutional guarantees that provide local citizens with
greater protections against warrantless searches of their
automobiles unless both probable cause and unforeseen
circumstances are present,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;In it's never-ending fight to
assist in the 'War on Drugs,' the Supreme Court has trampled over
civil liberties mandated by Pennsylvania's own state
constitution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Ginsburg dissented on the
basis that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction over the two
cases.&nbsp; &quot;A fair reading of [both cases] demonstrates
that the [Pennsylvania Supreme Court's] judgement almost
certainly rested upon [an] ... independent consideration of its
own Constitution,&quot; Stevens wrote.&nbsp; Consequently,
&quot;there is no reason for this court to disturb the state
court's findings.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>The cases are cited as Pennsylvania v. Edwin Labron and
Pennsylvania v Randy Lee Kilgore.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>License Suspension In Drug Cases Upheld By
Ohio Supreme Court</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp; Ohio's
highest court upheld legislation that imposes a mandatory license
suspension against individuals convicted of drug crimes,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a unanimous opinion, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that the
penalty did not violate the due process or equal protection
amendments of the Ohio or United States constitutions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion for the court, Justice Francis Sweeney
declared: &quot;All drug offenders are treated equally under
these statutes.&nbsp; The laws simply impose a penalty on persons
who have been convicted of a drug crime.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... These laws serve to punish drug offenders, to deter the
future use of drugs, and to protect the health and welfare of
society.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The opinion upheld the 2nd District Ohio Court of Appeals in 33
cases which were consolidated after a lower court refused to
suspend licenses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Laws passed by virtue of police power will be upheld if
they bear a real and substantial relation to the objective sought
to be obtained, namely the health, safety, morals or general
welfare of the public, and are not arbitrary, discriminatory,
capricious or unreasonable,&quot; the court summarized. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court did not address the question of whether the suspension
constituted &quot;double jeopardy&quot; because it was a second
punishment for a single criminal action.&nbsp; Earlier this year,
the Iowa Supreme Court struck down similar license suspension
legislation because it found &quot;no direct connection between
the possession of controlled substances, driving, and public
safety.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the court ruled that, &quot;The
amended statute authorizing ... license revocation was aimed essentially
at enhancing punishment for controlled substance
possession.&quot; <br>

Of Hemp</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b> Calling
it &quot;one of the most promising crops in half a century,&quot;
a recent issue of Farm Bureau News sings the praises of the hemp
plant.&nbsp; The publication is the weekly newspaper of the
American Farm Bureau Federation -- the largest farming organization
in the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Written by Debora Hood, the article declares that,
&quot;Legislation is needed to establish a recognized research
area for [hemp,] according to local, state and federal
regulations.&quot;&nbsp; It explores the potential economic
viability domestic hemp cultivation holds for the American
farmers and criticizes the Drug Enforcement Administration's role
in killing a Colorado bill that would have allowed the state to
grow test plots for research purposes.&nbsp; The essay also
recounts hemp's long and prosperous history as an agricultural
commodity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also included is an editorial by Bob Winter, president of the
Weld County Farm Bureau in Colorado.&nbsp; Winter worked closely
with hemp activists earlier this year and offered five acres of
his land for the proposed state test plot.&nbsp; &quot;Industrial
hemp provides a window of opportunity for U.S. agricultural
producers to take advantage of a highly profitable fiber crop
[with] many uses ...,&quot; he writes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;International trade agreements (e.g., GATT and NAFTA)
recognize the designation of 0.3 percent ... THC as the
distinction between industrial hemp and marijuana.&nbsp; [Yet,]
current U.S. law[s] do not differentiate between hemp and
marijuana.&nbsp; Thanks to these laws, the United States lags behind
other world powers in hemp production and must import raw hemp
pulp for manufacture here.&nbsp; [In addition,] U.S. farmers are
prohibited from growing a highly profitable crop without government
subsidy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The American Farm Bureau Federation passed a resolution at its

Medical Marijuana Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; A
bill currently in Congress that would amend the federal law to
allow a physician to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for seriously ill patients has gained another co-sponsor, Rep.
Julian Dixon (D-Calif.).&nbsp; Unfortunately, proponents recently
lost the backing of Rep. Louise Slaughter who withdrew her
support for the measure on June 18.&nbsp; The total number of
co-sponsors remains seventeen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Presently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by a
number of scientific and medical associations including the
American Public Health Association, the Federation of American Scientists,
the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services and

'Harm Reduction' Placed On Back Burner For Now</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; A
report drafted by <b>NORML</b> board member and New York Medical
School Professor John P. Morgan, M.D. for the American Medical
Association has been put on hold after objections were raised by
several prominent medical groups regarding the paper's
content.&nbsp; Specifically, certain doctors were uncomfortable
with Morgan's recommendations that marijuana be legalized and
that &quot;use, possession and low- level sales of all
psycho-active drugs should be a subject of police action only
when these activities are associated with a disruption of public
order.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dr. John Ambre, director of the AMA's Office of Medical
Information Services, told reporters that he recruited Morgan to
draft a report for the AMA, but would not divulge any information regarding
the paper's contents or prospects. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Morgan said that he was contacted by the AMA's House of Delegates
requesting a report on the subject of &quot;harm reduction&quot;
-- a policy commonly defined as helping drug users minimize the dangers
to themselves without mandating that they stop using drugs.&nbsp;
&quot;It struck most of us that the biggest harm reduction we
could see would be to stop putting people in jail [for drug

<p align="center"><b>Canadian Marijuana Reform Debate Yields Few
Results</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Ottawa, Canada:</b>&nbsp;
Ongoing debates regarding the possibility of marijuana decriminalization
in Canada yielded few tangible results as the Standing Senate
Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended no
significant changes be made to the Controlled Drugs and
Substances Act (bill C-8).&nbsp; This legislation is intended to
replace the Narcotic Control Act and, according to many Canadian
activists, will greatly expand the reach of Canada's illicit drug
laws.&nbsp; Bill C-8 will become law when an Order in Council is
passed later this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Senate Committee's recommendation shocked many who noted that
several of its members had publicly stated that they supported
the decriminalization of marijuana.&nbsp; In attempt to explain
the Senate's last minute flip-flop, Committee Chair Senator
Sharon Carstairs told the <i>Montreal Gazette</i> that the
committee members were serious about decriminalization, but felt
that such a recommendation would be politically futile at this
point.&nbsp; &quot;The majority of the Senators -- and I was with
them -- felt all the evidence indicated decriminalization for
simple possession [of marijuana] is the way we should be
going,&quot; she reaffirmed.&nbsp; However, Carstairs said that
many committee members believed such a proposal would violate
several international treaties that Canada has signed and would
have been struck down by the House of Commons. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If there is to be any relief for the cannabis community after the
latest round of political debate, it may come by way of an
approved amendment by Liberal Senator Lorna Milne that exempts &quot;mature
hemp stock&quot; from the definition of marijuana.&nbsp; Although
hemp industry proponents note that the passage of the amendment
does little to open the door to allow for the widespread cultivation
of hemp for commercial purposes, it does remove some of the
regulatory restraints (e.g., licensing) that are currently in
place regarding hemp fiber and products.&nbsp; &quot;For Canada
to develop hemp as an agricultural crop, the mature hemp stalk
and the valuable fibre (sic) acquired from it must be free from
over-regulation,&quot; Milne explained.&nbsp; &quot;Without the
amendment, the stalks, fibre (sic) and fibre (sic) products
derived from them such as paper, would continue to be treated as though
they were narcotic substances, simply due to the definition of
the bill.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A staff member for Senator Milne informed <b>NORML</b> that he
believes the Canadian government intends to draft a proposal to
allow farmers to grow hemp for commercial purposes, but many
Canadian activists feel that such legislation is still a long way
off.&nbsp; Currently, tests plots of industrial hemp are grown in
Canada under strict regulation for research purposes. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Upholds Civil Forfeiture In
Drug Cases</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
United States Supreme Court ruled that the government may both
prosecute individuals on drug charges for criminal violations and
seize their property without violating constitutional protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the decision for the court, Justice William Rehnquist
wrote that, &quot;We hold that these ... civil forfeitures are
neither punishment nor criminal for the purposes of double
jeopardy.&quot;&nbsp; Rather, Rehnquist defined forfeitures as
remedial civil sanctions.&nbsp; Ironically, the high court has
ruled in earlier cases that fines and tax stamps on illicit drugs
may, in some circumstances, constitute punishment under the law
and are applicable to double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court further maintained that Congress had intended
forfeiture to be a civil act and noted that, &quot;Requiring the
forfeiture of property ... ensures that [owners] will not permit
that property to be used for illegal purposes.&quot;&nbsp; The
opinion added that the court has a long history of upholding forfeiture
as constitutional, although many of the cases cited involved
either contraband (e.g., unlicensed firearms, pirated goods,
etc.) or property that was integrally involved in the commission of
a crime.&nbsp; This latter point led lone dissenting Justice John
Paul Stevens to write, &quot;There is simply no rational basis
for characterizing the seizure of [a] ... home as anything other
than punishment for [a] crime.&nbsp; The house was neither
proceeds nor contraband and its value had no relation to the government's
authority to seize it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;During oral arguments [during which I was present,] several
justices found the government's argument intellectually
incoherent,&quot; explained <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee Member
Jeffrey Steinborn.&nbsp; &quot;In the opinion, they accept the
government's theory.&nbsp; [Therefore,] we can expect the Supreme
Court to continue to indulge the government and we can expect the
government to indulge in runaway forfeiture.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to government statistics, the Justice Department
collected nearly $550 million in assets from civil forfeiture in
1994.&nbsp; Approximately $235 million went directly to state and

Target Drug Use Among Adolescents</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in cooperation
with the National Parent-Teacher Association (PTA), unveiled a
new campaign to warn adolescents of the dangers of tobacco,
alcohol, and illicit drugs.&nbsp; Entitled &quot;Reality
Check,&quot; the campaign is being launched primarily in response
to recent evidence of rising teen marijuana use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Today, too many teenagers think marijuana won't harm their
health or ruin their lives,&quot; HHS Secretary Donna Shalala
told the crowd at the 100th Annual National PTA Convention in Washington,
D.C.&nbsp; &quot;We want to help [parents] send a clear message
to their children that drugs are illegal, dangerous and
wrong.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the focus of the campaign are two publications that explain to
parents the best way to speak with their children about illicit
substances and encourage them to remain drug free. One section of the
booklet <i>Keeping Youth Drug Free</i> even advises parents how
to answer questions from their children regarding their past use
of marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Many people my age ... tried marijuana,
... but we didn't know as much about it as we do now,&quot; the
pamphlet recommends parents explain.&nbsp; &quot;I tried it [a]
couple times because friends of mine were doing it.&nbsp; And
then I stopped because I decided it just wasn't a good thing to
do.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;As long as the federal government continues to lump the
alleged dangers of marijuana alongside the harm caused by other
illicit drugs such as crack and heroin, any campaign hoping to 'educate'
children about the risks of using marijuana will be only
minimally effective,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> maintains that cannabis

<p align="center"><b>California High Court Rules<br>
That Judges Are Not Mandated To Impose 'Three Strikes' Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 20, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp; In
a ruling that may affect an estimated 16,000 inmates, the
California Supreme Court decided that judges are not required to
impose mandatory prison sentences of 25 years to life on repeat
offenders if they feel such a sentence is overly cruel.&nbsp; The unanimous
decision, which has drawn praise from many civil libertarians and
harsh criticism from Governor Pete Wilson, is retroactive and
could potentially reduce the sentences of individuals who were
given stiffer prison terms under the 1994 &quot;three
strikes&quot; law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The mindless and inexorable demand for a life sentence for
minor offenses has become a bit more mindful,&quot; said Vincent
Schiraldi, executive director of the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Because this decision was unanimous and from a conservative
court, other courts [across the nation] may look to this opinion
as challenges arise to their own laws,&quot; added Eric Sterling
of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The court's decision stemmed from a San Diego case in which a
repeat offender was charged with possessing a small amount of
cocaine.&nbsp; Feeling that the mandatory sentence was an unfit punishment
for the crime, the judge moved to strike the defendant's previous
convictions so he could plea bargain.&nbsp; The prosecutor in the
case objected, maintaining that under the &quot;three
strikes&quot; legislation, the judge lacked the right. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ruling maintained that denying judges their traditional
discretion over sentencing violates the separation of powers
guaranteed in the state Constitution.&nbsp; The court asserted
that their decision did not spell the end of &quot;three
strikes&quot; law, but merely returned the customary power of
judicial discretion back to the judges. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following the court's decision, Gov. Wilson -- an ardent
proponent of mandatory sentencing -- pledged to find a way to
bypass the court's ruling with either a referendum or by
introducing similar legislation.&nbsp; However, legal scholars
believe that the court will strike these measures down as well. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Those who repeatedly assault our citizens ... must pay a
sever price for their crimes,&quot; Wilson said.&nbsp; &quot;I
intend to keep faith with the people of California who have every

<p align="center"><b>Florida To Adopt Standards Regarding Hair
Testing</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1996, Tallahassee, FL:</b>&nbsp; A bill
(SB 518) amending drug testing laws to specifically establish
standards and procedures regarding the use of hair specimens in
drug testing has become law in Florida.&nbsp; The measure passed
without the governor's signature and makes Florida the first state
in the nation to explicitly address and endorse the use of hair
samples to test for illegal drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proponents of the measure argue that the testing procedure offers
significant advantages over urinalysis.&nbsp; Specifically,
backers of the procedure maintain that hair testing gives
employers a longer window of detection -- commonly allowing
employers to determine drug use that took place several months
earlier.&nbsp; Proponents also maintain that hair tests are much
more difficult to beat than is urinalysis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, critics of the use of hair specimens in drug testing
assert that the procedure has major flaws.&nbsp; For one, recent
studies indicate that the hair of African-American males may
collect nearly eight times as much drugs as either female
African-Americans or Caucasians.&nbsp; These findings indicate
the potential for racial and sexual bias in hair testing, critics
warn.&nbsp; In addition, hair testing remains a new technology
that many feel is still in need of further scientific evaluation.
&quot;Hair analysis for the presence of drugs is unproven [and]
unsupported by scientific literature or controlled trials,&quot; said
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spokeswoman Sharon Snider in a
1995 Providence Journal interview. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the procedures recent recognition in Florida, hair
testing on a national basis has yet to receive the same level of
technical and legal acceptance that has been accorded to
urinalysis drug testing and many courts will not accept the
findings of hair testing alone as a positive indication of drug
use. <br>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>University Of Mississippi
Denies Assertion Of California<br>
Narcotics Officers</b></font><b><br>
Researcher Calls Claim Of Over 10,000 Studies Documenting The
Harmful Effects Of Marijuana Groundless</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, University of Mississippi:</b>&nbsp;
A recent claim made by The California Narcotics Officers
Association (CNOA) that there are over 10,000 studies documenting
the harmfulness of marijuana has been flatly denied by University
of Mississippi Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences.&nbsp;
For the past 25 years, the Research Institute of Pharmaceutical
Sciences has been collecting national and international technical
research papers on marijuana.&nbsp; The organization is regarded
as the most comprehensive federal source of such information
available. The CNOA allegation recently appeared in a position
paper denouncing the use of marijuana as a medicine and has been
espoused by various other prohibitionist organizations.&nbsp;
However, in response to an inquiry by Harvard Professor and NORML
board member Lester Grinspoon, M.D., Research Associate Beverly
Urbanek said that the University of Mississippi &quot;is totally
in the dark as to where the statement that there are 10,000
studies showing the negative impact of marijuana could have originated.&quot;&nbsp;
Urbanek attests that the Research Institute does possess a
bibliography which includes over 12,000 citations to marijuana,
but notes that the total number also includes &quot;papers on the chemistry
and botany of the Cannabis plant, cultivation, epidemiological
surveys, legal aspects, eradication studies, detection, storage,
economic aspects and a whole spectrum of others that do not
mention positive or negative effects.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In conclusion, Urbanek states the following: &quot;We are
frequently contacted by various individuals and groups requesting
the current number of publications that we have listed in the
marijuana bibliography, and we readily give out that
information.&nbsp; ... However, we have never broken down that
figure into positive/negative papers, and I would not even
venture a guess as to what that number would be.&quot; <br>

Steve Morealle says his current duty is &quot;...to travel the country
to stop proposed state-level medical marijuana

agent who fell under fire last winter from civil rights
proponents for his participation in a rally held outside the

the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, Hempilation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Morealle's self-proclaimed job description,
Mass/Cann President Bill Downing sent letters to Massachusetts
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, the Massachusetts ACLU, and Congressman
Barney Frank addressing the potential improper use of federal
money and authority.&nbsp; Frank has previously engaged in
correspondence with United States Attorney General Janet Reno and
DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine over Morealle's actions
during the Hempilation protest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the DEA is using America's tax dollars to
fund efforts to effectively suppress any public discourse
regarding medical marijuana that differs from their belief that
marijuana has no acceptable medical use is highly offensive, if
not illegal,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Morealle also stated that he is employed to appear at public

<p align="center"><b>Conference Gathers Experts To Explore
Marijuana's Medicinal Value</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 16, 1996, Dennis, Massachusetts:</b>&nbsp;
Scientists and medical experts from around the world recently
gathered at a conference to learn more about marijuana's various
medicinal properties.&nbsp; It is the belief of the attendees
that chemical compounds found in marijuana promise to ease the
symptoms of glaucoma, the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS,
spastic disorders, the nausea associated with cancer
chemotherapy, arthritis -- and most dramatically -- severe brain injury.&nbsp;
While both <b>NORML</b> and a variety of scientific researchers
have endorsed cannabis' therapeutic properties for several years,
the possibility that marijuana may have medical utility in the treatment
of head trauma is a relatively new concept. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Esther Shohami, a senior lecturer in the department of
pharmacology at Hebrew University in Israel, stated that animal
and other tests of a synthetic compound called Dexanabinol seem
to reduce the impact of brain trauma, such as that suffered in
car accidents.&nbsp; Shohami said that less paralysis and memory
damage occurs if patients are administered the cannabinoid
compound.&nbsp; The patient's improvement is &quot;not
marginal.&nbsp; It's significant,&quot; she asserted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Conference speakers also addressed the effectiveness of Marinol
-- a THC-based synthetic drug occasionally prescribed for easing
nausea in cancer patients. Many researchers noted that whole
cannabis could be more effective than Marinol because there
exists many medicinal properties in cannabis other than THC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Two members of <b>NORML</b>'s Board of Directors, Dr. John P.

November Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 6, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California's Medical Marijuana Initiative has qualified for the November
general election.&nbsp; The Secretary of State's office in
Sacramento certified the initiative measure which will allow
California voters the opportunity to legalize marijuana for
medical use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative, which gathered 775,000 signatures to qualify for
ballot access, provides that &quot;patients or defined
caregivers, who possess or cultivate marijuana for medical
treatment recommended by a physician, are exempt from general
provisions of law which otherwise prohibit possession or
cultivation of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; It also provides that
&quot;physicians shall not be punished or denied any right or
privilege for recommending marijuana to a patient for medical
purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This measure will not legalize or otherwise change existing law
against use, sale, or possession of marijuana for recreational
use, proponents note.&nbsp; It will prevent the criminal
prosecution of those patients who have a legitimate medical need
to use marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although more research is needed, it is clear from both available
studies and rapidly accumulating anecdotal evidence that
marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and suffering for patients

<p align="center"><b>Victorian Politicians Reject Marijuana
Decriminalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 12, 1996, Victoria, Australia:</b>&nbsp;
Victorian politicians failed to endorse one of the chief recommendations
of Professor David Pennington -- head of Premiere Jeff Kennett's
advisory council on drug reform -- who concluded that the
decriminalization of marijuana for cultivation and personal use
would be an effective step in steering individuals away from hard
drugs.&nbsp; Just prior to the Kennett Government's decision,
Pennington had warned Parliament that the implementation of the
council's findings without marijuana decriminalization would be
&quot;very much a second-best answer.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The government firmly believes that before the
decriminalization of marijuana is considered further, a better
coordinated, better resources, more innovative and carefully
focused education, treatment, and law enforcement strategy should
be given a chance to work,&quot; stated a press release from the
Victorian Cabinet. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The Premier's 'firm belief' ... is laughable,&quot;
responded Jamnes Danenberg of HEMP SA, spokesman for a leading
Australian cannabis law reform lobby group.&nbsp; &quot;Just how
many more people need to be convicted [under prohibition] before
the right signal is sent?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">For months Victorian politicians had been debating over whether
to implement many of the 72 major drug reforms suggested by the
Drug Advisory Council report, the most controversial being marijuana
decriminalization.&nbsp; In all, the Kennett government approved
a majority of the report's policies, including shifting the state
anti-drug focus to education rather than enforcement, but rejected
taking any steps toward decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The
government did conclude, however, that it &quot;will review
penalties applying to the use and possession of drugs of
dependence to ensure that users are treated as having a health
problem first and as criminal offenders second and that
treatment, rather than punishment, is the priority.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the subject of marijuana decriminalization is
a serious topic of debate among Australian politicians is a
positive note for drug-reform advocates everywhere,&quot; noted
NORML Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;On the other
hand, it indicates just how far behind the United States is
lagging compared to other western nations when it comes to
addressing the issue of alternative drug policies.&nbsp;
Certainly, our own politicians would be well advised to heed the recommendations
the Pennington Report.&quot; <br>

Decision<br>
To Spray Marijuana With Pesticides</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 11, 1996, Tulsa, OK:</b>&nbsp; Oklahoma
narcotics officers and area environmentalists are clashing over
the state's decision to begin spraying pesticides on wild
marijuana plants in five counties.&nbsp; Authorities argue that
the spraying will deter people from cultivating, selling, and
smoking marijuana, but environmentalists are concerned that the
chemicals could pose potential heath hazards to both the
environment and the population. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Approximately 15 to 30 narcotics agents will begin spraying
uncultivated marijuana plants with glyphosate, a chemical weed
killer commonly marketed under the brand name
&quot;Round-Up.&quot;&nbsp; State officials claim that spraying
is the most effective way to eradicate uncultivated marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The herbicide has been tested, found to be safe and has a
very low toxicity to wildlife,&quot; said Oklahoma Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs spokesman Mark Woodward to the
Tulsa World News.&nbsp; To enforce his position, Woodward noted a
1986 U.S. Department of Justice study that showed an individual
could smoke 139 marijuana cigarettes treated with glyphosate a
day and still be under the safe level in regard to the
chemical.&nbsp; However, some area environmental activists are
not convinced. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Glyphosate] can do a lot of damage to our bio-diversity;
this can wreak damage on our wildflower population,&quot;
contested Noah Berry, vice president of EcoLaw Institute Inc., a
state organization that works to strengthen environmental
laws.&nbsp; Berry also cited a Journal of Pesticide Reform report
from last year that claimed glyphosate exposure was the third
most commonly reported of pesticide illness among agricultural
workers in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Maybe the state should get into the dandelion eradication
business, if it's busy work they want,&quot; Berry suggested. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 11, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Minor traffic stops can be used as justification for detaining
motorists and searching their vehicles for drugs, ruled the
Supreme Court in an unanimous decision.&nbsp; Critics argue that
the ruling will encourage police to use phony pretexts to invade
the privacy of motorists -- particularly minorities -- while
proponents maintain that it provides law enforcement with an
additional weapon to combat illicit drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is an opinion that essentially allows police to do an
end run around the Fourth Amendment,&quot; said Steven R. Shapiro

Harrelson Hopes To Challenge Federal Law By Act Of Civil
Disobedience</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1, 1996, Lexington, KY:</b>&nbsp; Hemp
activist and noted Hollywood actor Woody Harrelson was arrested
and charged with cultivation of fewer than five marijuana plants
after he brazenly planted four seeds of industrial hemp in full
view of Lee County Sheriff William Kilburn.&nbsp; The planting
and subsequent arrest are part of an orchestrated protest by
Harrelson to challenge the continued prohibition of industrial
hemp.&nbsp; Harrelson expects to be found guilty of the
misdemeanor charge and intends to appeal because current law
makes no distinction between marijuana and industrial hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The [law prohibiting hemp cultivation] is overly
broad,&quot; explained Burl McCoy, a Lexington attorney who was
on hand to represent the actor.&nbsp; &quot;There is no rational
basis for the statute.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a June 5 press release, the famed actor of both television and
film explained his actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am not one to go out of my way to get arrested.&nbsp; But
in this case, I thought it was important for me to take that step
in order to demonstrate the difference between industrial hemp
and marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Industrial hemp, like the four certified seeds I planted,
was first grown in Kentucky two hundred and fifty years
ago.&nbsp; It is currently grown in other countries across the
globe, including France, England, Canada, Australia, China,
Hungary, and the Ukraine.&nbsp; Industrial hemp has very little
THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. [Therefore,] it
cannot be used as a drug.&nbsp; None of the countries that allow
industrial hemp production have experienced any problems relating
to the crop. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Industrial hemp is very clean and easy to grow.&nbsp; It is
one of the most environmentally sound sources of industrial fiber
in the world.&nbsp; ... Environmentally friendly detergents,
plastics, paints, varnishes, cosmetics, and textiles are already
being made from it in Europe.&nbsp; ... Industrial hemp can meet
our fiber needs while also revitalizing our struggling rural
economies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Congress never intended to make legitimate industrial hemp
farming the same as marijuana cultivation.&nbsp; I planted
industrial hemp and got arrested because someone must highlight
this difference and in order to truly know the law, one must test
the law.&nbsp; I think it is time for all of us to make a stand
... for environmentally friendly, rural economic
development.&nbsp; If the people lead the leaders will
follow.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harrelson, who is part owner of The Hempstead Company -- one of
the largest hemp clothing companies in the nation -- notes that
he intends to plant hemp in additional states to further challenge
the laws. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Majority Of Police Chiefs Admit That War On
Drugs Is Unsuccessful</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Sixty
percent of police chiefs nationwide admit that police and other
law enforcement agencies have been unsuccessful in reducing the
drug problem in the United States and an overwhelming majority
(85 percent) call for major changes in the way America deals with
drug use, according to a joint study conducted by the Police
Foundation and Drug Strategies -- a Washington D.C. based
organization that advocates a more balanced approach to fighting
drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Police Chiefs want to see a balanced approach,&quot; Police
Foundation President Hubert Williams recently told the <i>Law
Enforcement News</i> in response to the report.&nbsp; &quot;They
recognize that a narrow strategy directed down a single corridor
will not work.&quot;&nbsp; More than 300 police chiefs from around
the country participated in the study. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The report's key findings are as follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Only 15 percent of the police chiefs polled say punishment
would be more effective than education, interdiction, or
treatment in controlling drug problems; only 10 percent of chiefs
who have served in a narcotics division choose punishment over
the other options. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Nearly three-fourths say that mandatory minimum sentences for
drug possession have been only somewhat effective or not really
the answer to drug trafficking in their communities; only 21 percent
say mandatory sentences have been very or fairly effective. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Only 28 percent regard low conviction rates, either for dealers
or users, as key limitations in their ability to deal with drugs
in their communities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* By two to one, police chiefs say that putting drug users in
court-supervised treatment programs (59 percent) is more
effective than prison or jail time (28 percent). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">* Only three percent believe that current efforts by law
enforcement have been very successful in reducing the drug
problem in the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The findings of the Police Foundation and Drug Strategies
demonstrate that the majority of our nation's police chiefs who
are on the front lines of the 'War on Drugs' do not favor the
'get-tough' approaches against drug users that are so often
heralded by our political leaders and supported by the American
public,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Small Town Mayor Claims She Was Unaware That
Growing Marijuana Was Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 29, 1996, Copperhill, TN:</b>&nbsp;
Copperhill Mayor Janelle Kimsey admits that she grew marijuana,
but argues that she was unaware that growing marijuana for
&quot;educational purposes&quot; was illegal.&nbsp; The
rural-town mayor was recently found growing ten marijuana plants
on her porch and may be indicted on charges of marijuana
cultivation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;There may be a perfectly good explanation for this, but at
this point we haven't found it,&quot; stated Polk County Sheriff
Bill Davis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In her defense, the two-term mayor claims she was guilty of
nothing more than ignorance.&nbsp; &quot;We made a drug bust a
couple of months ago, and the citizens wanted to know what
[marijuana] looked like,&quot; said the mayor, adding that she
planned to take the full grown plants to the police department to
be used as a display.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't know it was illegal to
grow it for educational purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kimsey also maintains that she intended to use the plants to
train the city's drug sniffing dog to sniff out cannabis.&nbsp;
When asked why she was growing so many plants, the mayor
responded that she thought several plants were needed so that she
could choose the best quality. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I know ignorance is no excuse, but in my case, it was
ignorance,&quot; she remarked. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although Kimsey has not been arrested, her case will be taken
before the Polk County grand jury on July 1.&nbsp; The 10
marijuana plants were confiscated by police.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Charges Dropped Against California Medical
Marijuana User</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>June 5, 1996, Toulomne County, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Marijuana possession charges were dropped yesterday against
Barbara Sloniker, a cancer patient who uses cannabis medicinally
to ease her pain.&nbsp; &quot;The six-month battle was hurtful
and draining at times ... but I am not angry at anyone,&quot;
says Sloniker, who was informed in 1994 that she had at best a 20
percent chance of living through the chemotherapy and radiation
treatments.&nbsp; &quot;Anger would kill me.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An activist as well as a patient, Sloniker intends to spend the
summer educating California voters about the need for medical
marijuana and encouraging citizens to vote &quot;yes&quot; this
November for an initiative to allow patients to use marijuana as
a medicine without fear of repercussion from law
enforcement.&nbsp; &quot;All of us who can need to speak up
now,&quot; she said.</p>

<p align="center">May 30,1996</p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Reform Debate In Full Force In
Canadian Federal Government</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Ottawa, Canada:</b>&nbsp; Debate
over Canada's federal policies regarding both the widespread
cultivation of industrial hemp and the legalization of small
amounts of marijuana for recreational use are currently in full
swing in the Canadian Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hearings have been ongoing regarding the future of proposed
government bill C-8, a measure currently before the Senate that
will effectively replace the Narcotic Control Act with the Controlled
Substances and Abuse Act.&nbsp; Currently, the measure retains
the existing penalties for marijuana: a potential $1,000 fine or
six months in jail.&nbsp; However, a growing group of vocal senators
from both major parties feel that the time for decriminalization
of marijuana has come and the federal law must reflect that. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am in favor of decriminalizing marijuana,&quot; said
Liberal Senator Rose-Marie Losier-Cool, one of five senators who
sit on the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee
who have publicly endorsed decriminalization.&nbsp; &quot;We must
look at this very seriously.&nbsp; The approach we have now is
criminal, it's punitive.&nbsp; Maybe it's a health approach we
should be taking a serious look at.&nbsp; The punitive approach
has not worked and the problem is still there.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Cannabis is much less lethal than cigarettes and
alcohol,&quot; added Quebec Progressive Conservative Senator
Pierre-Claude Nolin.&nbsp; &quot;Are we into prohibition because
it's somewhat of a dogma that we don't question and [because]
everybody else is doing it?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Senators [are] much more interested in a harm reduction
model of drug control in this country than they [are] in a
punishment model,&quot; confirmed Liberal Senator Sharon
Carstairs, Chairwoman for the senate committee.&nbsp; &quot;That
is where almost all of the senators are coming from.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to the growing movement regarding the use of
recreational marijuana, support for policies legalizing the
widescale growing of industrial hemp is also gathering
support.&nbsp; According to a staff-member for Liberal Senator
Lorna Milne, the senator will soon be introducing an amendment to
C-8 that will make it legal to cultivate hemp by adding
&quot;mature hemp stock&quot; to a list of approved
substances.&nbsp; The staffer reports that Milne's office does
not anticipate &quot;any difficulty&quot; regarding the passage
of the amendment and adds that the proposal has the support of
Health Minister David Dingwall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[Hemp cultivation] seems to me to be a sensible thing to
do,&quot; Milne said recently. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill C-8 is currently undergoing it's second committee review in
the Senate and the overall bill is expected to be amended and
returned to the House of Commons.&nbsp; Sources who have spoken
to <b>NORML</b> anticipate that any measures regarding hemp
cultivation should pass both the Senate and House without
complications, but warn that proposals regarding the
decriminalization of recreational marijuana will most likely be
opposed by the House. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Black Motorists Subject To Stops And
Searches On I-95 More Often Than Whites</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Perryville, MD:</b>&nbsp; Black
motorists are stopped and searched for drugs at least four times
more often than whites by a special Maryland highway drug unit
that patrols stretches of Interstate 95, according to a recent
report from the <i>Associated Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although state police spokesmen have flatly denied using racial
profiles, findings from an <em>AP</em> computer analysis of car
searches indicate that more than 75 percent of all drivers whose
cars were searched by the special drug squad through the first
nine months of 1995 were black.&nbsp; In all, the Special Traffic
Interdiction Force (STIF), whose six officers are white, searched
145 of the motorists it stopped along a 50 mile stretch of I-95
between the Delaware border and the Baltimore County line; of
these, 110 motorists were listed as black, 24 white, six
Hispanic, and five &quot;other&quot; minorities.&nbsp; Maryland
police maintain that the findings are a coincidence. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Maryland state troopers, like those in many states, are forbidden
to use racial profiles in traffic stops.&nbsp; In addition,
Maryland troopers are mandated to provide records on highway
searches to the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland under
terms of a legal settlement reached in 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to at least one attorney from the ACLU who spoke with
the <em>AP</em>, a future class-action lawsuit may be considered
if the data eventually proves a pattern of discrimination.&nbsp;
At least one private discrimination lawsuit has already been
filed against three STIF troopers. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Repeat Felony Marijuana Possession Penalties
Reduced In Missouri</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp; Thanks
in large part to the efforts of Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan
Viets, Gov. Mel Carnahan signed into law Senate Bill 830 which
significantly reduces the range of punishment for second and
third offense felony marijuana possession. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">SB 830 was filed after Viets contacted Sen. Joe Moseley
(D-Columbia) late last year and alerted him that under the
Missouri prior and persistent drug offender statute, an
individual who merely possessed more than one and one quarter
ounces of marijuana on two occasions would be eligible for a
punishment ranging from 10 years to life in prison.&nbsp; One who
had committed three such offenses would be subject to 10 years to
life in prison without the possibility of probation or parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The passage of SB 830 changes the law to specify that simple
marijuana possession offenses will no longer be punishable under
the prior and persistent drug offender statute.&nbsp; Therefore,
a second offense of felony marijuana possession which formerly
had a sentencing range of 10 years to life now has a sentencing
range of zero to seven years.&nbsp; Furthermore, regardless of
how many drug offenses of any nature one has, no simple
possession offense will ever carry a punishment of more than
seven years and the defendant will remain eligible for probation
and parole. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Senator Moseley ... [is] one of the most effective
advocates for rational reform of the criminal laws generally with
whom I have ever had the privilege of working,&quot; stated
Viets. <br>

Dennis Peron, founder of the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club
-- the nation's largest and most overt supplier of wholesale
marijuana to the seriously ill -- has stepped down from his post

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Taking over for Peron as director of the 10,000 member club is

goodbye to Dennis, but we know that we must legalize [cannabis]

Traverse City Commission has unanimously passed a resolution
urging city residents to vote against an initiative put forth by
the Traverse City NORML chapter to reduce marijuana
penalties.&nbsp; The measure -- which will appear on the ballot August
6 - seeks to make possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce
of marijuana in Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of
$100 and up to ten hours of community service for a first-time
offender.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the City Commission
unanimously passed a resolution encouraging residents to not sign
the NORML petition. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Bustance, president of the Traverse City NORML chapter,
denounced the Commission's latest action and remarked that it
&quot;discounts the intelligence of the worthy citizens that

confident that there is ample voter support for the measure.&nbsp;
&quot;We're not asking: 'Are you for marijuana or are you against
marijuana?' or 'If you're for <b>NORML</b> or against <b>NORML</b>?'
...&nbsp; We're asking: 'Do you want to throw people in prison at

<p align="center"><b>Federal Representative Continues Probe Into
Potential Misuse Of Federal Power At Anti-NORML Demonstration</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Rep.
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) continues to make federal waves in
response to a December 1995 rally held outside the offices of
Boston radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD, Hempilation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Having previously written to Attorney General Janet Reno this
winter both condemning the actions of rally organizers, the
Governors Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting an inquiry into whether
federal law enforcement officials were involved, Frank is again
pressuring the Attorney General to take action.&nbsp; &quot;I'm
writing to express my severe disappointment in the response I received
[from DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine] to a letter I sent
you in December about the conduct of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in an effort by officials of the state and federal government
to put inappropriate pressure on a radio station, and to do so in
an inappropriate manner,&quot; Frank asserts.&nbsp; &quot;The
response confirmed my fear that the Drng Enforcement Administration
does not have the respect for free expression which ought to
exist in the federal government, especially the Department of
Justice, charged as it is with the protection of constitutional
rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to eye-witness accounts, the Massachusetts based
anti-drug group, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA
and local law enforcement, organized and participated in a protest
outside the offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of
the station &quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD, Hempilation.&nbsp; Witnesses note that protesters
arrived in state vehicles, attendees were encouraged to
&quot;bring their squad cars,&quot; and that an individual
identified as the Boston liaison to the DEA accompanied Georgette
Watson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D, as she entered the
station.&nbsp; This action prompted Bill Downing, president of
Mass Cann NORML, to charge that &quot;Th[is] sort of [behavior],
when performed by government agents, [is] specifically
[prohibited] by law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is one thing for government officials to express their
opinions as to what is appropriate behavior by radio
stations,&quot; writes Frank in his follow-up letter to Ms.
Reno.&nbsp; &quot;It is quite another for a law enforcement
official to arrive in these circumstances and participate in what
is clearly an effort to pressure them on the spot. ...&nbsp; We
are talking here about a situation where a law enforcement
officer - I assume armed with both a weapon and with the power of
arrest -- enters a radio station in the company of a state
official who has organized a demonstration and joins with her --
indeed at her specific request -- in trying to persuade people at
the station to stop playing certain music. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;My impression is that we do not have enough law enforcement
officials available to do actual law enforcement.&nbsp; Diverting
one of them to spend his time seeking to pressure radio stations
into changing their selections is it seems to me both a misuse of
scarce resources as well as a misuse of the authority of law
enforcement officials where people's first amendment rights are
involved.&nbsp; I therefore must ask that you promulgate policies
which prohibit law enforcement officials from engaging in this
sort of activity.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Modified Hemp Measure Becomes Law In Vermont</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 14, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; A bill
(H. 783) that could signal the first step in the establishment of
a domestic hemp industry in Vermont became law without the
signature of Gov. Howard Dean.&nbsp; However, hemp proponents
maintain that the approved measure falls short of the bill's
initial expectations and acknowledge that any chance for local
industrial hemp cultivation still remains far away. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Similar to a resolution recentiy approved in Hawaii, the revised
Vermont legislation allows for research to be conducted into the
feasibility of industrial hemp production, but removed language that
would have authorized the state university to grow test plots in
order to assess optimum soils and other growing conditions.&nbsp;
The bill is a &quot;compromise,&quot; admits Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney),
one of the chief backers of the original bill.&nbsp; Maslack
notes that Gov. Dean would have vetoed any legislation that
allowed for the growing of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a start,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;But it's also an indicator of just
how far we have to go.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the approved measure maintains that: &quot;The commission
of agriculture, food and markets and the University of Vermont
are requested to undertake research, of a minimum of two years in duration,
of industrial hemp production in the state.&nbsp; [This research]
shall include: (1) Analysis of market economic conditions
affecting the development of an industrial hemp industry in the
state of Vermont; (2) Analysis of whether Vermont soils and
growing conditions are appropriate for economic levels of
industrial hemp production; (3) Analysis of research undertaken
elsewhere in the world regarding minimum THC levels of industrial
hemp production; and (4) Analysis of possible law enforcement
aspects of industrial hemp production in Vermont.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>South Australia's Director Of Public
Prosecutions Recommends The State Grow Cannabis</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, South Australia, Australia:</b>&nbsp;
The Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia wants the
State government to grow and regulate the sale of cannabis,
according to statements he recently made in an exclusive
interview with the Australian publication, The Advertiser. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We never really had a chance [in trying to stop drug
use],&quot; Director Paul Rofe, QC, stated.&nbsp; &quot;We've
just got to do something drastic.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rofe maintains that criminal involvement in the cannabis trade
would be cut dramatically if the government were to either begin
growing the drug or issue licenses for its manufacture.&nbsp;
Rofe suggested implementing a regulatory system similar to those
already in place for the sale of alcohol and tobacco whereby
individuals could purchase marijuana over the counter.&nbsp; Such
a move would both eliminate illegal profits from the black-market
sale of the drug and would cut down on the &quot;underground&quot;
attraction of smoking cannabis, Rofe remarked. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Hawaii State Legislature Passes Hemp
Resolution</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp; For the
first time in its history, the Hawaii State Legislature has
passed a resolution to conduct a study on the economic potential
of growing industrial hemp as an agricultural product. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">House Resolution 71 and House Concurrent Resolution 63 describe
the study as a fact-finding and information-gathering forum that
would examine the following aspects of industrial hemp: 1) the commodity
value, 2) economic potential and other benefits, 3) comparison of
the economic potential with that of similar crops, 4) interest of
Hawaii landowners, businesses, and other parties in growing
industrial hemp, 5) federal procedures for obtaining a permit to
grow hemp, and 6) the barriers that prohibit the growing of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Thousands of acres of former sugar plantation land still
await the arrival of a viable alternative crop,&quot; stated Rep.
David Tarnas (D-6th District), a chief backer of the
measure.&nbsp; &quot;Industrial hemp should be allowed to prove
itself as a successful commodity here in Hawaii -- as it is doing
in other places around the world.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The joint Senate Committees on Agriculture, Labor, and Employment
and Ways and Means stated in their committee report that
&quot;given the State's current economic crisis, the viability of alternative
cash crops should be explored to the fullest extent
possible.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Hawaii Agribusiness Development Corporation will be
initiating the research project at the University of Hawaii,
College of Tropical Agriculture. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Earlier this year, Rep. Tarnas introduced legislation to amend
the state law to authorize the production, possession, and
commerce of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii.&nbsp;
However, the House Agriculture Committee voted to postpone
deciding on that bill until next year. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Secretary Of State Issues Raw
Count For Medical Marijuana Petition</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 15, 1996, Santa Monica:</b>&nbsp; A raw
count by the California Secretary of State demonstrates that a
state-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for medical use has
well over the necessary number of signatures to appear on the
November 1996 state ballot.&nbsp; Although the total number of
signatures will not be certified by the State for another six or
seven weeks, the Secretary of Sate announced that raw count
figures indicate that more than 758,000 signatures were collected
-- well over the 433,269 required to qualify the initiative for
the 1996 ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed
by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; The 1996 initiative maintains
that patients or defined caregivers who possess or cultivate
marijuana for medical treatment recommended by a physician are
exempt from the general provisions of law which otherwise
prohibit possession or cultivation of marijuana.&nbsp; In
addition, the initiative declares that physicians shall not be
punished or denied any right or privilege for recommending
marijuana to a patient for medical purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If the initiative is passed by California voters this fall, the
measure will become law immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Oregon Marijuana Initiative Approaches
Required Number Of Signatures<br>
To Be Placed On Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 9, 1996, Portland, OR:</b>&nbsp; An Oregon
state campaign to regulate the sale of marijuana to adults
appears to be well on its way toward qualifying for the November
1996 general election. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Headed by local <b>NORML</b> activists and the Political Action
Committee Pay for Schools by Regulating Cannabis (PSRC), a
proposal to comprehensively reform marijuana laws in the state has
gathered in excess of 65,000 signatures -- more than three
quarters of the number needed to place the initiative on the
ballot.&nbsp; The PSRC must gather at least 73,261 registered
Oregon voters' signatures by July 5, 1996 to qualify. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Known as the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act (OCTA), the PSRC proposal
would tax and regulate the sale of marijuana to adults, license
farmers to cultivate the drug for sale to the state, permit physicians
to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously ill
patients, and allow farmers to grow industrial hemp for fiber,
oil, and protein production. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The OCTA would authorize the sale of marijuana to take place in
state-run liquor stores where the age limit of 21 can be strictly
enforced.&nbsp; The PSRC estimates that the profits generated
from the regulated sale of marijuana could amount to $500 million
a year or 20 percent of Oregon's total state budget.&nbsp; The
OCTA would direct 65 percent of that money toward funding primary
and secondary education.&nbsp; In addition, 30 percent of the
revenue would go to state and community colleges, four percent
would go to fund drug abuse treatment programs, and the remaining
one percent would be used to implement realistic drug education
programs in the schools. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Chief Petitioner Paul Stanford, the pending Oregon
legislation is drafted to effectively stand up to the barrage of
court challenges that it will presumably face.&nbsp; The OCTA is written
in compliance with the restrictions imposed by several
international anti-drug treaties and the bill provides numerous
constitutional protections in its comprehensive preamble to
ensure that the act will be upheld in court.&nbsp; Moreover, the
OCTA even provides funding for the inevitable legal battles that
await it by collecting revenue through the issuing of cannabis
license fees, Stanford notes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Preliminary surveys indicate that the OCTA has a realistic chance
of passing.&nbsp; School funding is a very urgent issue in Oregon
and a poll conducted by the state's largest television station, KATU-TV,
showed that 55 percent of the respondents answered yes when
asked, &quot;Should marijuana be sold in liquor stores to fund
education?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The war on drugs is the issue on which the future of
freedom in America swings,&quot; stated Stanford.&nbsp;
&quot;Families and individuals are being destroyed by this
misguided civil war.&nbsp; The war on drugs is not about drugs,
it's about money and the continued centralization of economic and political
control.&nbsp; The Oregon Cannabis Tax Act is the first big step
toward a solution.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact the PSRC @ (503) 235-4606

<p align="center"><b>Railroad Accident Data Shows Few Benefits
From Random Drug Testing</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 13, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
examination of Federal Railroad Administration accidents
statistics demonstrates that random drug testing has had no
apparent effect on railroad accident safety, reports California
NORML.&nbsp; The FRA data shows that prior to the introduction of random
drug testing in 1990, the number of accidents due to human error
declined steadily, from 3.8 per million rail miles in 1978 to 1.4
in 1986.&nbsp; Since then, however, the accident rate has held steady
at around 1.4 to 1.8. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data calls into question the supposed safety benefits
of random drug testing,&quot; said California NORML coordinator
Dale Gieringer.&nbsp; Unlike alcohol tests, drug urinalysis tests
cannot detect actual impairment, but only whether a drug was used
in the past.&nbsp; In the case of marijuana -- the drug detected
in the overwhelming majority of positive tests -- urine tests can
register positive for days or weeks after last use, long after
the euphoric affects of the drug have faded. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Random drug testing was imposed on the nation's railway workers
in the wake of a highly publicized 1987 Amtrak-Conrail collision
in which the crew were determined to have smoked marijuana.&nbsp;
The responsibility of marijuana for the accident was never
clearly determined, however.&nbsp; An investigation by the
National Transportation Safety Board determined that better equipment
and personnel management would have prevented the accident, but
did not recommend drug testing.&nbsp; Nonetheless, Congress
promptly rushed to require drug testing for all of the nation's transportation
workers following the accident. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The effectiveness of this regulation has never been
scientifically proven,&quot; states Gieringer.&nbsp; &quot;While
proponents say that testing has reduced the number of
transportation workers testing positive for drugs, there is no
indication this has had any [significant] safety benefits.&nbsp;
Poblems include: substitution of alcohol and other untested drugs
for tested drugs such as marijuana; unreliability of tests in
discriminating drug abuse; cheating and evasion by drug abusing
workers; and lack of relation between test result and job
performance.&quot; <br>

Fighting Drugs: Calls Record<br>
Setting FY 1997 Budget Lean</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 8, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Responding to criticism that the federal government isn't spending
enough money to fight drugs, Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey admitted
that he believed President Clinton's record high $15.1 billion
budget proposal for Fiscal Year 1997 to be &quot;a lean ... request.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Could more money be used on international and interdiction
programs?&nbsp; There is no question,&quot; McCaffrey told a
House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.&nbsp;
McCaffrey's remarks were made despite the fact that Clinton's
budget request allocates nearly $10 billion to be used in 1997
solely for law enforcement here and abroad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;How much is enough,&quot; questioned <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Twenty billion, 30
billion, when will it end?&nbsp; Despite claims that this new,
anti-drug strategy focuses on youth prevention and education, the
Office of National Drug Control Policy will spend a record high
$10 billion dollars on law enforcement -- a figure that the Drug
Czar now claims to be too little. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since 1988, federal spending on anti-drug programs has
increased more than 300 percent, yet according to government
statistics illicit drug use has remained virtually unchanged
among adults and has actually increased among adolescents.&nbsp;

expect any sort of positive results.&quot; <br>

Stiffer Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 7, 1996, Springfield, IL:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that will stiffen penalties for those convicted of selling
marijuana or other illicit drugs within 1,000 feet of a place of
religious worship will take effect in 1997 under a measure signed
by Gov. Jim Edgar. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This legislation takes our efforts to take drug dealers off
the street a step further by creating another safe zone where
those dealers know they will pay an even bigger price for their
crimes,&quot; Edgar said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The measure, sponsored by Rep. John Jones (R-Mount Vernon) and
Sen. William O'Daniel (D-Mount Vernon), increases the penalty by
one level for selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a place of
religious worship.&nbsp; The legislation is similar to current
laws providing enhanced penalties for those convicted of selling
drugs on the grounds of schools, public parks, and public
housing, or within 1,000 feet of them.</p>

Against Drug War</b></font><b> <br>
Endorses Program To Stop Arresting Marijuana Consumers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 25, 1996, Waterville, ME:</b>&nbsp; A
high-ranking federal judge criticized America's current anti-drug
efforts while speaking before students at Colby College, reported <i>The
Associated Press</i>.&nbsp; Calling our drug war strategies a &quot;losing
battle,&quot; Chief Judge Juan Torruella of the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals proposed that America seriously rethink its
methods and goals, and suggested that the establishment of a
national pilot program to alleviate marijuana-related
prosecutions might be a first step in the right direction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At minimum, &quot;a shift has to be made in the funding for drug
enforcement toward an intense educational campaign,&quot; he
said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella, who went on the federal bench in 1975 and joined the
appeals court in 1984, called for a national debate on the drug
issue.&nbsp; In addition, he said that an independent national commission
should be empaneled to analyze alternative approaches to curbing
drug use.&nbsp; Currently, any legitimate debate on the issue is
clouded by political &quot;rhetoric&quot; and anti-drug &quot;hysteria,&quot;
he claimed.&nbsp; Torruella likened this attitude to the zealotry
exhibited by anti-communists during the McCarthy era. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella was also critical of the ways in which he felt drug
prosecutors and law enforcement officials have run rampant over
the bill of rights.&nbsp; &quot;You can't have one Constitution
for the good guys and another Constitution for the bad
guys,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella has served as chief judge of the First Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals since 1994.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Medical Marijuana Bill Attracts
Additional Sponsors</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; Three more
members of Congress, including one Republican and the House's
only Independent, have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R.
2618) that would permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a
therapeutic agent for seriously ill patients.&nbsp; With the addition
of the recent signees, U.S. Reps. Bernard Sanders (I-VT), George
Brown (D-Calif.), and Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), the total number
of co-sponsors now stands at sixteen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Slowly but surely, more and more members of Congress are
coming forward to show their support for medical marijuana
legislation,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This is a bill that deserves full bi-partisan
support and prompt federal action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The inclusion of Bilbray brings the total number of Republican
co-sponsors to three.&nbsp; Republican support of this
legislation is critical if the bill is to move forward in a
Republican controlled Congress. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, H.R. 2618 is simultaneously pending before two
subcommittees: the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on
Crime and the House Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Health
and Environment.&nbsp; This past March, <b>NORML</b> Executive
Director Keith Stroup, Esq. testified before the Subcommittee on
Crime and encouraged Chairman Bill McCullom (R-Fla.) -- a former
two-time co-sponsor of federal medical marijuana legislation
himself -- to hold additional hearings regarding medical
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Presently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by a
number of scientific and medical associations including the <a

the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services and
Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the <a

<p align="center"><b>Navajo Hemp Crop Under Fire From Feds</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1, 1996, Navajo Nation, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
Plans for a widescale planting of industrial hemp on American
Indian soil have met opposition from federal officials who argue
that any planting or harvesting of hemp would violate federal
law.&nbsp; Presently, Navajo Nation President Albert Hale is awaiting
a legal opinion from the tribe's Justice Department before going
forward with the project.&nbsp; This past March, a ceremonial
planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition for Hemp Awareness
(CHA) took place on Native American soil following the unanimous
passage of a resolution by the Nation to allow for hemp
cultivation to occur on sovereign soil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species (<i>Cannabis
sativa</i>) that produces marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana,
however, industrial hemp contains only minute traces of THC, the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medicinal and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Regardless, DEA spokeswoman Dana
Seeley still maintains that federal laws forbidding the
cultivation of marijuana also apply to hemp.&nbsp; &quot;We are
hopeful that they will not [go forward with their plans],&quot;
she said.&nbsp; Seeley noted that the DEA will continue to
monitor the situation closely and may take action if any
large-scale test plots of hemp are planted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After decades of unemployment, leaders of the Navajo Nation feel
that hemp cultivation will invigorate the local economy.&nbsp;
The Navajo Nation Hemp Project &quot;is formulated to provide [a] bio-regional
local industry that will create jobs and enhance the agricultural
base,&quot; stated CHA spokeswoman Christie Bohling.&nbsp;
&quot;With the many attributes and by-products of this natural renewable
resource, the Navajo Nation will become self-sufficient in [its]
ability to provide many of its own necessities.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, industrial hemp is grown legally throughout much of
Europe and Asia and can be used to produce a variety of products
such as cosmetics, textiles, paper, paints, plastics, and animal
feed. <br>

With Drugs<br>
&quot;Walk Away&quot; Without Problems</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
During a recent speech at the National Press Club, new Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey made several remarks that cast doubt on the
validity of the &quot;gateway theory.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCaffrey stated that out of the 90 million Americans who have
experimented with illegal drugs, only 3 million are current
addicts.&nbsp; In addition, he stated that the &quot;overwhelming
majority&quot; of Americans who use illegal drugs simply
&quot;walk away and sa[y] it's not for me.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In my mind, the Drug Czar is simply acknowledging what we
at <b>NORML</b> have already known,&quot; said Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Federal statistics tell us time and time
again that the bulk the Americans who experiment with illicit
drugs experiment solely with marijuana and do not progress to
harder drugs or run into drug-related problems later in
life.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>White House Unveils New Drug Strategy</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 29, 1996, Cora Gables, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Amidst a wave of media fanfare, President Clinton and Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey unveiled a new 10-year anti-drug strategy this
past Monday in Miami.&nbsp; The program asks for a record high
$15.1 billion budget to initiate a &quot;decade-long commitment&quot;
to reduce drug use in America. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although both the President and the Drug Czar emphasized that the
new strategy is chiefly focused on &quot;motivat[ing] America's
youth to reject illegal drugs and substance abuse,&quot; a comprehensive
breakdown of the 1997 budget request illustrates that the plan's
largest component remains domestic law enforcement.&nbsp;
According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP),
the President is requesting $8.3 billion in fiscal year 1997 for
domestic enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, McCaffrey admitted that the new 1996 Clinton
anti-drug strategy is essentially the same as those of previous
administrations.&nbsp; &quot;Everything in this strategy is
already being done,&quot; he told reporters in Miami.&nbsp;
&quot;I don't think the drug strategy has new tricks in it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a follow-up conference this past Wednesday in Washington,
D.C., McCaffrey reiterated this point.&nbsp; This strategy
contains &quot;no sudden surprise attacks,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;[We] recognize that there is no silver bullet.&quot;&nbsp;
McCaffrey added that he sees the new approach as a
&quot;permanent commitment to young people&quot; and was
optimistic that &quot;there is no reason why we can't return
America to a ... pre-Vietnam era level of drug use.&quot;&nbsp;
When asked by the moderator what he felt about the idea of legalization,
McCaffrey called the notion &quot;nonsense.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The federal government's war on drugs has risen from a $1.5
billion yearly battle in 1981 to $15.1 billion battle
today.&nbsp; During that time, America has experienced millions
of casualties and very few gains,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The Clinton
administration's latest proposals are simply an escalation of the
same policies that resulted in the arrest of nearly one-half
million marijuana smokers in 1994 alone.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the 1996 National Drug Control
Strategy or the just-released Gallup Poll: A Look at How

Quadriplegic<br>
Who Used Marijuana As Medicine</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Toledo, OH:</b>&nbsp; Daniel
Asbury, a quadriplegic who grew marijuana to alleviate reoccurring
pain and muscle spasms, has been given a two-year suspended
sentence by Lucas County Court Judge Ruth Ann Franks.&nbsp;
Asbury, who was found guilty of trafficking in marijuana despite
expert testimony by <b>NORML</b> Board member Dr. John Morgan on
the use of marijuana and pain management, must now refrain from
using cannabis if he wants to stay out of jail. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This court does not condone the use of marijuana,&quot;
Franks said.&nbsp; &quot;This court has sent people to the
penitentiary for using marijuana.&nbsp; ... But I believe this is
a unique case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The evidence is clear that you were using this drug for
medicinal purposes.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, any further use may land Asbury in jail.&nbsp;
&quot;Essentially, David Asbury's future -- like the futures of
the tens of thousands of patients who use marijuana as a medicine
-- is limited to two options: suffer in pain or risk arrest and
jail,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use
marijuana as a therapeutic agent after prescription drugs proved
ineffective at controlling his pain.&nbsp; &quot;I need it,&quot;

me feel better.&quot; <br>

An initiative put forth by the Traverse City NORML chapter to
reduce marijuana penalties has the necessary number of signatures
to be placed on the city ballot.&nbsp; The petition seeks to make
possession, use, or sale of less than one ounce of marijuana in
Traverse City punishable by a maximum penalty of $100 and up to
ten hours of community service for a first-time offender. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The road to the ballot has been a rocky one for marijuana
activists.&nbsp; Chapter organizers' 1994 initiative drive was
rejected by the city commission despite having well over the
required number of signatures, because it allegedly conflicted
with state law.&nbsp; This year's petition was devoid of legal problems,
but faced severe opposition from city commissioners who in
December unanimously passed a resolution asking residents not to
sign the petition. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Bustance, president of the Traverse City NORML Chapter, told
local media that he feels that there is a good chance that the
measure will be approved by voters.&nbsp; &quot;We're just asking
a simple question,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;We're not asking:
'Are you for marijuana or are you against marijuana? or 'If
you're for <b>NORML</b> or against <b>NORML</b>?'&nbsp; ... We're
asking: 'Do you want to throw people in prison at a cost of

Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Buyers Club --
one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across the

guilty on Monday to three felony counts of trafficking marijuana
within 1,000 yards of a school in connection with a February raid
by law enforcement officers on the club's headquarters.&nbsp;
Evans' home, which is located in close proximity of a school,
served as the headquarters for the Cincinnati club.&nbsp; Evans

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Heads For
California Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 23, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a state-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for
medical use report that they have collected over 750,000
signatures, well over the number necessary to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Supporters were elated by the success of the signature-gathering
drive and noted that a last week blitz of over 140,000 signatures
virtually guaranteed that Californians will have an opportunity
to vote on the issue this year.&nbsp; A final validation of the
estimated 750,000 signatures is expected in five to eight
weeks.&nbsp; The number of signatures required to qualify the
initiative for the 1996 ballot is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed
by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; The 1996 initiative maintains
that any patient who possesses a valid doctor's recommendation
should be allowed to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent without
fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed by
California voters this fall, the measure will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The issue here is simple; sick people should not be
arrested for using medicine that their physicians recommend to
them,&quot; said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Vermont Senate Approves Hemp Legislation: <br>
However, State Still A Long Ways Away From Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; An
amended version of legislation that had been previously approved
by the House to permit the development of a domestic hemp
industry in Vermont was passed by the Senate by a 15-10
vote.&nbsp; The amended measure reportedly &quot;narrows the
focus&quot; of the bill (H.783) and now must be re-approved by
the Rouse before being sent to the governor.&nbsp; Because the
measure failed to receive two-thirds majority support in the
Senate, it is expected be vetoed by Gov. Howard Dean who remains
opposed to any efforts to legalize industrial hemp.&nbsp;
&quot;It is a terrible message to send to children,&quot; wrote
Dean in an April 8 letter to hemp-activist, Colorado Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D- Northglenn). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), a chief proponent of the
legislation, told <b>NORML</b> that the House is going to take
its time and &quot;let things develop&quot; before rushing to
approve the amended legislation.&nbsp; Maslack stated that House
backers are considering several options at this time, including
trying to override Dean's expected veto of the bill and/or
tacking the controversial legislation onto an economic
development bill considered sacred to the governor.&nbsp;
&quot;It's not over 'til it's over,&quot; Maslack told the <i>Associated
Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kathleen Keenan, chairwoman of the House Commerce Committee, told
the AP that she sees hemp as an &quot;economic development
issue,&quot; but noted that &quot;it has enough merit to stand
alone.&quot;&nbsp; Keenan further added that she was uncertain
how committed Dean was to the economic development bill and
cautioned that he may, in fact, veto it with the hemp provision
included. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keenan's warning has little affect on the bill's proponents,
however, who consider the latest round of political one-upmanship
a &quot;positive&quot; note.&nbsp; The approval from the Senate
was &quot;one more step in the process,&quot; said Maslack.&nbsp;
&quot;[It's] not the first step [and it's certainly] not the last
step,&quot; but it's definitely a step in the right direction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the latest status of the Vermont hemp

Stresses Source Reduction, Interdiction</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; New
White House Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, has submitted a
request to Congress for an additional $250 million to combat
drugs.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the majority of the requested
funding ($202 million) is to be used to beef up the
administration's source-reduction and domestic interdiction
programs.&nbsp; For example, the proposal's largest financial allotment,
$98 million, is requested to upgrade surveillance aircrafts to
patrol known drug source countries such as Columbia and
Peru.&nbsp; In addition, $27 million is to be spent on domestic enforcement,
including marijuana eradication, and $13 million is allotted to
the DEA for &quot;classified programs.&quot;</p>

Industrial Hemp Prohibition</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp; Appalled
at the recent defeat of a bill that would have allowed Colorado
to become the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since
World War II, Hollywood actor and hemp activist Woody Harrelson
has withheld $10,000 of his taxes to protest the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I know I'm only a pampered actor with no room to complain,
... but the fact is I care,&quot; Harrelson wrote in a two page
proclamation.&nbsp; Previously Harrelson, who has commercial
interests in a hemp clothing company, had pledged his support for
the Colorado hemp bill by affirming that he &quot;will personally
guarantee that all hemp produced in Colorado will be purchased at
fair market prices.&quot;&nbsp; The legislation was recently
killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a 8-5 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to a story that ran in <em>USA Today</em>, Harrelson
said that he's been quietly fighting on behalf of industrial hemp
and other environmental causes for years.&nbsp; He even slipped
president Clinton a letter regarding hemp cultivation while they
both attended actor Ted Danson's wedding, the feature noted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Harrelson's action and to commemorate his efforts
on behalf of the Colorado Hemp Production Act of 1996, the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) has declared July 23 to
be Woody Harrelson Appreciation Day.&nbsp; &quot;Mr. Harrelson
has shown great courage and integrity in speaking out in the name
of the [environment,] said CO-HIP's Laura Kriho.&nbsp; &quot;As a
well known and talented actor, his fame has brought media
attention to issues like the salvage logging rider and the
industrial hemp movement.&nbsp; We hope he continues to be a
vocal supporter.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEAth In Colorado</b></font><b> <br>
Hemp Cultivation Killed By House Agriculture Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 11,1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would have allowed Colorado to become
the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since World War
II was killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a stunning
8-5 vote.&nbsp; The vote came as a surprise to many who had watched
support for domestic hemp legislation grow in recent weeks,
including gaining approval from the full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many witnesses attribute the outcome to a collective show of
force from law and drug enforcement officials.&nbsp; During the
four hour hearing, twelve law enforcement officials testified against
the bill, including regional DEA representative Greg Williams and
Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director Carl Whiteside.&nbsp;
Among their arguments, law enforcement testified that there is no
difference between industrial hemp and marijuana and that passing
the Hemp Industrial Production Act would send the wrong message
to young people.&nbsp; &quot;In the minds of many, ... [support
for] this will be perceived as a weakening of our anti-marijuana
message in our society,&quot; stated Special Agent Williams. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Fear and intimidation&quot; scared off support for this
bill in the Committee, said the bill's sponsor, Senator Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn).&nbsp; Hemp activist Laura Kriho of the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) agrees.&nbsp; The
emotional pressure and scare tactics used by these law enforcement
agencies effectively strong-armed the state legislature, forcing
them to vote for the police and against the farmers of
Colorado.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One legislator who voted against the measure, Rep. Russell George
(R-Rifle), explained in an interview immediately after the
hearing how the testimony of law enforcement influenced his decision.&nbsp;
&quot;The key factor in making up my vote was when the ... DEA
... testified and said that under no circumstances would [they]
issue any kind of registration or permit,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;That meant anything else we did with this bill was a waste
of time and was moot because the bill itself said that ...
farmer[s] couldn't go forward without a DEA registration.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The presence of the DEA at the hearing was especially troubling
to both Casey and hemp proponents who noted that, prior to the
April 11 hearing, representatives from the agency had been
cooperative with the bill's backers.&nbsp; In the past, the DEA
in Colorado had &quot;appeared helpful,&quot; noted Kriho.&nbsp;
&quot;We had even been told that ... the DEA in Washington, D.C.
[was] in the process of reviewing policies related to industrial
hemp production.&nbsp; ... [However,] after the DEA testimony at
the hearing, I believe it is safe to say that the DEA is not
working with hemp proponents.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite this setback, activists remain positive that domestic
hemp cultivation in Colorado remains a tangible goal.&nbsp;
&quot;We [still] have a lot of momentum and a lot of
support,&quot; Kriho stated.&nbsp; &quot;We are now in the
process of evaluating our strategies and determining our courses
of action.&nbsp; We have several interesting options and are
excited to be able to pursue them.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately,
though, any future efforts to legalize industrial hemp in
Colorado will be without the efforts of either Lloyd Casey or
Reps. Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-
Lasalle), all of whom are stepping down after this year's
session.&nbsp; When asked by <b>NORML</b> if Casey foresees any legislators
in Colorado willing to carry the torch after he leaves, the
Senator's only response was: &quot;I hope so.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Enters Final
Week <br>
Activists Expect To Have Necessary Number Of Signatures</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
initiative to legalize the medical use of marijuana appears to
have the necessary number of signatures to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot, reports Californians for
Compassionate Use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;When organizers across the state turned in their respective
estimates ... of signatures gathered for the Compassionate Use
Initiative of 1996, the [total] came to over 500,000,&quot;
reported the CCU on April 12, one week before the deadline.&nbsp;
The number needed to qualify the initiative for the 1996 ballot
is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists note that an additional 120,000 to 140,000 signatures
were anticipated to have been gathered during the drive's final
week.&nbsp; Such a figure would be well over the amount needed to compensate
for any errors or invalid signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed
by California voters this fall, the bill will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 initiative has been endorsed by the cities of San
Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa Cruz and Marin
Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses Association; the Los
Angeles AIDS Commission; the California Multiple Sclerosis
Society; the Orange County Register, and many other health and
community leaders and organizations. <br>

Forfeiture</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court in a case that
may determine whether seizing property from criminally prosecuted
drug dealers constitutes double jeopardy under the United States
Constitution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Civil forfeiture has never been deemed so punitive ... as
to constitute a prosecution or punishment under the
[Constitution's] double jeopardy clause,&quot; contended Justice
Department lawyer Michael Dreeben on behalf of the Clinton
administration.&nbsp; The attorney urged the Court to overturn
two double-jeopardy decisions in which federal appeals courts in
Michigan and California found civil forfeiture following a
criminal prosecution to be unconstitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This] is, in my mind, the single most important case
involving the government's forfeiture authority in the area of
narcotics, and possibly other areas,&quot; said Attorney Lawrence
Robbins of Washington, D.C., one of two attorneys arguing against
the government's controversial, double-barreled anti-drug
strategy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If this looks like a punishment ... what then is the reason
for not treating it like punishment,&quot; asked Justice William
H. Rehnquist during the procedures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, no
one may be &quot;subject for the same offense to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb.&quot;&nbsp; The Supreme Court has
interpreted this provision to prohibit multiple punishments for
the same crime. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Cannabis Buyers
Club -- one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across
the country that supplies marijuana as a therapeutic agent to
seriously ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation --
has been subpoenaed to testify before the Grand Jury of Kenton,
Kentucky on April 19 in connection with a February raid by law

admits to having had two marijuana seedlings growing at the

the plants or issue a warrant for his arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans anticipates that the state's latest action is an attempt to
interrogate him about details of the club's activity, such as
membership and suppliers.&nbsp; Evans informs <b>NORML</b> that
he has been advised and intends &quot;to take the Fifth&quot; at

<p align="center"><b>California Assembly Committee Votes For
Tougher Pot Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 16, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Assembly Public Safety Committee slammed the door on
drug reformers by soundly defeating a bill to lessen penalties
for medical marijuana and approving another measure to increase
marijuana prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee, whose complexion has shifted sharply to the right
with the Republican takeover of the Assembly this year, turned a
deaf ear to the pleas of medical marijuana patients, physicians and
AIDS support groups by rejecting a medical marijuana bill
sponsored by Rep. John Burton (D-San Francisco).&nbsp; The Burton
bill (AB 2120) was a heavily watered-down version of legislation introduced
last year by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the
prescribed use of marijuana for the sick and terminally ill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the bill's concessions, Burton's proposed legislation was
defeated handily by a vote of 7-1, signifying a major reversal in
the committee's attitude regarding medical marijuana.&nbsp; In
the past, the committee had been receptive toward the medical
marijuana issue and had approved legislation allowing for it's
use three years in a row.&nbsp; This year, Burton's measure was
actively opposed by the California Narcotics Officers
Association, the Governor's Department of Health, and Attorney
General Lungren, who argued that the legislation undercut the
established system of drug regulation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the committee eagerly approved a measure introduced by
Assemblyman Charles Poochigan (R-Fresno) to enhance prison
sentences by three years and up for marijuana convictions
involving a kilogram or more. Two Democrats joined Republicans in
approving the bill, which was strongly backed by the Narcotics
Officers and District Attorney's associations.&nbsp; &quot;The committee
appeared indifferent to the costs of imprisoning more offenders
for non-violent crime,&quot; stated California NORML State
Coordinator Dale Gieringer, who had opposed the measure.&nbsp; &quot;Throughout
the day, it routinely approved all other penalty enhancement
bills with no regard as to whether the offenses were violent,
serious, or victimless. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Drug-law reformers hope to derail AB 2764 in the
Democratic-controlled State Senate, Gieringer noted. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, who last year introduced
a medical marijuana bill that made it all the way to the
Governor's desk before being vetoed, has once again introduced a
measure that would spell some relief for users of medical marijuana.&nbsp;
This year's measure would allow a person suffering from AIDS,
cancer, multiple sclerosis, or glaucoma to offer their medical
condition as a defense in a California courtroom if charged with
cultivation or possession of marijuana.&nbsp; The bill will be
considered by the California Assembly Public Safety Committee on
April 23.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Missouri Hemp Bill Heard Before Senate
Agriculture Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp; A
bill (SB 972) to allow for the legal cultivation of industrial
hemp in Missouri was heard before the Senate Agriculture
Committee.&nbsp; Introduced by Sen. Jerry Howard (D-Dexter), the
legislation permits licensed growers to cultivate industrial hemp for
a variety of commercial uses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although no vote was taken by the committee, those attending
report that the hearing was positive and signified a step in the
right direction.&nbsp; In all, four witnesses testified in favor
of the bill and no witnesses opposed it. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Because the legislation was introduced late in this year's
legislative session, there is little hope of it being approved in
1996.&nbsp; Nevertheless, hemp proponents are encouraged that
this hearing will provide a &quot;running start&quot; for the
introduction of a similar bill in 1997. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">We are &quot;laying the groundwork for next year,&quot; said
Missouri NORML President Dan Viets, Esq., whose office provided
Sen. Howard with background materials regarding the uses of industrial
hemp.&nbsp; Viets added that Howard has been
&quot;encouraged&quot; by the favorable response his bill has
received. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP), one
Missouri farmer has already applied for a DEA permit to grow hemp
and is hopeful that the legislature will at least pass a
resolution supporting industrial hemp research before the
completion of this year's session. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Vermont Hemp Bill Meets Unexpected

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 10, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that had been previously approved overwhelmingly by
the House to permit development of a domestic hemp industry in
Vermont has been temporarily derailed by the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee, the bill
(H.783) was passed by a 4-2 vote.&nbsp; However, the bill was
passed with an &quot;adverse report&quot; and is now
&quot;ordered to lie&quot; in Senate.&nbsp; According to a
spokesman for the Vermont Legislative Council, bills
&quot;ordered to lie&quot; are in limbo, but may be called back
to the floor for further debate at any time if the bill receives
a majority vote from the full Senate to do so. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Approving legislation with an adverse report is &quot;hardly ever
done,&quot; said Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), one of the
initial proponents of the hemp cultivation bill.&nbsp; Maslack
further added that law enforcement officials, the bill's chief
opponents, recently testified at informal hearings before the Senate
Judiciary Committee against the legislation. <br>

argue that the legislation is tantamount to legalizing
marijuana.&nbsp; Recently, a bill introduced by Rep. Scott
Bungaard (R-Glendale) calling for the repeal of Arizona's tax
stamp legislation was approved in the Senate Government Reform
Committee by a 6-1 vote.&nbsp; The bill (H2367) now moves to the
full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to Committee Chairman Stan Barnes, 55 people signed up
to testify in opposition to Bungaard's amendment, including
Arizona NORML President Peter Wilson.&nbsp; Wilson ignited the stamp
tax controversy this past November when Northwest Phoenix Justice
Court Judge John Barclay dismissed marijuana possession charges
against him because of evidence that he is licensed by the state
to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Basing his decision on constitutional
prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded
that Wilson could not be prosecuted because of (punitive) taxes
he had previously paid to the Arizona department of revenue to
sell and possess cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think by possessing a license and paying the tax, you
show an attitude that is different than a criminal
attitude,&quot; said Wilson's attorney and <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee member, Michael Walz, speaking in favor of maintaining
the current legislation.&nbsp; &quot;What you have is a county
attorney saying on the record he is 100 percent confident [Mr.
Wilson's case] will be reversed on appeal.&nbsp; If that is really
true, then there is no reason for this legislation.&nbsp; And in
fact, what it does is deprive the state of Arizona of
potentially, millions of dollars in revenue.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The license and tax requirements were never intended to
decriminalize the sale of marijuana,&quot; countered Rep.
Bungaard.&nbsp; &quot;I want to send a clear message that drug
use of any kind in this state is illegal and unacceptable.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the recent momentum to repeal the tax stamp legislation,
AZ4NORML member Bill Green doubts Bungaard's measure will pass
this year.&nbsp; &quot;If by some chance it gets passed without
us noticing, we plan to file a referendum with the Secretary of
State.&nbsp; We will bill it as a protest vote for legal
marijuana. <br>

Year Old Pot Charge</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 10, 1996, Chicago IL:</b>&nbsp; A
substitute teacher who was recently dismissed from work after a

in 1974 is suing school officials to get his job back, according
to an <em>Associated Press</em> report. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">High school substitute Michael Maynard, 42, argues that the
school's policy of firing teachers guilty of crimes including
drug misdemeanors -- but not murder -- is arbitrary and does not
give teachers a chance to defend themselves.&nbsp; Maynard
pleaded no contest in 1974 when a traffic stop revealed a small
amount of marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Colorado Senate Gives Green Light To
Domestic Hemp Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 30, 1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would allow Colorado to become the first
state to legalize the growing of industrial hemp was approved by
the full Senate by a 18-15 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The move surprised many who felt that the controversial
legislation would likely fall three or five votes shy of a
majority.&nbsp; &quot;I feel like I've been through a wringer,
but I'm very happy,&quot; said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn), in an interview with the <i>Rocky Mountain
News</i>.&nbsp; A similar bill was introduced by Casey in 1995,
but only received one vote of support in its first committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting
of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill
as marijuana containing no more than 0.5% THC) in Colorado in
1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale hemp production to begin in
1998 and has been endorsed by the Colorado Farm Bureau, the Colorado
State Grange, and the National Federation of Farm Bureaus.&nbsp;
The bill has also received support from Hollywood actor and hemp
businessman Woody Harrelson. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill now moves to the more conservative House where Reps.
Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-Lasalle) have
agreed to help carry the legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medical and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown
legally through much of Europe, Asia, and parts of Canada to
produce a variety of products such as textiles, paper, composites,
paints, cosmetics, and animal feed. <br>

<p align="center"><b>District Attorney To Take No Further Action
In Medical Marijuana Distribution Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; The
Manhattan District Attorney has agreed to take no further action
in its prosecution of Johann Moore for distributing marijuana for
medical purposes and to dismiss all charges against him in six
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge William Mogulescu explained in open court that this
decision by the District Attorney's office constituted an extreme
deviation from their internal policies which require that all
defendants must plead to the indictment in all cases of marijuana
sales.&nbsp; Judge Mogulescu further added that he believed the
District Attorney's action to be tantamount to an acknowledgment
by that office of the legitimacy of medicinal marijuana and of
the validity of Moore's claim that his distribution of marijuana
as medicine constituted a justification for his actions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Immediately after the court proceeding where Moore consented to
the six month deferred prosecution, he informed reporters that he
intends to continue to provide marijuana to those with a legitimate
medical need. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore's attorney and President of the National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), Robert Fogelnest said, &quot;I
applaud the District Attorney's office for their ultimately making
an intelligent and humane judgment in the disposition of this
case.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope that this will pave the way for a more enlightened
policy regarding the distribution of marijuana for medical
use,&quot; added Moore's other attorney, Ruth Liebesman.&nbsp;
Both Liebesman and Fogelnest are members of the <b>NORML</b>
Legal Committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moore is a longtime New York City drug reform activist and is the
founder of the city's underground cannabis buyer's club -- one of
an estimated 30 clubs that currently operate and distribute
medical marijuana to seriously ill patients who possess a
doctor's recommendation.&nbsp; He was arrested last August for
distributing marijuana and was charged with criminal sales in the
fourth degree. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The statement made by the District Attorney in this case is
a strong one,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It appears that they -- like the D.A.'s
offices in San Francisco, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have done
previously -- wish to make the prosecution of buyer's clubs and
those involved in the distribution of marijuana for medicinal use
the state's lowest priority.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Reports Record Numbers Of
Marijuana Prisoners</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 1, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
The number of marijuana offenders in California state prisons has
increased to its highest level in history, according to the
latest statistics from the Department of Corrections.&nbsp; As of
December 31, 1995, 1,572 prisoners were serving time for marijuana
felonies, up 18 percent from one year previously. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The new figures appear to belie recent claims that the war on
marijuana in California has let up.&nbsp; California now has two
and a half times more marijuana prisoners than in the early
l970s, before possession was decriminalized from a felony to a
misdemeanor, and 15 times as many marijuana prisoners as at the
record low in 1980.&nbsp; An unknown number of additional
prisoners are serving time in county jails.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
recent surveys indicate that marijuana usage is rising --
especially among adolescents -- suggesting strongly that harsh
penalties are not an effective deterrent in marijuana
consumption. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Prosecutors Seek To Seize Frequent-Flier
Miles Of Man Convicted Of Marijuana Trafficking</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 3, 1996, Baltimore, MD:</b>&nbsp; In an
action that appears to be a first for the nation, federal prosecutors
are attempting to seize 117,705 frequent-flier miles of a
convicted marijuana trafficker. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think it's ingenious,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Lynne A.
Battaglia, whose office recently filed the forfeiture
claim.&nbsp; Prosecutors maintain that the miles should be
converted into plain tickets and given to law enforcement
agencies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A federal judge will decide whether the miles should be
considered as assets and confiscated under forfeiture laws.&nbsp;
Recently, the Supreme Court upheld a Michigan ruling that allows prosecutors
to seize property used in a crime even when the owner was not a
participant.</p>

<p align="center"><b>USA WEEKEND QuickPoll Indicates Majority Of
Americans Favor Marijuana Decriminalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 31, 1996:</b>&nbsp; Seventy-four percent
of the more than 6,200 individuals who responded to a USA WEEKEND
poll said they favored decriminalizing marijuana.&nbsp; The
outcome came as a surprise to many who felt that the USA WEEKEND
feature: <em>Why more kids are into pot</em> greatly sensationalized
the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The results of this poll indicates that a clear majority of
Americans favor marijuana decriminalization,&quot; said <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;The results of the
USA WEEKEND QuickPoll mimics the outcomes of similar polls
conducted recently by <i>Parade Magazine</i> and America
Online.&nbsp; A significant number of Americans are fed-up with

<p align="center"><b>Federal Medical Marijuana Attracts
Bi-Partisan Support<br>
First Two Republicans Sign On To Bill</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 29, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; Four
additional members of Congress, including one member of the House
Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Crime, and two Republicans,
have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R. 2618) that would
permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for seriously ill patients.&nbsp; The recent signees, U.S Reps.
Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), Steven Gunderson (R-Wis.), Zoe Lofgren
(D-Calif.), and Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) bring the total number of
co-sponsors to thirteen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The support of the recent co-sponsors is critical for a variety
of reasons.&nbsp; The addition of Reps. Gunderson and Campbell
gives the bill its first taste of bi-partisan support and could
potentially persuade several other Republicans -- including House
Speaker and former co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) -- to sign on to H.R. 2618.&nbsp; In
addition, the support of Republicans is necessary if the bill is
to move forward in a Republican controlled Congress. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Lofgren's support is also crucial.&nbsp; Currently, H.R.
2618 is pending before the Subcommittee on Crime.&nbsp; As a
member of this committee, Lofgren can encourage Chairman and former
two-time co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation, Bill
McCollum (R-Fla.), to hold additional hearings on medical
marijuana and possibly bring the bill to a vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders, including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Currently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive medical marijuana legally from the federal
government. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Funding For Study On Medical Marijuana
Allocated In Washington State Budget</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March, 1996, Olympia, WA:</b>&nbsp; Washington
State University and the state Department of Health will start
looking for ways to make medicinal marijuana available to the
seriously ill, under strict controls, though two appropriations
provided in this year's operating budget. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The funding for the study came through the efforts of state
Senators Jeanne Kohl (D-Seattle) and Bob McCaslin
(R-Spokane).&nbsp; The two senators co-sponsored a bill (SB-6744)
that was used as a model for the appropriations provided in this
year's budget. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The funds will be used by Washington State University, in
conjunction with the state Board of Pharmacy, and the state
Department of Health to conduct research on cultivating marijuana
in a tamper-free environment.&nbsp; The study will also determine
the appropriate organization to manufacture and distribute the
drug for medical use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The second appropriation will be used to fund a clinical study
administered by the state Department of Health under the
controlled substance abuse therapeutic program, in statute since 1979. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study will be limited to patients under a physician's
care.&nbsp; Only patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation
treatments, or suffering from glaucoma, AIDS or HIV related illnesses,
multiple sclerosis, or other life threatening illnesses would
qualify for the study. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results of a statewide public-opinion poll directed by local
political consultant Sharon Gilpin the weekend of March 2nd-3rd
indicated that the public supports the use of marijuana for
medicinal purposes.&nbsp; The statewide survey of 400 voters
found that 75 percent favored making marijuana available for
patients if prescribed by a doctor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gilpin said the results were a complete surprise.&nbsp; &quot;I
know the people in the Northwest tend to be compassionate, but
the high number was totally unexpected,&quot; she said.&nbsp;
Gilpin said people who are concerned about the rising cost of
health care are willing to look at alternatives to the high cost of
fighting diseases such as AIDS and cancer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This is a great start that will lead to what we hope is a
promising finish,&quot; said Dr. David Edwards, an Olympia
physician and medical coordinator for the Washington Hemp
Education Network (WHEN), an agency working on informing the
public of the potential benefits of medicinal marijuana.&nbsp;
&quot;I expect the results to have a positive effect in our
effort to provide organic marijuana to patients under strict
medical guidelines.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana activist and founder of the Green Cross
Cannabis Buyers Club, Joanna McKee, said she is confident the
study will confirm what other tests have shown: the positive effects
of medicinal marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;The medical community is so
focused on using chemicals to combat illness, they ignore a
simple, organic solution that's readily available,&quot; she
said.&nbsp; &quot;This test will provide the answer to those who
still question the effectiveness of THC.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. McCaslin said if the results of the state study on THC is
similar to others conducted, organic marijuana could be a boon
for the seriously ill.&nbsp; &quot;It will not only aid them in
their physical recovery, it could prove to be a psychological
boost as well,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kohl said the study is the first step towards getting needed
medicine to those who desperately need it.&nbsp; &quot;If the
synthetic drug is not working for a patient, it only makes sense
they should be able to have access to organic marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists should be advised that the medicinal marijuana
appropriations could potentially fall victim to a section-item
veto by the governor. However, Sen. Kohl's office tells <b>NORML</b>
that she has been assured by the governor's staff that he will
not take such action. <br>

Legislation (SB 67) introduced by Sen. Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn)
to allow Colorado to become the first state to grow industrial
hemp in almost 40 years is heading for the Senate floor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a move that stunned both proponents and opponents alike, the
Senate Appropriations Committee voted 5-4 to send the bill to the
full Senate for debate.&nbsp; A similar bill was introduced by Casey
in 1995, but only received one vote of support in its first
committee. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We're talking about not just growing, but about the textile
mills, the paper mills, [and] the food-processing products.&nbsp;
We're talking about all the value-added things that can result

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Colorado Industrial Hemp Production Act permits the planting
of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp (defined by the bill

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Working diligently over the past year to gather support for this
bill is the Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP), a
grassroots organization of activists who have donated their time
to volunteer on this campaign.&nbsp; CO-HIP notes that the bill
currently has support in the Senate, but is probably three to
five votes shy of a majority.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the group
remains confident that the bill will pass the Senate and is
actively pursuing the help of farm organizations and professional lobbyists
to drum up support among legislators. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Washington State Medical Marijuana User
Found Guilty Of Drug Possession And Manufacture Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March, 1996, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp; A Pierce
County resident who used marijuana to alleviate pain and seizures
stemming from head injuries he suffered in a 1988 motorcycle
accident was found guilty of charges that he possessed and
manufactured marijuana.&nbsp; His sentencing is set for April 10. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jess Williams, aka Fat Freddy, claims that he grew marijuana to
combat the symptoms of his injury after discovering that cannabis
worked more effectively than any conventional prescription drugs.&nbsp;
Law enforcement agents who raided Williams home maintained that
Williams possessed more plants than necessary for personal
use.&nbsp; Williams attorney, <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member
Jeffrey Steinborn, asserts that he will appeal the
decision.&nbsp; &quot;This case is a long way from over,&quot; he
says. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">William's case had risen to the forefront of the battle for
medical access to marijuana in Washington State.&nbsp; While
Steinborn admits that an acquittal would not have invalidated the
law, he maintains that a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict might
have made prosecutors wary of bringing similar cases to trial.&nbsp;
Previously, medical marijuana user Ralph Seeley won a declaratory
judgment from Pierce County Superior Court Judge Rosanne Buckner
affirming that a cancer patient's need to use marijuana as a
medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing its
prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some activists who attended William's trial noted that they felt
the jury might have ruled differently had the defendant suffered
from cancer or glaucoma.&nbsp; Williams was the &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot;
of the month for the May issue of <em>High Times</em> magazine. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Industrial Hemp Planted On American Indian
Soil</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 17, 1996, Navajo Nation, Arizona:</b>&nbsp;
A scheduled planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition
for Hemp Awareness (CHA) took place on test plots of American
Indian soil.&nbsp; The initial planting came about following a
resolution passed unanimously by the Navajo Nation to allow for
hemp cultivation to occur on sovereign soil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Following meetings with both the Vice President and the Director
of Agriculture of the Navajo Nation, CHA spokesman Christie
Bohling told <b>NORML</b> that support for the hemp cultivation project
is &quot;overwhelming beyond our wildest dreams.&quot;&nbsp;
Bohling notes that adverse weather and a lack of seeds limited
CHA's spring planting to a small &quot;ceremonial
celebration,&quot; but adds that a widescale planting is
scheduled for the end of April. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navajo Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson
and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the
purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;
Currently, well over 30,000 acres of Navajo nation land has been
allocated for hemp cultivation.&nbsp; In addition, CHA states
that the organization is close to securing approval for similar cultivation
projects from ten other tribes located across the United
States.&nbsp; This will enable CHA the opportunity to grow hemp
in a variety of &quot;different [climates and]
environments,&quot; Bohling explains. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite
the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural crop.&nbsp;
CHA is a political advocacy network group that assimilates and disseminates
hemp information to both politicians and the public. <br>

Prohibitionist Movement In Virginia</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 19, 1996, Crewe, VA:</b>&nbsp; A
dazzling array of tough new anti-drug proposals failed to pass
the Virginia General Assembly this week.&nbsp; The measures were
opposed by a drug-law reform coalition that included members of
DC NORML, Virginians Against Drug Violence, and Virginia's Cannabis
Action Network.&nbsp; The measures would have increased marijuana
penalties, permitted drug testing of high-school students, and
given courts the broad authority to continue cases despite improper
procedures or incomplete lab results. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This year we had a real show of force,&quot; said activist
Lennice Werth of Virginians Against Drug Violence.&nbsp;
&quot;[We had] lots of anti-prohibitionists showing up at the
state house to voice their dissatisfaction with this kind of
legislation.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among bills defeated outright were measures to include marijuana
seeds and stems as evidence to increase marijuana penalties
(SB34, SB58, HB96, HB169); allow courts to continue cases that have
been dismissed due to improper procedures (HB646, SB53); add a
$1,000 additional fine for possession or distribution charges to
go to local authorities (HB1002), and permit the drug testing of
high school students (HB949, HB950, HB579). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A measure that was not killed, but amended, was legislation that
would have greatly expanded the use of military for drug law
enforcement, particularly for searching private property.&nbsp;
Werth notes that the amended bill limits use of the military to
aerial surveillance only and called the revision &quot;a
substantial victory&quot; for the drug reform movement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some measures that passed the General Assembly despite the
efforts of drug-law reformers include legislation to legalize
double jeopardy (SB435, SJR73) and deny bail to drug offenders (HB504).&nbsp;
Altogether, reformers monitored a total of 48 bills. <br>

could face a sentence of up to five years in prison.&nbsp;
Asbury's sentencing will occur on April 18. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The guilty verdict was a setback for marijuana reform advocates
who had hoped to set a legal precedent in Ohio for the medical
use of marijuana.&nbsp; John Hartman, President of Northcoast NORML,
notes that the organization flew in <b>NORML</b> Board member and
CUNY Medical School Professor Dr. John Morgan to testify as an
expert witness on the use of marijuana and pain management.&nbsp;
&quot;For whatever reason, the jury [who found Asbury innocent on
charges of cultivation] didn't find Daniel's medical necessity
case strong enough to nullify [the trafficking charge,]&quot;
Hartman notes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hartman adds that Asbury's defense was made more difficult
because Ohio currently provides no medical marijuana defense in
its body of established state law.&nbsp; Therefore, Asbury's
defense was basically asking the jury to &quot;find the
compassion to rule over the law,&quot; Hartman said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use

<p align="center"><b>Oakland City Council Issues Resolution
Supporting Medical Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 12, Oakland, CA:</b>&nbsp; The Oakland
City Council has unanimously passed a resolution (#72516)
endorsing Rep. Barney Frank's (D-Mass.) federal medical marijuana legislation, supporting
the activities of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers Club, and declaring
the arrest of individuals involved with the medical use of
marijuana to be a low priority for the city of Oakland. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The main points of the resolution are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Marijuana has been shown to help pain and discomfort in
        people suffering from a variety of illnesses including
        AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and chronic
        pain when no other medications have been effective. </li>
    <li>The illegal purchase of marijuana by people already suffering
        with chronic illnesses subjects them to further suffering
        in the form of potential arrest and prosecution. </li>
    <li>The Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Club provides a way for patients
        needing to purchase marijuana for medical use to do so
        with greater ease and less risk of arrest and prosecution. </li>
    <li>The City of Oakland wishes to declare its desire not to
        expend City resources in any investigation, detention,
        arrest, or prosecution arising out of alleged violations
        of state and federal law regarding the possession,
        cultivation, and/or distribution of marijuana for medical use. </li>
    <li>The Oakland City Council authorizes the City Manager to
        instruct the City's federal lobbyist to work in support
        of H.R. 2618 -- a bill in Congress that would amend the
        federal law to allow a physician to legally prescribe

<p align="center"><b>Twice As Many Defendants Imprisoned For
Marijuana Possession<br>
Under Tough &quot;Three Strikes&quot; Law Than For Violent
Crimes, Study Indicates</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 6, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
More than twice as many defendants have been sentenced to stiff
prison sentences under California's &quot;three strikes and
you're out&quot; law than have murderers, rapists, and kidnappers
combined, according to a recent study by the Center on Juvenile
and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Overall, the report concluded that 85 percent of those sentenced
under the law had been convicted most recently of a non-violent
offense.&nbsp; Of those 85 percent, 192 individuals were sentenced
under the law after being convicted of marijuana possession while
in custody (a felony offense in California) as compared to only
40 who were convicted of murder, 25 of rape, and 24 of
kidnapping. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To be prosecuted under the stringent California law, a defendant
must have been convicted of at least one or more serious violent
crimes in the past.&nbsp; However, the most recent offense need
not be a violent crime -- only a felony.&nbsp; The law mandates
double the normal sentence for anyone convicted of a second
felony and life sentence for any individual convicted of a third
felony. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;People are going to jail in America for possessing
marijuana,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;As this report clearly illustrates, the
sentences can potentially be for life.&nbsp; This sort of
illogical and fiscally irresponsible mandatory sentencing must
end.&quot; <br>

available for every American citizen that needs it!&nbsp; Nobody
should have to perform a criminal act to obtain a safe, natural medicine.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">To support her argument, Marlowe notes that she has letters from
two separate physicians confirming her use of medical
marijuana.&nbsp; In addition, Marlowe has an official notice from

Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 1996, Olympia, WA:</b>&nbsp; A final
version of the 1996 Washington Hemp Initiative has been approved
by the Washington state Attorney General.&nbsp; If successful,
the initiative, now known officially as Initiative 663, would
require the state to replace existing policies prohibiting
cannabis with a system of regulation and taxation similar to that
of alcohol.&nbsp; The initiative has until July 8th to gather the
189,000 signatures from registered Washington voters necessary to
place the bill on the upcoming ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 Hemp Initiative is a comprehensive initiative dealing
with industrial, medicinal, and recreational hemp.&nbsp;
Industrial hemp is defined by the initiative as having less than
.5 percent THC and is to be regulated as a non-intoxicating
agricultural commodity.&nbsp; Medicinal cannabis is allowed to be
distributed by prescription from drug stores and
pharmacies.&nbsp; Regulations regarding the use of recreational
and/or intoxicating hemp (read: marijuana) are modeled after the
laws regulating alcohol and permits adults over 21 to consume
cannabis as long as they do so responsibly.&nbsp; In addition,
minors will not be allowed where marijuana is grown, sold, or
consumed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Tom Rohan, state coordinator for the initiative drive, notes that
petition organizers have over 3,000 volunteers to help gather
signatures. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Bill To Eliminate Arizona Tax Stamp
Legislation Pulled For Time Being</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 12, 1996, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp; An
amendment that would delete Arizona's cannabis tax and licensing
program was pulled by the bill's sponsor, Rep. Scott Bungaard
(R-Glendale).&nbsp; Bungaard plans to reintroduce the amendment
next week. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bungaard's move to repeal Arizona's tax stamp legislation stems
from a November 1995 ruling by Northwest Phoenix Court Justice
Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges against Arizona NORML
Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence that he was licensed by
the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing his decision on
constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy, Judge Barclay
concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted for possession of
marijuana because of taxes he had already paid the Arizona
Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; The state is currently
appealing the decision. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Having this law gives the appearance that we have
decriminalized [marijuana] use in this state,&quot; Rep. Bungaard
said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If the legislature allows Rep. Bungaard to submit a new
bill, it will open this issue up to public debate within both the
House and Senate,&quot; said Bill Green of Arizona <b>NORML</b>.&nbsp;

[lobby the legislature] at that time.&quot; <br>

<p align="center">March 7, 1996</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>NORML Testifies Before
Congress</b></font> <br>
<b>Executive Director Keith Stroup Tells Subcommittee That
&quot;Far More Harm Is Caused By Marijuana Prohibition Than By
Marijuana Itself&quot;</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 6,1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; In a
step forward for the marijuana reform movement, Congress invited <b>NORML</b>
Executive Director Keith Stroup and two other reform advocates to testify
on the subject of marijuana policy.&nbsp; Wednesday's
congressional hearing marked the first time that Congress has
made such overtures in more than six years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee: Congressional
Subcommittee on Crime, Stroup urged the committee to put an end
to federal policies that continue to arrest hundreds of thousands
of adult marijuana users every year while, at the same time,
maintaining <b>NORML</b>'s opposition to adolescent drug
use.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana smokers in this country are no
different from their non-smoking peers, except for their
marijuana use.&nbsp; Like most Americans, they are responsible citizens
who work hard, raise families, contribute to their communities,
and want a safe, crime-free neighborhood in which to live,&quot;
he stated.&nbsp; &quot;It's time we ended marijuana prohibition
and stopped arresting and jailing hundreds of thousands of
average Americans whose only 'crime' is that they smoke
marijuana.&nbsp; This is a tragic and senseless war against our
own citizens; it must be ended. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stroup also spoke in favor of amending federal law to allow
patients access to medical marijuana with a doctor's prescription
and urged the members of the crime subcommittee to promptly
approve HR 2618 -- a federal bill currently before the
subcommittee that would permit the medical use of cannabis.&nbsp;
&quot;Whatever you may feel about the war on drugs,&quot; Stroup summarized,
&quot;denying medical marijuana to seriously ill people should
not be a part of it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also appearing before the subcommittee to attest to marijuana's
medical utility was Richard Brookhiser, Senior Editor for the
National Review.&nbsp; In impassioned testimony, Brookhiser told
of his own use of marijuana, with the full knowledge of his
physicians, as a way to alleviate the violent nausea he suffered
as the result of cancer chemotherapy treatments.&nbsp;
&quot;Because of ... marijuana, my last two courses of
chemotherapy were almost nausea-free,&quot; Brookhiser
recounted.&nbsp; &quot;There was only one problem -- I had to
become a criminal to do this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representing the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
(NACDL) was Attorney Jeralyn E. Merritt of Denver,
Colorado.&nbsp; Merritt testified in favor of changes recently
enacted by the U.S. Sentencing Commission and approved by
Congress adopting a universal plant/weight ratio of 100 grams be
used in marijuana sentencing.&nbsp; Merritt argued that efforts
by some members of Congress to re-enact a 1000 gram per plant
ratio for marijuana plants were not justified.&nbsp; &quot;For Congress
to step in now,&quot; she testified, &quot;in the absence of new
and compelling evidence that the [current law] is scientifically
unsound or otherwise irrational, flies in the face of the
authority granted to the [U.S.] Sentencing Commission.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Appearing before the committee on an opposing panel were
Stephanie Haynes, President of Drug Watch International, Dr. Eric
A. Voth of the International Drug Strategy Institute, D.A.R.E. officer
Donald Hayes of the Alexandria Virginia Police Department, and
Tom Hedrick, Vice Chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free
America.&nbsp; All four speakers testified in favor of continuing
to maintain strict penalties for the use of marijuana and
encouraged Congress to strengthen their anti-drug efforts.&nbsp;
In addition, both Ms. Haynes and Dr. Voth voiced their disapproval
over the efficacy of medical marijuana and the introduction of HR
2618.&nbsp; Ignoring the fact that thousands of seriously ill
patients risk arrest daily to acquire marijuana as a therapeutic agent
for a variety of serious illnesses including glaucoma, cancer,
and the wasting syndrome associated with AIDS, Voth testified
that only &quot;the pro-marijuana forces [continue to] drive the medical
marijuana issue.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although <b>NORML</b> was encouraged by the opportunity to
testify before the congressional subcommittee, the organization
expressed concern that Subcommittee Chairman, Bill McCollum -- a
former two-time co-sponsor of medical marijuana legislation
himself -- refused to hear testimony from Harvard Medical School
Professor and international authority on medical marijuana, Dr. Lester
Grinspoon, M.D.&nbsp; &quot;Because of the importance [<b>NORML</b>]
place[s] on the need for medical marijuana, we had asked if we
might have ... [Dr.] Lester Grinspoon ... present our testimony
here today, but [we] were told by the committee that would not be
possible,&quot; Stroup explained.&nbsp; &quot;[However,] Dr.
Grinspoon remains available should this committee elect to hear
from him at some point.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The fact that the subcommittee allowed a medical doctor
testify to the purported dangers of marijuana, but denied <b>NORML</b>
the opportunity to present expert medical testimony on the therapeutic
effectiveness of cannabis is truly unfortunate, said <b>NORML</b>'s
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Since the
Subcommittee on Crime may be voting on proposed medical marijuana legislation
in the near future, one can only hope that they will hold
additional hearings at which time expert medical testimony on
both sides of the issue will be accepted.&quot; <br>

Massive Expansion Of White House Anti-Drug Efforts</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>March 6, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; In a
move that signifies a 180 degree departure from the President's
previous decisions to downsize the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, President Clinton recently asked Congress for
$3.4 million in supplemental spending to expand the staff of the
ONDCP from 25 to 150 individuals.&nbsp; This money would be in
addition to the extra $250 million dollars already appropriated
by the White House to beef up anti-drug efforts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The general wants some troops to command,&quot; explained
one White House official to the Washington Post on Clinton's
sudden move to increase the ONDCP staff, &quot;and Clinton wanted
the general.&quot;&nbsp; Newly appointed drug czar, retired
General Barry R. McCaffrey was sworn in to office yesterday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to his title as drug czar, McCaffrey was granted a
slot on the National Security Council.&nbsp; The former general
was also given approval from the White House to carry over 30 former
Pentagon staffers to his new operation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;According to the most recent FBI statistics, the federal
government's war on drugs is primarily a war against marijuana
users,&quot; explained <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Clinton's latest effort to drastically
increase the 'war' effort is yet another step in the wrong
direction and a wasteful expenditure of valuable taxpayers
dollars.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Issues Principles Of Responsible
Cannabis Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 29, 1995, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the nation's
oldest and largest interest group dedicated solely to marijuana
law reform, has adopted a set of Principles of Responsible
Cannabis Use.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> maintains that when marijuana is
enjoyed responsibly, subjecting users to harsh criminal and civil
penalties provides no public health benefit and causes terrible
injustices.&nbsp; For reasons of public safety, public health,
economics, and justice, the prohibition laws should be repealed
to the extent that they criminalize responsible marijuana
use.&nbsp; The key points to the Principles of Responsible Use
are as follows: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Cannabis consumption is for adults only.</b>&nbsp;
        Many things and activities are suitable for young people,
        but others absolutely are not.&nbsp; Children do not
        drive cars, enter into contracts or marry, and they must
        not use drugs. </li>
    <li><b>The responsible cannabis user does not operate a motor vehicle
        or other dangerous machinery impaired by cannabis.</b>&nbsp;
        Although cannabis is said by most experts to be safer than
        alcohol and many prescription drugs with motorists,
        public safety demands that impaired drivers be taken off
        the road and that objective measures of impairment be developed
        and used, rather than chemical testing. </li>
    <li><b>The responsible cannabis user will carefully consider his/her
        setting and regulate use accordingly.</b>&nbsp; The responsible
        cannabis consumer will be vigilant as to conditions -- time,
        place, mood, etc. -- and does not hesitate to say
        &quot;no&quot; when those conditions are not conducive to
        a safe, pleasant and/or productive experience. </li>
    <li><b>Use of cannabis, to the extent that it impairs health, personal
        development or achievement, is abuse and should be
        resisted by responsible cannabis users.</b>&nbsp; Abuse means
        harm.&nbsp; Some cannabis use is harmful; most is
        not.&nbsp; That which is harmful should be discouraged; that
        which is not need not be. </li>
    <li><b>The responsible cannabis user does not violate the rights
        of others, observes accepted standards of courtesy and
        public propriety, and respects the preferences of those
        who wish to avoid cannabis entirely.</b>&nbsp; Regardless
        of the legal status of cannabis, responsible users will
        adhere to emerging tobacco smoking protocols in public
        and private places. </li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><b>Vermont House Of Representatives Approves
Hemp Cultivation Legislation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 29, 1996, Montpelier, Vermont:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation that proposes to permit development of a domestic
hemp industry in Vermont (H.783) was approved by the House of
Representatives by a voice vote today.&nbsp; The bill had
received wide-scale bi-partisan support one day earlier when the
second reading was approved by a 108-33 vote.&nbsp; The
overwhelming number of votes in favor of the legislation would
override the Governor's veto if he chooses to oppose it.&nbsp; In
the past, Gov. Howard B. Dean has spoken out against hemp
cultivation claiming that it would be tantamount to legalizing
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Vermont legislation is similar to a pending Colorado hemp
bill introduced by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn) and would
authorize the University of Vermont to undertake research of industrial
hemp production in the state.&nbsp; A key aspect of this research
would include growing test plots of industrial hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill is expected to go to the Senate after session tomorrow
barring any last minute calls for reconsideration.&nbsp;
Legislators note that there appears to be little opposition for
the proposal in the Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Sen. Thomas Bahre (R-Addison), chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee told the <em>Vermont Times</em> that he hopes to begin
taking testimony on the bill as soon as March 18.&nbsp; &quot;We want
to seriously look at whether there is anybody out there to buy
this fiber, and what its potential is to create manufacturing
jobs,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;If it doesn't then I don't see a
need to go any further.&nbsp; But, I do think this fiber has the
potential to have land produce something that isn't producing
milk.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric
properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown legally
throughout much of Europe and Asia and can be used to produce a
variety of products such as cosmetics, textiles, paper, paints, plastics,
and animal feed. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 17, 1996, Chandler Heights, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
The Coalition for Hemp Awareness (CHA) announced that the Navajo
Nation has issued a resolution allowing for hemp cultivation to
take place on American Indian soil.&nbsp; CHA has scheduled a
spring planting to take place on March 17, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Navaho Hemp Project began in 1992 when activists Jim Robinson
and Tom and Carolyn McCormick moved to the reservation for the
purpose of introducing hemp cultivation on sovereign soil.&nbsp;
The trio were so successful in their education campaign that the
resolution was passed by the Navajo Nation with a unanimous vote
of 30-0. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although over 30,000 acres of the Navajo Nation have been
allocated for hemp cultivation, CHA's initial planting will be
limited to a small seed bank crop.&nbsp; In addition, CHA states
that the organization is close to securing approval for similar
cultivation projects from ten other tribes located across the
United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Coalition for Hemp Awareness was founded in 1991 to incite
the rapid return of cannabis hemp as an agricultural base
crop.&nbsp; CHA is a political advocacy network group that
assimilates and disseminates hemp information to both politicians
and the public. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Illinois Supreme Court Finds Cannabis Tax
Stamps Unconstitutional</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 15, 1996, Illinois:</b>&nbsp; The
Illinois Supreme Court has declared that the application of the
state's Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act in the case a
defendant who had previously plead guilty to drug possession
charges constitutes double jeopardy under the United States
Constitution.&nbsp; This decision follows closely on the heels of
similar rulings reached by both an Arizona trial court and the
Indiana Supreme Court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing the opinion of the court, Justice Harrison rejected the
state's argument that the application of the Illinois act is not
contingent upon commission of a crime.&nbsp; &quot;Under the Act,
the only persons liable for the tax are 'dealers,'&quot; the
justice writes.&nbsp; &quot;[T]o be a 'dealer' within the meaning
of the statute, one must have carried out certain enumerated acts
'in violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or the
Cannabis Control Act,' both of which are criminal statutes.&nbsp; [Hence,]
by the terms of the Act, criminal conduct is a prerequisite to
tax liability. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Consequently,] because the Department of Revenue cannot
determine whether a person is a 'dealer' subject to the tax
unless and until that person had been found guilty of the
underlying criminal offense, the Cannabis and Controlled
Substances Tax Act not only assumes that a crime has been
committed, it also presupposes that the offending party has been
arrested, charged and convicted.&nbsp; In this regard, the act
... [is] a form of punishment for double jeopardy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this case, please refer to Docket No.

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 26, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b> An
initiative to legalize the medical use of marijuana appears
headed for the November 1996 California ballot thanks to crucial
last-minute financial support from a group of major donors.&nbsp;
The new donations make it likely that supporters will garner the
necessary number of signatures by the April 20 deadline to place
the initiative on the ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Initiative organizers were elated by the gift and expressed
confidence that voters would approve the measure.&nbsp; Polls
indicate that a solid majority of Californians support the
medicinal legalization of marijuana.&nbsp; The current medical
marijuana initiative would guarantee the right of patients to use marijuana
for medicinal purposes if they possess a physician's
recommendation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana has remained illegal despite growing acceptance
in the health care community of its efficacy in the treatment of
cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain and
muscle spasticity.&nbsp; Under current state law, Californians
who cultivate marijuana for medicinal use may be subject to up to
three years in state prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 medical marijuana initiative has been endorsed by the
cities of San Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa
Cruz and Marin Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses
Association; the Los Angeles AIDS Commission, the California
Multiple Sclerosis Society, the California Seniors' Legislature,
and many other organizations and public leaders. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to statements made to the <em>New York Times</em> by
Dennis Peron, Director of the California Medical Marijuana
Initiative, the all-volunteer signature drive has gathered
approximately 200,000 signatures to date.&nbsp; The coalition
must collect 600,000 signatures by April 20 to place the initiative
on the November ballot. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Cincinnati Buyers Club Founder Takes
Offensive Following Police Raid</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 29, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Cannabis Buyers
Club -- one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across
the country that supplies marijuana as a therapeutic to seriously
ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation -- has
taken the offensive since his home was raided by police on
February 16.&nbsp; Evans' home served as the headquarters for the
club which distributed marijuana to approximately 30 patients. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans and his attorney, marijuana activist Gatewood Galbraith,
held a press conference on the Covington courthouse steps at the
Kenton County Municipal Building to protest the police
action.&nbsp; &quot;If they want to make this the battle [for
medical marijuana clubs,] then we're ready to do battle,&quot; Galbraith
told the press.&nbsp; &quot;Only a fascist nation would keep this
premiere medicine from the hands of seriously ill patients ...
for whom it is the best therapy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even though Evans' house was raided over one week ago and
marijuana was confiscated, law enforcement officials have yet to
produce a warrant for Evans' arrest.&nbsp; Even so, Evans' case
and subsequent press conference have drawn an exceptional amount
of favorable press coverage including features in the <em>Kentucky
Post</em>, <em>Cincinnati Post</em>, <em>Cincinnati Enquirer</em>,
and at least two television news stations.&nbsp; Covington police
have refused to comment on the situation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am sick of living in a country where I can't be
free,&quot; summarized Evans.&nbsp; &quot;Give me liberty or give
me death.&nbsp; We are going to have a cannabis buyers
club.&quot; <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 16, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
The home of activist and medical marijuana user Richard Evans has
been raided by law enforcement officials.&nbsp; Evans' house
served as the home base for the 9-year-old Cincinnati Cannabis
Buyers Club. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans, who was not home at the time of the raid, subsequently
checked himself into a local hospital to combat onsetting
symptoms of manic depression -- a medical condition which he is treated
for.&nbsp; Evans stayed at the hospital throughout the weekend
and intends to turn himself over to local authorities. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans informed <b>NORML</b> that he still has &quot;no idea&quot;
what charges may be pending against him, but speculated that he
may be facing felony offenses for two marijuana seedlings that
were present in his home.&nbsp; Ironically, witnesses report that
law enforcement officers failed to seize the seedlings. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Cincinnati Buyers Club is one of an estimated 30 underground
cannabis buyers clubs located throughout the country.&nbsp; The
Cincinnati CBC has an eight member board of directors and distributes
marijuana to approximately 30 patients.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> will

Passes Senate Public Health Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 15, 1996, Jefferson City, MO:</b>&nbsp;
A medical marijuana bill (Senate Bill 573) introduced by State
Senator Joe Mosley has unanimously passed the Senate Public
Health Committee.&nbsp; The bill states that &quot;no criminal or
civil penalty shall apply to any person for the act of possessing
marijuana provided that ... a [physician] certifies in writing
that the person is under professional care [and] ... needs
marijuana as part of a therapeutic regimen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Missouri NORML Coordinator Dan Viets says that he is pleased with
the committee's recommendation to the Senate to pass the
bill.&nbsp; However, he added a note of skepticism regarding a
last minute amendment to the bill that instructs the University
of Missouri to conduct research on the efficacy and safety of
whole-smoked cannabis to that of the synthetic-THC drug Marinol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I hope this doesn't bog the bill down and undermine the
overall purpose of the legislation: to stop seriously ill
individuals from going to prison for their medical use of
cannabis,&quot; Viets said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill will now go to the Senate floor for a vote. <br>

Years In Prison</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 15, 1996, Minneapolis, MN:</b>&nbsp;
Hemp activist and founder of the U.S. Hemp Company, Arlin Trout,
was sentenced to more than eight years in prison after being
found guilty of conspiring to possess more than 100 kilograms of
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Trout accused the prosecution of utilizing paid informers and
snitches to frame him and labeled himself a political prisoner
who is being targeted for his beliefs.&nbsp; Arlin's wife, Cathy,
will now be left to run the successful clothing business and
raise the Trout's six children on her own. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to his sentencing, Trout gave an impassioned speech to U.S.
District Judge James Rosenbaum.&nbsp; &quot;I was charged and
convicted of conspiring to sell a plant that grows wild in this region
and [that] once provided legal jobs for Minnesota.&nbsp; This
plant is the oldest, safest source of food, fuel, fiber and
medicine on Earth and has infinite industrial and medicinal value
to society. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... Fear and ignorance guided by greed and blind ambition
created the prohibition of hemp.&nbsp; I am morally and
intellectually compelled to resist these forces.&nbsp; When the
American people find out what hemp is and why it's really
illegal, may they deal with this government as harshly as it has
dealt with me. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although Trout's supporters applauded Arlin's bold speech, Judge
Rosenbaum was unmoved and sentenced Trout to the maximum sentence
recommended under the U.S. sentencing guidelines. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked if she felt that her husband's speech may have
increased the length of his sentence, Cathy Trout responded,
&quot;Why not stand up for your rights?&nbsp; One day in jail is
too long.&nbsp; You can't be expected to admit you're wrong when
you don't believe you are.&nbsp; You've got to live with yourself.&nbsp;
Besides, the extra time isn't going to destroy the fact that I
love him and his children love him, and no matter how long he's
in [prison], that won't change.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite Trout's incarceration, he is reportedly planning to run

NORML chapter is under fire from parents and local officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The three case exhibit, currently on display at The Norman Public
Library, advocates the legalization of the hemp plant for
industrial and agricultural purposes.&nbsp; On display are
various products made from hemp such as hats, shoes, and

President George Washington encouraging farmers to: &quot;Grow
hemp.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">School patron Robert Coffman, who said he was representing other
parents, recently criticized the display at a City Council
meeting and argued that such an exhibit was inappropriate for children.&nbsp;
In addition, Mayor Bill Nations reports that he has had at least
a dozen calls from people opposed to the exhibit.&nbsp; Nations
admits that both city and library officials had tried to prevent
UO NORML from running the exhibit. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Tony Smith, a member of UO NORML, states that the library has
received an equal number of compliments as well as complaints
from patrons regarding the controversial exhibit.&nbsp; He
further argues that children should be allowed to view the

uses of the hemp plant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We teach our children that we have a free country where

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Magill explained to <b>NORML</b> that he was in the process of

Anderson, a long-time police chief for the town of Fairfax is one
of the latest law enforcement officials to speak out in favor of
California's current medical marijuana initiative. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I believe there is adequate unbiased and scientific
evidence that marijuana does have medicinal benefit.&nbsp; When
we consider the associated consequences of other prescription
drugs it seems illogical to exclude marijuana as another
alternative available to physicians for prescription. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;... Even if there are no other benefits than relief of pain
or stimulation of appetite, there appears to be a legitimate
place for marijuana in the wide array of legally prescribed
drugs.&nbsp; The legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes
seems to strike a reasonable balance between the abuse and illegal
use of the drug and its legitimate medicinal value that could be
available through prescriptive use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;With the increased public attention on my own support of
the medicinal use of marijuana, I find that many other
conservative persons share this belief.&nbsp; ...Marijuana is not
the street degenerate that ravages society.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Anderson has been employed in law enforcement and public safety
since 1964 and has been a police chief for 14 years.&nbsp; He is
also a member of the U.S. Army Reserve with rank of Lieutenant Colonel. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Californians for Compassionate Use coalition is attempting to

<p align="center"><b>Update: Judge Drops Charges Against Medical
Marijuana User Todd McCormick</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 13, 1996, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Judge
Anthony Gretick has dismissed drug charges against medical
marijuana user and activist Todd McCormick.&nbsp; McCormick, who
has a prescription from a physician in Holland to use cannabis as
a medicine, was arrested this past summer when Ohio State
Patrolmen discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in
his van. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Gretick ruled that state troopers had illegally searched
McCormick's vehicle and ordered that the evidence be
suppressed.&nbsp; It is expected that the state will appeal
Gretick's verdict. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Since the beginning of this case, McCormick has maintained that
the search had been illegal and that the marijuana seized was
intended solely for medical use and not for sale.&nbsp;
McCormick, 25, is the founder of the San Diego Compassionate Use
Club in California and was driving to his home state of Rhode
Island to establish a similar club when he was arrested. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick's case garnered national headlines this past fall when
it was revealed that Judge Gretick was considering allowing
McCormick to have legal access to cannabis while in jail.&nbsp;
For much of his life, McCormick has used marijuana as a
therapeutic to alleviate pain associated with a rare strain of
cancer he suffers from known as histiocytosis X.&nbsp; While in
Holland, McCormick received a prescription for the use of 1 to 10
grams of marijuana daily from Dr. R. T. Trossel of the Preventive
Medicine Center in Rotterdam. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I'm sure he can't live without it,&quot; Trossel notes,
&quot;because he becomes completely paralyzed.&nbsp; ...I am
convinced [that] there are no other drugs that would give him the
same relief.&nbsp; He's tried them all ... [and] ... this seems
to have the best effect on him.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick, who had recently been residing in the Netherlands,
states that he is pleased with Gretick's ruling and plans on
returning to Rhode Island shortly.&nbsp; He notes that he is
considering filing charges against the state of Ohio. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Sentence Reduction Bill
Introduced in California</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 5, 1996, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
State Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) has introduced
legislation (AB 2120) that would provide some relief for patients
who choose to cultivate marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp;
The bill (AB 2120) would reclassify such personal cultivation and
use of medical marijuana as a misdemeanor, thereby allowing
judges to grant a wide variety of sentencing alternatives.&nbsp;
Currently, marijuana cultivation in California is categorized as
a felony offense and those found guilty may be subject to up to
three years in state prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical sentence reduction bill is scheduled to be heard
before the Public Safety Committee of the State Assembly in
March.&nbsp; Burton's bill represents the fourth year in a row
that the state legislature has attempted to reconcile the
continuing demand from the medical community for access to
medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This bill is a real ... effort to relieve the suffering of
thousands of seriously ill people,&quot; says Dennis Peron,
Director of Californians for Compassionate Use.&nbsp; &quot;This
is surely the least we can do.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Californians for Compassionate Use coalition is currently
attempting to place a medical marijuana initiative on the 1996
general election ballot by collecting 600,000 signatures by April 20,

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Modeled closely after a Colorado hemp bill, Vermont's legislation

Agriculture Committee<br>
Postpones Voting On Hemp Cultivation Bill Until 1997</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 12, 1996, Honolulu, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp;
The House Agriculture Committee has voted to postpone deciding on
a bill that would allow Hawaii to cultivate industrial hemp until
&quot;more scientific information&quot; can be gathered. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Legislation introduced by state Rep. David Tarnas would amend the
state law to authorize the production, possession, and commerce
of non-psychoactive industrial hemp in Hawaii.&nbsp; Tarnas maintains
that the cultivation of industrial hemp in Hawaii could provide
local farmers with a prosperous economic and environmental
future.&nbsp; &quot;Hawaii has the opportunity to capture a significant
market share as the first hemp production in the U.S.A.,&quot; he
wrote this past November. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Less enthusiastic were the members of the House Agriculture
Committee who decided to hold off acting on Tarnas' bill until
the 1997 legislative session.&nbsp; The committee's main concern
appeared to be over the question of cross-pollination, stated an
aid of Rep. Tarnas who attended the hearings.&nbsp; Law
enforcement officials testified that marijuana growers would be
able to grow psychoactive strains of cannabis alongside of
non-psychoactive hemp.&nbsp; Hemp proponents denied this claim
and argued that the growth of high grade marijuana was not
possible in such close proximity to industrial hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An aid of Rep. Tarnas maintains that he will
&quot;absolutely&quot; reintroduce hemp cultivation legislation next
year.&nbsp; In the meantime, the House of Representatives has
released a concurrent resolution (H.C.R. 28) requesting the
establishment of a &quot;state licensing program for the
agricultural production of industrial cannabis hemp for food,
fuel, and fiber, and the establishment of a pilot project to
conduct agronomic research on industrial cannabis hemp.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Actor Woody Harrelson Endorses Industrial
Hemp<br>
Hearings For Colorado Cultivation Bill Begin Today</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 8, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp;
Hearings begin today before the Colorado State Senate Agriculture
Committee to determine the fate of a bill that would allow
Colorado to become the first state to grow industrial hemp in
almost 40 years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, sponsored by Senator Lloyd Casey (D-Northglenn),
permits the planting of no more than 40 acres of industrial hemp
in Colorado in 1996 for agricultural, commercial, and scientific research.&nbsp;
The legislation allows for full scale commercial production of
hemp to begin in 1998. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Appearing before the Committee today are a wide assortment of
hemp activists, businessmen, farmers, and lobbyists.&nbsp;
However, Casey speculates that the bill's most influential
endorsement may come from Hollywood actor and businessman, Woody
Harrelson.&nbsp; In a fax to the Agriculture Committee, Harrelson
stated that he &quot;will personally guarantee that all hemp
produced in Colorado will be purchased at fair market
prices.&quot;&nbsp; Harrelson is a hemp proponent who has
commercial interests in both the clothing and paper industry. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;That [endorsement] might do the best for us,&quot; notes
Casey.&nbsp; In the past, a major concern for the committee was
whether there is a legitimate market for industrial hemp.&nbsp;
Harrelson's announcement demonstrates that there are buyers
willing and waiting, the senator states. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If Casey's legislation is approved by the 7-member Senate
Agriculture Committee, the bill will then move on to the Senate
floor for a vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on this bill, please contact either
Colorado State Senator Lloyd Casey @ (303) 866-4865 or the

<p align="center"><b>Circuit Court Ruling Allows For Religious
Defense In Marijuana Cases</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 2, 1995, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Rastafarians can defend themselves against charges of marijuana
possession on religious grounds, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals has ruled. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the three
judge appeals panel overturned the lower court convictions of
three individuals charged with possessing marijuana.&nbsp; The
Circuit Court ruled that a Montana District Court Judge had
violated the act by failing to allow the Rastafarian defendants
to present evidence demonstrating marijuana's sacred role in
their religion.&nbsp; However, the Court upheld additional drug
convictions against the defendants. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The court's decision to negate the marijuana possession
charges against these defendants is a significant ruling,&quot;
stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;To the best of <b>NORML</b>'s knowledge, this decision is
the first time that a marijuana conviction has been overturned on
the basis of freedom of religion.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 strengthened
protections for religious groups and was intended to curb
criminal prosecutions that interfere with religious
beliefs.&nbsp; The act requires the government to show a
compelling interest for any prosecution that significantly
hinders the exercise of religious freedom. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Under RFRA, ... the government had the obligation, first,
to show that the application of the marijuana laws to the
defendants was in furtherance of a compelling governmental
interest and, second, to show that the application of these laws
to these defendants was the least restrictive means of furthering
that compelling governmental interest,&quot; Judge John Noonan
wrote for the court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, the court maintained that the government could
challenge the defendant's claims that they were, in fact,
Rastafarians. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The government should be free to cross-examine [the defendants]
on whether they ... are Rastafarians and to introduce evidence
negating their assented claims,&quot; added Judge Noonan.&nbsp;
&quot;It is not enough in order to enjoy the protections of the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act to claim the name of religion
as a protective cloak.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>
@ (202) 483-5500.&nbsp; A copy of the decision is currently
available on the Internet at the following address: </i><a
href="http://www.law.vill.edu/Fed-Ct/Circuit/9th/opinions/9430073.htm"><i>http://www.law.vill.edu/Fed-Ct/Circuit/9th/opinions/9430073.htm</i></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>Iowa Supreme Court &quot;Just Says No&quot;
To Controversial License Suspension Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>February 1996, Des Moines, IA:</b>&nbsp;
Iowa's federally mandated &quot;smoke a joint, lose your license
law&quot; has been ruled unconstitutional by the State Supreme
Court.&nbsp; As a result, hundreds of convicted drug offenders,
many found guilty of simple marijuana possession, will have their
driving privileges restored.&nbsp; In addition, the state stands
to lose more than $16 million annually in federal highway aid. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With its recent <a href="../LAWS/dressler.html">decision</a>, the
court nullified a 1993 state law that imposes an automatic six-month
driver's license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related.&nbsp;
According to the court, the license suspension constituted
&quot;double jeopardy&quot; because it was a second punishment
for a single criminal action.&nbsp; &quot;There [is] no direct connection
between possession of controlled substances, driving, and public
safety,&quot; wrote the court.&nbsp; &quot;The amended statute
authorizing this license revocation was aimed essentially at
enhancing punishment for controlled substance possession.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Iowa Department of Transportation estimates that nearly 8,500
people had been subject to license suspension since the law took
effect two years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's the first step in the right direction of common
sense,&quot; said Attorney Jeff Crispin of Des Moines.&nbsp;
&quot;There's no logical connection between these drug offenses
and driving privileges.&nbsp; It doesn't make sense to have these
penalties.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the recent decision, transportation officials have
decided against expunging drug-related suspensions from the
driving records of those who have already completed them. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Patients To Rally On State
Capitol Steps</b> </p>

Persons who are living with AIDS and cancer from the Sacramento
County area and beyond will be rallying on the West Steps of the
California State Capitol Building Saturday, February 17 at 2:00
to show their support for medical marijuana.&nbsp; Sacramento
County Director of Californians for Compassionate Use, Ryan
Landers, will present state lawmakers with signatures gathered in
Sacramento during the first half of the statewide effort to
qualify the &quot;Compassionate Use Act of 1996&quot; for
inclusion in the 1996 election ballot and demonstrators will be
conducting an all day sign-up drive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana proponents need to gather 600,000 signatures
from registered voters by April 20 in order to put the Initiative
on the ballot for the 1996 election.&nbsp; To date, the all
volunteer drive has amassed approximately 125,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's Medical Marijuana Initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation that would
allow for the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; If the initiative
is passed by California voters this fall, the bill will become
law immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The [Medical Marijuana] Initiative will simply set the
record and allow patients and their doctors to use marijuana
medicinally in California free of the stigmas and terror they
have come to accept,&quot; explained Dennis Peron, statewide

has sent a formal letter and 50-page informative booklet to each
member of the new Republican task force on drugs.&nbsp; The
letter urges the committee to lift the federal government's ban
on medical cannabis and re-examine the decriminalization of
marijuana as a public policy.&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> also asks the
task force to include testimony from medical experts on these

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Enclosures to the letter include endorsements of the potential of
medical marijuana from such well respected organizations as the

Czar.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;General McCaffrey has an impressive record of service to
this country,&quot; says George R. Vickers, Executive Director of

that have had little impact on the supply of illicit drugs coming
to the United States. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Regardless of his personal qualities, McCaffrey's
nomination symbolizes the misguided militarization of U.S. drug
policy,&quot; adds WOLA Senior Associate Colleta Younger,

<p align="center"><b>Circuit Judge's Dissent In Urinalysis Case
Could Spur Supreme Court Review</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 24, 1996, Atlanta, GA:</b>&nbsp; The
11th Circuit Court has ruled that a Georgia law requiring all
political candidates running for state office to undergo drug
screening urinalysis is constitutional, but it is the dissent
that has attorney Walker Chandler talking. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a great decision,&quot; Walker said.&nbsp; &quot;Have
you read the dissent.&nbsp; It hits the nail right on the head.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a scathing 11 page dissent, Circuit Judge Rosemary Barkett
writes, &quot;I do not believe that the suspicionless search in
these circumstances serves any special governmental need beyond
the normal need for law enforcement, and, if it did, I believe
that the candidates' privacy interests outweigh the governmental
interests. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">...We are not merely dealing with the denial of a job
opportunity, but with the denial of opportunity to participate in
our democratic form of government.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Barkett's dissent also calls into question apparent First
Amendment violations posed by the controversial Georgia
law.&nbsp; &quot;The majority maintains that the government's
purpose [in passing this legislation] is not suppression of free
expression.&nbsp; Yet, it supports its holding by citing the importance
of ensuring that elected officials are 'persons appreciative of
the perils of drug use' and 'sympathetic to drug interdiction
efforts.' <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Establishing a certain ideology as a 'qualification' for holding
public office appears to be a content-based restriction on free
expression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Chandler, who filed the action against the Georgia statute and
served as his own legal counsel maintains that he will forgo an
&quot;en banc&quot; review of his case and will attempt to take
his appeal directly to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He intends to
argue that the law violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp; Referring to the Court's
decision last year to uphold the constitutionality of a
Washington state law mandating random and warrantless searches of
high school athletes partly on the notion that school children
live under fewer constitutional protections than adults, Chandler
fires, &quot;The only way the Supreme Court could [then] approve
of Georgia's law is by affirming that all Georgians are
[children.]&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s recently reformed Amicus Curiae Committee is
currently reviewing the 11th Circuit Court decision and will
consider filing an amicus brief if the Supreme Court decides to
hear the case. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Activists Intending To Sell Marijuana At The
Super Bowl Gain National Exposure</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 14, 1995, Tempe, AZ:</b>&nbsp; The
rumor that marijuana will be sold openly during this year's Super
Bowl has garnered the attention of the national media in recent
weeks and has even made it to the pages of Time Magazine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Representatives from the Richard M. Davis Cannabis Hemp Co. plan
to be on hand selling marijuana, states the magazine.&nbsp;
&quot;I plan to have a press conference in the parking lot,&quot;
says longtime marijuana activist and R.M. Davis spokesman Ron
Kiczenski, &quot;[I will] tell people where they can buy
[marijuana] in the vicinity of the Super Bowl.&nbsp; Not within
the secured zone you have to get a special venue license for, but
outside of that zone.&nbsp; They'll be able to buy legal
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Kiczenski and Davis have openly sold marijuana in Arizona
before.&nbsp; Ironically, on one occasion, the activists boldly
set up shop in front of the Arizona State Capitol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The activists latest plan stems from a ruling by Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges
against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence
that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing
his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted
for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the
Arizona Department of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Under Title
42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license
and tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Ron Kiczenski @

<p align="center"><b>Defense Fund Established To Aid Man Charged
With Marijuana Trafficking</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 24, 1996, Oregon, OH:</b>&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>
chapters in Cleveland and Fremont Ohio have united to establish a
defense fund for medical marijuana user Daniel Asbury.&nbsp;
Asbury is a quadriplegic who has been charged with trafficking in
marijuana for growing his own medical cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury suffered a broken neck 15 years ago and began to use
marijuana as a therapeutic after prescription drugs proved to be
ineffective at controlling his pain and muscle spasms.&nbsp;
Marijuana made me &quot;fe[el] like a human being again,&quot; he
said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Asbury was arrested in September of 1995 for growing his own
marijuana to treat his medical condition.&nbsp; Asbury's lawyer,
Terry Lodge of Toledo, Ohio, will invoke &quot;medical
necessity&quot; as the basis for his defense.&nbsp; The trial is
scheduled to begin February 26 at the Lucas County Court House. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The medical necessity defense is expensive and requires expert
testimony to establish the foundation for the defense.&nbsp;
Asbury's legal fees, including the cost of flying in expert
witnesses such as <b>NORML</b> board member Dr. John Morgan, will
total in the thousands of dollars. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b> will forward all moneys received for the Daniel
Asbury Defense Fund to Mid-American Bank in Toledo, Ohio where an
account has been set up to assist Asbury. <br>

<p align="center"><b>National Review Advocates Legalizing Drugs</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 21, 1996:</b>&nbsp; The latest issue
of National Review, a weekly conservative journal headed by
syndicated columnist William F. Buckley, asserts that the
&quot;war on drugs is lost&quot; and recommends that the time has
come to make narcotics legal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 15 page section of the political weekly, Buckley and a
half-dozen other legalization proponents including Mayor Kurt
Schmoke of Baltimore argue that America's &quot;present
prohibitive policy has failed, flatly and without serious
question.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a telephone interview with the San Francisco Chronicle,
Buckley said that he hopes that the attention garnered from
National Review will encourage the thinking community to begin
seriously facing the issue of legalization. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Buckley, who just recently debated DEA head Thomas Constantine on
the January 23 edition of &quot;The Today Show,&quot; intends to
follow up on the subject with three televised debates on his PBS program,

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Supreme Court To Review Double Jeopardy
Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 12, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The United States Supreme Court has agreed to review the case
that has virtually halted civil forfeitures across the country
and resulted in thousands of convicted individuals asking courts
to vacate their convictions. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In <a href="http://www.fear.org/405kpg.html">United States v.
$405,089.23 in U.S. Currency</a>, the Court of Appeals for the
9th Circuit ruled that civil forfeitures constitute punishment
for the purpose of double jeopardy.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, courts
across the country were flooded with petitions from inmates
claiming that they had been punished by civil forfeiture and
demanding that their convictions must be vacated.&nbsp; Consequently,
prosecutors throughout the nation have been besieged with
litigation which requires that they defend cases they thought
they had already won. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Criminal forfeiture statutes allow the government to simply
combine the forfeiture and the criminal prosecution in the same
case.&nbsp; However, civil forfeitures are preferred by the
government because the property owner is presumed guilty and
because prosecutors have the added benefit of impoverishing the
property owner as he or she faces a criminal prosecution.&nbsp;
Should the Supreme Court affirm the 9th Circuit's decision, even
in part, many convictions and civil forfeitures will have to be
undone. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both the government and the property owners urged the Supreme
Court to take this case to resolve a host of issues which have
arisen in the 6 years since the Court ruled in 1989 that civil forfeiture
could be considered punishment for double jeopardy purposes. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on civil forfeiture, please contact
counsel for the property owners: Jeffrey Steinborn (206)

<p align="center"><b>Exiting Drug Czar Takes &quot;Pot&quot; Shot
At New Hemp Shoe</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 13, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The name of Adidas' new hemp-based sneaker has fallen under
staunch criticism from exiting drug czar, Lee Brown.&nbsp; In a
January 5 letter addressed to Adidas America President Steven
Wynne, Brown asserts that the product's brand name -- &quot;The Hemp&quot;
-- was specifically chosen to glorify and capitalize on the drug
culture.&nbsp; &quot;On behalf of the children of
America...,&quot; Brown writes, &quot;I call upon you not to
market [this] shoe.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to the drug czar's sharp reproach, Wynne answers that
the shoe's brand name was chosen simply as a way to call
attention to the industrial material used to construct the
shoe.&nbsp; &quot;Adidas ... is working to produce products that
are environmentally responsible,&quot; responds Wynne.&nbsp;
&quot;One such material is hemp.&nbsp; ...Consistent with this
direction, we have produced a shoe using hemp.&nbsp; ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Furthermore,] products made from fiber hemp, including our
shoes have no drug qualities.&nbsp; I don't believe you will
encounter anyone smoking our shoes anytime soon.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This past Friday, Brown shot off a second letter to Wynne,
chastising the &quot;sarcastic&quot; tone of his previous
response and again repeating his demand that Adidas find another
name for its shoe.&nbsp; &quot;What the shoe is made of is not
the problem,&quot; Brown counters.&nbsp; &quot;The problem is
what you call it.&nbsp; ...I do not think it is in the goal of
curbing drug abuse to imply that drugs are cool.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Adidas spokesman John Fread says the company has not yet decided
whether it will respond to Brown's latest letter.&nbsp; The
controversial Adidas shoe hit stores in December, but has not yet been
publicly advertised. <br>

Students</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 12, 1996, Fort Myers, FL:</b>&nbsp;
The Lee County school board is considering whether to impose
random drug tests on its entire upper level student body as a way
to deter teen drug use.&nbsp; The proposed tests would be given
regardless of reasonable suspicion and would extend to all students
in middle and high school.&nbsp; School board members intend to
decide on the issue before the next school year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think there is a [drug] problem,&quot; board member Pat
Riley told the Fort Myers News Press.&nbsp; &quot;When I mention
it to students, they jokingly say: 'There goes the whole

that's funny. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Lee County school officials note that the schools already undergo
random searches by drug dogs of students' lockers, although few

Army Lt. Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey is a leading contender to be the
nation's next drug czar, reports a recent story in The Washington
Post. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Post article quotes an unnamed senior administration official
who said McCaffrey is &quot;looking good&quot; for the
position.&nbsp; McCaffrey is one of the country's most decorated
generals and in the past has taken a hard-line stance against
drugs.&nbsp; He recently criticized the United States' current drug
interdiction efforts during a public forum at the Heritage
Foundation, a Washington DC Republican think-tank. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many political analysts speculate that appointing a tough,
no-nonsense military figure to head the federal &quot;war on
drugs&quot; would be a wise strategic move for the Clinton
administration, which has often been criticized for appearing
&quot;soft&quot; on the illegal drug issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If McCaffrey is selected for the position, he would be the

<p align="center"><b>Canadian Hemp Activist, Businessman Busted
By Vancouver Police</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 4, Vancouver, Canada:</b>&nbsp; Police
have raided the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp
BC</a> store in Vancouver, British Columbia, and are charging the
store's owner, vocal hemp activist Marc Emery, and three employees
with selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp; Emery had been selling
marijuana seeds, along with hemp products and literature, from
his retail store for the last 19 months in open defiance of the
law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emery was recently featured in a front page article of the Wall
Street Journal where he boasted to have sold &quot;130,000
seeds&quot; this year alone. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The raid took place at approximately 1 p.m. and law enforcement
officials seized seeds and drug paraphernalia such as pipes,
bongs, and mushroom grow kits.&nbsp; A large Budget Rent-a-truck was
parked outside to help the police move Hemp BC's wide assortment
of products.&nbsp; Emery and three employees were taken away in
handcuffs and all four activists are being charged with trafficking
marijuana seeds and selling instruments and paraphernalia for
illicit drug use.&nbsp; If found guilty of both charges, all four
could face each life imprisonment and fines of $100,000. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Police Constable Anne Drennan states that the <a
href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> bust is
the first time in Vancouver history that trafficking charges have
been filed against individuals for selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp; Drennan
further added that she expects Emery -- a self-proclaimed
libertarian who has previously served time in jail for opening
his bookstore on Sunday in disobedience of Ontario's blue laws --
to conduct a very public court challenge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Emery and the three <a
href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> employees
were released Friday on their own recognizance.&nbsp; A
preliminary hearing has been set for February 8, 1996. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dana Larsen, editor of the magazine <i>Cannabis Canada</i>,
reports that the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp
BC</a> retail storefront continues to remain open for business in
spite of last Thursday's raid.&nbsp; &quot;We will be selling pipes,
bongs, and seeds as per usual, although we might be understocked
for a day or two,&quot; he says. <br>

<p align="center"><b>American Farm Bureau Supports Industrial
Hemp Research</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 11, 1995, Reno, Nevada:</b>&nbsp; The
American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest farming organization
in the United States, passed a resolution at its annual
convention calling for research that could lead to the
re-introduction of hemp into the American farm economy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The resolution, adopted by a unanimous vote of the 51 state
presidents and all 300 voting delegates, reads: &quot;We
recommend that [the] American Farm Bureau Federation encourage research
into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp
production in the United States.&nbsp; We further recommend that
such research includes planting test plots in the United States using
modern agricultural techniques.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces
marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has
only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric
properties.&nbsp; Industrial hemp is currently grown legally
throughout much of Europe and Asia and is being cultivated in
test plots in Australia and Canada. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Andrew Graves, incoming president of the Fayette County chapter
of the Kentucky Farm Bureau and vice-president of the Kentucky
Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, introduced the resolution
at the convention.&nbsp; &quot;What we are asking for is research
to determine whether industrial hemp can once again become a
profitable agricultural commodity for American farmers just as it
is for farmers around the world,&quot; Graves said in his
presentation.&nbsp; &quot;Where would agriculture be without
research?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a separate resolution, the AFB also voted to affirm its policy
in support of government efforts to eradicate illegal drugs,
including marijuana. <br>

Protest Rally</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 3, 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; In
response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston
radio station WBCN to the protest the airplay of the NORML

U.S. Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has issued a letter to
Attorney General Janet Reno both condemning the actions of rally
organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting
an inquiry into whether federal law enforcement officials were
involved. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Like many others who have voiced their disapproval over the
actions of the G.A.A.D. (i.e., National Writers Union, Boston
Coalition for Freedom of Expression, Mass/Cann, etc.), Frank is highly
critical of the actions of a Drug Enforcement Administration
official who allegedly took an active role in the protest.&nbsp;
&quot;It does not seem to me at all appropriate for a federal law
enforcement agent to accompany an individual [G.A.A.D. Executive
Director Georgette Watson] who is making a demand that a media
outlet cease broadcasting a particular album, no matter how ...
ill-advised you, I and the DEA might find it to be,&quot; Frank
writes.&nbsp; &quot;This [sort of conduct] puts the federal government
in the position of lending official support to an interference
with freedom of expression. ...&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Therefore,] if in fact a DEA agent accompanied Ms. Watson
and lent support by his ... presence to her demand that the radio
station stop playing [the <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>] CD,
[then] that is a wholly inappropriate action for a federal law

bipartisan committee, Council on Crime in America, held a press

Drug Czar William Bennett and former U.S. Attorney General

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee's first report is &quot;descriptive&quot; rather

America,&quot; says Bennett. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Future reports and conferences will be aimed at addressing

the bipartisan commission intends to address is the notion that
America's current criminal justice system is simply a

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Activists Sue Prosecutors:&nbsp;
Hemp Proponents Claim Unlawful, Selective Prosecution In Hemp
Seed Case</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 28, Hilo, Hawaii:</b>&nbsp; Longtime
hemp activists Roger Christie and Aaron Anderson have filed a
civil lawsuit against Hawaii County prosecutor Jay Kimura and
Deputy Prosecutor Kay Iopa alleging that they were unlawfully and
selectively prosecuted for expressing their opinions regarding
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Christie and Anderson's suit maintains that the two were
selectively prosecuted by Iopa in 1992 for possessing apparently
sterile hemp seeds.&nbsp; The seeds had been imported from China
as birdseed in compliance with both state and federal laws.&nbsp;
Charges of &quot;commercial promotion of marijuana&quot; against Christie
were dismissed earlier this year, but the case against Anderson
is still pending. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The duo's lawsuit asserts that they were singled out primarily
for their outspoken beliefs regarding the positive uses for
hemp.&nbsp; Christie and Anderson note that while similar hemp
seeds are available and commonly sold in stores in Hawaii, they
were the only individuals targeted by prosecutors. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, the suit alleges that prosecutors violated
Christie's and Anderson's constitutional rights to &quot;freely
speak, petition their government, and be free from unjust
government oppression.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The suit also alleges that Iopa misrepresented the facts against
Christie and Anderson.&nbsp; In 1992, police sent 800 seeds to
the state Department of Agriculture for germination tests.&nbsp;
According to Christie and Anderson, the report said that there
was zero germination.&nbsp; However, the activists maintain that
Iopa told the county grand jury, the Circuit Court, and the
Hawaii Supreme Court that 6 to 9 percent of the seeds germinated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Our lawsuit underscores the new energy in the hemp
movement,&quot; states Christie.&nbsp; &quot;We seek to make this
the last marijuana trial in Hawaii.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Christie and Anderson are seeking $3 million in damages. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on Christie and Anderson's lawsuit,

<p align="center"><b>Canada Set To Lessen Pot Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 1, Toronto, Canada:</b>&nbsp; A bill
that will revamp the way Canada deals with marijuana has passed
Parliament and is now in its final stages of becoming law.&nbsp;
Among the reforms included in the bill are a relaxing of the penalties
associated with the possession of small amounts of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;People charged with possession of less than 30 grams of
marijuana or one gram of hash or hash oil will no longer be
fingerprinted and they will have no criminal record,&quot; says
Steve Jeffrey, a spokesman for Canada's Health Ministry.&nbsp;
&quot;[However,] possession of the drug [will still] remain a crime,&quot;
he warns. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">That aspect of bill C-7 troubles <a
href="http://www.calyx.com/~normlca/">NORML Canada</a> President
Umberto Iorfida. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[The law] almost doesn't mean anything to me if you still
have to appear in court,&quot; he says.&nbsp; Other less critical
proponents of the bill view C-7 as striking a necessary balance
between a liberalizing public attitude toward the drug and the
fears of anti-drug groups and law enforcement. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Among the new marijuana sanctions proposed by the pending
legislation are community service or payment of a fine.&nbsp;
Revenue raised through marijuana possession fines will be used to
support marijuana related medical treatment programs and/or
rehabilitation programs, notes Iorfida. <br>

<p align="center"><b>NORML Establishes Amicus Curiae Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In an effort to establish <b>NORML</b> as a more
serious participant in the national debate over drug policy, <b>NORML</b>
has re-established an amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the
court&quot;) committee to offer legal assistance in important marijuana
related legal issues.&nbsp; The committee will be co-chaired by <b>NORML</b> Legal
Committee members Michael D. Cutler, Esq. of Boston,
Massachusetts and C. Rabon Martin, Esq. of Tulsa, Oklahoma. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;An active <b>NORML</b> Amicus Committee will provide an
avenue for <b>NORML</b> to once again add its organizational
voice to some of the important legal issues of the day,&quot;
says <b>NORML</b> Executive Director Keith Stroup, Esq.&nbsp; &quot;The
committee will review requests that come into the national office
for amicus assistance and will file an amicus brief with the
court in the appropriate cases.&quot;&nbsp; Many policy groups
file amicus briefs in important and controversial legal cases as
way to assist the court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The first case before the new committee is a marijuana
cultivation case involving the question of whether dead marijuana
plants count as plants (with an assigned weight) or as actual
marijuana (measured by actual weight).&nbsp; The case (U.S. v
Shields) is currently on appeal before the 11th Circuit.&nbsp;
The committee further intends on filing a second brief in the
case of Seeley v Washington.&nbsp; Defendant Ralph Seeley earlier
won a declaratory judgment ruling that the state's ban on medical marijuana
was unconstitutional.&nbsp; The case is now going before the
Washington State Supreme Court. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Indiana Supreme Court Rules On
Constitutionality Of Illegal Drug Excise Tax</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 27, Indianapolis, Indiana:</b>&nbsp;
The Indiana Supreme Court has ruled that the state cannot tax
illegal drugs and prosecute their owners too.&nbsp; In the
written opinion of the court, Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard
maintained that to apply both civil and criminal penalties to
drug cases would be a violation of the constitutional protections
against double jeopardy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, the high court also added that the assessment of the tax
is a valid punishment when it is the &quot;first jeopardy&quot;
-- that is, if it precedes criminal proceedings. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responses to the ruling are widespread and some legal scholars
are critical that the ruling will allow certain defendants to
&quot;buy&quot; their way out of criminal sanctions.&nbsp; Citing
the court's suggestion that Revenue Department officials could
consult with prosecutors to determine which action to take,
Attorney Andrew Maternowski of Indianapolis worries that the
state's particular punishment could depend on the defendant's
financial standing.&nbsp; &quot;If you don't have money, you go
to prison,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Others feel that the ruling will encourage the state legislature
to abolish the excise tax. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A similar &quot;double jeopardy&quot; ruling was recently issued
in an Arizona trial court.&nbsp; In that decision, a Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge dismissed marijuana charges against <a
href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">Arizona NORML</a> Chairman
Peter Wilson because he had previously paid the state tax on
cannabis.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Despite &quot;Colorful&quot; Side Effects<br>
FDA Panel Gives Thumbs Up To New Anti-Glaucoma Drug</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A Food and Drug Administration panel has approved
a new type of anti-glaucoma drug even though it has the startling
side effect of turning blue eyes brown.&nbsp; &quot;This could
turn out to be a major public health hazard for glaucoma
patients,&quot; noted Dr. Alexander Buckner of the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;
The panel voted 4-2 to approve the new drug. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">National statistics indicate that glaucoma effects some 980,000
Americans a year.&nbsp; Standard therapy in the treatment of
glaucoma is the drug Timolol; however, physicians state that the
drug has numerous side effects ranging from breathing problems to
irregular heartbeats. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Medical marijuana proponents argue that the use of cannabis is an
effective treatment in lowering inter-ocular pressure in
individuals who suffer from open-angle glaucoma.&nbsp; Advocates state
that cannabis is both more effective and safer than other
conventional treatments. <br>

<p align="center"><b>USDA Issues &quot;White&quot; Paper On
Industrial Hemp: Report Concedes That American Hemp Cultivation
Isn't Likely Any Time Soon</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A recently released USDA &quot;white&quot; paper
indicates that the federal agency is currently exploring the
possibility of domestic hemp cultivation.&nbsp; The report notes
that a number of U.S. states reliant on the revenue raised
through tobacco farming have shown an interest in the possibility
of cultivating hemp as a way to compensate for slumping tobacco
sales.&nbsp; However, the report's conclusions demonstrate that
in spite of worldwide trends and renewed domestic interest in
hemp production, large-scale hemp cultivation will not begin in
the United States any time soon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the report, the USDA insists that, &quot;Production
and processing trials [are] needed to establish the economic
viability of industrial hemp production [within the United
States.]&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the report further notes that
neither can be permitted because &quot;legal issues currently preclude
[this] research&quot; from taking place.&nbsp; In sum the USDA
maintains that they cannot endorse the domestic production of
industrial hemp until field tests are conducted while
simultaneously noting that the DEA refuses to allow any actual
tests to take place. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, the report states that the DEA remains &quot;opposed to
any consideration of hemp as a legitimate fiber or pulp
product.&quot;&nbsp; The DEA justifies this position, not on the
basis of any agricultural or economic evidence, but on &quot;the
perception that industrial hemp advocates have a hidden agenda of
favoring the legalization of marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; The report
further notes that current policy dictates &quot;that the White
House Drug Enforcement Office should be contact[ed] before USDA
staff attend meetings on industrial hemp or get involved with
research programs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In essence, the federal government is allowing our nation's
policy toward an agricultural endeavor be determined -- not by an
agricultural agency -- but rather, by an anti-narcotics agency that
bases its reasoning upon the preconceived notion that any
advocacy of industrial hemp is also an endorsement of the
legalization of marijuana,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;For the American farmers
and businessmen who could potentially benefit from this growing
worldwide industry, the U.S. government's bias is unsupported and
truly shameful.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>An in depth look at the USDA report will be featured in the
forthcoming issue of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>'s Ongoing
Briefing.&nbsp; Copies of the 7 page report entitled
&quot;Industrial Hemp and other Alternative Crops for small-scale
Tobacco Producers,&quot; are presently available from </i><a

The sixth annual Florida Hempfest was marred by a greater police
presence than ever before and a record number of arrests --
including that of marijuana activist and legal medical marijuana
user, Elvy Musikka.&nbsp; Musikka, who is supplied by the federal
government with a monthly prescription of marijuana cigarettes to
treat her glaucoma, was dragged off the stage arm-and-arm by two
police officers after lighting one of her prescription &quot;joints&quot;
on stage. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Musikka was initially charged with possession of cannabis and
disorderly conduct.&nbsp; Her lawyer, Gary Wainwright, later
announced that the rally's organizers would take legal action
against the city for false arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hempfest organizer, Kevin Aplin, noted that the police presence
at the event was both threatening and excessive.&nbsp; &quot;I'm
sure the police intimidation discouraged some people from coming out,&quot;
he told <i>The Gainesville Sun</i>.&nbsp; Longtime hemp activist,
Jack Herer, also stated that he felt the behavior of the
Gainesville police officers was the worst that he had ever seen
at an event. <br>

State Senator John Moseley has pre-filed a bill (Senate Bill 573)
for the 1996 session of the Missouri General Assembly that would
provide certain marijuana users with a medical necessity
defense.&nbsp; Sen Moseley is the former President of the
Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill states that &quot;no criminal or civil penalty shall
apply to any person for the act of possessing marijuana provided
that ... a [physician] certifies in writing that the person is
under professional care ... [and] ... needs marijuana as part of
a therapeutic regimen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Attorney Dan Viets, President of Missiouri NORML, views Moseley's
bill as a step in right direction and does not forsee significant
political opposition.&nbsp; &quot;Given the fact our legislature overwhelming
supported a resolution to end the federal prohibition of
marijuana as a medicine in 1994, we feel that Moseley's bill has
an excellent chance of passing in the Missouri General Assembly,&quot;

Shirts That Parodied DARE Logo</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 8, 1995, Pomona, California:</b>&nbsp;
The Los Angeles County District AttorneyÍs office dropped
charges against store-owner Mark Hornaday for selling T-shirts
parodying the DARE logo.&nbsp; Hornaday had been cited on a
complaint by DARE America for selling shirts bearing the DARE
logo with the statement: &quot;I turned in my parents and all I
got was this lousy T-shirt.&quot;&nbsp; He was charged under a
rarely used criminal law forbidding the counterfeiting of
copyrighted logos.&nbsp; Hornaday's T-shirts were also
confiscated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday was defended by <b>NORML</b> Legal Committee member
William Panzer, who argued that the law was unconstitutionally
broad in failing to distinguish between legitimate free speech
and intentionally deceptive marketing practices intending to
mislead customers.&nbsp; &quot;No one was going to think those
were really DARE T-shirts,&quot; argued Panzer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Pomona assistant district attorney Richard Jenkins said that he
chose to dismiss the case because &quot;the people from DARE
would prefer that the [trade]mark be protected by a civil
action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Since when does DARE call the shots at the DA's
office?&quot; Panzer replied sarcastically. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hornaday faced a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $5,000
fine on four separate counts if convicted.&nbsp; It is unclear
whether DARE America intends to press further, civil litigation

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 13, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Pronouncing the current administration's anti-drug policy to be
&quot;in utter disarray&quot; and citing recent findings that
indicate 48 percent of the high school class of 1995 has tried an
illegal drug, House and Senate Republicans have organized an
eighteen man task force to examine the drug issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's time to get tough with this stuff,&quot; said task
force co-chair, Orrin Hatch (R-UT).&nbsp; Hatch criticized the
nation's current anti-drug strategies as not focusing enough on
interdiction and law enforcement.&nbsp; The task force announced
that it will issue a report in March. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recent studies demonstrate that drug use among high school
seniors is steadily climbing upward.&nbsp; The annual University
of Michigan study discovered that teen drug use rose for the
third year in a row, but cautioned that America's current
adolescent use rates still remain far below the peak period of
the late 1970s and early 1980s. <br>

liberties proponents are claiming victory following an Illinois
Supreme Court decision to uphold a Champaign County Judge's
ruling that the police acted illegally by searching the bag of a
Greyhound Bus passenger. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Judge Harold Jensen granted a motion to suppress in the case of
Greyhound passenger Tim Besser.&nbsp; Besser was faced with drug
charges after a police search of bus passengers and their luggage
revealed Besser's suitcase to contain marijuana.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At the hearing, officers testified that they boarded the bus as
it pulled into the Urbana Station at 2:50 a.m.&nbsp; One officer
and his dog searched the luggage compartment and two other
officers questioned the bus passengers, ordering each to identify
their luggage.&nbsp; During the course of the trial, police
conceded that there was nothing suspicious about the bus or any
of its passengers.&nbsp; One officer further testified that he
knew the bus schedule by heart and added that such suspicionless
searches of busses were routine police procedure. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Consequently, by boarding the bus and detaining the passengers
without probable cause, the court ruled that Besser had been
unlawfully seized and searched.&nbsp; &quot;That kind of random
police work is a little offensive to me,&quot; Judge Jensen
remarked. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 7, 1995, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
In a unanimous decision that may open the door for the appeals of
hundreds of firearm convictions, the Supreme Court unanimously
ruled that a federal law mandating drug traffickers to receive an
additional five years in prison for using a firearm can only be
invoked when the defendant actively employs the weapon. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The decision struck down the convictions in two District cases in
which firearms were present but locked away during drug
dealing.&nbsp; In one incident, police discovered a pistol inside
a bag in a car trunk following a traffic stop that revealed 27
bags of cocaine.&nbsp; In the second case, an unloaded derringer
was discovered locked in a trunk of the defendant's bedroom
closet.&nbsp; The defendant had earlier sold crack cocaine to an
undercover officer in her apartment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Prior to the Court's ruling, many circuits courts had been
divided on how much &quot;use&quot; of a firearm is necessary to
invoke the additional mandatory minimum.&nbsp; A prior D.C.
Circuit of Appeals ruling stated that as long as the weapon is in
close proximity to the drugs or drug proceeds and is accessible,
the stiffer punishment could apply. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, after reviewing the law's language, the Supreme court
concluded that prosecutors must show active employment of the
firearm.&nbsp; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The definition of &quot;use&quot; said Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor &quot;is of such breadth that no role remains
for 'carry,&quot; which is also included in the statute.&nbsp;
&quot;Use&quot; does not include the mere placement of a gun
nearby for protection, she concluded.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Leaves Post</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton accepted &quot;with regret&quot; the resignation
of Dr. Lee Brown as head of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy.&nbsp; A spokesman for the administration
says that a search for a successor is underway and maintained that
the President is as committed as ever to the battle against drug
abuse.&nbsp; &quot;[The war on drugs] will never be over until
every child in America knows that drug use is dangerous, illegal
and wrong,&quot; the President said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown is leaving his post as Drug Czar to take a teaching job at
Rice University in Houston.</p>

<p align="center"><b>(Meanwhile) Gallup Poll Indicates That
Americans Are Very Concerned About Illegal Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>December 12, 1995, Miami, FL:</b>&nbsp;
Americans rate the use of illegal drugs as one of the nation's
greatest crises, second only to violent crime, indicates a Gallup
poll released this past Tuesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to results from the 1995 poll, 88 percent of the
nation's adults view illegal drugs as a serious problem --
ranking it ahead of such issues as the federal budget deficit and
health care costs.&nbsp; The survey also indicated that 93
percent of respondents favored more anti-drug education in public
schools and 85 percent opposed the idea of legalizing drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">White House Drug Czar Lee Brown, speaking at a conference in
Miami, commented that the results of the poll further
re-emphasize the need for a high-profile, well-funded national
drug control strategy.</p>

this past November urging lawmakers to make marijuana legally

Mark: FBI Data Confirms Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Tougher
Than Bush's</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">An estimated 481,098 total marijuana arrests were
made by state and local law enforcement during the year 1994,
according to the latest edition of the FBI's Uniform Crime
Report.&nbsp; This figure is a 26 percent increase over last
year's total and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests
under the Clinton administration to a staggering 861,788. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Of the 481,098 arrests made for marijuana in 1994, approximately
83.7 percent (402,717) were for simple
&quot;possession.&quot;&nbsp; The remaining 16.3 percent (78,381
arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot; a category that
includes all cultivation offenses -- even those where the marijuana
was being grown for personal use. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">&quot;This data confirms that the federal government's war on
marijuana consumers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These new FBI statistics
indicate that one marijuana user is arrested eveiy 65 seconds in America.&nbsp;
Not surprisingly, those individuals who possess marijuana are
being hardest hit.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's two year
average of total marijuana arrests (430,894 arrests per year) is
27 percent higher than the average number of yearly arrests under
the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp; &quot;The fact that
studies indicate adolescent use rates for marijuana are rising at
the same time that law enforcement is arresting record numbers of
users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s long-held belief that marijuana
prohibition is not an effective deterrent to marijuana
consumption,&quot; remarks St. Pierre. <br>

Nation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>December 4, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
The nation's prison population experienced its largest 1 year
increase ever bringing America's inmate population to a record
total of more than 1.1 million.&nbsp; With this total, the United
States now surpasses Russia to claim the unenviable crown of having
incarcerated a greater share of its residents than any other
nation. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Since 1980, America's prison population has risen by over 300
percent.&nbsp; This dramatic increase is due mainly to the impact
of the &quot;war on drugs&quot; and stiff mandatory
sentences.&nbsp; According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
drug offenders now constitute nearly two-thirds of all federal
prisoners and approximately one-quarter of all state prisoners.</p>

To Purchase Legal Tax Stamps</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>December 5, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
Following a recent Arizona court decision that rules a citizen
may legally possess and sell cannabis in Arizona if they possess
the proper state license and tax stamps to do so, marijuana
activists have been swarming to the state. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to reports from representatives of <a
href="http://www.amug.org/~az4norml/">AZ4NORML</a>, some
activists have even taken to openly selling marijuana in front of
the Arizona State Capital.&nbsp; Rich Davis, longtime hemp
activist and curator of the mobile USA Hemp Museum, recently sold
one gram bags of marijuana out in front of the Department of
Revenue in plain view of both capital and state police
officers.&nbsp; No arrests were made. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">A second well known activist, Ron Kiczenski, reports that he
intends to open America's first ever marijuana store.&nbsp;
&quot;This will be the first legal marijuana cigarette
company,&quot; he told <i>The Associated Press</i>.&nbsp;
&quot;It's legal to buy marijuana from anyone in the state.&nbsp;
You just have to pay the state tax within 24 hours of the
sale.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">The recent goings-on in Arizona stem from a ruling by Northwest
Phoenix Justice Court Judge John Barclay that dismissed charges
against Arizona NORML Chairman Peter Wilson because of evidence
that he is licensed by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Basing
his decision on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be prosecuted
for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has paid to the
Arizona Depantnient of Revenue to sell cannabis.&nbsp; Under
Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both a license
and tax stamps to possess and sell marijuana. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">State lawmakers contend that the legislation was intended solely
as a way to punish drug traffickers, not to legalize cannabis in
the state of Arizona.&nbsp; &quot;We're confident that [Judge
Barclay's] decision will be overturned,&quot; states Barnett
Lotstein, a special assistant with the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.&nbsp; &quot;In the event it isn't, I'm sure the
Legislature would remedy that post haste.&quot; <br>

CD Escalates: Massachusetts Anti-Drug Group Organizes Rally
Against Radio Station WBCN Boston</b> </p>

<p align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50"><b>Boston, Massachusetts, December 1, 1995:</b>&nbsp;
The Massachusetts based anti-drug group, Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA
and local law-enforcement, organized a protest outside the
offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of the station
&quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b> benefit CD, <a
href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">Alleging that <b>NORML</b> is poised to make &quot;millions&quot;
from the sale of the CD and further stating that &quot;WBCN is an
active participant of the pro-marijuana legalization effort in
Massachusetts,&quot; the G.A.A.D. issued a fax release
encouraging local law enforcement to attend the rally and
&quot;bring [their] squad car[s.]&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">According to representatives from Mass/Cann NORML, about 15
protesters showed up at the gathering and a report of the event
was broadcast on WCVB-TV Channel 3 News.&nbsp; Attendees were
shown carrying signs with slogans such as &quot;WBCN is bringing
the country to its knees&quot; and &quot;WBCN: Broadcasting
Capitalists for NORML.&quot;&nbsp; G.A.A.D. Executive Director
Georgette Wilson and Boston liaison for the Drug Enforcemant
Administration, Steve Morreale, were filmed entering WBCN's
offices as &quot;they went in to make their case to station
officials.&quot; <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">WBCN reported to WCVB-TV that the station will continue to play
music off the <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
CD.&nbsp; Later, in an MTV NEWS interview which aired December 6
and 7, WBCN's program director commented that: &quot;Music
shouldn't be blamed for social phenomena.&nbsp; Musicians have
the same right to free expression as other Americans.&quot;&nbsp;
The radio station offered Wilson an opportunity to air her
concerns over <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">HEMPILATION</a>
on WBCN's public forum show, but Wilson refused their invitation. <br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="50">In response to the action taken by the Governor's Alliance
Against Drugs against WBCN, Mass/Cann NORML is considering taking
legal action against the federal prohibitionist groups involved
in the protest.&nbsp; &quot;These government sponsored and
organized activities are designed to coerce, threaten,
intimidate, and damage WBCN-FM so that they [will] abandon their
association with Mass/Cann NORML,&quot; alleges President <a

duck.&nbsp; Like footballs, however, it bounces back.&nbsp;
Sooner or later politicians will have to stop running scared and
address the evidence: cannabis per se is not a hazard to society
but driving it further underground may well be.&quot; <br>

<p align="center">November 16, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Judge Dismisses Drug Charges Against
State &quot;Licensed&quot; Marijuana Dealer:<br>
Court Rules Marijuana Tax Stamps To Be Double Jeopardy</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 1, 1995, Phoenix, AZ:</strong>&nbsp; In a
ruling whose implications have been described as &quot;staggering,&quot;
a Phoenix court has dismissed charges against Arizona NORML
Chairman, Peter Wilson, because of evidence that he is licensed
by the state to sell marijuana.&nbsp; Wilson was charged with
possession of marijuana after police confiscated a bag of
marijuana at his home on August 22. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Basing his ruling on constitutional prohibitions against double
jeopardy, Judge John Barclay concluded that Wilson could not be
prosecuted for possession of marijuana because of taxes he has
paid to the Arizona Department of Review to sell cannabis.&nbsp;
Under Title 42 of a 1983 law, Arizona residents can purchase both
a license and tax stamps ($10 per ounce) to legally possess and
sell marijuana.&nbsp; Wilson possessed both a license and over
$200 dollars worth of stamps at the time of his arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Noting that the creation of Title 42 creates a &quot;confusing
paradox,&quot; Judge Barclay ruled that &quot;the facts in this
case prohibit prosecution for the possession of marijuana because
the tax imposed prior to the prosecution served a punitive
purpose.&quot;&nbsp; The Fifth Amendment strictly prohibits
citizens from being punished more than once for the same offense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Bill Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office, says that the state intends to appeal the ruling. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the meantime, Wilson is encouraging the Arizona cannabis
community to contact the Department of Revenue and -- as quickly
as possible -- acquire the &quot;trinity:&quot; a marijuana
license, stamps, and a copy of Judge Barclay's decision.&nbsp;
&quot;The police should then say to you something like, 'Well,
sir, I see [that] you are lawfully in possession of
marijuana.&nbsp; Have a good day.'&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><em>For more information, please contact Peter Wilson of AZ4NORML
@ (602) 861-0855.&nbsp; To acquire a copy of Judge Barclay's
decision, please contact the Northwest Phoenix Justice Court @

Arizona vs Peter Banker Wilson).</em></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Massachusetts Governor Refuses To Sign
Medical Marijuana Necessity Defense Act</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 10, 1995, Massachusetts:</strong>&nbsp;
Governor William Weld has refused to sign legislation that would
allow for defendants facing charges of marijuana possession to
argue that they use the drug as a medicine.&nbsp; Weld returned
the bill (H 2170 aka the Joe Hutchins Act) back to the Legislature
requesting that lawmakers tighten the bill's language. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to press reports, Weld balked at the bill because he
felt that, as written, the legislation &quot;would in all
likelihood lead to inappropriate assertions of the
defense.&quot;&nbsp; Weld also notes that the bill would allow a
defendant to take a &quot;self-diagnosis approach.&quot;&nbsp;
Weld suggested amending the bill to require that the defendant
must be certified to participate in a therapeutic research
program and possess the marijuana for personal use as a result of
that program. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Patricia D. Jehlen (D-Somerville), the bill's sponsor, was
shocked by the governor's actions.&nbsp; Jehlen claimed that
House members have worked closely with Weld's staff and did not anticipate
the governor's recent concerns over defendants misusing the
defense.&nbsp; &quot;We [already] have language to address that
[problem,]&quot; Jehlen said.&nbsp; &quot;All my original bill
would've done is let people who are suffering tell the jury why
they were smoking marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Moreover, backers of H 2170 claim that Weld's amended language
for the bill is nothing more than an empty gesture.&nbsp; There
exists no such state research program, proponents for the bill
note, and even if there was, the government no longer makes the
drug available for medical research.&nbsp; In short,
&quot;[Weld's] amendment means that there is no bill,&quot;
Jehlen said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, eight Americans receive marijuana from the federal
government as part of the Compassionate Investigative New Drug
(IND) program.&nbsp; This program was closed to new applicants in
1992 and it remains in operation only for the eight surviving
previously-approved recipients. <br>

<p align="center"><strong>ACLU Poll Demonstrates That Americans
Clearly Support Medical Marijuana</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 9, 1995:</strong>&nbsp; Preliminary findings
from a recent study conducted by the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) demonstrate that the legalization of marijuana for
medical use is favored by a clear majority of American voters. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The poll notes that 79 percent of Americans thought it would be a
&quot;good idea&quot; to allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for
medical purposes.&nbsp; Eighty five percent of the respondents
said that they would &quot;favor&quot; making marijuana legally
available for medical uses where it has been proven effective for
treating a problem. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ACLU study also reports that Americans tend to separate their
opinions regarding marijuana for medical use and marijuana for
recreational use.&nbsp; While the study demonstrates that a &quot;clear
majority&quot; of respondents favor changes in the federal law
that would allow for the medical use of marijuana, only a
&quot;near majority&quot; support the decriminalization of
marijuana for social use. <br>

<p align="center"><strong>Germany To Begin Cultivating Industrial
Hemp</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 1995, Germany:</strong> The New York Times
News Service reports that the German government is repealing its
ban on the cultivation of industrial hemp.&nbsp; The hemp
plant--also known as marijuana--can be used to make various
products such as clothes, textiles, foodstuffs, cosmetics, paper,
and plastics. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hemp has been stigmatized in Germany because it can also produce
marijuana, noted Health Minister Horst Seehofer.&nbsp; However,
Seehofer stated that farmers now possess the technology to grow
strains of hemp that contain less than 0.3 percent THC--the
substance that gives marijuana and hashish their psychoactive
qualities.&nbsp; Therefore, &quot;the principle argument against
a continuing ban on hemp cultivation is ... no longer
valid,&quot; Seehofer said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hemp production is rapidly becoming a booming industry throughout
Europe and is already permitted in Spain, Britain, France, and
the majority of Eastern Europe.&nbsp; Recently, worldwide clothing
manufacturers such as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Adidas have
all introduced hemp to their product lines. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;German farmers should be able to take advantage of the
market potential for the hemp plant,&quot; Seehofer concluded. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><em>For more information on the many uses of industrial hemp,

<p align="center"><strong>Annual PRIDE Survey Shows Increase In
Adolescents Using Drugs, Marijuana</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 2, 1995, Atlanta, Georgia:</strong>&nbsp; A
recent survey from the National Parents' Resource Institute for
Drug Education (PRIDE) reports &quot;significant increases&quot;
in the use of cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and hallucinogens
among adolescents.&nbsp; These findings come shortly after data from
the 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also noted an
increase in adolescent marijuana use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The PRIDE report states that: &quot;Marijuana use [has] increased
more dramatically than any drug in the study.&nbsp; One third of
high school seniors (33 percent) have smoked marijuana in the
past year, and one fifth (21 percent) smoked monthly.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The report further notes that monthly marijuana use among high
school students rose 2.9 percent over the past year and now
stands at 18.5 percent.&nbsp; By comparison, the Household Survey
data reported that 7.3 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 17 used
marijuana on a regular basis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">PRIDE announced that the rising figures should serve as a warning
to baby boomers with children.&nbsp; &quot;More of your teenagers
are using drug than last year,&quot; the parents organization
warns, &quot;and too few of you are doing what you can to prevent
it.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><strong>SAMHSA's Figures Don't Match Up<br>
With Brown's Statements Regarding Marijuana Related Emergency
Room Episodes</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 8, 1995, Washington, DC:</strong>&nbsp;
Recent figures released from an upcoming report that tracks the
number of Americans admitted to hospital emergency rooms with
drug-related problems conflict with statements made earlier this
summer by Drug Czar Lee Brown.&nbsp; The complete 1994 report
will be released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration later this year. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The report's press release states that just over a half-million
Americans wound up in hospital emergency rooms with drug related
problems in 1994, including a record number 142,000 with cocaine-related
episodes.&nbsp; The release additionally states that some 40,000
episodes were related to marijuana and hashish, although it notes
that almost half of these patients also used alcohol and cocaine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">This data directly conflicts with statements made by Drug Czar
Lee Brown this past July regarding the supposed dangers of
marijuana.&nbsp; At that time, Brown told the national media
that, &quot;[Marijuana] now sends nearly as many people to the
hospital as cocaine.&quot;&nbsp; (<i>Washington Post</i>, July
28, 1995)&nbsp; Yet, the figures released by SAMHSA demonstrate
that more than seven times as many individuals went to the
emergency room because of cocaine related episodes in 1994 as did those
who consumed marijuana alone.&nbsp; The newly released figures
indicate that Brown grossly exaggerated his previous statements
regarding marijuana-related emergency room admissions to incorrectly
imply that marijuana is as dangerous as cocaine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Some marijuana users are admitted to emergency rooms after
suffering panic attacks from consuming cannabis.&nbsp; These
attacks are relatively harmless and subside within a few
hours.&nbsp; National data estimates that approximately 10
million Americans use marijuana monthly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The SAMHSA release concluded that &quot;cocaine ... appears to be
the primary cause for the increase in total drug-related
emergency department episodes since the mid 1980s.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><em>For more information or to acquire a copy of the SAMHSA press
release, please contact the Drugs &amp; Crime Data Center &amp;

<p align="center"><strong>Clinton, Brown Speak At Community
Anti-Drug Coalition Of America Forum</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 2, 1995, Alexandria, VA:</strong>&nbsp; Both
President Clinton and Drug Czar Lee Brown were among those
federal officials speaking at the Community Anti-Drug Coalition
of America's (CADCA) annual National Leadership Forum.&nbsp; This
year's forum signified the kick-off of the CADCA's &quot;Working
Together to Save Lives&quot; drug-awareness campaign,
memorializing the men, women, and children who have died in
drug-related deaths.&nbsp; The campaign is handing out &quot;Memorial
Bracelets&quot; to symbolize the many victims of drug-related
deaths.&nbsp; The CADCA estimates that 35,000 people died in
drug-related incidents in 1992 alone; however, the organization
does not distinguish between deaths due to the use of illegal
drugs themselves (i.e., Tish Smith, an eighteen year old victim
of an accidental heroin and cocaine overdose) and deaths due to
the federal prohibition of drugs (i.e., Edward Plank, a 28 year
old police officer who was killed by drug runners this past
October). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">President Clinton, who was presented with the first
&quot;Memorial Bracelet,&quot; spoke broadly about drug use in
general and specifically about concerns he held regarding a
recent increase in casual marijuana use among teenagers.&nbsp;
Clinton claimed that the recreational use of marijuana was &quot;dangerous&quot;
because marijuana &quot;is more toxic than ever before&quot; and
is a gateway to other drugs.&nbsp; The president later added that
he would &quot;convene a White House leadership conference on adolescent
drug use and violence in January.&quot;&nbsp; <b>NORML</b> knows
of no evidence indicating that today's marijuana is either more
toxic than marijuana of the past or that it is a causal link to
hard drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Citing figures from a new survey conducted by the Parents
Resource and Information on Drug Education (PRIDE), Drug Czar Lee
Brown once again reiterated his beliefs that marijuana is a highly
dangerous drug.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana fuel[s] a culture of
violence which is destroying the lives of thousands of our young
people,&quot; Brown stated. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><em>For more information on the CADCA's new campaign, please

<p align="center"><strong>State Representative Advocates The
Cultivation Of Industrial Hemp In Hawaii</strong></p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><strong>November 1995, Hawaii:</strong>&nbsp; State
Representative David Tarnas voiced his support for establishing a
legal, domestic hemp industry in Hawaii in the November issue of
Ka'u Landing magazine.&nbsp; In an article written by Tarnas and
entitled The Politics of Hemp: An Emerging Public Policy Issue,
he states that: &quot;The government must do its best to open up
commerce in industrial hemp.&nbsp; ... My goal is to remove
barriers to allow commerce to prove itself.&nbsp; Get government
out of the way, and let a legitimate hemp business support a
diversified, well integrated local economy.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Tarnas also used the feature article to state his stern
consternation for the prosecution of Roger Christie and Aaron
Anderson for possessing sterilized hemp seeds.&nbsp; Tarnas noted
that state statutes &quot;explicitly allow commerce in sterilized
hemp seed&quot; and further added that &quot;the prosecutor has
made public statements that the defendants are being targeted
because they are hemp advocates.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;As a state representative, I say this [prosecution] is
absurd! Government doesn't have money to waste on frivolous
lawsuits.&nbsp; This is a flagrant example of commerce being
strangled by unjustified government interference.&quot; <br>

<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">November 13, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Congressman Barney Frank Introduces Federal
Legislation To Make Marijuana Available By Prescription</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; U.S. Representative
Barney Frank (D-MA) introduced a federal medical marijuana bill
in Congress on November 10 that would permit physicians to
prescribe marijuana to patients for a number of serious
illnesses. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Frank medical use bill is modeled closely after a 1981
federal medical marijuana proposal co-sponsored at that time by
Rep. Newt Gingrich, now Speaker of the House, and three other Republicans.&nbsp;
The bill would reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule
II and would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services
to provide for controlled domestic cultivation to provide a legal
supply of medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although much more research is needed, it is clear from both
limited scientific data and rapidly accumulating anecdotal
evidence that marijuana is a valuable aid in reducing pain and
suffering for patients with a number of serious ailments, and
that it is less toxic and costly than the conventional medicines
for which it may be substituted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana is an effective means of overcoming the nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy as well as the nausea and
loss of appetite associated with the wasting syndrome of AIDS.&nbsp;
It is useful for various spastic conditions including multiple
sclerosis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia.&nbsp; It lowers
interocular pressure in people who suffer from open-angle
glaucoma.&nbsp; For some people with epilepsy, it is the only
anticonvulsant that works.&nbsp; It has been used for centuries as
an analgesic and its medical potential has been endorsed by both
the National Academy of Sciences and the Australian Commonwealth
Department of Human Services and Health.&nbsp; In 1988, DEA Chief
Administrative Law Judge Francis J. Young declared that marijuana
fulfilled the legal requirements for currently accepted medical
use in the United States, finding marijuana to be &quot;one of
the safest therapeutically active substances known to
man.&quot;&nbsp; His order was overruled, not by any medical
authority, but by the DEA itself. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Results from a recent poll conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union demonstrate that 85 percent of the voting public
favor the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; Thirty-six states have
adopted legislation facilitating the medical use of marijuana,
but none of these state measures can be implemented until
Congress amends the law.&nbsp; The introduction of Rep. Frank's
legislation provides Congress with that opportunity. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many seriously ill patients in this country are already using
marijuana to reduce their pain and suffering, even though they
must risk arrest to obtain and use it.&nbsp; As a result,
informal &quot;buyer's clubs&quot; have formed in many cities to
supply marijuana to the seriously ill.&nbsp; Some of these clubs
are small and almost clandestine; a few, such as the one in San
Francisco, operate openly and serve several thousand clients on a
regular basis.&nbsp; The fact that thousands of seriously ill
Americans would risk arrest to obtain marijuana as a medicine
attests to the need for medical marijuana legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Harvard Professor Lester Grinspoon M.D., co-author of Marihuana,
the Forbidden Medicine (Yale University Press, 1993) says the
Frank medical marijuana bill &quot;is a compassionate and humane
proposal which would provide relief from pain and suffering to
thousands of seriously ill Americans.&nbsp; These are people with
life-threatening illnesses who cannot obtain relief with
available medication.&nbsp; It is both unscientific and
unconscionable for the federal government to continue to deny an
effective medication to these patients.&nbsp; Rep. Frank's
proposal would allow this decision to be made by the patient and
the treating physician.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Sentencing Commission's Recommendations
Regarding Marijuana Weight Disparity Enacted Into Law: New
Legislation Could Affect Approximately 950 Imprisoned Marijuana
Growers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>November 1, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Recommendations made by the U.S. Sentencing Commission this past
spring mandating a universal plant-weight ratio for marijuana was
enacted into law on November 1.&nbsp; The recommendation will be
retroactive and will affect an estimated 950 cases across the
nation dating back to 1989.&nbsp; Many of these prisoners will be
eligible for early release due to the amended guidelines;
however, Families Against Mandatory Minimum's (FAMM) spokesman
Jeff Stewart cautions that the decision to release an inmate
early still remains up to the discretion of each individual
judge.&nbsp; While it's true that nearly 1000 inmates will be affected
by the change, it does not necessarily follow that all of those
inmates will be immediately released, FAMM warns. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the newly amended guidelines, each marijuana plant
cultivated will now be given a weight equivalent to 100 grams
regardless of the number of plants involved.&nbsp; In the past,
the 100 grams per plant measure was only mandated when a
defendant was convicted of possessing 49 plants or fewer. For
those convicted of harboring 50 plants or more, the weight
equivalent for each plant jumped to 1000 grams.&nbsp;
Consequently, defendants convicted for possessing 50 plants or
more faced sentences almost 3 times as long as those convicted
for 49 plants. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;To enhance fairness and consistency, this amendment adopts
the equivalency of 100 grams per marijuana plant for all
guidelines determinations,&quot; the commission stated.&nbsp; The
commission voted 7-0 in favor of the change. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A bill blocking the commission's recommendations was introduced
by U.S. Representative Jim Bunn (R-OR) in October, but Congress
failed to act on it. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Buchanan Flip-Flop-Flips On Medical
Marijuana Issue</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Storm Lake, IA:</b>&nbsp;
When it comes to the issue of medical marijuana, presidential
hopeful Pat Buchanan just can't seem to make up his mind. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While fund-raising in Charlotte, NC this past summer, Buchanan
responded to a question posed by MAPS (Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies) President Rick Doblin about
whether he would &quot;support the use of medical
marijuana.&quot;&nbsp; At that time, Buchanan stated that:
&quot;If a doctor indicated to his patient that this was the only
way to alleviate certain painful symptoms ... I would defer to
the doctor's judgment.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, when confronted with a similar question at a recent
gathering in Storm Lake, Iowa, Buchanan began singing a different
tune.&nbsp; When approached by a citizen and publicly asked about his
views on the medicinal use of marijuana, Buchanan said that he
felt that doctors should not be permitted to prescribe smoking
marijuana because of its destructive effect.&nbsp; Buchanan then
asked the man if he was with NORML.&nbsp; When the citizen
responded that he wasn't, but rather that he was &quot;terminally
ill patient ... [with] no hope and no treatment,&quot;&nbsp;
Buchanan suddenly flipped yet again on the issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If everything you say is true, and I choose to believe
you,&quot; Buchanan said, &quot;[then] I would support [your
decision to use marijuana as a medicine] in a second.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Idaho Supreme Court Rules That Employee Let
Go For Failing Drug Test<br>
Should Be Awarded Unemployment Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Idaho:</b>&nbsp; In a
surprising 3-2 decision, the Idaho Supreme Court has ruled that
an employee who was fired after having tested positive for THC
should be eligible for unemployment benefits.&nbsp; In it's
written opinion, the Court concluded that: &quot;The record
presents substantial and competent evidence to support the
Commission's conclusion that Shearer [Lumber Products] failed to
communicate its expectations to [its employee, Steven]
Merriott.&nbsp; Shearer therefore could not require Merriott to
comply with uncommunicated expectations.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The &quot;uncommunicated expectations&quot; in this case had to
do with whether or not it was clear that Merriott's conduct while
off-duty could be construed as appropriate grounds for
dismissal.&nbsp; After testing positive for THC on a February 9,
1993, drug test, Merriott admitted that he had smoked marijuana
during his day off two days earlier.&nbsp; Merriott maintained
that he had not been intoxicated while on the job.&nbsp; He was
later fired on February 16, 1993, for violating Shearer Lumber
Products' substance abuse policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon analysis, the Court decided that although the company's
substance abuse policy prohibited employees &quot;from being
under the influence of any chemical substance or alcohol during working
hours,&quot; it did not make reference to what employees may or
may not do during non-working hours.&nbsp; &quot;The Commission
noted that Shearer presented no evidence that Merriott was impaired
while at work, nor was Merriott informed that use of controlled
substances during non-working hours would violate Shearer's
policy.&nbsp; Because there was no evidence that Merriott did not
comply with Shearer's communicated substance abuse policy, the
Commission concluded that Merriott was not discharged for
employment-related misconduct.&nbsp; ... [Therefore,] the Commission's
conclusion that Merriott is eligible for unemployment benefits is
affirmed.&quot; <br>

To Kill Proposed Ohio Bill That Allows Police To Sell Drugs</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 30, 1995, Cleveland, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Northcoast NORML has launched an educational campaign to inform
citizens about a proposed House Bill that would change Ohio's
long standing policy prohibiting law enforcement personnel from
selling less than the bulk amount of an illegal drug in reverse
sting operations.&nbsp; The bill (H.B. 125) is titled
&quot;Violations of the Drug Laws&quot; and is being sponsored by
State representative Jeff Jacobson (R-Dayton) by the request of
Montgomery County law enforcement officials. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML is concerned about this proposed legislation for
various reasons.&nbsp; Most of all, NORML is worried that this
bill, if enacted into law, would shift the focus of Ohio's drug
war away from traffickers and onto small time users.&nbsp;
&quot;If the Senate passes House Bill 125, it will be open season
in Ohio for drug users,&quot; stated Northcoast NORML President
John Hartman.&nbsp; &quot;With the State prison system [already
operating] at over 170 percent capacity and many county jails bursting
at the seams, ... [it's clear that] we just don't need more drug
users in prison.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Northcoast NORML also notes that a change in the law could cause
law enforcement personnel to unintentionally add to the drug
problem in Ohio. Hartman notes that an October 25, 1994, Orange
County Register article (Defense Wants Crack Cases Killed, Peter
M. Gollner) reported that 42 percent of the people who bought
drugs from undercover officers got away with the police
manufactured drugs. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Smoke Study Demonstrates
Waterpipes To Be Ineffective</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1995, San Francisco, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Preliminary findings from a recent study on marijuana smoke
indicate that waterpipes offer smokers little protection against
the harmful tars found in cannabis. The study was sponsored by
California NORML and MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies) and its findings were released in a
California NORML press release. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the release, &quot;The reason [for this startling
result] appears to be that waterpipes filter out more of
marijuana's main psychoactive ingredient,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than they do other,
non-psychoactive, harmful tars.&nbsp; [Hence] users [of
waterpipes are required] to consume more noxious smoke in order
to reach their desired high.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study, which was supported by the Drug Policy Foundation and
private donors, carefully analyzed the solid tar and THC content
of marijuana smoke from six separate devices.&nbsp; These devices
included a regular joint, a cigarette filter, three different
waterpipes, and two vaporizers (devices designed to evaporate the
THC from the marijuana with minimal smoke.)&nbsp; The performance
of each device was rated according to how effectively it reduced
the concentration of tar relative to THC.&nbsp; (THC, unlike the
tars in marijuana, is not carcinogenic.) <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Surprisingly, the unfiltered joint yielded less tar per THC than
did either the cigarette filter or any of the waterpipes that
were tested.&nbsp; Results regarding the performance of the
vaporizers were mixed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While the study results suggest waterpipes may be
counterproductive, sponsors caution that it is still premature to
conclude that they are actually harmful to health,&quot;
California NORML summarizes.&nbsp; &quot;This is because the
study did not analyze the non-solid vapor phase of marijuana smoke,
which contains a number of gasses known to be harmful to
health.&nbsp; If waterpipes help screen out these gasses, they
might be beneficial to health.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Urges High School Coaches To Drug
Test Student Athletes</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 20, 1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking before both national and DC area middle and high school
coaches, Drug Czar Lee Brown once again called for the drug
testing of high school athletes.&nbsp; Proclaiming that school
athletes are both &quot;role models&quot; and &quot;trend
setters&quot; for the student body, Brown encouraged schools and
coaches across the country to institute programs that would
subject athletes to random drug testing.&nbsp; &quot;If we can
make real headway in turning student athletes away from drugs, I
believe we can succeed with the entire population of young people,&quot;
Brown explained. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Brown admitted during Friday's speech that,
&quot;There is no reason to think that drug use is any more
prevalent among student athletes than among young people
generally.&quot;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Brown wholeheartedly spoke
out in favor of policies that encourage student athletes to be
tested.&nbsp; &quot;My message for coaches and all school
administrators and teachers is this,&quot; Brown concluded,
&quot;You have important tools available to you, but first you've
got to get off the sidelines and into the game.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a decision advocated and publicly embraced by the Clinton
Administration, the Supreme Court this past June upheld a
Washington state middle school policy that authorized the random testing
of student athletes, without cause or suspicion of drug
use.&nbsp; At that time, Brown called the Court's ruling a
&quot;victory for kids.&quot; <br>

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The press release, featured in the October edition of TeleCard

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 1995:</b>&nbsp; <em>Great Events
Monthly</em>, a bi-monthly newspaper edited by Jack Anderson, has
devoted its September/October edition to analyzing the pros and
cons of the &quot;War On Drugs.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Posing the question of whether to &quot;legalize&quot; drugs or
&quot;escalate&quot; enforcement, the special issue explores both
sides of the drug issue and features articles by a variety of
authors including syndicated columnist Doug Bandow and DEA
Administrator Thomas Constantine.&nbsp; The issue also includes
two feature articles on the subject of medical marijuana.&nbsp;
The first, written by the Oklahoma City chapter of NORML
describes the plight of Jimmy Montgomery, the paraplegic medical
marijuana user who was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison for
less than two ounces of cannabis.&nbsp; (Thanks in large part to
hundreds of phone calls and letters from the media and <b>NORML</b>
activists, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating signed for
Montgomery's medical release in late July.)&nbsp; The second
article focuses on both medical marijuana user Todd McCormick and
the ongoing legal battle for federal rescheduling reforms. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML</b>'s contribution to the publication includes a full
page chart outlining the responses of two widely respected
doctors when asked to rank drugs on the basis of five problem
areas.&nbsp; (These areas are withdrawal, reinforcement,
tolerance, dependence, and intoxication.)&nbsp; Both Dr. Jack E.
Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal
L. Benowitz of The University of California at San Francisco
ranked marijuana as the least serious drug.&nbsp; Both doctors determined
marijuana to be less serious than caffeine. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Pierce County Superior Court Judge Rules<br>
That Cancer Patient Should Be Allowed To Use Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 13, 1995, Tacoma, WA:</b>&nbsp; In a
decision that may be a first for the nation, Superior Court Judge
Rosanne Buckner has ruled that a cancer patient's need to use
marijuana as medicine overrides the state's interest in outlawing
its prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defendant Ralph Seeley--a former journalist, lawyer, and cancer
patient--accomplished what no one else has done in a quarter
century of attempts.&nbsp; Seeley filed a declaratory judgment
action in Pierce County Superior Court, asking for a ruling that
the State's Constitution's reliance on &quot;fundamental
principles&quot; requires that marijuana be available as a
prescription substance.&nbsp; This past Friday, the Honorable
Judge Buckner agreed.&nbsp; A final order is being prepared. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I think, practically speaking, the effect [of this ruling]
is to put prosecutions for medical marijuana use on hold,&quot;
Seeley said.&nbsp; During the court proceedings, Seeley's moving
argument contained numerous references to his own experiences as
a cancer patient, forced to choose between breaking the law or
enduring unbearable suffering.&nbsp; Seeley has undergone eight
surgeries on his spine, two lung surgeries--including the removal
of one lung--radiation, and several bouts of chemotherapy.&nbsp;
He faces another surgery next month. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Jeffrey Steinborn, a Seattle lawyer who has represented a number
of clients in medical marijuana cases, called the ruling
significant.&nbsp; &quot;I think it's going to open the door to a
new wave of attempts to make this a legitimate medicine,&quot;
commented Steinborn, who is a friend of Seeley's.&nbsp; &quot;There's
a crack in the door now, a crack in the shell and I think it's
going to spread.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is monstrous to say [that] this substance cannot be used
as a medicine by people who are dying,&quot; Steinborn
concluded.&nbsp; &quot;I challenge any federal official to come
and debate the wisdom of this.&quot; <br>

Californians For Compassionate Use Band Together To File Medical
Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 16, 1995, Sacramento CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill (A.B. 1529) by
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the prescribed medical
use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp; The
legislation would have provided for the controlled compassionate use
of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be
suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; This is the third consecutive time that
Wilson has vetoed a medical marijuana proposal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In reaction to Wilson's veto, a coalition of AIDS activists,
cancer survivors, seniors, nurses, and medical experts have filed
a medical marijuana initiative with the California Attorney
General's Office.&nbsp; Marijuana activist and head of
Californians for Compassionate Use, Dennis Peron, will be directing
the initiative drive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that any patients who possess a valid
doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a
therapeutic agent without fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; The initiative
also allows citizens to cultivate their own marijuana for
personal use and encourages state and federal governments to
establish a program that will provide for a safe and affordable
method of distribution.&nbsp; This coalition has 150 days to
collect 600,000 signatures. <br>

CNN</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 13, 1993, New York City, NY:</b>&nbsp;
Showbiz Today, a regular half hour program on CNN, featured a
segment on the growing controversy surrounding the release of HEMPILATION:
Freedom Is NORML.&nbsp; HEMPILATION is the first ever major
release devoted solely to the &quot;wonders of weed.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The approximately two minute news segment featured positive
comments from <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre as
well as musicians Ian Moore and B-Real of Cypress Hill.&nbsp;
Both Moore and Cypress Hill are featured on the CD. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The CNN piece also featured criticism from David Chamberlain of
the Washington DC-based Family Research Council.&nbsp; Stating
that be hoped that Capricorn Records would abandon the project,
Chamberlain commented that he felt the CD would encourage
teenagers to try marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A portion of the profits of the CD go directly to benefit the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.&nbsp;
HEMPILATION: Freedom Is NORML hit record stores across the nation
on September 26.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Drug Czar Lee Brown Is Not Amused</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 19,1995, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; The
Washington Post recently reported that Drug Czar Lee Brown is
steaming over the release of HEMPILATION: Freedom Is NORML.&nbsp;
The Post quoted Brown as stating that song titles appearing on
the CD such as &quot;I Wanna Get High&quot; and &quot;Who's Got
the Herb&quot; were &quot;enough to make one sick.&quot;&nbsp;
Brown is set to voice his frustration over the CD as well as what
he considers to be Hollywood's overall glorification of marijuana
in a speech to the Entertainment Industries Council in Los
Angeles. <br>

To Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Anchorage, AK:</b>&nbsp;
In a ruling that could cast doubt upon the legality of many
roadside searches, Alaska District Court Judge William Fuld has
dismissed charges against a man who was arrested after a state
trooper reportedly smelled marijuana and then demanded that the
defendant &quot;hand it over.&quot;&nbsp; In the court's view,
the officer's phrase: &quot;hand it over&quot; was not a choice,
but a demand to search the defendant's vehicle.&nbsp; Therefore,
the court ruled that the roadside search was improper because no
valid consent was ever given by the defendant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The trooper was in uniform and the defendant testified that
he felt he had to respond to the officer's command,&quot;
summarized Fuld in his court opinion.&nbsp; &quot;The demand to

of the defendant.&nbsp; While the trooper smelled marijuana, he had
no right to search the passenger.&nbsp; ... <br>

Initiative For 1996 State Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 29, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A coalition of AIDS activists, cancer survivors, seniors, nurses,
and medical experts have filed a medical marijuana initiative
with the California Attorney General's Office.&nbsp; The
initiative was filed in response to Governor Pete Wilson's
expected veto of bill AB 1529.&nbsp; (This legislation would
provide for the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for
those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be suffering from
the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple
sclerosis.)&nbsp; Wilson previously vetoed similar bills in both
1993 and 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that those patients who possess a valid
doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a
therapeutic without fear or risk of criminal prosecution.&nbsp;
The initiative also allows citizens to cultivate their own
marijuana for personal use and encourages state and federal
government to establish a program that will provide for a safe
and affordable method of distribution.&nbsp; This coalition has
150 days to collect 600,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana activist and head of Californians for Compassionate
Use, Dennis Peron, will be directing the initiative drive.&nbsp;
&quot;If Governor Wilson had not vetoed, two years in a row, two
separate medical marijuana bills--one that would have allowed
doctors to prescribe, and one to allow patients not be prosecuted
for personal use of marijuana--this would not be necessary,&quot;
he stated. <br>

Use Of Heat Sensing Equipment<br>
To Be Unconstitutional</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Denver, CO:</b> The following
is an excerpt from a Reuters news brief: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    It is unconstitutional for police and drug enforcement agents
    to scan homes with heat-sensing equipment to detect criminal
    activity without a warrant, the federal appeals court in
    Denver ruled Wednesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The decision came in a case which law enforcement officers in
    Wyoming obtained a search warrant, and later a conviction,
    after using a thermal imager to gather evidence that
    marijuana was being grown in a home. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from a
    six state region [Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
    Kansas, and Oklahoma], ruled 3-0 that police must obtain a
    search warrant before using such equipment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    &quot;We reject the government's contention that its
    technical wizardry should free it from the restraints
    mandated by the Fourth Amendment,&quot; the court said.&nbsp;
    It noted that the government denies thermal imagers intrude
    upon privacy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The court said four federal appeals courts in other circuits
    have ruled the opposite way, that warrants are not needed
    before police use thermal imagers.

York Times Editorial Lashes Out At The Drug War</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1995, New York, NY:</b> Citing
statistics from a recently released Sentencing Project report,
The New York Times denounced the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; in a
Saturday editorial. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Noting that current data indicates that one in three black men
between the ages of 20 and 29 are involved somewhere in the
criminal justice system (either prison, pre-trial detention, on probation
or on parole), the Op-ed argues that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;
is rounding up a &quot;disproportionate&quot; number of black
Americans.&nbsp; In support of this notion, the editorial noted
that &quot;during the early 1990's, at a time when
African-Americans accounted for only 13 percent of monthly drug
users, African-Americans were involved in 35 percent of the
arrests for drug possession, 55 percent of the convictions and 74
percent of the prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although the editorial never spoke out in favor of legalization,
it did assert that America &quot;need[s] to rethink both drug and
punishment policies.&quot;&nbsp; These latest figures, the Times
concluded, &quot;should set off alarm bells from the White House
to city halls--and help reverse the notion that we can
incarcerate our way out of fundamental social problems. <br>

Sandusky County NORML<br>
With Indictments</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 30, 1995, Fremont, OH:</b> A
September 22 weekend rally put on by the Sandusky County Chapter
of NORML has stirred up more than just controversy following an
announcement by Sheriff David Gangwer that he had undercover
agents infiltrate the event. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am disappointed with the actions of this sheriff,&quot;
said Sandusky County NORML Chapter President, Tomas
Salazar.&nbsp; &quot;This is a direct attack on NORML and we are
being targeted for our beliefs.&nbsp; This is a violation of our
Constitutional right to assemble.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gangwer claims that the information and evidence gathered by his
agents will eventually be turned over to the Sandusky County
Prosecutor and state officials.&nbsp; The evidence could warrant the
need for a special grand jury to seek criminal indictments
against NORML, he added.&nbsp; Gangwer would not discuss what
charges were being considered. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;At the very least we hope the information we gathered will
prevent this from ever happening in this county or in this state
again,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Don't bet on it, claims Salazar, who is already preparing to
organize another Harvest Festival next year.&nbsp; &quot;I can't
see anything that they can charge NORML with,&quot; he
contends.&nbsp; &quot;NORML has always acted responsibly in all
of their events ... and I expect there will be no
indictments.&nbsp; This is harassment.&quot;&nbsp; Salazar added
that organizers required all attendees to sign a release
affirming that they would not engage in any illegal activities
during the course of the festival.&nbsp; The release also required
attendees to indicate that they were not an undercover law
enforcement official. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We have a right to socialize and that's what we did,&quot;
Salazar concluded. &quot;We never expected the big brouhaha that
was made out of it.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Prohibition Establishment Attacks NORML
&amp; Capricorn Records<br>
For The Debut Of The Long-Awaited HEMPILATION Release</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN &amp; Washington,
D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Last week marked the first time ever that a major
recording label has released a benefit compilation of popular
musicians that will benefit the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).&nbsp; Available in music stores around
the nation, Capricorn Records' HEMPILATION contains major music
recording stars: Blues Traveler, The Black Crowes, Cypress Hill,
Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, Gov.'t Mule and twelve other
musical acts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We want people to think about freedom,&quot; explains Allen
St. Pierre of NORML.&nbsp; &quot;This is why the CD's subtitle is
'Freedom is NORML'.&nbsp; Participating artists view HEMPILATION
as a permanent, musical means of expressing their joint concerns
about the unfair restriction on Americans' civil liberties posed
by long standing government anti-marijuana efforts and a public statement
of their support for NORML. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On September 29, the Associated Press (AP) reported that
extremist anti-marijuana groups have already vowed to protest
HEMPILATION'S release.&nbsp; Devout prohibitionist Joseph
Califano, head of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA) at Columbia University, told AP, &quot;Why anyone would
want to take something that's dangerous and damaging and
encourage children to use it is beyond me.&quot;&nbsp; NORML's
Allen St. Pierre responds: &quot;I wish that Mr. Califano would
stop misrepresenting NORML's mission statement.&nbsp; For 25
years NORML has never advocated that anyone, especially children,
should use marijuana.&nbsp; NORML advocates that adults should
not face criminal or civil penalties for the use and possession
of marijuana in their homes.&nbsp; If Mr. Califano is truly
concerned about the welfare of today's children and 'pro-drug'
messages in our society, I strongly suggest that Mr. Califano
should begin by loudly advocating the prohibition of the
semi-pornographic beer commercials that litter professional and
collegiate sporting events aired on television.&nbsp; It's clear
that alcohol and tobacco are, by any measure, the two drugs that
Mr. Califano and his group should be focusing on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other prohibition groups such as the Atlanta-based Parents
Resources and Information on Drug Education (PRIDE) and the
Washington, D.C.-based Family Research Council have indicated
that they would like to force this music off the market in a way
similar to their attempts to ban explicit rap music. <br>

freedom to purchase and read literature that describes or depicts
&quot;illicit drug use&quot; has been won by Umberto Iorfida of
Canada NORML.&nbsp; In a letter to Iorfida's attorney, The
Attorney General (Ministry of Justice) indicates that the
Canadian government has decided not to appeal the decision handed
down on October 4, 1994 by the then Ontario Supreme Court [now
called the Ontario Court of Justice, General Division].&nbsp;
That decision removed from the Criminal Code offensive language
that made &quot;literature&quot; such as: NORML publications,
High Times magazine, HEMP BC catalogs, Jack Herer's &quot;The
Emperor Wears No Clothes&quot; and a myriad of other popular
published works illegal in Canada. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Madame Justice Ellen McDonald determined the inclusion of
&quot;literature&quot; in the Criminal Code to be inconsistent
with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms [The equivalent to the

<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With this case finally put to rest, Iorfida and NORML Canada are

Bales) took place in September of 1861.&nbsp; Approximately 3000
federal soldiers from Chicago looted the bank and created a makeshift
earthwork fort.&nbsp; Twenty thousand Missouri volunteers engaged
the federal troops.&nbsp; A three day siege of the fort led to a
stand-off until the Missourians had the idea of using the
recently harvested hemp bales as a moving defense. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">With water soaked hemp bales (to prevent the fire red hot
grapeshot from burning the hemp bales), the Missourians, firing
over the hemp bales, rolled them forward toward the fort and
carried the day, defeating the federal troops. <br>

Include &quot;Publications&quot; As Drug Paraphernalia</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 19, Octorara, PA:</b>&nbsp; By a 6-2
vote, the Octorara Area School Board adopted a policy that
enables school officials to suspend students for 10 days and
notify local police if student is caught on school grounds with &quot;publications
about drugs&quot; wrote a report in The Intelligencer Journal
(IJ). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to school administrators, the policy is needed because
&quot;publications ... brought to school have dealt with how to
grow marijuana and manufacture hallucinogenic drugs,&quot;
reported The New Era newspaper. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While the vote to adopt the policy prevailed, strong opposition
was voiced by School Board Member John Addyman who was quoted in
the IJ as saying, &quot;I have a real problem saying a publication
should be banned.&quot;&nbsp; Addyman said when he took a seat on
the school board he swore to uphold the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;
&quot;That Constitution guarantees the right of free
speech,&quot; Addyman said.&nbsp; William Iacone, director of
special services, said administrators hope to target publications which
promote drugs by telling how to cultivate, buy, sell, use or
manufacture illegal drugs --and in some case, where to get
them.&nbsp; &quot;This is not freedom of speech,&quot; Iacone
said to the IJ. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Also opposing the new policy was school board attorney, Alan
Jarvis.&nbsp; He told the IJ that publications are &quot;a tender
area&quot; of the law and cautioned the board on calling publications
drug paraphernalia.&nbsp; He said the policy might be
challenged.&nbsp; Despite Mr. Jarvis' reservations of the legality
of the board's actions, other board members chimed in: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - &quot;Leave it in [the policy change] and be
    challenged,&quot; said board member Sam Gasnow.&nbsp;
    &quot;That's what's right.&quot;&nbsp; Gasnow also asserted
    that students &quot;have no First Amendment rights in the
    classroom.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Board member Lawrence Gibbs [who supports the change in
    policy]: &quot;Why don't we stop by the library after the
    meeting.&nbsp; There may be a few books I want to get out of
    here.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    - Also, Superintendent Tom Sholvin commented, &quot;Today the
    right thing and the legal thing aren't always the same
    things.&nbsp; Our intent is not to take away anybody's rights.&quot;

Drugs: 'We're Losing The War On Drugs'</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, Nashville, TN:</b>&nbsp; Joining
more than 60 other Federal judges, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Wiseman spoke up in opposition to this country's &quot;war on

Wiseman said that &quot;We've spent $100 billion on the war on

the U.S. should legalize drugs.&nbsp; That, he says, is the only
real way to win the war.&nbsp; &quot;If you take the profit out

<p align="center"><b>The Dutch Government Modifies Its Drug
Policy<br>
Pressure Felt From Neighboring Countries</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 25, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; The
Dutch government announced some revisions of their progressive
drug policy at a news conference held at the National Press
Club.&nbsp; State-Secretary for the Interior, Jacob Kohnstamm, presented
to the U.S. press (what little there was assembled! -ed.] a list
of changes that the Dutch government are seeking to implement in
the coming years.&nbsp; While some of these changes may be viewed
by some as an abdication by the Dutch of the progressive drug
policies established in the 1970's, Secretary Kohnstamm was quick to
point out that The Netherlands is not abandoning its defacto
legalization of small amounts of cannabis. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Due to strong pressure from its neighboring countries (especially
France), The Netherlands seek to compromise with its neighbors
while still championing the social, public health, and criminal justice
benefits that it believes its drug policy presents. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Secretary Kohnstamm indicated that policy changes concerning
cannabis are: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The sale of cannabis products in &quot;coffee shops&quot;
    will be reduced from 30 grams per purchase to 5 grams, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -There will be a 50% reduction of the number of &quot;coffee
    shops&quot;, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The state will begin to combat the large-scale production of
    cannabis in the Netherlands, <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    -The Netherlands will also seek to establish a more active
    policy on the deportation of &quot;drug tourists&quot; and
    addicts residing illegally in the Netherlands. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Mr. Kohnstamm reiterated that the citizens and the government of
the Netherlands strongly support their drug policy.&nbsp; When
asked by an American reporter, &quot;Why don't the Dutch adopt a drug
policy similar to America's war on drugs approach?&quot; Mr.
Kohnstamm said that such a policy is considered a complete
failure in the minds of the Dutch.&nbsp; He cited the latest
statistics from both the U.S. and the Netherlands concerning the
prevalence of cannabis use amongst teens to make his case. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Netherlands (where cannabis sales are tolerated) the rate
of teens admitting to using cannabis is: 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 13% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Last 30 days = 6% <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    As compared to the United States (where there is a total
    prohibition on cannabis): <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    Ever using cannabis = 28% <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Legislature &quot;Just Says
No&quot; To Unpopular Marijuana Law</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 15, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Governor and possible Presidential nominee Pete Wilson
suffered a major defeat when the Republican controlled California
Assembly rejected his last ditch effort to renew the state's
&quot;Smoke a Joint, Lose Your License&quot; law.&nbsp; The controversial
legislation requires that the state impose a six-month drivers
license suspension upon conviction of any drug offense,
regardless of whether the offense is driving related.&nbsp; The
law will expire on the 2nd of December. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Looming heavy over the head of the California Assembly's decision
to dissolve the &quot;Smoke a Joint&quot; legislation is the
issue of federal mandates.&nbsp; Because Wilson initially pushed
for the license suspension law by co-sponsoring a 1990 federal
mandate requiring the state to either enact the legislation or
pass an &quot;opt-out&quot; resolution explicitly rejecting the
policy, California now stands at risk of losing nearly $100
million in federal highway aid.&nbsp; Ironically, in recent
years, Wilson has been an outspoken proponent against the
legitimacy of federal mandates. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Governor Pete Wilson Expects To
Veto Medical Marijuana Bill<br>
For Third Consecutive Year</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
For the third time in as many years, the California State
Assembly has voted in favor of a bill that would allow for the
medical use of marijuana by the sick and terminally ill.&nbsp;
However, sources close to the governor claim that Wilson will
once again veto the proposed legislation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The bill, AB 1529, would provide for the controlled compassionate
use of marijuana for those individuals diagnosed by a physician
to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and
multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; In addition, this revised version of
the bill is worded in such a way so that it expressly avoids
conflicting with current federal policies prohibiting use of the
drug.&nbsp; (Wilson cited these policies as the basis for last
year's veto.)&nbsp; Despite the revision, however, a spokesman
for Wilson told the <em>San Diego Union Tribune</em> that the
governor &quot;hates&quot; the bill.&nbsp; AB 1529 is supported by
both the California Nurses Association and the California Senior
Legislature. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to claims that Wilson will veto the measure, the
bill's author, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), has
blasted the governor as being more concerned with politics than with
human suffering.&nbsp; &quot;In a free society, people who are
ill shouldn't be made criminals to alleviate their pain,&quot;
said Vasconcellos.&nbsp; &quot;Wilson is engaging in politics of
pain.&nbsp; That's pathetic.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on bill AB 1529, please contact Dale
Gieringer of California NORML @ (415) 563-5858 or contact Dennis
Peron of Californians for Compassionate Use @ (415)
864-1961.&nbsp; In the coming months, the CCU intends to collect
the 600,000 signatures necessary to place this measure on the
1996 statewide ballot.&nbsp; This initiative is set to be filed
with the Attorney General's Office for title and summary on
Friday, September 29.</i></p>

<p align="center"><em><b>New York Times</b></em><b> Runs Feature
On Todd McCormick Bust</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 17, 1995, Bryan, 0H:</b>&nbsp; The <i>New
York Times</i> featured a major story on the case of medical
marijuana user Todd McCormick in the national edition of this
week's Sunday paper.&nbsp; The Times is the second nationally
syndicated paper to publicize McCormick's legal battle since his arrest
on July 18.&nbsp; USA Today referred to McCormick in an August 21
editorial supporting the use of medicinal marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick was arrested this past July when Ohio State Patrolmen
discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his
van.&nbsp; He is currently free on bail and staying with Don
Wirtshafter at the Ohio Hempery since having his bail dropped at
a September 7 bail reduction bearing.&nbsp; McCormick maintains
that the cannabis found in his vehicle, all of which was visibly
marked &quot;for medicinal use only,&quot; was intended to be
used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in Rhode Island and
was not meant for sale.&nbsp; He is charged with four felony drug
counts. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">When asked to comment on the McCormick case, John A. Mutter,
president of the 3000 member American Judge's Association, told
the <i>New York Times</i> that: &quot;It strikes me as being incongruous
that a doctor can prescribe for the well being of his patients
narcotic drugs like morphine that are habit forming, but they
can't prescribe marijuana.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Landmark State Decision Could
Spell Victory<br>
For McCormick's Upcoming Trial</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 10, 1995, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Civil liberty and personal privacy proponents achieved a major
victory last week when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled to severely
limit the rights of police to question citizens or search their
property after misdemeanor roadside traffic stops.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML President John Hartman applauded the court's ruling.&nbsp;
&quot;People in the cannabis community will be driving a little
easier [now] in the state of Ohio,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 4-3 decision, the court struck down the drug arrest of a man
whose car was searched following a routine traffic stop.&nbsp;
The court maintained that the evidence seized during the search was
invalid because the search itself was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; According to the AP,
&quot;The court said that although the driver gave his consent,
the search was improper because the deputy never told the driver
[that] he was free to go after the traffic stop and before the
drug search began.&quot;&nbsp; The law states that police cannot
automatically search a car based upon a traffic misdemeanor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Harry R. Reinhart praised the ruling.&nbsp; He
explained that hundreds of innocent Ohio motorists are stopped
each year by police and intimidated into having their automobiles searched
because law enforcement officials purposely neglect to inform
citizens of their legal right to say no. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One can only wait and see what potential ramifications this
decision may have on Todd McCormick's upcoming trial.&nbsp;
McCormick had his van searched after Ohio State Patrolmen pulled him
over &quot;because the curtains in [his] van were
closed.&quot;&nbsp; McCormick maintains that he did not give
police permission to search his vehicle. <br>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 18, 1995, Tucson, AZ:</b>&nbsp; The
plight of medical marijuana user Richard Martinez looks to have
finally come to an end.&nbsp; Martinez was released from jail at
12 pm on September 18 and the charges against him have been
dismissed under rule 11 for incompetence.&nbsp; Martinez suffered
for over four months in Arizona jails while the state conducted
tests to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand
trial.&nbsp; He was shot through the right eye in 1991 and now
has brain damage.&nbsp; Martinez was charged with drug possession
when local authorities discovered that he was using marijuana in
place of his prescribed medication, Marinol. <br>
